               <h2><span class="head">Background</span></h2>
               <p>During the spring 2006 semester, I taught a senior-level course in British Romantic
                  Drama for English majors, a course that satisfied for them a genre upper-division
                  requirement. My first-day assessments of my students revealed that several had taken
                  an introductory course in drama, and some had taken a junior-level course in Shakespeare,
                  but no one enrolled in the course had pursued a course in the Romantic period. This
                  course was, therefore, the students’ only contact with the Romantic period as well
                  as a course involving the reading, discussing, writing, and performing of drama from
                  the 1780s to the 1830s. </p>
               <p>During the spring 2005, when I was teaching the senior capstone course in English,
                  I included Joanna Baillie’s 1798 <em>Plays on the Passions</em> (<em>Count Basil, The Tryal, and De Monfort</em>) in a culminating activity I termed “The Baillie Project,” and during the fall 2006
                  semester, I included Baillie’s <em>Count Basil</em> in a sequence of plays for an Honors College course entitled Introduction to Drama:
                  Tragically Monstrous, a course that is offered as a First-Year Experience requirement
                  for incoming Honors College students. The first-year students read <em>Count Basil</em> in tandem with Euripedes’ <em>Medea</em> and Shakespeare’s <em>Othello</em>. When I teach the junior-level course in the British Romantic period, I routinely
                  include two or three dramas, including <em>Count Basil</em> and Thomas Bellamy’s 1789 <em>The Benevolent Planters</em> (both are anthologized in Mellor and Matlak’s <em>British Literature 1780-1830</em>). And when I teach the graduate-level course in British Romantic literature, I add
                  P. B. Shelley’s 1819 <em>The Cenci</em> and Lord Byron’s 1822 <em>Manfred</em> to the two plays from the undergraduate course. My point is that while I had integrated
                  Romantic drama into other courses I had taught, I had never taught an entire course
                  devoted to Romantic drama until the spring of 2006. In spring, 2007, I taught the
                  graduate version of the course as an Advanced Problems topic entitled British Romantic
                  Drama. This course was actually a “piggy-back” course in that it was taught as a graduate
                  seminar and an Honors College seminar for 4000-level credit for English majors and
                  minors with the appropriate prerequisites.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Course Description</span></h2>
               <p>To help students identify what a course entitled Senior Seminar in Studies in Drama:
                  British Romantic Drama was about, I supplied the following description, which provided
                  them a sense of the cultural and political aspects of the course we would emphasize
                  as well as strategies they could use for reading the plays:</p>
               <p>After more than a decade of recovering and recontextualizing Romantic drama in Great
                  Britain, we have come to recognize the central role that drama played during the period.
                  Romantic drama, staged and read, was its culture’s most popular medium, crossing class,
                  national, and gender divisions, as well as a serious literary form written by the
                  period’s major writers. Manifested in diverse ways (melodrama, gothic, verse drama,
                  opera, pantomime, puppet shows, children’s drama, monodrama, tragedy, comedy, burlesque),
                  Romantic drama performed, reflected, and influenced the political, social, and cultural
                  issues of its day. The Licensing Act of 1737, granting patents to the Royal Theatres
                  of Drury Lane, Covent Garden, and the Haymarket, and the Lord Chamberlain’s censorship
                  (willingness to grant performance licenses) meant that playwrights had to be clever
                  in their stagings of controversial and taboo subjects.</p>
               <p>In this seminar, we will examine diverse plays from the period as negotiations of
                  theatrical politics. We will look at the performative aspects of Romantic drama, including
                  the role of the actor, the design of stages, non-dramatic performances (such as itinerant
                  medical shows), and private theatricals. We will consider the thematic and dramaturgical
                  handling of the revolutionary and changing Romantic culture from which its drama emanated.
                  We will contextualize the ways in which Romantic drama engaged with the late-eighteenth
                  and early-nineteenth centuries as British society became increasingly democratized,
                  commercialized, and bourgeois. We will discover how the theatre was a site for performing
                  gender and how playwriting was particularly problematic for women. We will situate
                  Romantic drama in the history of theatre. </p>

               <p class="noCount">I ask students to come to this seminar prepared to engage in interactive learning,
                  to be willing to explore all dimensions of Romantic drama as reading and performance
                  texts, as stage spectacles, as serious commentary on the period and its culture. I
                  inform them during our first class meeting that because my pedagogy and scholarship
                  are informed by feminism and feminist theory, they will encounter a learning environment
                  of decentralized authority with an invitation to participate in their own learning/discovery
                  process, their own knowledge- and meaning-making. I tell them that because Romantic
                  drama is a genre that uses performance as well as the printed page, they should be
                  prepared to engage in some reading and performance activities that will require them
                  to learn affectively as well as intellectually. Students are given multiple opportunities
                  to pursue their own interests and lines of inquiry involving the drama, and my writing
                  and discussion prompts are directive but open-ended. </p>

                  <dd>Because some of the topics at the heart of Romantic drama involve gender, class, and

                     affective areas that are sensitive. It is important, therefore, for us to be sensitive

                  of the Romantic period, and this activity is a kind of “thinking-on-paper” writing
                  in which you are still its primary reader, but I am dropping in on the thinking process.
                  Make your reflections honest, useful, and specific. These responses may serve you
                  well later in your reshaping of initial reactions and ideas into more reader-based
                  discourse for the researched critical analysis assignment. (See the Appendix with

                  school, law school, scholarships), a potential paper for a conference presentation,
                  an essay that you can return to and expand as a senior thesis or in graduate courses.
                  Strive for about 7-10 pages of discourse followed by notes (if applicable) and your
                  works cited listing. </div><br/><div>Your audience will be your classmates (including me), and so before you write, do

                  of the dramas, but in order to access your arguments and evidence, you will have to
                  supply contextual clues and connections. </div><br/><div>Here are some recommendations as you engage in the process of writing:</div>

                     </div> One reason for my including so much drama by Joanna Baillie is that about one third
                     of my students needed to satisfy a major requirement for a single author, and so they
                     were able to do so by taking this course that highlighted Baillie as its major playwright.
                     I tried to include representative plays by male and female playwrights, but we began
                     with three late eighteenth-century comedies by women: Hannah Cowley’s <em>A Bold Stroke for a Husband</em> (1783), Elizabeth Inchbald’s <em>Everyone Has His Fault</em> (1793), and Joanna Baillie’s <em>The Tryal</em> (1798). These comedies opened onto discussions of Georgian courtship and marriage
                     customs that cast men and women in stereotypical relationships that favored men. We
                     discovered how Cowley displaces British manner and customs onto Madrid, and, like
                     Baillie, relies on disguise and cross-dressing to suggest gender-bending in which
                     women gain control over their lives. Inchbald’s comedy, we agreed, brings the legal
                     issues of divorce, custody, adoption, bankruptcy, and robbery into the contexts of
                     women’s rights and gender stereotypes. While <em>A Bold Stroke for a Husband</em> is also a play that stages ambivalent, gender-bending heroines, we looked at how gender
                     was even more complicated in performances featuring Mary Robinson as Victoria. All
                     three plays show the centrality of marriage for women of Georgian Britain. All three
                     comedies also push generic bounds. Cowley deploys conventions of Spanish intrigue
                     and recycles the motifs of the comedy of manners.

                     </div> Inchbald’s play resonates with pathos of character and novel-like structure. Baillie’s
                     comedy revolves around subplots of play-making; Marianne and Agnes are themselves
                     playwrights in this metadramatic comedy. Because these comedies are critical of the
                     culture’s dominant practices, the students find them fun, but they help to draw students
                     into Romantic period culture as well as into the playwrights’ resistance to its dominant
                     ideologies.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>We next turned to tragedies, beginning the next cluster of plays with Baillie’s <em>De Monfort</em> (1798), <em>Orra</em> (1812), and Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s <em>Remorse</em> (1813)—three plays that address sensibilities of the early nineteenth-century, including
                     the Gothic. In <em>De Monfort</em>, we continued our exploration of gender-bending strategies, but here in tragic forms,
                     and we considered whether or not the play holds up a tragic hero for emulation or
                     admiration, whether it hints at homoerotic or incestuous relationships, and whether
                     it presents the tragic consequences of immoderate passions, especially hatred.

                              and Passions: Teaching Joanna Baillie’s Dramas,” in Joanna Baillie, Romantic Dramatist:
                              Critical Essays, ed. Thomas Crochunis (New York: Routledge, 2004), 315-47.</span></div>
                     </div> We learned how Baillie stages the Gothic, more fully developed, in the kidnapping
                     and brainwashing of the tragic heroine in <em>Orra</em>. Like the other plays we had read, <em>Orra</em> puts marriage center stage, as well as the heroine’s resistance to patriarchal control.
                     We found that <em>Orra</em> also demonstrates the power of storytelling and the consequences to those whose naïve
                     understandings of the world give them limited critical ability to discern reality
                     from fiction. Similarly, <em>Remorse</em>, we agreed, explores gender-bending and mistaken identities so as to expose the fallacies
                     and inconsistencies in social orders that are shaped by misogyny. While Baillie’s
                     tragedies explore the crises for female identity and expose the subjection of femininity
                     within patriarchal structures, Coleridge’s tragedy brings early nineteenth-century
                     constructions of masculinity under scrutiny. All three plays can be read through postmodern
                     lenses as historically specific—both in terms of their medieval settings and their
                     Romantic-era contexts of composition—enactments of gender; the tragedies’ theatricality
                     and performance, furthermore, expose the artificiality and even the fluidity of gender
                     roles and gendered behaviors at the very time when codifications of those roles were
                     being scripted off-stage as well as on-stage.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The next grouping of tragedies—P. B. Shelley’s <em>The Cenci</em> (1816), Baillie’s <em>Count Basil</em> (1798), and Lord Byron’s <em>Sardanapalus</em> (1821)—took us into deeper and darker spaces of Romantic thought by way of historically
                  based incidents and characters. All three of these plays involve despotic rulers of
                  corrupt governments, but they similarly feature stories of dysfunctional families,
                  thus bringing the crises of public and private spaces together in shared space on
                  the stage. <em>The Cenci</em>, like <em>De Monfort</em> from the previous cluster, is a play that opens onto discussions of censorship and
                  licensing of plays in the Romantic period. The settings of Italy for <em>Cenci</em> and <em>Basil</em>, and Assyria for <em>Sardanapalus</em> offer spaces where taboo and disturbing issues affecting early nineteenth-century
                  British culture could be displaced and displayed. These three tragedies open onto
                  explorations of criminal behavior and punishment, the efficacy of language, the function
                  of the public body, and the pathology of madness. <em>Count Basil</em> exposes the folly of excessive passions, coded masculine or feminine, and the segregated
                  and gendered spaces that impede an individual’s healthy participation in the public
                  sphere. P. B. Shelley’s tragedy presents us also with the problem of morality sanctioned
                  by state and religion. <em>Sardanapalus</em> adds layers of colonialism and orientalism to its questioning of gendered agency
                  and effective leadership. All three tragedies hint at Romantic preoccupations with
                  transgressive public figures under surveillance and then put on trial for their moral
                  and legal infractions.</p>
               <p>As afterpieces to the course, we read George Colman the Younger’s <em>Blue-Beard; or Female Curiosity! </em>(1798), and Matthew Lewis’s <em>Timour the Tartar; A Grand Romantic Melo-drama in Two Acts</em> (1811), two plays that demonstrate to students the kind of experimentation that was
                  occurring with drama, particularly staged drama, during the Romantic period. These
                  two fantasies are fanciful but disturbing in their staging of the abuses of misogyny
                  and of orientalism (both set in the Near East) under the guise of children’s theatre,
                  harlequinade, pantomime, and spectacle. Both Bluebeard and Timour are representations
                  of actual figures whose stories become thoroughly mythologized and fantasized. Their
                  stories and depictions, like that of Beatrice Cenci, have been replayed in multiple
                  forms—theatre, novels, visual arts, opera, and film—and we talked about why Romantic
                  theatergoers would find these characters so interesting and engaging.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>To supplement each clustering of dramas, we read, as the schedule above indicates,
                     the performance reviews that Cox and Gamer have included in the Broadview anthology
                     and that Duthie has included in his edition of <em>Plays on the Passions</em> and that are relevant to the play we are discussing. The creative discovery activity
                     enables students to work closely with these reviews and to think critically about
                     performance aspects of the plays. Graduate students work beyond the reviews of the
                     anthology, seeking additional performance information and reviews from online and
                     traditional scholarly sources in the preparation of their assignment. They may also
                     look at reviews of contemporary stagings of Romantic plays.

                  <p>As we moved to the cluster of tragic plays with gothic overtones, I introduced the
                     cluster with a small segment of the video of the Readers’ Theatre production of <em>A Tale of Mystery</em> (1806) that was performed and video-taped at the 2003 meeting of the International
                     Conference on Romanticism at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The setting
                     of the reading in the St. Joan of Arc Chapel on the Marquette University campus was
                     a spectacular way for students to get a visual clue about how to read settings in <em>De Monfort, Orra, </em>and <em>Remorse</em>. The live accompaniment of the reading gave students a sense of how music was, in
                     fact, a vital component to the play—something I asked them to pay close attention
                     to in their readings of the plays’ stage directions. Likewise, our reading and discussion
                     of <em>Count Basil</em> was enriched by two video supplements. In March of 2002, in celebration of Women’s
                     History Month, the Women’s Studies Program and the Theatre Department at Texas Tech
                     University worked together to present a parlour reading of Romantic period dramas
                     by Felicia Hemans, Elizabeth Inchbald, and Joanna Baillie. We held the reading in
                     the parlor of a local, private home, and relied on student and faculty volunteer performers,
                     and I served as dramaturg for the production. We videotaped the performance, and thus,
                     I have a segment of <em>Count Basil</em> as amateur readers’ theatre that I can show the students. In August of 2003, the North
                     American Society for the Study of Romanticism brought a Horizons Theatre production
                     of <em>Count Basil</em> to Fordham University, Lincoln Center Campus for the association’s annual meeting.
                     Having procured a DVD recording of that professional production, I can show my students
                     parts of the play or the entire performance of <em>Count Basil</em>. I can also refer students to reviews of that production that were published in <em>European Romantic Review</em>.

               <p>To enrich our readings of <em>The Cenci, Sardanapalus,</em> <em>Blue-Beard, </em>and <em>Timour the Tartar,</em> I relied on reproductions of artwork, all of which are easily available online for
                  showing in class or for reproducing as handouts. In particular, we looked at the “Sirani
                  Elisabetta Portrait of Beatrice Cenci” attributed to Guido Reni that P. B. Shelley
                  saw in Palazzo Colonna in 1818. This visual served as a starting point for our discussion
                  of the enduring interest in Beatrice Cenci, as demonstrated by the many revisions
                  of her life story in plays, operas, novel, and film. For <em>Sardanapalus</em>, we looked at Eugène Delacroix’s painting <em>The Death of Sardanapalus</em>, 1827-1828 which is on display at the Louvre. For Colman the Younger’s play, we viewed
                  Gustav Doré’s nineteenth-century illustrations of Bluebeard. <em>Timour the Tartar</em> became more accessible for the students with the visual enrichment of Skelt’s Scenes
                  from the novel version of Timour’s story, J.K. Green’s illustrations of the characters
                  and scenes of the play, and the playbill of Mrs. H. Johnston in the melodrama of <em>Timour the Tartar. </em>We also looked at a picture of the statue of Timur in Shahrisabz, Uzbekistan.</p>

                     For my graduate seminar, students work with at least one hypertext found on <em>British Women Playwrights around 1800</em>, or they work with a novel and its dramatic adaptation.

               <h2><span class="head">Sample Student Responses</span></h2>
               <p>In the creative discovery activity #2, one student took the reviewers of Joanna Baillie’s
                  <em>Plays on the Passions</em>, in particular of an 1804 staging of <em>Count Basil</em>, to task. She writes: “…I find Baillie’s endeavors to capture the state of one passion
                  incredibly impressive and thought provoking. The reviewers seemed to have missed some
                  of the points of Baillie’s unchecked and exaggerated passions.” A researched critical
                  analysis of Baillie’s <em>Orra</em> explores the “patriarchal-taught self-fear” that Orra experiences and its contribution
                  to her madness. The student writes: “This self fear is beneficial to the patriarchal,
                  hierarchal society because it keeps women in their ‘place’ by making them emotionally
                  weak and easily scared. They either run to men for help and/or readily submit to men
                  without question.” Another student astutely observes gender dichotomies: “[v]iolence
                  directed at women in Romantic drama serves the masculine standard by placing the dramatic
                  burden firmly on the shoulders of the female characters—both as actor and acted upon.…
                  Clearly, Baillie is interested in how her contemporaries utilized violence and gender
                  both to control action on stage and, in many ways, to control the making of this action.”</p>
               <p>For the re-staging of <em>The Cenci</em>, one student elaborates on the scenery and costuming: “Lighting would be very warm,
                  reds, oranges, and yellows…Once Count Cenci reveals the demise of his sons and openly
                  celebrates their death, the brightness of the stage will begin to diminish and the
                  darkness of the Palace will take over, like a foreboding shadow. Beatrice would, like
                  the other characters, begin the play, except for Cenci, in drab and colorless apparel,
                  but when she starts to plan her father’s murder, she changes to richly colored costumes
                  so that by the height of her madness, she would be donning apparel almost equal to
                  the richness and color of the costuming worn by Cenci.” Another student proposes a
                  contemporary cast for a new film version of P. B. Shelley’s tragedy: Scarlet Johansen
                  as Beatrice, Michael Douglas as Count Cenci, Jessica Lange as Lucretia, and Anthony
                  Hopkins as Cardinal Camillo. As for an interesting stage effect at the end of the
                  play, another student writes: “The Hall of Justice would be a long hallway, with the
                  prisoners positioned at one end, each seated in a rolling office chair, and Camillo
                  and the judges at the other. As characters are given their turns to speak, their chairs
                  roll forward toward the judges, and as they are dismissed, their chairs will roll
                  into a doorway off to the side of the hall.”</p>
               <p>A response to 1813 reviews of Coleridge’s tragedy <em>Remorse</em> indicates how the student better appreciates the importance of the play’s scenery
                  for spectators. He writes: “With these reviews, it was somewhat easier to imagine
                  what key scenes would have looked like, the sorcery scene specifically. They also
                  gave me a sense of what early nineteenth-century audience thought of acting capabilities.
                  By giving our imagination a direction, the reviews let me see different perspectives,
                  things I can’t see from merely reading the play.” Another student recommends <em>Remorse</em> for a made-for-TV movie, recast as a story about high-school kids and cliques. The
                  outsider Alvar would be chunky and nerdy, and Ordonio would be thin and popular. Ordonio
                  teases Alvar and spreads malicious rumors about his brother, eventually causing Alvar
                  to transfer schools, despite the fact that Teresa finds him attractive. When Alvar
                  returns to the school months later, he has lost weight, wears contacts, and is immediately
                  a hit with the popular crowd.” Another student recommends filming Byron’s <em>Sardanapalus</em> for the big screen, with a setting in the 1940s in Washington, D.C. and involving
                  a congressional scandal with a closeted effeminate male and a press leak, so that
                  the story would be about the fall of democratic leadership rather than the fall of
                  the Assyrian empire. Another student, however, sees contemporary appeal for a movie
                  that retains Byron’s Near East setting, particularly given our political interests
                  in the very region that was seen as vital to the emerging commercial economy of early
                  nineteenth-century Britain. A passage from a researched critical analysis of <em>Sardanapalus</em> reveals how clothing becomes code for sexuality for this reader: “Clothing is used
                  in this play to reveal Sardanapalus’ femininity, and Sardanapalus’s preoccupation
                  with battle clothing makes him seem less of a man. When Sardanapalus orders his servant
                  to bring him a mirror, we see his narcissism, his feminine concern with appearances
                  rather than the impending battle for control of Nineveh.”</p>
               <p>In general, the course evaluations for British Romantic Drama were similar to what
                  I receive from other courses I teach, but here are some comments that are particularly
                  relevant to the content and delivery of the seminar and that indicate how students
                  were able to integrate the learning experiences. One student writes: “This class taught
                  me something very different; reading drama can be just as fulfilling or more fulfilling
                  than actually seeing a play read.” Another student points to the ways in which the
                  drama contributed to his self-awareness: “I learned a lot about myself over the course
                  of this semester in class. It took me a while to learn how to read the plays, but
                  once I learned what worked, I fell in love with some of the plays we read. I wish
                  I had taken a course in Romanticism before my senior year.” Another student emphasizes
                  connections between self-actualization and the drama we read: “Through this class,
                  I have been exposed to literature and drama that, up until this point, I had not heard
                  of and I was able to learn. I think that the most important thing that I have learned
                  about myself this semester is that I really enjoy reading drama and that I am drawn
                  to these plays because of their interesting content. I think that groupings of the
                  plays are helpful since it allows for progression through the semester with smooth
                  transition between plays.” And finally, a student admits ending up in this course
                  quite by happenstance, but finds it a surprisingly pleasant and instructional experience:
                  “This class has been an invaluable learning experience for me. I thoroughly enjoyed
                  the curriculum and loved learning about, for me, a new kind of drama. Joanna Baillie
                  was my favorite dramatist, and I must confess that I took this course because the
                  Shakespeare class was full, but I am very glad that I had this opportunity.” </p>

               <h2><span class="head">Expected Outcomes</span></h2>
               <p>At the end of the semester, I was able to report to my department chair that students
                  who successfully completed English 4312: Studies in Drama: British Romantic Drama
                  during the spring 2006 were able to write analytical essays that summarized, explicated,
                  and judged diverse cultural expressions in the plays we read. The students contributed
                  to class discussions with analyses, comparisons, contrasts, and presentations of experiential
                  knowledge informed by close textual readings of Romantic drama and reviews. The students
                  demonstrated generic and periodic understandings of how literary and language studies
                  function through their response papers and the researched critical analysis. The students
                  integrated understandings and applications of skills acquired through the study of
                  literature and language as part of their last response paper (see Appendix), which
                  required them to perform a self-assessment and to discuss the ways in which the skills
                  and strategies they had acquired in this course would be helpful to them in the future.
                  Finally, the students composed a research essay in which secondary materials supplement
                  and support close readings of the drama, an essay that was built, in part, by the
                  cumulative assignments of the secondary source discovery activity, the response papers,
                  the critical analysis proposal, and class discussions. By the end of the course, most
                  students were able to identify historical and current developments in the study of
                  British Romantic drama and were cognizant of the ways in which British Romantic drama
                  reflected the cultural and historical issues of the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth
                  centuries. </p>
