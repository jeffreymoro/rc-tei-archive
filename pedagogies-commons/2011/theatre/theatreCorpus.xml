               </byline>
               <p>In spring 2007, I taught a special topics course at Shippensburg University with
					the same title as this essay. In the course, I examined with students both the
					dramatic writing of women writers of the British seventeenth through twentieth
					centuries and the meta-historical questions raised by the course’s title. In the
					following remarks, I suggest some of the directions that I tried in the course
					and some of the ideas I would try in the course after seeing how the students
					responded.</p>
               <!--[Layout Note: Ideally, I would like the “How” remarks to exist in a main page list of
            bulleted statements and then click through to open or unfold to the “Why” commentary. I
            like the idea of creating a small amount of hypertextual navigation by the reader.]-->
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">How:</hi> Tell the students to look for the plays written by
					women. Don’t just hand them to them; tell them that they have to go find one to
					read. Give them a time frame; maybe (or maybe not) suggest particular
					playwrights. Maybe gesture towards a reference source…but don’t hand it to
					them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">Why:</hi> Students may be surprised to find that it might not be
					easy to find a text to read. Much depends on what kind of library they use,
					whether they mind reading text online, how adroit they are in digging into
					online tools to find scanned texts. When I first taught this course in 2007, the
					landscape was quite different online. Then, the Googlebooks phenomenon took off,
					and now there are many, many relevant texts online. But regardless of what
					students find, their various paths to finding texts to read…and what they find
					and choose to read…provide a basis for good discussion about why these texts
					have the status they have, what the history of their publication has been, and
					how the students made their decisions about how to excavate the history.</p>
               <p> In other words, this is one of those cases where professorial expertise can
					productively be withheld for pedagogical purposes.</p>
               <p> The plays found can be returned to a bit later for discussion of their style and
					content. There’s a good chance that “what women wrote about” may be represented
					in interesting patterns by what students will find hidden in plain sight. But
					you might ask them to make some guesses about what women wrote about in the era
					in question and why. If they’re catching on to your game, they may cannily
					resist, but no matter…you can ask them <emph>why</emph> they resist. Why, after
					all, shouldn’t the sample we find be used to determine what the larger
					phenomenon of women’s playwriting consists of? Hey, I thought this was a
					literature class, not social science. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">H:</hi> Ask students to look for reviews of plays by women
					playwrights of the era you’re focusing on. Again, like looking for texts, they
					will encounter something of the landscape of available information. Depending on
					whether they go the route of publications or online resources, and depending on
					how they construct their searches, they may run into some frustrations. This
					assignment effectively encourages collaborative work and provides coaching and
					suggestions. Again, the idea is not simply to show them the best repositories of
					information you know. See what they find.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">W:</hi> What students may find when they do this is that the
					double concealment of minimal productions and limited access to review
					information can make it seem that there are few plays by women playwrights of
					certain eras that have been produced. If this is what is found, you might ask
					students why they suppose so little information seems to be available. But if
					they find a few valuable sources, you might follow up by asking them to
					determine what purposes led to the creation of the source. Students might then
					begin to examine assumptions about how history comes to exist as an available
					resource for our use. A first assumption may be that “durability” (aesthetic,
					probably) creates the archive of information. But many of the resources they
					will find likely will exist for other reasons than that they survived and were
					gathered together. In fact, digital materials typically have their own sorts of
					purposes for existing and being maintained, and these can be productively
					examined. Pose the question to students, “How are the purposes of digital
					archives similar to or different from those of material archives?” The question
					might seem to stump them at first, but they can go back to some of what they
					found in their first two experiments, maybe in working groups, and examine the
					materials to see if they can find any clues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">H:</hi> Show them how women responded to the dramatic writing of
					other women in developing their own dramatic voices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">W:</hi> Women playwrights understood that the ways predecessor
					women navigated tricky genres, subjects, professional identities, and
					institutions had something to teach them. They may not have assumed that they
					should make the same choices as a woman dramatist who came before, but
					understanding earlier writers alerted Romantic-era playwrights to the
					distinctive gendered landscape they needed to navigate. Cowley looked back to Behn and
					Centlivre, as did Inchbald. Women who wrote
					tragedies and histories—from Burney to Baillie
					to Mitford—read widely in the unperformed published tragedies of other
					women.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">H:</hi> Place women’s dramatic writing in the context of men’s
					writing of their era, in similar genres, and for the same theatrical houses and
					actors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">W:</hi> While women theatre writers may participate in a
					counter-tradition that has its own historical significance apart from their
					public recognition, how women dramatists wrote in relation to the male writers
					of their era provides a crucial lens through which to view women’s choices of
					form, subject, and social process. With men often in control of the business end
					of theatre management in the Romantic era (but not always, consider Jane Scott),
					women’s ways of “writing their way in” can be seen for all its pragmatic or
					self-assertive ingenuity. Some women playwrights—such as Inchbald—needed to succeed financially, while others had greater
					freedom to test the limits of male dramatic conventions—Baillie, for instance. But it is always worth
					considering how women dramatists position themselves in relation to men’s
					dramatic writing of their era. Doing so helps to estrange the aesthetic of the
					male tradition, to contextualize it historically, and at the same time to see
					the strategic dimension of women’s dramatic aesthetics.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">H:</hi> Look at how women dramatists and actresses contributed to
					each other’s aesthetic and professional development.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">W:</hi> In some ways, women dramatists and actresses were two
					aesthetic “species” that constituted the two aspects of the theatrical female of
					the Romantic era. While the dramatist could lay some claim to literary
					authority, the actress could sustain a kind of public persona through careful
					reputation management, self-marketing, and selection of repertoire. But, of
					course, the two different female theatrical roles also had ways of teaching each
					other. Actresses learned to “author” their theatrical personae from women
					dramatists, fashioning ways of developing their professional character
					performance by performance. Playwrights “performed” their authorship, learning
					from actresses how they might influence public perception through staging
					particular moments of authorial utterance within the public sphere. Even more
					fascinating, women dramatists wrote plays with particular actresses in
						mind—Baillie’s Jane DeMonfort for Siddons,
					for example—but even beyond practical casting considerations, actresses served
					to flesh out the imagination of the stage writing of women who wrote without
					intimate knowledge of the backstage world or who sought in the persona of an
					actress a way of moving beyond their own personal style of feminine performance.
					At the same time, actresses valued the roles written by women for women’s
					performance. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">H:</hi> Consider the continuum of venues for which women wrote
					drama—from private circulation of closet drama to London’s patent theatres and all spaces in between.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">W:</hi> The early phase of research on women dramatists focused
					on the far extremes of these venues, the closet and the patent-theatre stage.
					But as a greater variety of scholarship has developed, more work on alternative
						London stages, provincial stages, private
					theatres, and any number of alternative venues has complicated the picture of
					women’s dramatic writing. What makes consideration of different venues such an
					interesting dimension of our historicization of women’s dramatic writing is that
					it forces us to reexamine dramatic forms and subjects in the context of variable
					social dimensions—which audiences directly experienced the works, in what
					contexts they experienced the works, and how a drama’s aesthetic reception was
					surrounded in varied ways by other forms of publicity, knowledge, and social
					circulation. For instance, a play like Ann Yearsley’s <emph>Earl Goodwin</emph>,
					performed in Bristol and Bath in 1789, hits its regional audience and local
					readers of newspapers differently than the same play might have had it been
					performed, as Yearsley originally hoped, on a London
					mainstage. The social acoustics of varied venues of performance affect how
					women’s plays are heard and how they resonate in the culture surrounding
					them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">H:</hi> Study the theatre theory women of the era wrote, not just
					as explanations of their dramatic praxis but also as further ways in which they
					performed in the theatre of authorship and in which they created new
					possibilities for dramatic thinking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">W:</hi> In any form of commentary on theatre or drama, women
					writers envision ways that plays might be received—empathically, ethically,
					politically. When Inchbald, for example, responds
					to the plays of women writers included in <emph>The British Theatre</emph>, she
					cannily does so as much as a characterized type of critic as she does as a
					private citizen. A reader of her commentary is thereby given a kind of stance to
					respond to: “This critic raises an eyebrow about this play’s moral commitments,
					but I might not share those concerns,” one might think. But in this stance
					taking, Inchbald opens up dialogue with the plays
					she discusses, and that dialogue with a play is an opening to further thought.
					Likewise, when Baillie—in all earnestness, it
					seems—critiques the practices of theatre production of her time, she, too, does
					more than propose an alternative production style. She reframes the very idea of
					theatrical convention, inviting us to consider what kinds of aesthetics of
					character, plot, and theme current practices advance. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">H:</hi> Consider women’s dramatic writing as more than pragmatic
					literary professionalism—consider its psychological and self-revelatory
					dimensions and the ways it allowed for new kinds of envisioning by women to
					become public.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">W:</hi> There are times when I reread one of Joanna Baillie’s plays and I suddenly can only
					see its monodramatic qualities. I see only Joanna—both her young and her older
					self—playing all the parts, reading all the lines, channeling all the emotions.
					And then I think about the psychological freedom that envisioning oneself acting
					the play on a London stage could have represented to
					her. And then I think about what imagining her doing so could have represented
					to a woman (or a man) reading the play. The pleasure of dashing one’s head
					against the side of the stage, of tossing a coffee cup to the floor, of
					comforting a distraught brother, of disarming a crazed rival! Baillie, like so many women dramatists of the
					era, had discovered the power of interventionist acting out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">H:</hi> Introduce contemporary women dramatists and writers who
					employ dramatic elements in all kinds of contemporary forms of writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">W:</hi> In my course, I connected women dramatists of the
					Romantic era to contemporary screenwriters and graphic novelists. We looked at
						<emph>My So-Called Life</emph>, Winnie Holzman’s mid-1990s television
					series, as well as Alison Bechdel’s graphic memoir <emph>Fun Home</emph>. After
					reading many different women writers’ treatments of family life in dramatic
					form, these two uses of dramatic elements in very different media suggested
					interesting parallels. But perhaps more importantly, the contemporary works sent
					us back to re-see such features as Inchbald’s
					tonal shifts or Baillie’s social contexts for
					the passions. It is valuable to look back to see what came before, but sometimes
					what comes after sheds light on the forms and strategies of predecessor texts. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">H:</hi> Ask whether teaching women’s dramatic writing of the
					British Romantic era has any curricular patterns in common with teaching other
					minority literatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">W:</hi> One of the questions I raised repeatedly in the course
					had to do with what kinds of rationales we can use to justify the teaching of
					“minority literatures.” Because some of my students were English education
					majors, and because I think about the concerns of future and current teachers
					whenever I teach literature these days, I was curious to probe the rationales we
					use to bring new books into the book room, new texts and aesthetic forms into
					our classrooms. After all, school can often be about transmitting the received
					forms and aesthetics—how else to explain the fetishization of Ibsen’s <emph>A
						Doll House</emph> in American public high schools to the exclusion of almost
					all other 19<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi> century European drama? Why change what
					we teach? I know that in a faculty-research-driven environment, faculty’s
					continuing quest for a new margin to explore can provide the answer. But when
					the default rationale is celebration of the already valued, and when the
					logistics of getting new texts before the students can be complicated, other
					rationales need to be explored—if not necessarily unproblematically endorsed.
					Why, after all, teach undergraduates a course in “How and Why to Teach the
					History of Women’s Dramatic Writing” in the first place? Why indeed….</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <ab>
                     <emph>For historical representation</emph>
                  </ab>
                  <p> This rationale would depend on the idea that literature is taught to
						represent the history of culture. Therefore, to give an accurate picture of
						history would demand that major producers of cultural forms must be part of
						what we consider in historical studies to get an accurate picture. This
						rationale depends, however, on viewing women’s dramatic writing as
						significantly varied from men’s in ways that make it represent something
						slightly different, a significant minority variation. And the overall
						rationale for literature teaching that undergirds this reason is a kind of
						representational politics of culture. Questions might be raised about
						whether within the vast scheme of things that is a British culture
						curriculum women’s plays—given how much many of them partake of the same
						industry protocols as men’s plays—are a significant and variant enough
						subset to merit special consideration. Would we teach women’s newswriting,
						television screenplays, and so forth? The representational rationale is one
						that has its limits, though when linked to more pragmatic reasons—such as
						allowing contemporary women who (might) write drama to reflect on women’s
						previous dramatic writing—can have power.</p>
                  <ab>
                     <emph>For stylistic and thematic distinctiveness</emph>
                  </ab>
                  <p> As I’ve already suggested, this rationale ultimately has to be addressed
						within the historical rationale as well. There, the question becomes whether
						women’s writing of drama is representative of anything distinct that must be
						accounted for. Here, elements of dramaturgy (central female characters given
						new agency, for example) and of thematic focus (the problematics of
						marriage, women’s filial obligations, social pressure toward respectability)
						provide the main reasons for studying the history of women’s drama. Of
						course, these elements may either be seen as essentially different from
						other drama for reasons of women’s fundamental differences in interests from
						men’s, or as primarily a market niche that women dramatists occupied. The
						primary dilemma for this rationale is that convenience sampling of women’s
						drama overall may be the only way to claim an essential difference.
						Considering only women's plays that differ from the main body of a period’s
						drama seems a good way to ensure minority status that is both misleading and
						limiting to fuller consideration of the plays.</p>
                  <ab>
                     <emph>For its value in troubling existing aesthetics and histories</emph>
                  </ab>
                  <p> I’ve saved this one for last because it seems to me most compelling. When we
						look closely at the plays of women dramatists and at their careers as
						writers, we are often forced to see the complex interplay between dramatic
						writer and historical situation in new ways. Sidestepping the sociology of
						dramatic authorship no longer makes sense—and we begin to wonder whether it
						ever did. Our current ideas about how art treats some of the themes familiar
						to us—love, tragedy, economic struggles, etc.—are often turned around. For
						instance, we may leave to doubt whether any love story can confidently be
						taken as representational of a particular persona’s situation rather than as
						a structural device for examining identity, desire, and social priorities
						within the rigors of an art form centered on enactment rather than
						reflection.</p>
                  <p>This last rationale seems to me most appealing when we talk about
						marriage comedies of playwrights such as Centlivre, Cowley, and Inchbald since our
						own insistence on love as a personal emotion and set of choices seems
						problematized when characters’ personal actions in sorting out love matters
						test our credulity at the same time they might make some wonder, “Why
						doesn’t she just…?” or “Her actions seem rather tortuous and tangled.” While
						we can certainly choose to see the actions of the plays as less authentic
						and real than our own (aren’t they?), we might also scent the ways that our
						own beliefs in the personal directness of love, achievement, and ethical
						character might be a bit less inevitable were we to look at them in their
						full context of actions over a lifetime. Plays by women often create this
						trouble closest to home.</p>

						when we naturalize our work with cultural materials from the past that our
						scholarly and teaching practices remake. As we pursue our professions
						through working with the materials of earlier periods, we sometimes fail to

						not possible to remain perpetually meta-aware of the premises of our

               <p>This essay addresses two questions that motivated the design of my new graduate seminar: why I extended the survey to include
					romantic drama, and why I believe romantic drama is particularly suited to a discussion of the pedagogical process. In the
					introduction to <title level="j">Romantic Pedagogy Commons</title>, the editors explain that <quote>this journal presents articles
						about how teaching works. Occasionally, in an essay about teaching, the writer of the essay will say, 'Then I get students to
						see that . . . .' Sometimes whatever follows the 'that' is in fact less significant than what has been elided. What's missing
						is an answer to the question, HOW? How do you get students to see what you see in a text? (Mandell)</quote>
                  <lb/> This apt observation underlines that,
					when we teach or talk about our teaching, it is much
					easier to focus on our goal, <emph>what</emph> we want to teach our students, than on the process by which we achieve that goal.
					Pedagogy defies definition, in part because our teaching truly is a performance—scripted to a certain extent, but dependent on
					mood, on audience, on time—and so bounded by the rules of performance. Our teaching can never be repeated exactly the same way
					each time we do it, and the act of teaching is always slipping determinedly into the past. We emerge from a good class, or a bad
					one, with a record of what we have conveyed yet only a memory of how we have done so.</p>
               <p>Of course, none of these factors mean that we cannot discuss how we teach (only why these discussions are difficult), and I
					have always found that teaching drama gives me a model for how to reflect on my own teaching practice. Teaching a genre contingent
					upon performance reminds me that we cannot understand "what" without talking about "how." Teaching drama trains me to comprehend
					theory and practice simultaneously, and as a result I'm more ready to bring this approach to the subject of teaching itself. But
					recently, as I began to work more with those plays classified as "romantic dramas," I discovered that drama could be more than a
					model. Romantic drama in particular seems interested in how theatrical practice works as a pedagogical strategy, so that the
					"what" these plays are all about becomes the "how" that we as scholars and teachers tend to efface. For instance, when Marjean D. Purinton presents 
					the metatheatrics of Joanna
						Baillie's comedy <title level="m">The Tryal</title> as "a pedagogical strategy offering women an alternative
					relationship to power" (133), her statement suggests the point of the play rests not just in what women are taught, but in the
					method by which women are taught it: through theater. This focus then reflects metatheatrically on the function of Joanna Baillie's play, 
					such that "<title level="m">The Tryal</title> makes its own pretense as
					theatre ironically powerful as a teaching tool" (Purinton 133).<hi/>
               </p>
               <p>So what should romantic drama teach us? "The Drama improves us by the knowledge we acquire of our own minds, from the natural
					desire we have to look into the thoughts, and observe the behaviour of others," Baillie states in
					the introductory preface to her <title level="m">Plays on the Passions</title> (90). Baillie here
					seems to outline first a method and then a goal: by observing the "varieties of the human mind," by "examining others," we may in
					turn "know ourselves" ("Preface" 76, 74). Both her choice to write drama and her insistence that her plays were intended for the
					stage make sense in light of these methods, as the observation and examination of others would seem to be best fulfilled in the
					embodied realm of performance ("Preface" 108-9).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Despite the vexed performance history of
						her plays, Baillie insists she wrote them to be performed. According to Catherine Burroughs, the playwright's stated intention disqualifies her plays as "closet
						dramas." I'm citing Burroughs' talk "The Persistence of Closet Drama: Theory, History,
						Form," given at the Huntington Library, San Marino, California, March 4<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi>, 2006. </note> But because
					of these methods, the "what" these plays are supposed to teach us—to know ourselves, to know our own minds—is a quantity always to
					be discovered, contingent as it is upon the infinite varieties and behaviors we can observe. More properly, Baillie is invested in teaching method: 
					we learn from her plays <emph>how</emph> to know ourselves.
					When studied from this perspective, these plays reveal that self-knowledge, the pedagogical "goal" of Baillie and many other romanticists,
					is itself a process far more than a precept. And when studied from this
					perspective, Baillie's plays allow us to have methodologically oriented discussions that reflect
					more generally on the practice of teaching, itself. </p>
               <p>The links between subjectivity and pedagogy in the romantic period run wide and deep, and my graduate seminar builds to these
					links by situating Baillie's plays at the end of a historical survey of drama. The survey has a
					practical function—my class is perhaps the only course in eighteenth-century literature that my graduate students will take, and I
					feel responsible for providing coverage—but it has an intellectual purpose as well. I want my students to experience the liminal
					moments in literary history, to make connections among literary periods sometimes presented as distinct. The survey format also
					means that, by the time we reach romantic drama, we can discuss why plays that reflect on the pedagogical benefits of performance
					are also suited to explore the issues of subjectivity and self-knowledge with which they engage.</p>
               <p n="5">The stated rubric of my course is that eighteenth-century plays depict identity as both metaphorically and literally
					theatrical. Our readings from the eighteenth century, texts from <title level="m">The Rover</title>, to <title level="m">The
						Beggar's Opera</title>, to <title level="m">The Belle's Stratagem</title>, illustrate that an awareness of actual theatrical
					practice informs the way characters stage their identities in the "offstage" regions of these plays. I want students to think
					about how these observations resonate in provocative ways with contemporary theories of gender and identity construction, and I
					also want students to think about how current scholars are using terms from theater history in more theoretical ways. I therefore
					pair our primary readings for each week with a specific keyword, taken from theater / performance / gender studies, that
					reinforces in some way the themes of the text. Every student must choose one such word, research its theatrical and
					theoretical applications, and share a brief essay on their findings with the class. Keywords range from "ritual," to "masquerade,"
					to "spectacle." By the time we get to "performativity," students recognize that we have already been using the word, in its
					current theoretical sense of acts or behaviors that construct the state of being they purport to express, to describe many acts of
					theatrical performance explored within these eighteenth-century plays. For example, we discuss the way a comedy 
					such as Hannah Cowley's <title level="m">The Belle's Stratagem</title> explores the idea of pre-existing
					social roles by having its title character move through a series of different and overtly theatrical roles onstage. These
					connections between "performativity" and "performance" (and I have the presenting student read at least the introduction to the
						Parker and Sedgwick collection of essays on this topic)
					encourage us to read the ideas about subjectivity considered in these plays in terms of evolutions—or continuities—in theatrical
					practice. I then pair our final keyword, "theatricality," with Baillie's <title level="m">Plays
						on the Passions</title>, so that students will question the closeted nature of her plays and discuss to what extent
					theatricality can still characterize texts that are not actively performed. </p>
               <p>Thus, as we move into our romantic plays and challenge their delineation as "closet dramas," we also create the potential for
					more continuity between eighteenth-century and romantic conceptions of subjectivity than is currently assumed.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
						Julie Carlson and Jane Moody are among the recent critics who
						have helped trouble the delineation "closet drama." </note> Dror Wharman's recent book <title level="m">The Making of the
						Modern Self </title>offers one version of the kind of polarized view we challenge. In this book, Wahrman argues that "selfhood" in 
					the short eighteenth century (the version of the century that eschews the romantic
					period) was understood as something Protean, superficial, something Wahrman calls "socially turned"
					(168). Not until the end of the century, he claims, did identity come to be understood as something more essentialist and
					interior—the romantic idea of the self.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For Wahrman,
						"identity" and "self" become interchangeable in the later eighteenth century, as the point at which "identity became personal,
						interiorized, essential, even innate." Once identity is something internalized, "it was made synonymous with self" (276).
					</note> Yet Wahrman mistakenly invokes eighteenth-century theater as illustrative of, even
					responsible for, this shift. He claims that "the [eighteenth-century] actor…was expected to believe in his own actual
					metamorphosis in order to achieve the ideal dramatic effect," so that if an eighteenth-century audience witnessed an actress in a
					breeches part, it would read the performance as indicative of "a playful splitting of identity, a splitting literal rather than
					metaphorical" (172, 176). Contrary to Wahrman's assertions, the necessary identification of an
					actor with his or her part was in fact the subject of much debate in the eighteenth century, as our reading from Diderot's <title level="m">
                     <foreign>Paradoxe sur le comédien</foreign>
                  </title> makes clear. At the same time, our dramatic readings showcase
					characters who do identify with the theatrical roles they adopt, but for very different reasons, and with very different results,
					than the ones Wahrman suggests. Many of our plays include characters who adopt parts and put on
					roles, not always in an effort to reinvent themselves (Wahrman), nor with the ability or desire to
					retain some theatrical detachment from the role they take up (Diderot), but in a conscious effort to convey sentiments that would
					otherwise be inexpressible. Cowley's Letitia Hardy fits into this characterization, as do Behn's Hellena and Goldsmith's Kate Hardcastle. As these characters
					flit from persona to persona, their roles are connected by a consistent, self-defining emotion that the various roles allow them
					to convey. Indeed, the Goldsmith and Cowley heroines make
					students think back to Eliza Haywood's heroine Fantomina, the titular character from one of the few non-dramatic pieces we read.
					In all these cases, the theatrical "splittings of identity" emerge as a characteristic performance strategy that creates a link,
					not simply a gap, between self and persona, with a relationship between the two that is not necessarily deceptive. </p>
               <p>The eighteenth-century "self" seems much less Protean in this context, much less superficial, and much more associated with
					the sense of coherence and interiority that accompanies later romantic models of subjectivity. By the same token, these
					characteristics of romanticism emerge as a continuation of, not a deviation from, the ideas about subjectivity embodied on the
					eighteenth-century stage. Yet within this continuum any sense of interiority is constructed by the reiteration of theatrical acts,
					a rather un-romantic revision of essentialism. Imagine, for instance, how a student coming from a survey of eighteenth-century
					plays would read the following passage from Baillie's tragedy <title level="m">De
					Monfort</title>, the moment at which Lady Jane De Monfort has tracked her conflicted brother to his friend Count Freberg's
					residence. Desperate to learn why De Monfort has fled their home, Jane takes Freberg's advice and veils herself, so that she may
					accost her brother while her own identity is obscured: <quote>

                     </lg>
                  </quote>
                  <lb/> Jane's conduct in this passage is at once theatrical and experimental, as she dons a mask in an attempt to
					assess "the temper of [her brother's] mind" (2.1.104). But the effect of Jane's disguise is surprising, for it prompts De Monfort
					to compare her to the person she actually is. Her face, behind those sable folds, <emph>is</emph> exactly as fair as the face that
					De Monfort imagines, her kindly deeds measure up precisely to the obligations her brother praises. Jane's disguise also means she
					belies herself when she claims "all sisters are not to the soul entwin'd / with equal bands." The sisters she describes are
					actually only one sister, the bands she describes exactly equivalent. All sisters conflate within her sable folds, so that De
					Monfort when confronted with her veil may see—correctly—the sister of whom he speaks. </p>
               <p>Her performance says much about the evolution and nature of romantic subjectivity. First, students will recognize that Jane
					takes her cue from a slew of earlier dramatic heroines. Like Letitia's or Fantomina's acts of disguise, Jane's masking becomes an
					expressive not an obfuscating act, and De Monfort would be better served by taking her at face value than by seeking to see
					something different beneath her veil. But Jane's veil is expressive in that it is evocative of the self upon which it is layered.
					The theater's use of costumes and vizards provides a physical source for the metaphorical layering that occurs in theatrical
					presentation, so that as theatrical presentation provides a surface, it simultaneously suggests an element of depth. Theatrical
					performance becomes an efficacious form of expression in this scene as it offers up the very surfaces that reinforce a subject's
					depth and dimensionality; selfhood in this model remains internalized, even as its interiority is perpetuated by the theatrical
					acts that confirm it. </p>
               <p>Jane's masquerade also has a clear teaching purpose that reinforces this reading of subjectivity as consistently
					multi-layered. She may speak as a sister in this scene only because she is veiled, and thus only because De Monfort assumes he is
					not the brother of whom she speaks. She may express her familial feelings precisely because they are articulated during a
					performance, which suggests that even when the masks characters don are expressive and not obfuscating the interiority-producing
					layer of the mask is essential to maintain. Furthermore, it is crucial to De Monfort's reaction that he be "caught up in the act"
					without quite knowing that he has become so. Jane's theatrical display encourages in her brother neither catharsis nor even
					vicarious sympathy. De Monfort experiences something more psychoanalytic, as the act of witnessing Jane's performance brings his
					own latent passions to the surface and forces him to come to terms with them.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This, to me,
						is what Baillie means by her idea of "sympathetic curiosity" or "sympathetic propensity" (73,
						76). Unlike Adam Smith, who claims that sympathy enables us "change places with the sufferer," to gain some sense of
							<emph>his</emph> torments, Baillie asserts that "in examining others we know ourselves"
						(74). </note>
               </p>
               <p>Yet performance becomes pedagogical only under specific conditions. As the wronged sister, Jane consciously adopts a role
					that communicates her own feelings. She performs her part with an unexpected emotional honesty, and her ultimate influence over
					her brother derives from the fact that she is not only like the sister of whom she speaks, but she is the sister herself. De
					Monfort, on the other hand, does not know he is participating in a performance until Jane unmasks. In Baillie's play, acts of performance shift 
					from entertaining to instructive when they are crafted so that their
					specific didactic purpose is somewhat obscured, and so that the intended student audience (in this case, De Monfort) is at least
					temporarily unaware of the scene's crafted nature.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Elizabeth
							Inchbald's 1797 comedy <title level="m">Wives as They Were, Maids as They Are</title> and Maria Edgeworth's 1798 home theatrical
						<title level="m">Whim for Whim</title> (recently
						published by Pickering and Chatto in volume 12 of <title level="m">The Novels and Selected Works of Maria Edgeworth</title>) also illustrate this concept,
						though we do not have time to read them in my class.
					</note> For the typical theater audience tucked safely behind a fourth wall, the conditions of performance are both more apparent
					and less interactive. Yet by incorporating models of pedagogical performance within themselves, plays like <title level="m">De
						Monfort</title> reflect suggestively on their own pedagogical function. Indeed, by framing pedagogical moments within the play
					as covertly didactic, the play reclaims its own generic conventions as advantageous to its didactic project. The broader
					convention of the stage, which seems to require that the theater audience observe yet not participate in the dialogues they
					witness, also insists that the play's pedagogical claims on its external audience be at least temporarily disguised. (In this
					model, Baillie's "Introductory Discourse" becomes akin to the explication of Jane's unmasking.)
					The theater audience thus shares a position with DeMonfort, as both are unaware of exactly how they are engaged and implicated in
					the didactic project of the performance before them, while this temporary suspension of awareness is encouraged by and crucial to
					the pedagogical program outlined within the play itself. </p>
               <p>In the classroom, we are much more attuned to the fact that we are teaching or being taught, though here too we can be
					subtle about how our goals are advertised or achieved. For instance, I publicize my graduate course as a course on "staging
					identity," though my publicized interest in subjectivity and my closeted interest in pedagogy ultimately align. A tenet that
					remains consistent among rationalist and romantic ideas of education alike is that the preceptor is not a dictator so much as a
					guide (Richardson). The student must learn how to learn; they must, as Maria Edgeworth puts it, learn to "think and reason for [themselves]" (297). The educator in this
					model does not disseminate facts so much as lead students toward personal discoveries, so that students have for themselves the
					experience of proving theorems, of testing precepts. And for the student—be he a doctoral candidate or the tormented De Monfort—to
					learn from experience, he must be able to react to a staged circumstance with his own emotions. The good teacher both creates and
					obscures the conditions that enable this emotional reaction to occur. In other words, teaching, when done well, obscures its
					scripted nature.</p>
               <p>What I have learned, then, in teaching romantic drama is that students need guidance, but that they also need to reach
					conclusions on their own. In the case of my graduate seminar, they need to experience for themselves the instructive, constructive
					relationship of performance to subjectivity. So in addition to having my students attend productions of Bertolt Brecht's 
					<title level="m">The Threepenny Opera</title> and a dramatic adaptation of <title level="m">Mansfield
						Park</title> (which the USC School of Theatre very conveniently scheduled to overlap with my seminar), I have my class
					conclude with a student performance that coincides with their final reading assignment in Austen's novel <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>. As a class, they must agree upon one scene from all the plays we have read, cast the actors, decide
					on whatever props will be necessary, and rehearse to whatever extent they see fit. The preparation for the assignment asks them to
					review the plays and themes from throughout the semester, but it also asks them to mimic the process of decision and rehearsal
					that frames <title level="m">Mansfield Park's</title> controversial home theatricals. We have shared an experience with the
					Crawfords and the Bertrams and should never read the novel in quite the same way, again.</p>
               <p>More specifically, the actual staging gives us a chance to discuss how performance intensifies one's experience of a scene
					and why performance, in the nineteenth-century context of Austen's novel, might be considered risky. As we discuss, Fanny's
					discomfort with the playacting in the novel responds on some level to the fact that Austen's characters pair off in a manner that
					reflects their real life affections, so that the rehearsals become a chance to act on the flirtatious impulses that might
					otherwise be kept in check. And as the strategic space between actor and role is lost, the personal expressions of these
					actors—more than theatricality itself—become the subject of Austen's critique. </p>
               <p>So unlike Baillie's play, in which the assumed discrepancy between actor and role provides
					Jane De Monfort the space and opportunity for self-expression, Austen's novel depicts an unmediated understanding of performance,
					and the theater in this novel is disbanded exactly when it has become recognized as an expressive more than a performative space.
					But as we approach this novel at the end of our survey of texts, and concurrent with our own attempts to choose and enact roles,
					we find ourselves discussing expression and performativity as dialectical, not antithetical, concepts. Our historical survey shows
					us instead that what varies from play to play is not the project of the theater, so much as the audience sensitivity towards one
					or the other potential of theatrical performance and, correspondingly, an author's manipulation of this sensitivity through his or
					her framing of the act of performance itself.</p>
               <p>Yet by ending our seminar with a novel, we also end with a question: if performance and the associated behaviors of
					observation and participation were so crucial to a romantic program of education, why is it that the novel and the closet drama
					(genres that do not require performance) become the dominant genres for conveying pedagogy? The rise of the novel in all its
					didactic glory is something critics acknowledge, and this is a genre we discuss at least briefly in our class. I also want to
					mention here the plethora of "academic dramas" that marked the end of the century, the proliferation of dramatic dialogues that
					were seen as "lesson[s] in the guise of play[s]" though plays that were never meant to be performed.<hi rend="sup">
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors"> The term "academic dramas" is from Marta Strazinicky, 426; the quoted phrase is from
							Hannah More's closet drama <title level="m">A Search after Happiness</title> (composed 1763; published 1773). For examples
							of these "lesson[s] in the guise of play[s]," see (among others) C. Short, <title level="m">Dramas for the use of young
								ladies</title> (1792); Elizabeth Pinchard <title level="m">Dramatic Dialogues, for the use of young persons</title>
							(1792); Charlotte Smith, <title level="m">Rural Walks…Intended for the use of young persons</title> (1795). I thank 
							Catherine Burroughs for sharing these references with me. </note>
                  </hi> Why does pedagogy become increasingly associated with the closet drama, increasingly detached from actual performance? </p>
               <p>This shift reveals, I believe, that the key to romantic pedagogy is not embodiment, per se, but mediated experience:
					physical observation or interaction is ultimately less crucial to romantic pedagogies than the notion that <hi>we
						learn about ourselves through others</hi>. This claim offers an alternate reading of romantic drama, one that reveals the
					pedagogical potential of theater to rest in more than just its ability to encourage audience observation of embodied roles. If we
					go back to Baillie's play, we see that Jane's physical presence is actually less important to De
					Monfort's epiphany (indeed, he does not know that Jane is present) than the means by which she communicates with her brother: from
					behind a mask, and by directing her explanation for the mask—not to her brother, for whom both mask and explanation are clearly
					meant—but to Count Freberg, the very man who advocated the disguise. In this scene, Jane highlights a key component of all
					playacting, and a characteristic of theatricality: not embodiment, but mediation. The act of acting is by definition the act of
					conveying ideas or thoughts via intermediate roles. And yet, on the stage this process is often all too overt, especially if the
					theatrical nature of a performance must be obscured for it to function in a pedagogical manner. Closet drama (and, I would argue,
					a novel such as <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>, which juxtaposes its own generic conventions to the current unmediated
					conventions of the Bertram's theater) interrupt what Martin Puchner calls the "unmediated
					theatricality of the stage" (22). The closet drama insists that the theatrical process itself be mediated; paradoxically enough,
					it restores the theatricality to drama and thus drama's pedagogical potential.</p>
               <p n="17">I therefore believe that romantic drama can teach us much about teaching and even more about why we teach literature, of any
					genre or period. As students, teachers, and lovers of books—a body of people who often struggle to define the value of theorizing
					about imaginary heroines, dead authors, and subjective readings—we learn from romantic drama to focus on the benefits, indeed the
					necessity, of learning about ourselves through others. Additionally, these plays remind us that teaching is not about a set of
					definitions but about shared methods, experiences, and a collective process of discovery. We are passionate about what we read and
					teach because we have felt the benefit of emotional and intellectual engagement with what we read and teach. And we know that
					literature, as that which provides such an experience, can teach us something about ourselves. </p>

               <p>As an introduction to the drama of 1780-1830, with emphasis on production and performance, English 97H: <emph>Romantic Drama.
					Production and Performance</emph>, includes practice in acting styles of the period (gesture, elocution, delivery), historical theater
					construction, period costumes, and stage design. Although a large number of theater majors, music majors, and English majors turn
					out, auditions are open to all students. They are asked to prepare a monologue, a song, and to provide a “cold” reading of a
					dramatic passage. In selecting the play to be performed each year, the primary concerns are to find a play that will challenge
					student abilities, that will be accessible to our audiences, that will be rich in historical relevance, and that will depict the
					temper and tastes of the period. Because the theater of the period is musical theater, there is also the difficulty of securing a
					musical score. Many productions relied on interpolated songs, and even where full scores exist, those score were often altered
					with changes in the cast from one season to the next. Obviously the music, then as now, had to suit the abilities of the cast.</p>
               <p>As offered during the Winter Quarter (January through March) 2006, the course actually began with enrollment/auditions at the
					end of November in the preceding term. The course description was also the call to auditions.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> English 97H. Romantic Drama. Production and Performance. Marquis de

               <p>The selection of the play to be performed each year is usually made during the preceding summer, when I have the opportunity
					to browse through the archives of the Theatre Museum in Covent Garden, London. During the summer of 2005 I came across <title level="m">The Haunted Tower, a Comic
						Opera</title>, with the compete musical score by Stephen Storace (1763-1796))
					and the libretto by James Cobb (1756-1818). Opening at Drury Lane November 24, 1789, this comic opera was a significant success, with
					eighty-four performances in its first two seasons, many more throughout the 1790s, and frequent revivals for the next half
						century.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
						Genest, <title level="m">The English Stage</title>, 6:586-88.</note> For the
					purpose of this essay, it seemed useful to highlight a single production, so that a coherent set of examples could be provided for
					all aspects of our efforts in a single term.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For their usefulness in teaching Romantic
						Drama, I am especially indebted to three essays by Marjean Purinton: “On
						Teaching <title level="m">A Bold Stroke for a Husband</title> and Other Comedies by Romantic Women Playwrights,” <title level="j">European Romantic Review</title> 17.3 (July 2006): 351-60; “Romantic Praxis: Teaching British Romanticism with

                  <title level="m">The Haunted Tower</title> provides an excellent example because of its particularly rich fabric of historical,

                  <head>Discovering Storace and Cobb</head>
                  <p>Storace and Cobb began their
						collaboration with a translation of <title level="m">The Doctor and the Apothecary</title>, which opened at Drury Lane on October 25, 1788.
						This production closely followed the Viennese
						original, <title level="m">Doktor und Apotheker</title> (1786), with a score by Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf (1739-1799) 
						and libretto by Gottlieb Stephanie (1741-1800). After the great success of <title level="m">The Haunted Tower</title>, Cobb and Storace continued their collaboration with another comic opera, <title level="m">The Siege of Belgrade</title>,
						first performed on January 1, 1791; <title level="m">The Pirates</title>, performed at the King’s Theatre on November 21, 1792; 
						and <title level="m">The Cherokee</title>,
						performed December 20, 1794. In addition to his collaboration with Cobb, Storace also wrote the score for <title level="m">No Song No Supper</title>, an
						opera in two acts by Prince Hoare (1755-1834), performed at Drury Lane
						April 16, 1790. For Hoare’s libretto Storace introduced some of the music that
						he had written in Venice of his opera, <title level="m">Gli equivoci</title> (December 27, 1786), based on Shakespeare’s
							<title level="m">Comedy of Errors</title>. The music forGeorge Colman’s
							<title level="m">The Iron Chest</title> (March 12, 1796) was also composed by Storace.</p>
                  <p> Although I was excited about working with a musical score that included 29 songs, with overture and finale, I also
						recognized that the music would be a challenge vocally to a student cast. 
						The success was due to the Vocal Director, Stephen Pu, graduate student in Musicology at UCLA. In an attempt to trace the origin
						of the plot, and hoping to find hints on performance, I turned to Michael Kelly’s
							<title level="m">Reminiscences</title> (1826). Kelly performed with the
						Storaces in Vienna and returned with them to London in March, 1787. Kelly made regular trips to Paris in search of material for the London stage.
						At the Comédie-Italienne in Paris, 1790, Kelly saw <title level="m">Raoul Barbe-Bleue</title>, a comic opera by Ernest Modeste Grétry (1741–1813), 
						with libretto by Michel-Jean Sedaine (1719-1797). Kelly not only persuaded George Colman to write an English adaptation,
							Kelly himself composed the musical score. <title level="m">Blue-Beard; or,
							Female Curiosity</title> opened at Drury Lane on January 16, 1798.</p>

                  <head>Cobb's Adaptation of Sade</head>
                  <p>When Kelly made the trip to Paris in
						1788, he returned with a work entitled, <title level="m">La tour enchantée, un opéra-comique</title>. In searching for the
						author of this French work, I discovered that it was none other than the infamous Marquis de Sade, who had sent it, along with several other plays,
						to theaters in Paris in late summer, 1788.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">La tour enchantée, un opéra-comique</title>, as described in the Marquis de Sade’s 
							<title level="m">Catalogue raisonné</title> (October 1, 1788), was the concluding episode to
							a sequence of six plays entitled <title level="m">L’union des arts.</title> On February 27, 1791, Monsieur Framery, agent
							for playwrights, informed Sade that several of the plays had been accepted
							for performance. They remained unstaged, but <title level="m">La tour enchantée, un opéra-comique</title> made its way
							from Paris to London. </note> This discovery
						was not mine. John and Ben
							Franceschina provide a comparison of the French and English versions in the introduction to their translation,
							<title level="m">The Plays of the Marquis de Sade,</title> 3 vols. (2000).
						Serendipitously, I also discovered that UCLA’s Clark Library possessed a manuscript of Sade’s 
						<title level="m">La tour enchantée</title> and that the manuscript of Cobb’s libretto was in the Larpent Collection at the nearby Huntington Library.</p>
                  <p>During the Fall term I set to work with the necessary adaptations. First, I turned to Brian Holmes (San Jose State University) 
						to adapt the musical score for performance
						by a chamber ensemble (violin, viola, flute, keyboard) rather than a full orchestra. Brian also provided an additional song
						for a scene that had been omitted by Cobb (“My love is not a problem” II.vi). This
						song is sung by a tax collector, whom two young ladies are trying to persuade to enter the Haunted Tower (“Attune the pipe”
						II.vi). The first week began with discussion of plot, character, and acting styles, and many improvisation exercises in period
						acting accompanied scene by scene blocking of the play. For the first several weeks vocal rehearsals were held separate from
						acting rehearsals, but because this production is so extensively musical, the two had to be integrated by the fourth week.
						Additional time was required for vocal rehearsals right up to the time of performance at the end of the eighth week. For our
						final dress/tech on Thursday, March 1, we had the benefit of an exclusive audience of specialists: Catherine Burroughs (Wells College), Jeff
							Cox (Colorado), and Jane Moody (York), who provided a useful critique
						following the performance.</p>
                  <p>The great advantage of utilizing performance and production in teaching Romantic Drama is that the students learn the
						material literally from the inside out. They gain an understanding of the language, the acting, and the music that mere
						reading cannot provide. With this particular play, the students were made aware of gender issues, as well as national tensions
						(French vs. English) and social tensions (aristocracy vs. lower classes) that prevailed during the period. As the only work of
						the Marquis de Sade to be performed on the London stage during his own lifetime,
							<title level="m">The Haunted Tower</title> also gave students insight into the international reach of the drama of the
						period.</p>

                  <p>The task of rendering <title level="m">La tour enchantée</title> palatable to an English audience was far more
						complicated than simply excising Sade’s comments about the English. Cobb had to tell the
						story from an English rather than a French perspective. He was
						greatly assisted in this task by Storace, who provided several set pieces to
						reinforce a sense of British tradition: an opening chorus “To Albion’s Genius” (I.i), a hunting song, “Hark! The sweet horn”
						(I.iii), a chorus to the “Roast Beef of Old England”(II.vii), and a drinking song
						praising English ale, “And now we're met, a jolly set” (III.iv).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The songs for this

                     </note> Further, Cobb’s version, with its marriage between Lady Elinor de Courcy and
						Lord William, restored to his estate as the true Baron of Oakland, reestablishes harmony between France and England. The division between the
						aristocracy and the common folk is not overcome, but the virtues and advantages of the commoners are repeatedly affirmed.
						Indeed, the significant contribution of the subplot, the love of Edward and Adela, was to emphasize the sincerity and
						integrity of the lower classes. Michael Kelly declares that the subplot “was
						taken from an Italian intermezzo opera,” and it was clear that Stephen Storace
						intended the role of Adela as a showcase for his sister Anna Storace’s
						accomplishments, “both as a singer and an actress.” Kelly describes his own solos
						as Lord William, “From hope's fond dream” (I.i) and “Spirit of my sainted Sire” (III.iv), as “fine songs,” but notes that the
						latter was “one of the most difficult songs ever composed for the tenor voice.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                  <p>Several songs express the honesty and freedom of the lower class. Cicely, for example, sings of her freedom “From high birth
						and all its fetters” which allows her, in contrast to Lady Elinor who is bound in an arranged marriage, to choose the “youth I
						love” (III.iii). Edward and Adela ridicule aristocratic pretensions in their duet, “Will great lords and ladies” (I.iii). The
						conflict between upper and lower class is given full expression in the sestetto, “Alas! behold the silly maid” (II.iv), and
						more directly in the cat-fight duet with Adela and Lady Elinor, “Begone! I discharge you!” (III.iii).</p>
                  <p>As John and Ben

							3:4. “For example, Juliette’s opening air, 'Love, listen to my sorrow' evokes Adela’s 'Whither, my love!' (I.iii) in Cobb’s libretto. 
							Both pieces depict long-suffering heroines yearning to be
							reunited to their long-lost lovers in lyrics that evoke images of bondage, lovers’ tokens, and an obsession with the
							lover’s image. Lorville’s lament recalling his leaving his lover behind, 'Oh! Juliette' is echoed in Cobb’s libretto with
							Charles’s 'My native land I bade adieu' (I.iv), in which the
							noble servant character philosophizes about the girl he left behind. In both airs, the characters singing imagine that the
							intensity of emotion has changed on the part of the women involved. In the English work, Charles accepts the situation
							with wry humor; in the French, Lorville responds melodramatically in images of bondage and death.” </note> Indeed, <title level="m">La tour enchantée</title> provides prime evidence of Sade’s skill
						as lyricist, and Cobb followed Sade’s
						lead in his English adaptation. It was also to Cobb’s great advantage that he had
						the collaboration of Stephen Storace, whose score has been judged “the most
						successful full-length opera that Drury Lane staged in the entire century.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Roger Fiske, <title level="m">English Theatre Music in the Eighteenth Century</title>

                  </p>
                  <p>Sade’s setting was contemporary. Cobb changed the setting back to the time of William the Conqueror. In adapting <title level="m">The Haunted
							Tower</title>, I brought the time forward again to the reign of George III in order to make the references to the French
						Revolution more evident. Among other changes, I restored the opening dialogue between Juliette and Louise (Lady Elinor and
						Cicely), which provides at the very beginning of the play the explanation of the haunting. I also restored the scene in which
						an attempt is made to persuade Grouffignac, the tax collector, to enter the haunted tower. Here I made the further change of
						giving the task of seducing the tax collector to two village girls rather than to Juliette and Louise. </p>
                  <p>Much of the humor of the play derives from differences in manner and speech between French and English, and between
						upper and lower classes. These differences are compounded by the many role reversals. Having fled as a young boy to France, 
						the exiled Lord William has survived as the Frenchman Sir Palamede, is concealed
						in the De Courcy estate dressed as a girl by Cicely, and presented at the English court as a Jester. In his role as the
						usurping Baron, Edmund the ploughman is boorishly clumsy in affecting grand airs, and obnoxious in his presumption of sexual
						liberties. To marry her beloved Edward, Adela must disguise herself as Lady Elinor, and Lady Elinor, to avoid marriage to
						Edward, pretends to be her own maid-in-waiting.</p>

						now agitated and quick. “The moment that a difficulty presents itself, the play of the hands entirely ceases – the eye, which,
						as well as the head, had a gentle and placid motion, while the thought was easy, and unfolded itself without labour, [...] in
						this new situation looks straight forward, and the load falls on the heart, until, after the first shock of doubt [...]
						suspended activity resumes its former walk.” The pace, the tilt of head, the movement of the hands and arms, must undergo a
						transformation from agitation to control. As if he catches himself, he stops still, gathers composure, then delivers his
						soliloquy. Hamlet’s reflections bring him to a crux: “To die, to sleep;/ To sleep, perchance to dream” (III.i). Hamlet comes
						to a full halt, pauses a moment, then exclaims “ay, there’s the rub,” and at the same moment should give the exterior sign of

                  <p> In the comedies of the period, an heiress and her maid are often depicted as companions: the lady demur and modest, the
						maid daring, witty, and saucy. The relationship between Lady Elinor and her maid Cicely adheres to this pattern, except that
						Cicely is several degrees more assertive and commanding. She constantly interrupts Lady Elinor, gives orders to Sir Palamede,
						and directs their actions. Her solo in Act I, “Nature to woman still so kind,” based on a Welch folk tune, asserts her sense
						of a woman’s advantage.</p>

                  <p>Although herself a member of the serving class, Cicely is haughty and officious when addressing other servants. In
						Act I, scene ii, as depicted, she is insulting in her rude dismissal of Maud, the village girl who has offered shelter and
						guidance to the newly arrived party from France. The gestures, it may be noted, are
						those prescribed by Engel/Siddons: Palamede’s contemplative curiosity, Maud’s offended astonishment, Cicely’s arrogant authority.</p>

                  <p>	The role of Lord William is, in effect, several roles in one. He was but a boy of twelve when the false slander
						against his father, the Baron of Oakland, forced him into exile. Following the death of his father, a distant cousin, Edmund
						the ploughman, has seized power as usurping Baron. In France, William took on the
						disguise of Palamede, and matured into a promising young soldier in service to De Courcy. Here he fell in love with Lady
						Elinor and she with him. Her father, however, has pledged her in marriage to the heir of the Baron of Oakland. Lord William,
						of course, is the rightful heir, but he dare not make that claim until he has received the official pardon from the King. He
						thus must remain docile and submissive, even to the demands of Cicely. Assisting him to gain access to Lady Elinor’s quarters
						in her father’s estate, Cicely has disguised him as Lily, a maid-in-waiting. As Lily, William/Palamede was also able to make
						the crossing in the same ship with Lady Elinor. He is caught in the dilemma of asserting his masculinity while Cicely
						teasingly reminds him of his female role. Whatever other roles he is forced to assume, the audience must perceive that he is
						indeed his own man and capable heir to his father’s lands. When he steps forth from the haunted tower dressed in his father’s
						armor, singing the powerful aria, “Spirit of my sainted sire” (III.iv), he has fully assumed his proper heroic stature. The
						backflashes that explain the usurpation and exile are provided, first, by the village girl Maud, then by Hugo, faithful
						servant of the family. Cicely’s abrupt dismissal of Maud in the above depicted scene (I.ii) is motivated by her anxiety that
						she will lose control of the situation if Maud reveals too much of William’s eminent restoration. When William is introduced
						as De Courcy’s court jester, the Baron ridicules his debased status, but deftly turns the tables with a satirical song
						laughing at the Baron’s impotent and ineffectual prowess. </p>

                  <p>	As noted above, Cobb and Storace fortified the Englishness of their adaptation by introducing traditional English themes in their songs. How
						the entrance and exit of a chorus was managed at Drury Lane I could discover neither
						in Kelly’s account in his <title level="m">Reminiscences</title> nor in Genest’s commentary on the premier performance.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
							Kelly, <title level="m">Reminiscences</title>, 1:318-20; Genest, <title level="m">The English Stage</title>, 6:586-88. </note> My
						solution was to present a quartet (two sopranos, an alto, and a tenor) with changes in costume but always the same as
						characters. For the opening chorus (I.i) they were costumed as fishermen, as huntsmen led in song by Robert (I.iii), as
						servants to the false Baron (I.iii), as cooks, again led by Robert in singing the “Roast Beef of Old <name ref="England">England</name>”(II.vii), and as soldiers (I.iv and III.vi). The chorus thus had four costume
						changes, but they were instructed always to synchronize their movements and gestures, as in the above scene as huntsmen. The
						one exception was their signature entrance: they would march on stage perfectly coordinated, then stumble and bump into each
						other when they came to a halt.</p>

                  <p>The comic center of <title level="m">The Haunted Tower</title> is the lecherous and self-aggrandizing fake Baron. He
						exploits and abuses the lower classes as mere objects of his desires. Just clever enough to be aware of his own clumsiness in
						pretending to nobility, he constantly suspects that others of rank and power are laughing at his pretensions and attempting to
						undermine his authority. His suspicions are not ill-founded. In the scene depicted above (III.i), the Baron expresses to De
						Courcy his fears that a revolution, led by De Courcy’s court jester, is at hand. De Courcy, of course, perceives that the
						court jester is Sir Palamede, one of his own retinue. He knows Palamede’s affections for his sister, yet he has assumed that
						Lady Elinor would not dishonor her father’s pledge that she marry the son of the Baron of Oakland. In performing the role of
						the false Baron, Greg Cragg followed my cues in adapting several of Robert Baddeley’s mannerisms, 
						including what Michael Kelly described as Baddeley’s “habit of smacking his lips always when
							speaking.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                  <p>Fig. 9 Edward, Adela, and the Baron (III.i)</p>
                  <p>At the beginning of Act III, De Courcy finally meets Adela, the peasant girl who has been impersonating his sister.
						Edward, son of the false Baron, is in love with the peasant girl Adela. Just as Lady Elinor must accept her father’s decision
						that she marry the heir of the Baron of Oakland, Edward must comply with his father’s eager pursuit of the marriage which will
						lend legitimacy to his own claims of nobility. Edward contrives the plot to disguise Adela as Lady Elinor and thus consummate
						the marriage before the real Lady Elinor arrives. The real Lady Elinor arrives too early, but is readily persuaded by Cicely
						to play along with the hoax in order to escape an unwanted marriage to Edward. This scene commences with De Courcy in pursuit
						of Sir Palamede, whom he now fears has turned traitor and seeks to elope with his sister. After the false Baron informs him
						that a revolution is underway, Edward arrives half-drunk from his tryst with Adela, whom he has introduced into the Oakland
						court as Lady Elinor. Considering his sister’s honor insulted by Edward’s overly familiar claims of intimacy with “my wife
						that is to be,” De Courcy is about to draw his sword. At this moment Adela arrives, and is greeted as “Lady Elinor” by the
						Baron and his son. Suspecting that this false identity must be a plot of Palamede’s, De Courcy declares, “I perceive, my lord,
						you have been imposed on, but you shall soon be avenged.” Edward and Adela stand aside looking guilty and exposed, while the
						Baron tries to puzzle out how he might have been “imposed on.” Not suspecting his son’s ruse and unable to determine any
						source of imposition, he follows after De Courcy to “ask whether I ought to be in a passion or not.” The scene closes with
						Adela singing a plaintive love song to Edward, “Love from the heart” (III.i). In referring to the penultimate scene (III.v),
						when “the Baron enters with his sword drawn, and some old armour awkwardly put on,” Genest cites Hannah Cowley’s remarks on Baddeley’s performance: “a
						great actor, holding a sword in his left hand, and making awkward passes with it, charms the audience; and brings down such
						applauses as the bewitching dialogue of Farquhar pants for in vain.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
							Genest, <title level="m">The English Stage</title>, 6:588; Hannah Cowley, Preface, <title level="m">The Town Before You: a Comedy, as
								acted at the Theatre-Royal, Covent Garden</title> (London: Printed by G. Woodfall, for T. N. Longman, 1795), p.
							vi.</note> The implication would seem to be that by some degradation of popular taste, the comedy of gesture has gained an
						unwarranted advantage over the comedy of witty dialogue. The charge is not without truth: Romantic comedy is not particularly
						noted for its clever dialogue, and it does rely frequently on body language, indeed more and more so with the increasing
						popularity of pantomime and melodrama. But this was not a passing phase. The Baron frantically waving his sword still brings
						down the house. Nevertheless it is also true that the dialogue contains a great deal of allusive irony concerning the politics
						of revolution.</p>
                  <p>Although the performers were well cued on pacing their delivery to allow that irony to emerge, many of the potential
						laugh-lines were missed by the student audiences during our four performances at UCLA. The cast and crew were therefore
						pleased and surprised by the much more responsive audience of literary scholars attending the performance on March 9, at the
						41st Annual Comparative Literature Conference, California State University, Long Beach. The success of our performances were
						due entirely to the talent and dedication of the students involved. Gifted singers like Schuyler Hudak as Adela, Kristin
						Crawford as Lady Elinor, and Lauren Cheak as Cicely brought Storace’s score to
						life, and Stephen Pu as vocal director enabled the entire cast to achieve excellence in virtuoso solos as well as complex
						choral pieces.</p>
                  <p>In the final scene (III.vi), Lord William is revealed as rightful Baron of Oakland. He reconciled with De Courcy who
						affirms that no obstacle interferes with his father’s pledge of Lady Elinor’s hand in marriage. Edward is free to marry Adela.
						The comic opera concludes with the first Grand Finale to be performed on a London Stage: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>The banished ills of heretofore</l>
                           <l>At happy distance viewing;</l>

									(III.vi)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> Crucial here is that Lord William exonerates the false Baron of all crimes related to his usurpation and committed
						under his rule. The “happy ending” reconciles French-English animosities and class conflict at the very moment in history,
						immediately following the outbreak of the French Revolution, when these tensions were at a peak. Whether or not the audience
						saw any contemporary relevance in this doctrine of reconciliation, the finale gave an optimistic “feel good” conclusion to a
						comedy of disguise, deceit, and sadistic exploitation.</p>

                  <head>Overview</head>
                  <p>This exercise consists of two parts: a take-home assignment (about 25 minutes), and an in-class movie screening, followed by
						classroom discussion (50 minutes or more). Students are to compare their own seemingly objective responses to John Keats’s 
						“La Belle Dame sans Merci” with filmmaker Hidetoshi Oneda’s short adaptation of the
						poem (for more information, see <ptr target="http://www.celophaine.com/lbdsm/lbdsm_top.html"/>). The aim of the exercise is to
						challenge students’ notions of objectivity, and to make them self-aware readers, thus classroom discussion should emphasize
						the ambiguities of poetic language, and the role of the reader/viewer as co-creator of meaning. Additionally, you might ask
						the students to analyze their own reading practices in comparison with the process of adapting a text for a film.</p>
                  <p>As I have presented it here, the exercise suits introductory major or non-major English courses. Since its primary purpose is
						to help students to appreciate the ostensibly passive act of reading as an active, creative process, it is most useful early
						in the term as a methodological primer. In addition, the exercise can be easily adapted to advanced courses specializing in
						Romanticism. To that end, below, I have suggested how an instructor might connect the themes at hand to other literary and
						generic contexts, with a particular emphasis on Romantic drama.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <ab>For an
								upper-division course, Charles Lamb’s essay “On the Tragedies of Shakespeare” would make for a fine companion-text to this exercise. 
								Lamb states that, in seeing a Shakespeare tragedy
								performed, “we have given up that vantage-ground of abstraction which reading possesses over seeing” (I. 106). Given
								the task at hand, to compare reading and seeing, the generic distinction between our interest in dramatic poetry and
									Lamb’s interest in drama matters very little. This is not to argue that “La Belle
								Dame” confronts the reader with the range of complexities that Lamb notices in <title level="m">Hamlet</title>, but rather to point out similarities in practice as <emph>readers</emph> and
									<emph>seers</emph>, whether of poetry or drama.</ab>
                        <lb/>
                        <ab> An advanced version of this exercise might consider the nature of filmic adaptation in Lamb’s terms: “When the novelty is past,
								we find to our cost that, instead of realising an idea, we have
								only materialised and brought down a fine vision to the standard of flesh and blood. We have let go a dream, in quest
								of an unattainable substance” (I. 98). The students should not be led to a simplistic hierarchy of reading over
									performance—Lamb himself is careful to note that he is “not arguing that Hamlet
								should not be acted, but how much Hamlet is <emph>made another thing</emph> by being acted” (I. 101, my emphasis).
								Instead, they should develop a critique both for and against the idea of performance as transformative and
								simplifying, as detrimental to creative liberty and multidimensionality.</ab>
                        <lb/>
                        <ab> Upper-division students might also explore such concerns about reading and seeing among the writings of other
								Romantic critics. Joanna Baillie considered the unsuitability of her own plays for
								stage performance in her note “To the Reader,” appended to <title level="m">A Series of Plays</title> (1812, also
								included as an appendix in <title level="m">The Broadview Anthology of Romantic Drama,</title> pp. 370-78). 
								Baillie’s argument complements Lamb’s in several
								respects, especially in her emphasis on the limitations of stage-mechanics and the difficulty of communicating emotion
								to an audience in one of London’s vast playhouses. Samuel
									Taylor Coleridge’s lectures on Shakespeare also provide numerous
								points of comparison, most importantly his agreement with Lamb that Shakespeare suffered in performance, thus the ineptitude of modern production
								companies “drove Shakespear[e] from the stage, to find his proper place, in the heart and in the closet” (<title level="m">Lectures</title> I, 563). William Hazlitt went further than Lamb or Coleridge, declaring that “the reader of
								the plays of Shakespeare is almost always disappointed in seeing them acted;
								and, for our own parts, we should never go to see them acted if we could help it” (<title level="m">A View of the
									English Stage</title>, V, 222). (When introducing the subject of Romantic attitudes toward performance vis-à-vis
									Shakespeare, it might be useful to point students to Frederick Burwick’s essay on the subject in the Blackwell <title level="m">Companion
									to Romanticism,</title> edited by Duncan Wu.)</ab>
                        <lb/>
                        <ab>If we choose to point out these similarities underlying the dramatic criticism of Lamb,
									Baillie, Coleridge, and Hazlitt, it makes good sense to spend some time talking about the history of English
								theater, including developments in licensing, bowdlerization (again, Lamb would figure
								prominently), celebrity culture, and leisure activities among the new middle class. The Keats exercise could therefore take on a 
								historical dimension it lacks in its present lower-division form.
								Furthermore, Keats’s own commentary on reading and seeing, his 1817 letter on Edmund Kean
								and “negative capability,” connects well with the themes at hand, and might be employed in tandem with or instead of
								the aforementioned prose writings.</ab>

                  <p>For the first part of the exercise (here conceived as a take-home assignment, though it can be done in-class if time allows)
						students should read Keats’s “La Belle Dame sans Merci” and respond to questions on a handout.
						For the exercise to be most effective they should read the poem, put away their books, and then respond to the questions, thus
						referring back not to the text itself, but to their memories of it. Admittedly, this is a ruse: students relying on their
						memories are likely to conflate their own subjective contributions to the poem with textual details, and this conflation is
						the impetus for the second part of the exercise. This portion takes about 25 minutes.</p>
                  <p>The second part of the exercise is based on an in-class screening of the short film (runtime approx. 15 min). Students should
						be attentive to Oneda’s creative liberties with Keats’s poem. After the screening the students
						should take a few minutes to review their own responses to the handout, comparing their answers with Oneda’s interpretation.
						Consider beginning the discussion by asking them how <title level="m">Oneda</title> would have responded to the handout
						questions.</p>
                  <p>Ask the students if they thought that Oneda’s handling of Keats’s poem was “faithful” or “loose.”
						Have them identify both obvious and subtle variations between the poem and the film. Oneda’s directorial choices are in many
						instances quite startling, and the students will inevitably mention his liberties with the kinds of details they worked
						through in their handouts, particularly the age and appearance of the knight, and the identity of the first speaker. At this
						point, shift the discussion back to the text of the poem, perhaps even reading it aloud, and emphasize Keats’s evasive use of descriptive detail. 
						Have the students share their responses from the handout questions, and
						ask them to find strong textual support for them. In most cases, they will find sufficient ambiguity in Keats’s poem to support Oneda’s choices with as much 
						(or as little) stability as their own. This revelation should
						energize a discussion of reading as a creative act, even reading in its most apparently objective guise. If time permits, you
						might briefly discuss the semantic distinctions between an “adaptation” and an “interpretation.” Which term applies to Oneda’s
						film, and which term applies to the act of reading?</p>
                  <p>Note: as laid out here, this exercise primarily addresses Keats’s poem <emph>vis-à-vis</emph> the
						practice and phenomenology of reading and dramatic interpretation, not as a Romantic text in all of its historical and textual
						glory. Below, I offer a few brief thoughts on what implications the exercise might have for our understanding of, and perhaps
						an extended classroom discussion about, Keats’s poem itself.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <ab>Much has been made of the 
							fact that “La Belle Dame sans Merci” exists in two states, the 1820 <title level="j">Indicator</title> text, beginning “Ah what can ail thee, wretched wight,” and the better known 1848 Charles Brown
								text, beginning “Oh what can ail thee, knight-at-arms.” Scholars will always debate over which version—if either—ought
								to be seen as definitive. While the nuances of publication history and textual variants might not enliven classroom
								discussion, the concerns about authority they raise can do so. The present exercise, with its emphasis on the
								collaborative nature of reading, calls into question the function of textual-authority and authorial-textuality, and
								enables, even at the undergraduate level, a discussion of the relative merits of Formalist and Historicist approaches.
								Are we reading Keats’s poem or a poem by Keats, belatedly
								inflected (perhaps first by a slightly older Keats, then) by Leigh Hunt or Charles Brown
								or Richard Milnes, then by ourselves or perhaps by Hidetoshi Oneda? This is fairly well-trodden theoretical ground,
								but it is especially apt with respect to the textual history of “La Belle Dame” and the potential of this exercise to
								problematize authorial and readerly intention and mediation.</ab>
                        <lb/>
                        <ab>As Jerome McGann, Theresa Kelley, and others have
								shown, “La Belle Dame” proposes a number of ambiguities—and its textual history only compounds these ambiguities—but
								this is not so much a problem as it is a provocation. Is it “merci” or “mercy,” “wild wild eyes” or “wild sad eyes”?
								It is, of course, all of the above, and therein lies not only the appeal of Keats’s
								poem(s) but also the immediacy of McGann’s early appeal for historical method.
								Moreover, the poem’s internal ambiguities, as outlined in the exercise (and present in either version of the poem),
								reinforce Kelley’s persuasive argument that “‘La Belle Dame sans Merci’ explores the
								value of poetic figures whose meaning is not intuited but learned” (333). This is not to claim a unique status for “La
								Belle Dame,” but to suggest that, more insistently than many other works, it is a poem that invites and rewards
								analysis of its own processing (both of its production and its reception).</ab>
                        <lb/>
                        <ab>All of this is to say that the exercise can and ideally does illustrate that “La Belle Dame” embraces narrative and
								linguistic indeterminacy, so that an ostensibly “loose” adaptation such as Oneda’s can be, all the same, just as
								“faithful” as any other interpretation. Having used the exercise to highlight this aspect of the poem, one seems
								well-situated to teach his or her students about how “La Belle Dame” connects with “negative capability,” Romantic
								irony, the ballad revival, Romantic subjectivity, and many other topics, themes and theories that usually inform our
								discussions of the period.</ab>

                  </ab>
                  <p>Director Hidetoshi Oneda’s <title level="m">La Belle Dame sans Merci</title> evinces his keen familiarity not only with Keats’s poem, but
						with many other canonical works and conventions of Romantic literature. Keats’s ballad guides the storyline of the film: a lovelorn knight, abandoned on a hillside,
						recollects his encounter with an unforgiving, wild-eyed lady. But Oneda places the knight’s tale within a narrative frame akin
						to that of <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, or <title level="m">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</title>, and like Mary Shelley and Samuel Taylor Coleridge,
						Oneda employs this framing technique to gain moral perspective on his story. Whereas the speaker of the first three stanzas in
							Keats’s poem is an ambiguous voice, all provocation with no discernible means of registering
						and responding to the story he or she provokes, in the film the speaker is embodied as the unwitting pupil—Shelley’s Walton, or Coleridge’s wedding
						guest—here re-imagined as a shipwrecked English navigator. The navigator, deposited on a desert island, finds the ancient and
						haggard knight, and is transfixed (and transformed) by his story. Oneda dramatizes the knight’s memories, presenting the belle
						dame as the archetypal Romantic <emph>femme fatale</emph>. Like Geraldine or Lamia, her seductive exterior belies a cold,
						reptilian nature. Still, her wickedness is avoided at a cost: in Oneda’s film, the lady represents the ideal for which each of
						us must make a great sacrifice upon faith, lest we end our lives like the knight, stranded, with only regret to sustain us. In
						fact, after the knight tells his tale of destiny unfulfilled, he dies and disintegrates before the navigator’s eyes, leaving
						the younger man sadder, wiser, and with a renewed commitment to his own dream: to be an artist. The <emph>kunstleroman</emph>
						concludes with a close-up shot of the navigator being rescued, a sparkle of creative determination in his eyes.</p>
                  <p>This is, of course, the work of a director playing fast-and-loose with his literary source. However, Keats’s “La Belle Dame sans Merci” is a 
						sparsely detailed poem that relies upon a communal knowledge of medieval
						romantic tropes and ballad traditions, thus each reader must provide his or her own cultural capital as flesh for a skeletal
						story. If Oneda’s version is a bit fleshier than some, still there is little in Keats’s poem that
						undermines his interpretation. </p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Responses to the handout:</head>
                  <p>[Note: I did not have access to the students' responses until after the in-class screening and discussion; my point in
						presenting the responses here, before recounting the classroom discussion, is to offer a summary of the exercise from the
						students’ perspective.] In responding to the first handout question, the students generally agreed that the knight was
						“dejected,” and “distraught.” They tended to portray his paleness and feverishness as that of a young man “prematurely
						aged”—according to one student “he resembles a dying flower, once young and vibrant, but now decaying [as if] nature has
						turned its back on him.” In their drawings the students tended to depict a small armor-clad figure dwarfed by his
						surroundings. In one way or another, nearly all of the students described a “physically strong man that has obviously been
						emotionally broken.” None of the students described the knight as aged or moribund (as does Oneda); instead they concentrated
						on the mental and emotional toll of his experience. One student likened the knight’s trauma to that of the survivors of 9/11:
						“like the extreme shock people experience after a terrorist attack.”</p>
                  <p>The 9/11 example is a good indicator of the extent to which each student made the poem personal. But even conventional
						medievalist renderings of the knight were drawn from within: after all, Keats’s description of
						the knight is little more than a fragmentary <emph>blason</emph> on a tormented face. Bodily, the knight loiters alone, but
						his face is our only index of his physical and mental attributes: it is pale, haggard, woeful, clammy, feverish, blushing. He
						is a “knight at arms” (or a “wretched wight”), but to envision a handsome man in the prime of his life wearing a (perhaps
						disheveled) suit of armor is to provide a chivalric archetype in the place of a few vague details. Although my students were
						more familiar with Tolkien than with Spenser, from their descriptions and drawings it was clear that they had melded Keats’s language 
						with their own preconceptions of medieval knights.</p>
                  <p>

						dust.</p>
                  <p>The second question elicited mixed but intriguing responses. Of the eighteen students participating, only five suggested that the
						first speaker of Keats’s poem is unidentifiable—an “omniscient voice,” “perhaps Keats himself.” Of that group, three went on to conjecture
						that this unidentifiable voice conveys a
						sense of sympathy in the act of questioning. In total, “sympathetic” “concerned” and “compassionate” turn up in eleven of the
						students' responses, whether describing an anonymous voice, a “stranger,” a “physician,” “another knight at arms,” or—the most
						popular response—the belle dame herself. Six students shared this idea, mostly without further justification, though one
						student ventured, “she [the belle dame] is a supernatural existence that is contacting him again after not taking him ‘beyond’
						[…] She allows him to ‘wake up’ and she is narrating to him to help him psychologically grasp what happened.” This tendency
						among the students to reach after ethical fact and reason deserves greater attention, but suffice to say it is another
						imposition of the reader on the text. </p>

                  <p>The third question divided the class. Roughly half of the students felt that the lady represented neither good nor evil; they
						resisted reading her as an allegorical figure or as a type, instead envisioning her as a human character with interiority and
						a personal history. “She might know the power she possesses, but it is not necessarily a bad thing,” one student suggested.
						Five students shared the idea that the lady had a distressing history of her own (a history that motivated her behavior in the
						poem), and one student even went so far as to compare the lady with Dickens’s Miss Havisham, “heartbroken, betrayed, and so
						grief-stricken by a man in her past that she spends all her time seeking revenge on every man she encounters.” This group
						tended to ignore the title of the poem, although one student did remark that “sans merci” was the knight’s judgment, and not a
						universal reproach. On the whole, they saw the lady as a “free spirit,” not as a <emph>femme fatale</emph>.</p>
                  <p>The other half of the class endorsed the titular view of the lady “without mercy,” and dedicated no time to ascribing a motive
						for her “seduction” of the knight. In fact, this group tended to grant the lady no interiority at all, seeing her
						allegorically either as pure evil (“she eats these men’s hearts and spits them out”) or as emblematic of a concept such as the
						debased “passion of men,” or war (“Warriors, knights, and kings are her victims, after all”). While students on both sides of
						the question noted that the lady never speaks for herself—“she is only characterized through the knight’s words”—this fact did
						not seem to pose any problems for them in addressing the handout question (it became problematic when discussing the film; see
						below).</p>

                  <head>Screening and discussion:</head>
                  <p>When we screened the film in class, the students were quick to note Oneda’s contributions to Keats’s story, especially his
						addition of a fourth character (the navigator survives the shipwreck with an ailing,
						alcoholic ship’s physician who dies within the first few minutes; this character is likely a conjecture as to what the
						apothecary Keats might have amounted to, had he not become a poet and a consumptive). The
						enthusiasm with which they noted and critiqued these differences between the poem and the film, even while the screening was
						underway, boded well for the more nuanced discussion to follow. After the screening, I gave the class five minutes to reflect
						on their own responses to the handout questions, and to consider Oneda’s implied responses to the same questions, given his
						handling of the poem.</p>
                  <p>We opened the discussion by reviewing the first issue from the handout, the description of the knight. The students were
						unanimous in voicing their surprise (both approving and disapproving) at Oneda’s decision to cast the knight as an old man—and
						within seconds, a student noted the similarity to Coleridge’s <title level="m">Ancient Mariner</title>, which we had read earlier. By depicting the knight as elderly, one student contended, Oneda gave
						the character an air of wisdom and experience, a superior position from which to impart a moral lesson to the young navigator:
						“do as I say, not as I have done.” Another student suggested that the casting choice made the knight seem feeble or senile,
						and that his story was somehow less convincing and reliable because of the amount of time elapsed since the events related.
						(Not surprisingly, both of these arguments had also informed our discussion of Coleridge.)</p>
                  <p>I asked the class if they thought this directorial choice was unfaithful to Keats’s poem or merely
						an interpretation made possible by the poem’s ambiguities. A number of students quickly answered that Oneda had strayed from
							Keats’s text; no one disagreed, though I noticed many thoughtful stares. We opened our books
						and I read through the stanzas in which Keats offers descriptive details of the knight:
							<quote>“palely,” “haggard,” “woe-begone,” “a lily on thy brow,” “with anguish moist and fever dew”; “on thy cheeks a
							fading rose / withereth,”</quote> We agreed that none of these details explicitly tells us the knight’s age, or anything
						substantial about him beyond the expressiveness and sickliness of his face. I suggested that, for all Keats tells us, the knight could be 
						three feet tall with one eye and no teeth, wearing a ball gown and army boots.
						Within the vast realm of <emph>possibility</emph> (ignoring, for the moment, the smaller realm of <emph>probability</emph>)
						Oneda’s version of the knight actually seemed approximate to their own envisioning; but where did the students’ and Oneda’s
						ideas about the knight come from? Not from the text of “La Belle Dame” itself, I assured them.</p>
                  <p>This appeared to be a disturbing proposition for many of them, and the room fell silent for a minute. I decided to move through
						the other two handout questions in short order, to leave more time at the end of class for a discussion of the implications of
						the exercise. The next handout question, involving the first speaker of the poem, drew mixed responses (I did not yet know the
						variety of explanations the question had elicited). It was generally agreed that Oneda’s invention of the navigator (or
						rather, his distillation of the poem’s narrator into the navigator), and his employment of a frame narrative, distorted the
						content and form of Keats’s poem. This agreement took a few minutes to materialize among a group
						of students now wary of my evidently deceptive questions. But even looking at the text, it seemed difficult to find anything
						defensible in Oneda’s handling of the poem’s first speaker.</p>
                  <p>I asked the students to tell me how <emph>they</emph> had responded to the question—if not a stranded ship’s navigator, who
							<emph>was</emph> the first speaker? Reluctantly, a few students shared their ideas: one said she thought the speaker was
						the belle dame, and I saw a few nods of affirmation to this. Another student replied that the first speaker was anonymous and
						indistinguishable, and she said that Oneda could just as easily have done away with such a character altogether, since he/she
						makes no difference to the plot of the poem (after instigating it). At this, a number of students voiced disagreement, and
						shared more ideas about who the first speaker was. But with each additional suggestion came the renewed assertion from all
						corners of the room, that we simply cannot identify the speaker. To identify the speaker, one student said, was a temptation
						for the reader—and for someone making a film from the poem, it is a temptation that must be indulged. In other words, Oneda
						was compelled by the exigencies of filmmaking to “over-interpret” the poem in order to make it a comprehensible story. The
						student argued that as readers we do the same thing, but we can leave the identities of characters less resolved in our minds,
						remaining comfortable with ambiguity. Such ambiguity is difficult to convey in a film. (It seems that, after seeing the movie,
						at least a few of the students became more negatively capable.)</p>
                  <p>While I was thrilled to see an emerging correlation between active reading and filmmaking, I decided to lead the discussion to
						the third and final handout question, the characterization of the lady. Again, as I would learn when I collected their
						responses, this question split the class down the middle, some characterizing the lady as a “free spirit,” others as an “evil
						temptress.” Though I had chosen the first two “objective” questions in order to emphasize the amount of
							<emph>subjective</emph> judgment needed to answer them, with this more obviously interpretive question, I had a different
						goal. Since the knight characterizes the lady and her actions, she is, in a sense, a text-within-a-text, and one that comes to
						us pre-interpreted, refracted through the knight’s own convictions and (perhaps) misjudgments. Nevertheless, in my experience
						teaching this poem, students rarely consider the possibility of the knight as an unreliable narrator. Even when they notice
						that the lady never speaks for herself, they do not usually propose that the knight is a dubious—even downright
						bad—interpreter or relater of his own experience. These issues of fallible narration (often familiar to the students as a
						convention of the dramatic monologue, from Chaucer’s <title level="m">Canterbury Tales</title> or Browning’s “My Last Duchess”
						at least) greatly enrich a reading of “La Belle Dame,” and I was interested to see how Oneda’s film might or might not
						influence the students’ awareness of such narrative complications.</p>
                  <p>Usually, when I teach this poem, I note lines 19 and 27-28 as instances at which the knight’s judgment must be scrutinized.
						“She look’d at me <emph>as</emph> she did love,” can mean either that she looked at the knight <emph>while</emph> she loved
						him, or that she looked at the knight <emph>as if</emph> she loved him, in which case the knight has made a questionable
						observation, and one that the lady’s actions later in the poem seem to undermine. Similarly, the phrase “sure in language
						strange she said— / I love thee true,” hinges on our understanding of the word <emph>sure</emph>: it might imply that the lady
						said “I love thee true” <emph>surely</emph>, with confidence. Alternatively, the word might stand in for equivocal phrasing
						like <emph>I am sure that</emph> or <emph>to be sure</emph>, in which case the knight is casting doubt on his ability to
						translate the lady’s “language strange,” even as he claims self-assurance. </p>
                  <p>Oneda does a fine job with these ambiguities. As the ancient knight tells his tale to the navigator in voiceover, the
						flashback-story comes to life on the screen. For the most part, during this voiceover, the young knight and the lady
						communicate through meaningful glances, without spoken language. But at the exact moment when the ancient knight recounts the
						cryptic declaration of love (“I could not understand her words, but I am sure she said, ‘I love thee true’”), the lady in the
						flashback actually speaks a few words of unintelligible non-language, suggesting the fallibility of the knight’s translation.
						I wanted to see how the students reacted to this dramatization of one of the poem’s subtler elements. Would it change the way
						they interpreted the poem?</p>
                  <p>As we reviewed the handout question, the students who shared their responses were those who believed the lady was motivated by
						neither good nor evil, the “free spirit” group (as I would later label them). None of the <emph>femme fatale</emph> group
						volunteered their thoughts. Indeed, when I asked if anyone in the class felt that the lady was motivated by revenge or hatred,
						a student raised his hand and said that he had thought so after reading the poem, but not after seeing the film. A number of
						his classmates nodded consensually. I asked them why. Two students replied that Oneda’s film made them think that the lady
						represented a positive concept (“ambition” and “creativity”), and that the fault lies not in the lady, but in the knight’s
						inability to commit to her. “Does the knight really understand her?” I asked.</p>
                  <p>A number of hands went up immediately. The students had appreciated Oneda’s use of voiceover narration to convey ambiguity,
						and—to my delight—they noted the same ambiguity in lines 27-28 of the poem without my prompting. One of them suggested that
						the knight in the film was an unreliable narrator. I asked if the same might be said of the knight in Keats’s poem, and
						the overwhelming response was “yes.” “It was way more obvious in the movie, though,” one student
						added. I told her to hang onto that thought.</p>
                  <p>With the three handout questions laid out before us, we now had two big issues to consider: from the first question, the issue
						of <emph>where our visual ideas of the knight came from</emph>; from the second and third questions, the issue of <emph>the
							differences between reading a text and adapting it for a film</emph>. Fifteen minutes remained in the class period.</p>
                  <p>I introduced the first issue in a broad context. If our conception of the knight in the poem is not drawn from the poem itself,
						then it is coming from some other source or sources—what does this suggest about reading? Is it an individual or communal (and
						cumulative) process? Is it an active or passive engagement with a text? I established these questions as the basis for our
						discussion, then I asked a more finite question: “when you addressed the first prompt on the handout (before seeing the film)
						did you think it was an objective or subjective question?” The response, predictably, was that they had thought of the
						question as “more on the objective side,” though they now realized the problems with this conclusion. “
							Keats doesn’t tell us what the knight looks like, or the lady. It’s like we have to picture them in our heads as
						we read.” After some more discussion, another student added, “even the most basic details in this poem—we have to create
						them.” I suggested, then, that reading—especially reading a poem like this one—is an active process in which the reader fills
						in a lot of gaps, often without realizing that he or she has done so. </p>
                  <p>A student admitted that when he reads novels he “casts” certain Hollywood actors in the characters’ roles. In some way, I said,
						we all do this. Didn’t we cast the knight, if not with a specific actor, at least with our idea of what knights are
							<emph>supposed</emph> to look like? On both a conscious and subconscious level, we are constantly integrating the
						information we get from the text we are reading (whether a sparsely detailed poem like this, or a richly detailed realist
						novel) with information we already have. Being aware of, and analyzing this synthetic process, I argued, makes us sharper,
						more sophisticated readers and critics.</p>
                  <p>We talked about this a little more, in reference to other texts we had read (and again, Coleridge loomed large in the discussion). 
						By way of analogy, someone mentioned the great difference between
						reading a play and seeing it performed. I explained that this was not a distinction lost on the Romantics (a few of the
						students had, in fact, read Lamb’s essay on the topic in a Shakespeare course). In the remaining time, I turned to the 
						comparison of reading and filmic adaptation.</p>
                  <p>I began, “Someone mentioned that the possibility of seeing the knight as an unreliable narrator was ‘more obvious in the
						movie.’ Why?” A few students replied that “seeing it [the poem] visualized made it more obvious.” Again I asked why, and was
						met with silence. I offered more: “In the film, you tended to notice the moment when the knight interprets—probably
							<emph>misinterprets</emph>—the lady’s words, ‘I love you.’ But this moment is there in the text too. Specifically, what
						made this moment stand out in the film, more so than in the poem?” I suggested that the answer might be somehow related to the
						just-mentioned differences between reading and watching Shakespeare. A student answered
						that Oneda had decided to make this issue important in his film, and that was why he used the voiceover technique. “Good,” I
						said, “as with his use of the navigator as the first speaker in the poem, Oneda makes a series of interpretive choices in his
						film. We’ve mentioned that we like to ‘cast’ actors in the mental performances of our readings—so let me ask you this: is what
						Oneda does in adapting Keats’s poem for a movie different from or similar to what we do in
						reading the poem on our own? Indeed, is there a big difference between reading—what we might call interpretation—and adapting?
						Or is all reading adaptation?”</p>
                  <p>With time running out, I left them with this question. This had been a lively discussion, and the questions it raised
						(especially this last one) were recurrent throughout the quarter. After this exercise I found it much easier to move beyond
						plot-level discussions of texts to meta-commentaries on the practice of reading and the dynamics of interpretation. The
						knight’s superimposition of his own desires upon the lady’s “language strange” became a cautionary example for us as critical
						readers. I worried that I would need to explain further: the point was <emph>not</emph> that no right or wrong way to read a
						text existed and that reading was an entirely subjective experience. But the students understood: they were generally prepared
						to critique their assumptions, and to consider elisions and lacunae in literary texts as rhetorical strategies. They were more
						aware of the dimensions of their personal involvement in the act of reading—that is, aware that reading is by definition a
						co-creative endeavor. I believe that I also succeeded in helping the students to appreciate filmic adaptation as a means of
						literary criticism, in which a director makes an argument about a text through a series of interpretive choices.</p>

               <p>Several years ago I offered a graduate seminar in Romantic period drama, basing my choice of plays on Jeffrey Cox and Michael Gamer’s <title level="m">Broadview Anthology of Romantic Drama</title>, which had recently appeared, as well as Peter Duthie’s edition of
						Joanna Baillie’s <title level="m">Plays on the Passions</title>.<hi rendition="#sup">
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors">Jeffrey N. Cox and Michael Gamer, <title level="m">Broadview Anthology of Romantic Drama</title> (Peterborough, Ontario: Broadview Press, 2003); 
							Joanna Baillie, <title level="m">Plays on the Passions</title>, ed. Peter
							Duthie (Peterborough, Ontario: Broadview Press, 2001).</note>
                  </hi> I wanted to offer a broad range of plays to span the sublime-ridiculous axis within a fairly tight time span. My focus was
					on the material conditions of playwriting, acting, and even attending theatres during the period, with less attention given to the
					difficulties of producing a play and of doing so within physically challenging work spaces.<hi rendition="#sup">
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors">My thanks to the superb graduate students in this seminar, especially but not only
							Christian Pulver, Elizabeth Thompson, Michael Neubeck and David Rogers.</note>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p> Our mandate for the course was to consider Romantic-period London theatres to be the
					central cultural institution of the day. I present the genre of drama to my students by explaining that plays, whether written to
					be performed or to be read as “mental theatre,” were used to work through key issues of the day, and that letters and memoirs of
					the time often represented thoughts and behavior as if dramatized. Novels frequently contained references to the theatre or
					specific plays, and occasionally included scenes of amateur playacting in order to make social commentary. Playwrights and poets
					wanted to stage contemporary issues in visible confrontations, whether of politics (revolution versus maintaining the status quo,
					Whigs versus Tories, Parliament versus the monarchy); national identity (patriotism versus Jacobinism, British culture versus
					colonial culture, abolition versus the slave economy); and/or gender relations (feminism versus patriarchy, the marriage market,
					family structure). We also considered how theatres were managed, the difficulties facing playwrights who had only three main
					theatres to submit their work to, and how people used the theatre auditorium as a way to stage their own social performance. </p>
               <p>Finally, we attempted to understand an audience experience so different from our own in which, for earlier Romantic plays,
					performances were held in lighted rather than darkened theatres. Sputtering candlewax, the heat generated by hundreds of candles
					and spectators, and the constant movement of lighting attendants only added to the confusion created by those audience members
					more concerned to display themselves or to visit their friends than to watch the actors on stage. Toward the end of the period
					enlarged theatres meant actors were too distant to hear well while the still brightly lit audience space made the stage hard to
					see as well. We were forced to reconsider the normative high value given to text-based literature, and to read these plays
					differently: to read them as staged, to appreciate each genre by its own terms, and to hear the confusion and hubbub that
					surrounded these plays as part of their cultural value. I wanted us to study representative plays of the period, from tragedies
					and sentimental comedies to melodrama and closet dramas, while paying attention to dramatic form and representation. Of course,
					this aspect of our discussions always spiraled into content analysis as students became engaged with characters’ struggles rather
					than the issues such fictions are meant to embody, but we tried to constantly remind ourselves of the material conditions
					surrounding dramatic production. </p>
               <p> We approached our topic through articles by key scholars in the field and relevant websites, and students were excited by
					how challenging the theoretical tools were that scholars use to analyze these plays, and yet how much fun people were having
					creating websites to document the material culture of late eighteenth-century and early nineteenth-century theatres and
					performances. With this discovery another set of <emph>x-y</emph> axes began to appear over the framework I had structured for the
					course of a sublime-ridiculous <emph>y-</emph>axis cut by a historical <emph>x-</emph>axis, each intersection providing a key to a
					cultural moment. We now had a multi-level coordinate system in which the <emph>x-y </emph>axis of history cut by genre was
					overlaid with an <title level="m">x-</title>axis of materiality cut by a <emph>y-</emph>axis of theory. Added to these
					coordinating vectors was our own axial supplement of difficulty cut by enjoyment. Difficulty was articulated by genre and theory;
					pleasure by history and materiality. As with any supplement, our own vectors held more truth-value for us. Out of the students’
					engagement with supplementary materials, the intersections of difficulty and pleasure began to chart our understanding and
					reconstruction of Romantic drama and stagecraft. It was not that the sublime and the difficult were synchronized against the
					ridiculous and pleasure, but rather that both the sublime and ridiculous were modulated by the cultural moment while pleasure
					showed us when difficulty was valuable and when it only interfered in our historical reconstruction. We learned to read more into
					the contradiction between the difficulty of a woman learning her craft while knowing the danger to her reputation for traveling to
					theatres alone at night—or, if her play was being staged, for staying alone with the dramatic company during rehearsals—and the
					fact that women wrote some of the most hilarious domestic comedies of the late eighteenth century. No longer could breeches parts
					and gender-bending be taken as anything other than social commentary, but we laughed all the harder at the jokes, mistakes, and
					misunderstandings that ensued from such masquerades. The axial pairs shifted and adjusted as we went, creating ways to chart our
					entrée into Romantic theatricality and its peculiar relation to British Romantic culture. </p>
               <p>Our range of plays reflected both sets of axial descriptors: we went from the sit-coms of the day, such as 
					Hannah Cowley’s <title level="m">A Bold Stroke for a Husband</title> (1783) and Elizabeth Inchbald’s <title level="m">Every One Has His Fault</title> (1793), to the
					high tragic art of Joanna Baillie’s <title level="m">Plays on the Passions</title>
					(1798) and Shelley’s <title level="m">The Cenci</title> (1819); from the
					orientalism of George Colman the Younger’s <title level="m">Blue-Beard; or, Female Curiosity!</title> (1798) to the absurdity of
					his burlesque <title level="m">Quadrupeds of Quedlinburgh</title> (1811). Our scholarly framing came from Catherine Burroughs’<title level="m"> Women in British Romantic

                  </hi> Comparing a closet drama to an afterpiece was instructive, since in both forms questions of gender can be treated more
					ambiguously than in the hard give-and-take of domestic comedy or the dire consequences of tragedy. <title level="m">Blue-Beard</title>’s melodramatic hippodrama with a gothically bleeding “Blue Chamber” used a different kind of specularity
					from Byron’s, with live horses instead of ethereal spirits, and a
					Turkish locale instead of Byron’s alpine sublime. Its fairy tale
					treatment of women’s subject-status and their right to knowledge provided a greater gender critique than did Manfred’s mysterious
					soul-mate Astarte whose absent presence haunts the play, yet whose unverifiable life and death settles the focus squarely on
					Manfred and his hallucinatory world. </p>
               <p>Thomas John Dibdin’s pantomime <title level="m">Harlequin and Humpo; or, Columbine by Candlelight!</title> (1812) was our

					issues raised in the plays we had already read; in hindsight,<title level="m"> Harlequin and Humpo</title> provides the real key
					to our experience of the course. On the one hand, its inclusion in the Broadview anthology and in my syllabus demanded that we
					take it seriously; on the other hand, as social satire its antics lack the deeper cuts of Voltaire’s satiric plays or even Inchbald’s domestic comedies. 
					But I wanted to take seriously Jeffrey Cox’s questioning of long-held claims that melodrama caused the death of
					tragedy or foreshadowed modern drama<hi rendition="#sup">
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors">“Melodramatic realisms, Romantic virtualities,” pre-conference lecture for NASSR 2006
							at Purdue University.</note>
                  </hi>, and I also wanted to parse pantomime with both forms to find how the melodrama of everyday life rewrote the tragedy of
					history by allowing theatre-goers to simply have fun. </p>
               <p>For my students I wanted to pose the question of how pantomime changes the understanding we had been developing of Romantic
					performance: was Dibdin’s play a devolution or a critique? Historically, the pantomime was first performed as a Christmas
					pantomime at Drury Lane, 26 December 1812, the year that saw the Luddite bill in Parliament for capital punishment against
					framebreakers, and Byron’s maiden speech; the second year of the
					Regency amid George III’s increasing insanity; and Napoleon’s invasion and then retreat from Moscow. It was a year of chaos and
					madness, at the same time endowed with the Regency’s characteristic high-spirits and playfulness. Dibdin’s mishmash of genres
					captures the year’s contradictory aspects and sense of tumult. Its subtitle indicates mystery and revelation, surely also a hint
					at the unknowns to come regarding Napoleon, worker unrest, abolition and its effect on the sugar trade. Moreover, after the debut
					just a month later, January 23, 1813, of Coleridge’s tragedy <title level="m">Remorse: A Tragedy, in Five Acts</title>, it was often double-billed with Dibdin’s play as the afterpiece, surely a
					sign of the despair these unknowns could unfold. That was our first set of axial coordinates: 1812 cut by a harlequinade. </p>
               <p>Our second set of axes confronted the materiality of putting on this bizarre performance (and wondering why it could be
					staged when <title level="m">Manfred</title> could not) cut by Bakhtin’s theory of the carnevalesque, but also theories of how
					theatre reflected revolution and war, and how women playwrights were losing out to male writers. Although 
					Joanna Baillie’s third volume of plays was also published in 1812, this did not
					signal success for women dramaturges since her dramas were for the most part read rather than performed. If the pairing of <title level="m">Remorse </title>with <title level="m">Harlequin and Humpo </title>contradicts the theory that serious dramaturgy
					suffered under the popularity of the ridiculous, the closeting of Baillie’s plays
					does suggest a silencing of female voices, if not of tragedy itself. Columbine gained new significance in this comparative, and we
					wondered at the significance of her being closeted by the evil witch Owletta, and her forced marriage to the deformed Humpino.
					Finally, we were faced with the axes of difficulty and pleasure: a theatrical that is highly historicized, ephemeral, and
					non-transcendent that nonetheless made us laugh. How it did so became the puzzle to unpack, since understanding that allowed us
					back into plays we’d read earlier to see if our intellectual enjoyment there could now take on a more sincere pleasure in plays
					that are likewise historically situated and culturally distant, if closer to our standards of taste and literary norms. </p>
               <p n="10">The full title of Dibdin’s play is <title level="m">Sketch of the New Melo-Dramatick Comick Pantomime called Harlequin and
						Humpo; or, Columbine by Candlelight! </title>The reviews at first trashed it, yet it ran forty-eight nights and was, like
						<title level="m">Blue-Beard,</title> one of the great successes of its genre. Dibdin had an even freer rein with his pen than
					Colman since he began his career as an actor and writer for Sadler’s Wells, and also wrote for other secondary theatres before
					moving to Covent Garden and finally becoming manager of Drury Lane and then Surrey Theatre. If tragedy provides the sublime and
					Gothic yields the grotesque, pantomime gives us the ridiculous. How might the ridiculous provide the underside of the sublime? How
					might it reveal the Gothic as pretentious artifice rather than psychological insight? How could we make sense, in other words, of
					Regency humor? The pantomime’s origins in Italian <emph>commedia dell’arte</emph>, with its puppet-like character types,
					improvisational style, and slapstick orientation make it appear childish and rustic rather than sophisticated, but could we read
					it another way? In preparation for our last seminar meeting I gave the students background material on the <emph>commedia
						dell’arte</emph>, its importation into northern Europe and Britain, and the similar stylized use of character in the more
					recently imported opera. We needed to dig underneath stereotyped characters and set scenes to understand why audiences would have
					found these familiar formulae pleasurable, and how playwrights might motivate such characters and scenes for social critique. How
					might interruptive “laugh” devices increase emotional distance in order to make a point as much as to augment audience hilarity?
					How might absurd plot devices make us rethink our own lives and life trajectories? These together with the play’s unsparing use of
					mistaken identity and pantomimic features captured some of the saturnalian qualities of earlier British traditions surrounding
					Christmas, I told my students, when lords and peasants threw protocol to the winds for a few topsy-turvy hours. But the saturnalia
					was always already social commentary, a chance for the oppressed to turn rage to laughter. The difficulty lay in how to decode the
					laughter, how to understand the violence underlying Regency tastes in elite <emph>and</emph> bawdy subjects and acts.</p>
               <p> The pantomime always began with a ballet that describes a fairy tale set-piece, followed by a mid-scene centered on a fairy
					character such as Mother Goose, and ending with the harlequinade. All three sections were accompanied by music or had musical
					interludes when actors broke out into song, and music was always played during processionals. Music provided one of our biggest
					material difficulties: although the words are usually, but not always, recorded in scripts, typically there is no notation or
					indication of how the music would have sounded. Students were better able to imagine the pantomimed scenes from their familiarity
					with mime artists today, but they had trouble reconstructing the visual effects of this play’s pantomimic elements, as well as the
					aural effects of its sound technologies. In this case the ridiculous was cut both by history and by materiality; theory came to
					our historical aid in the guise of Bakhtin’s theory of the carnevalesque, which I had briefly introduced earlier in the semester,
					and once students made the connection some enlightening self-ridicule took place. We realized we had been reading at once too
					superficially and too deeply—frustrated at finding no meaning, we couldn’t see the meaning in front of us. Having got this far, we
					still needed help understanding the material aspects of the harlequinade. Nevertheless, we began to enjoy Harlequin and
					Columbine’s misadventures, chronicled through the series of improbable plots disastrously entangled, checked, and plied through
					with difficulties created by plotting maids, parasites and duplicitous characters, child-snatchers, braggarts and simpletons, to
					say nothing of mistaken identity and other plot interventions. We had to tell ourselves to let go of plot motivation, sequencing
					logic, and interpretive subtlety, but we also had to learn to look for layers of meaning, connections between the performance
					sections, and cultural significance. </p>
               <p> A peculiar quality of the pantomime is its exploitation of the stage’s visual conventions; this created another hurdle for
					students trained in the play-as-text, but also opened the door to understanding the material conditions of the performance.
					Dramatic productions usually submerge the artificiality of stage representation beneath the accepted norms for symbolic space,
					character stability, disguise, temporal movement, and role portrayal. Audience compliance with these norms generates expectations
					that playwrights and actors will adhere to certain formal and representational models. Like today’s cartoons, pantomime sets out
					to subvert these models, conventions and rules at every opportunity, an intention already encoded in its use of scenes as the
					principle unit rather than acts subdivided by scenes. Cartooning, then, offered us our first ‘theoretical’ intervention in
					understanding materiality. In our discussion of <title level="m">Harlequin and Humpo </title>students began to point out in
					particular the metacommentary at work in puns on visuality as the layers of the visual and the staged, of what we see and what we
					allow ourselves to see, become the interference factor in our understanding of everyday life. It is a factor that the play makes
					all too visible; it was easy for students to come up with examples of near-equal ridiculousness from our own political stage to
					the social drama of celebrity lives. </p>
               <p> A scene that quickly became central to our discussion was that made by a dumb show during a chase scene set in London’s market streets.
					Although it is morning, the Clown steals a telescope from the
					optician’s shop and uses it to view the just risen moon. After several musical pieces accompany more movement on stage, the Clown
					resumes his play with the telescope at which “the figures disappear and one like the Clown takes their place.” In the next musical
					piece “Presto. Harlequin from a window waves his sword. The telescope changes to a gun, goes off, shoots the Clown, who shams
					dead,” but when the gunsmith claims his gun “Harlequin enters, pursued, &amp; leaps through one Eye of the Spectacles at the
					Opticians. Clown in following leaps through the other and their faces appear (painted) thro’ each eye of the [Spectacles], which
					fall down like a yoke upon Pantaloon’s neck, which stands in place of a nose to them” (stage directions, Scene XIII). </p>
               <p>Presto, like circus clowns the characters are miniaturized and displaced, substituted and reconstituted, and are as
					fantastical in their abilities and whims as genies and spirits. One student had been reading about late eighteenth-century
					advances in scientific instruments, providing a clue to the visual fascination with optics, from spectacles and telescopes to gun
					sights. We talked about how the pantomimed scene made us question what we see that we normally wouldn’t, whether a tiny moon in a
					telescope lens or even a mirrored image. Another student wondered about the connection between this play and <title level="m">The
						Travels and Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen</title> (1859) with its similar parodic effects and fascination with
					telescope-enhanced adventures. There the political commentary is more overt, allowing us to begin to consider the critique
					Dibdin’s play might be articulating. </p>
               <p>As the spectacle scene demonstrates, space and time in <title level="m">Harlequin and Humpo</title> are more ambiguously
					related to normal frames of reference than is usual in drama so that scenes can shift in rapid succession from one location to
					another. In rapid succession we move from a king’s palace to a Dutch clockmaker’s to a country pub to a warehouse to a plumber’s
					shop to a fairy’s cave all at dizzying speed and often for no real reason except for that of the antic. Late in the play the Clown
					attempts to steal a hurdygurdy “Shew Box” or peep show after watching a performance by animals and dancers. Just as he is leaving
					with the shew box, “Harlequin strikes it and it encloses the Clown like a Box” (stage directions, Scene XIV). Sizes, physical
					properties and space-time dimensions change with the same ease as objects viewed alternately through a telescope and the naked
					eye. Instrumentation becomes a contemporary form of fairy dust, while subjectivity is ungrounded and put into freefall. Students
					just coming from <title level="m">The Cenci </title>found the freefall glibly problematic on the one hand, and yet on the other,
					what one student called “a kind of cardboard version” of Beatrici’s moral freefall. If stage space is arbitrary and artificial, so
					too might be our legal codes, or worse, our moral codes—for surely we had been hard put to condemn Beatrice if we could not quite
					condone her. Surely she had blurred our moral vision and made us reconsider what we were witnessing. Surely Harlequin’s antics
					were more than they appeared.</p>
               <p>The fairy tale, we thought from the outset, would provide an apt terrain for political allusions, for social commentary and
					for plumbing the depths of the popular imaginary. Here was ground for my students to discover that all they had laboriously
					construed over the semester concerning Romantic drama could be subjected to a severe roasting. They noted in particular its
					antecedent in 1950s-era “Looney Tunes,” in which indestructible cartoon characters caricature prominent social and political
					figures. Sir Arthur, “a gallant Knight, afterwards Harlequin,” as the role list explains, provides a stock character of British
					legend: the knightly King Arthur. Humpo, by contrast, is King of the Dwarfs, denied regal decency by his signifying name and his
					transformation into the stock zanni Pantaloon (normally spelled Pantalone). He is a literally unenlightened ruler, whose daughter
					may not see the sun until she is eighteen due to the fairy Owletta’s curse, and the dupe of others. Sir Arthur’s antagonist is the
					Prince of the Dwarfs, Humpino, to whom the Princess has been promised in marriage; the anticipation of this disastrous wedding
					begins the rapid-paced action, in which the Princess is magically changed to Columbine and her lover Sir Arthur to Harlequin in
					order to escape the dire event. One student compared reading the play to seeing only the storyboards for a Hollywood film and then
					trying to imagine the movie in its finished state without being able to see it. Textually the play requires enormous leaps of the
					imagination.</p>
               <p>Worse yet, Dibdin’s characters kept leaping back and forth between fairy tale and harlequinade, so that we kept falling into
					childhood memories of Grimm’s Fairy Tales just as we would enter the parodic world of <emph>commedia dell’arte</emph>. The rapid
					shifts in genre, discursive traditions, character expectations interfered with our ability to follow a basic plot since most of us
					did not have the cultural knowledge necessary to interpret each of these traditions as they arose in the play. The convergences,
					slippages, and disjunctures, I felt, were not too different from those of music videos but my students protested being asked to
					retro-fit our music industry aesthetic to Dibdin’s taller order of the absurd. Again we returned to cartoon animation, in which
					the two dimensions of the everyday world and the fairy world are also so interrelated that characters move between them almost
					seamlessly. We also discussed the relation between puppetry and harlequinades, and how the imaginative demands that each of these
					folk forms make on the audience are similar. Both the cartoon and puppetry frameworks made more palatable the conversion of the
					Princess and Sir Arthur into their recognizable forms as Columbine and Harlequin, rendering their story inevitable no matter how
					many plot turns or leaps between different worlds were required to fulfill it. In our favor was the fact that every play we had
					read seemed to dwell on the problems of star-crossed lovers, unfulfilled love, illicit love, misguided love. We revisited an
					earlier discussion of how the Austenian problem of the middle-class heroine in search of a husband saturated the theatrical
					dynamic as much as that of the domestic novel. Contextualizing our harlequinade in this way helped us orient Dibdin’s world of
					uncomplicated love, fraught, it is true, with barriers and disruptions but nevertheless secure in the primordial compact between
					Harlequin and Columbine. The play’s task is to resolve how this pair, who unquestionably belong to each other, ultimately survive
					the Shakespearean trials that constantly thwart their union. But if the play is about Harlequin and Columbine, why then, one
					student demanded, is the title character Humpo and not Harlequin’s rival Humpino? </p>
               <p> As Cox and Gamer remark in their
					preface to the play, Humpo King of the Dwarves bears a striking resemblance to Napoleon the usurper. We decided that indeed his
					diminutive stature would visually invoke Napoleon the man, a blow at French visions of grandeur that we thought would be nearly
					requisite by 1812, while his name indicates a deformed body and deformity of psyche or soul that represents Napoleon’s
					megalomania. Humpo, providing the play’s political critique and villain, caricatures Napoleon in a manner recognizable in Coleridge’s
					<title level="m">Remorse</title>, which we had read. Yet he also
					recalls Tom Thumb, the subject of a highly popular satire by Henry Fielding that we had not read, but which I summarized for them.
					Fielding’s diminutive Tom is King Arthur’s giant-killer, an anti-Napoleon.<hi rend="sup">
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors"> “Hero, Giant-killing Lad, / Preserver of my Kingdom” (I.ii). <title level="m">The

							common title, <title level="m">Tom Thumb; and, The Tragedy of Tragedies</title> (Edinburgh, Oliver &amp; Boyd, 1970).
						</note>
                  </hi> Here was confusion indeed: Humpo, the greatest of the dwarves, is tiny against the full physical, cultural, and heroic
					stature of Sir (or King) Arthur, but is he defender of the kingdom, as for Fielding, or a Napoleon? It is Humpo, in his grotesque
					co-role as Pantaloon, who wrecks havoc for Harlequin and Columbine, chasing them through the various scene sets and finally, in
					Scene XV, forcibly separating them with the aid of the evil fairy Owletta, who had originally benighted the Princess/Columbine.
					Harlequin is left alone in the fairy’s cavern to be tormented by the Gothic devices of hooting owls and passing specters. Throwing
					himself on the ground in his despair, Harlequin “recollects his sword, waves it, strikes the ground &amp; rocks without effect,
					throws it from him angrily—.” Which is to say Arthur’s legendary talent with stone and sword has failed him here and a stronger
					magic is needed. The sword instantly turns into a bow and arrow, the weapon that will aid him in defeating Owletta and Humpo, and
					return him as Sir Arthur to the land of fairy, where he is reunited with his beloved Princess, restored from her alternate
					identity of Columbine. </p>
               <p> At the end of the seminar we were left ruminating about alternative identities, alterity, the psychodynamics of id-ego
					embodiments, and cultural manifestations of all these imaginative projections. We read the spectacle scene as a commentary on
					Luddite framebreaking, Humpo as a bizarre Napoleon, and the land of dwarves, witches, and harlequins as our everyday world—but
					mostly we came away with a sense of an audience reveling in the reduction of political uncertainty to visual play. We could see
					that in <title level="m">Harlequin and Humpo</title> stock characters and masks achieve cultural critique without the high style
					of Romantic psychodrama, intensely fleshed out characters, or the ambiguities and questions necessary to the Romantic imagination
					and culturally invested art. </p>
               <p> For us, the difficulty of the piece resides in interpreting its dumb shows, connecting the layers of comic and conventional
					symbolism to a coherent narrative, and following the central themes through all the interpolations and transformations of the
					play. Dibdin’s foolery with space and time and the arbitrariness of representation is difficult enough to let us find its
					philosophical counterpart in Wordsworth’s <title level="m">The
					Borderers</title>, with its equally challenging disorientation of time and space. If for Dibdin the fateful interventions of good
					and bad fairies are unrelated to personal merit, in <title level="m">The Borderers</title> the ethical becomes another dimension
					that ambiguates location and temporality, so that personal integrity has everything to do with epistemological stability.
					Epistemological stability, of course, is what is supremely missing from <title level="m">Harlequin and Humpo</title>, where not
					even scientific instrumentation provides reliable information, and where if you thought you knew something about plot and
					characterization, just wait a minute for it all to be undone. In <title level="m">The Borderers</title>, plot and character appear
					to unveil each other, yet language continually gets in the way—as it does in <title level="m">The Cenci</title>—of our moral
					determination, our belief in our capacity to decode, interpret, translate literary art according to a strong moral code. Each of
					these plays—Wordsworth’s, Shelley’s, Dibdin’s—dramatize how morally chaotic a historical moment can be, how the verbal framing of events can
					swing our moral compass in dizzying ways. Taking a moment to rethink <title level="m">The Borderers</title> and <title level="m">The Cenci</title> made us recalibrate our initially too-superficial approach to <title level="m">Harlequin</title> yet
					again.</p>
               <p n="21">We began to think that <title level="m">Harlequin and Humpo</title> provides a telling example of the ridiculous as an
					antidote to the sublime: it seemed to us that perhaps 1812 was a ridiculous year as well as a tragic one, or rather its tragedies
					turned everything upside-down. The play’s distillation of psycho-social relations into essential units symbolically represented
					and engaged in semiotic foolery, layered onto cultural biases and traditions but invoking more recent developments such as the
					Gothic as well, also made it easier to see in retrospect how similar features are at work in literary dramas such as <title level="m">Manfred</title> or <title level="m">Count Basil</title>. This required some distillation, of course, but it was
					easier to do with Dibdin’s play than it would have been if we had started with the sublimity of <title level="m">Count Basil,
					</title>unpacking it from this perspective without having gone through the absurdity of <title level="m">Harlequin and
						Humpo</title>. For my students the harlequinade’s fun struck like a sword through our disciplinary assumptions of literary
					value, genre expectations and valuations, and the aestheticization of fantasy. It cut through the heavy stone of highly theorized
					interpretations of such plays as well, giving my students back for a moment their sense of delight in the fantastical world that
					theatre makes possible. We thought it was perhaps for this reason, indeed, that theatre managers had begun sequencing <title level="m">Remorse </title>with <title level="m">Harlequin and Humpo.</title> Then we had a more post-modern moment, and ended
					the seminar with the idea that perhaps Dibdin’s spectacle should have come first in the sequence, preparing its audience for the
					moral challenge of Coleridge’s tragedy, and that for us, its heightening of
					so many intellectual and cultural cacophonies, disruptions, and sacrileges might more usefully have begun our semester than
					concluded it. </p>

                  <head>The Classroom Dramaturg</head>
                  <p>In most theater survey or dramatic literature classes, plays are
						treated as literature. The term “dramaturgy” never comes up, either as a
						theatrical discipline or as a critical tool for helping our students
						understand drama. I propose changing this situation, and I will use Hannah Cowley’s comic masterpiece, <title level="m">The Belle’s Stratagem</title> (1780), to demonstrate how
						looking at plays from a dramaturgical perspective can provide both students
						and teachers with a more dynamic relationship to Romantic dramatic
						texts.</p>
                  <p>As a dramaturg, scholar, and teacher working with historical
						playwrights, I seek to bridge the worlds of the academy and the professional
						theater. I find my scholarly background imparts a rigor to my dramaturgy and
						my dramaturgical perspective colors my approach in the classroom. The job of
						the dramaturg, when working on an historic play, has many facets. The
						dramaturg must advocate for the necessarily absent author, educate the
						director, cast, designers and audience about the language and historic
						background of the play, and keep the production true to the integrity of the
						work, while at the same time keeping in mind the artistic, physical, and
						economic realities of the theater. As a dramaturg, I consider it most
						important that my students be aware that drama is a form of literature not
						meant primarily to be read but to be heard and seen. </p>
                  <p>Theater is, by its very nature, a collaborative art. The text of a play
						is the skeleton, the bones of the work of art, that must be fleshed out by
						the joint efforts of actors, directors, designers, and even dramaturgs. The
						final collaborator is the audience. Every performance is individual and
						unrepeatable. Living, breathing actors embody a text and <hi rend="bold">connect</hi> with a specific living, breathing audience, making the
						performance both a public and an intimate event. Part of a dramaturg’s
						function is to facilitate that connection. The dramaturg must always be
						asking, “What is the play’s relationship with the audience?”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For those who have never worked on a
							historical production with a dramaturg, I wish to clarify some of the
							differences between the roles of director and dramaturg. The director
							chooses what the overall interpretation of the script will be and the
							dramaturg, actors and designers all serve the director to achieve his or
							her vision. By having a dramaturg keeping track of the story and making
							sure all the elements are clear to the audience, the director is freed
							to focus on the details of each scene and the moment to moment
							relationships between the characters. In addition to providing
							historical research the dramaturg may take notes during a rehearsal and
							pass them on to the director to help make sure the overall narrative
							doesn’t get lost in the development of a particular scene. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To understand what that relationship is, more questions must be asked.
						What is left unsaid in the play? Are there assumptions the audience is
						supposed to make? Are these assumptions culturally or historically specific?
						If so, what can theater artists do to recreate the appropriate receptivity
						on the part of the audience? What are the silences in the play, the blanks
						in the script we must choose either to fill or elide, that will color our
						entire interpretation? (Whether we fill or elide these silences, we are
						making an interpretational choice, so we might as well make a conscious
						choice, while recognizing at the same time that other choices are equally
						possible.) How do we recognize the silences? All these are dramaturgical
						questions that broaden our understanding of a play beyond the simply
						literary perspective and lead us to a multidisciplinary approach to this art
						form that requires our active participation.</p>
                  <p>I propose to look at teaching Hannah
							Cowley’s comic masterpiece <title level="m">The Belle’s
							Stratagem</title> (1780) from a dramaturgical perspective, and that
						means that the first task is to shatter the preconception that a Romantic
						play is a dusty period piece from a quaint and less sophisticated time. I
						want to get our students to recognize that the script is alive and subject
						to multiple interpretations. This can be demonstrated by showing how
						portraying a minor aspect of the play from different perspectives will
						change the resonance of the play for today’s audience, while remaining true
						to the integrity of the text.</p>

                  <head>On the Margins of <title level="m">The Belle’s Stratagem</title>
                  </head>
                  <p>While <title level="m">The Belle’s Stratagem</title> is set firmly in
						the fashionable society of late eighteenth-century London, and its style is reminiscent of 
						Cowley’s Restoration and Augustan predecessors, Cowley’s comedy demonstrates concerns about
						the laboring classes and their relationship to the moneyed elite. The title
						of Cowley’s comedy pays homage to one of her
						favorite Augustan playwrights, George
							Farquhar (1677-1707), and his <title level="m">The Beaux’s
							Stratagem</title> (1707), and like many of these earlier comedies,
							<title level="m">The Belle’s Stratagem</title> juxtaposes two story
						lines: Letitia Hardy’s ingenious plot to win the heart of her betrothed,
						Doricourt, against the marital problems of jealous Sir George Touchwood and
						his wife, the naïve Lady Frances. Both plots concern men learning to respect
						the women in their lives both before and after marriage, and are further
						connected by questions regarding the nature and fluidity of identity.
						Interwoven with these plots are transitional scenes among servants,
						tradesmen and con artists who make their livings off the excesses of
						fashionable life.</p>
                  <p>The title plot revolves around Letitia Hardy and her fiancé Doricourt,
						who have been engaged since childhood, but who have not seen each other in
						years. Doricourt, back from his tour of the continent, has returned to London as its most fashionable and seemingly
						eligible bachelor. Abroad, he has learned to appreciate continental beauty
						and manners and he disparages Englishwomen (much to the disgust of his good
						friend, Saville). Letitia finds herself captivated by the man Doricourt has
						become, but dashed by his apparent indifference to her. She vows to “win his
						heart or never be his wife.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
							Hannah Cowley, <title level="m">The
								Belle’s Stratagem </title> (1780), in Melinda C. Finberg, <title level="m">Eighteenth-Century
								Women Dramatists </title> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001),
							225 (1.4.145). All citations from play taken from this volume. </note>
						Her stratagem, as she confides to her doting father and her cousin, Mrs.
						Racket, is based on the maxim that it is “easier to convert a sentiment into
						its opposite than to transform indifference into tender passion” (p. 227
						[1.4.225-26]). Letitia plans to disgust Doricourt by posing as an ignorant,
						vulgar rustic and later to enchant him in masquerade as a cosmopolitan lady
						of mystery. In many ways, this plot is a reversal of Goldsmith’s <title level="m">She Stoops to
							Conquer</title>, in which Kate Hardcastle wins her lover by abasing
						herself. Kate is building up the confidence of a man too insecure to address
						women of his own class; Letitia, on the other hand, cuts Doricourt down to
						size and makes him acknowledge his own naïveté. </p>
                  <p>Cowley’s secondary story line is a
						retelling of the Pinchwife plot of Wycherley’s <title level="m">The Country Wife</title>. Sir
						George Touchwood, a man of the world and former avowed bachelor, has married
						the lovely but sheltered Lady Frances. He has been compelled to bring her to
							London to be presented at court, but aspires
						to keep her all to himself and away from the pernicious pleasures of the
						town that once made up his own life. While Sir George lacks Pinchwife’s
						overt cruelty, Cowley uses his character to
						question whether jealousy and the concomitant infantilization of the beloved
						is not cruelty in and of itself. Cowley’s
						character Courtall, a rewrite of Wycherley’s Horner, the man out to seduce the naïve bride, is a
						rake in the wrong century. His seduction plots backfire and sexual
						humiliation is his to receive, not to inflict.</p>
                  <p>Bridging the two stories are Mrs. Racket, a merry widow, and Villers, a
						debonair bachelor – a witty sophisticated pair who egg on the mischief, and
						each other – as well as Flutter, a gossipy fop who can be counted on to get
						every story wrong, and loyal Saville, Doricourt’s best friend, who still
						pines for Lady Frances.</p>
                  <p>The major plots of <title level="m">The Belle’s Stratagem </title>can
						be staged as an effervescent confection – fast-paced, intricately
						choreographed and filled with sparkling repartée. The transitional scenes
						ground the plot by revealing the sordid underpinnings of frivolous
						fashionable life. Cowley gives us our first
						glimpse of laboring life in the second scene of the comedy, among
						Doricourt’s servants. A tabloid reporter bribes Doricourt’s porter for
						information on any romantic liaisons involving his quasi-celebrity master.
						They dicker over the value of the porter’s possible information. Their
						tète-á-tète is interrupted by the entrance of a horde of servants and
						tradesmen, who have bribed Doricourt’s valet for a view of the gentleman’s
							<foreign>haute couture</foreign> Parisian fashions with an eye to copy
						them for their masters and customers. Later there is a scene between an
						auctioneer and his shills. These lower-class hirelings pose as people of
						fashion, bidding on items to help drive up the prices. </p>
                  <p>Each of these scenes serves as a precursor to the later grand
						masquerade. Below stairs at Doricourt’s and at the auction house, we see the
						lower classes masquerading as the elite for various motives. In the first,
						they are creating a parallel world to those of the upper classes: just as
						Doricourt is preparing to attend the king’s levée and people of high fashion
						hang around the court to stay current on the latest gossip and trends, so
						the servants and the less socially prominent attend the households and
						servants of the fashionable. At the auction house, the auctioneer, Mr.
						Silvertongue, prepares his “puffers” to drive up the bids at the upcoming
						sale. He coaches them on jargon and the details of artists and items and he
						criticizes their clothing. They must appear like people of fashion to fool
						people of fashion. A female puffer complains Silvertongue doesn’t pay her
						enough to afford appropriate clothes and they argue about wages, comparing
						them to soldier’s wages. The behind-the-scenes scrapping reminds the
						audience that London’s fashionable life is based
						on a teetering economy: everyone at the auction is there to ogle or buy
						items seized to settle debts of those financially ruined by gambling and
						extravagance. </p>
                  <p>These scenes stand out from the general effervescence with their ugly
						glimpses of the economic realities behind the glamour. They have grit. They
						rub our noses into the fact that this is a society of many degrees of haves
						and have-nots. And some of these have-nots are finding and taking every
						opportunity to exploit their oblivious masters. They call our attention to
						the cannibalistic nature of this society, as we watch different classes prey
						upon each other and even on the remains of members of their own class who
						have fallen into financial ruin.</p>
                  <p>These transitional scenes present us with dramaturgical choices: how
						much attention should they be given in comparison to the scenes of the major
						action? Are they casual moments the audience catches in passing, or are they
						moments that deliberately stop the forward motion of the plot? How much do
						they infiltrate or color our perception of the fashionable society that
						dominates the plot? In some productions, historically as well as today, they
						are cut entirely.</p>
                  <p>There is no right or wrong answer, but whatever choice we make will
						color the audience’s understanding of the text. We can compare a dramatic
						work to a diamond: letting different facets catch the light changes our view
						of the stone itself – its color, its reflective capacities, even its beauty.
						In teaching a play, examining several of the different facets and their
						coloring of the interpretation of the piece will give students a richer
						understanding of how a dramatic text comes to life.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, to understand the possible choices, we will need to
						encourage our students to do multidisciplinary research. In the case of
							<title level="m">The Belle’s Stratagem</title>, such research will
						involve cultural and economic history of the period. What did the people
						look like? Who are the servants to the upper classes? What are their
						backgrounds? What was a levée? How is a levée being parodied? What were the
						gossip columns of the day like? How do they compare to today’s tabloids?
						What was the role of the auction houses? What was being auctioned? Where and
						how did classes mix? There are so many topics that could be explored to shed
						light on the life the play assumes its audience will know that it is
						impossible for a teacher to cover them all in a class. One possible way to
						involve students in unearthing the social assumptions of the play would be
						to have them do individual reports or papers on different topics and then
						share them with the whole class. Once everyone has a substantial background
						in the social world of the play, discussions can take place about how to
						incorporate this new understanding into the staging of the play. </p>
                  <p>To demonstrate how a class might go about this process, I will use the
						example of one marginal character within <title level="m">Belle’s
							Stratagem</title> and the questions that are raised by Cowley’s employment of her. Kitty Willis comes
						to play an important role in one of Cowley’s
						major plots, although Kitty has very few lines. Courtall, the supposed rake,
						has taunted Saville, Doricourt’s best friend, over Saville’s chaste passion
						for Lady Frances Touchwood. Saville insults Courtall by casting doubts on
						Courtall’s self-proclaimed successes with women. An enraged Courtall plots
						his revenge by planning to deceive and abduct Lady Frances at the
						masquerade, but Saville gets wind of the plan and decides to outplot the
						plotter. Saville confides in Doricourt that he has found a woman “whose
						reputation cannot be hurt” (p. 256, [4.1.155]) to masquerade as Lady Frances
						and deceive Courtall. That woman is Kitty Willis. This is the only
						description we are given of Kitty. As Shakespeare would say, “The rest is silence.” (<title level="m">Hamlet</title>, 5.2.360) But for drama to live, the silence has to be
						filled. How do we discover how to fill it?</p>

                  <p> To understand how to teach our students how to approach the dramatic
						text as the framework for a performance, I suggest starting with the
						language of theater practitioners. One of the first tasks a director, actor,
						designer, or dramaturg undertakes when beginning to work with a script is to
						to determine the “given circumstances” of the text or of an individual
						character. These “given circumstances” are the facts the author has provided
						for us through the words and actions of the play. They are the theater
						artist’s point of departure in analyzing the text, and they will vary
						depending on whether one is examining one specific character or the entire
						play. One character’s given circumstances will differ from another’s by
						virtue of what the character <emph>knows</emph> about the rest of the plot
						or characters, as well as who the character <emph>is</emph>. Differences
						about what each character knows are often the basis of comedy and farce.
						Differences about who characters are provide depth and variety to the life
						of the play. </p>
                  <p> What are Kitty Willis’s given circumstances? Cowley provides us with minimal information. Kitty: <list type="bulleted">
                        <item>has a distinctive, diminutive name.</item>
                        <item>is a woman whose reputation cannot be hurt.</item>
                        <item>doesn’t believe many women can sustain a character of virtue

                     </list> From these given circumstances, we must make deductions and begin
						our research.</p>
                  <p> Kitty appears to be a publicly known woman whose reputation seems to
						be beyond being able to be damaged, written by a publicly known woman who
						was always having to defend her respectability from damage. (By 1780 women
						novelists could be respectable, while actresses were still considered not
						much better than prostitutes. As a playwright, Cowley found herself in disputed territory: did the public
						confer upon her the respectability of the novelist or the opprobrium of the
						actress/prostitute? Although she asserted her respectability – even when
						writing the words of disreputable characters – critics challenged “whether
						Mrs. Cowley ought so to have expressed
							herself?”)<note place="foot" resp="editors">
							Hannah Cowley, <title level="m">A School
								for Greybeards; or, the Mourning Bride</title> (London: G. G. J.
							&amp; J. Robinson, 1786), Preface vii. In this preface, Cowley defends herself from attacks from
							her critics based not on her talent and the realism of her character
							creations, but on her gender and whether she should write such
							characters so well. Janet Todd (in <title level="m">The Sign of Angellica: Women, Writing and Fiction, 1660 –
								1800 </title>(New York: Columbia University Press, 1989) traces the
							woman writer’s concern with being a public woman, and thus being equated
							with the disreputable prostitute, back to Aphra
								Behn’s character of Angellica Bianca, in <title level="m">The
								Rover</title>, who hangs her picture with her price outside her door
							and tries to claim the same sexual freedom as men. </note> Kitty’s very
						name suggests animality, sexuality and lack of will. Her circumstances
						suggest that she is some kind of prostitute, courtesan, or actress, but what
						kind? Research into the topic of eighteenth-century British prostitution
						yields many different possible answers to this question, each of which
						provides us with different approaches to staging Kitty. Any production must
						make one strong choice about Kitty and allow that choice to influence the
						staging of her relationships with each of the characters she encounters,
						including the effect her presence brings to the central masquerade scene. </p>
                  <p>During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, prostitution was the
						subject of much public debate and fascination. It not only played a part in
						many of the novels of the day, but prostitute narratives, purported to be
						the true histories or memoirs of real prostitutes and courtesans,
						proliferated and were vastly popular. In her recent study, <title level="m">Infamous Commerce: Prostitution in Eighteenth-Century British
							Literature and Culture</title>, Laura
							Rosenthal points out that these novels and narratives took
						primarily two different approaches to the profession. The first took the
						form of libertine narrative in which a woman rises through her labors to
						fame (or infamy) and fortune. There is a quality of entrepreneurship to her
						profession and ownership of her body. Such narratives describe a woman
						rising from the brothel to the life of celebrity as a courtesan; sometimes
						they show her fall back into degradation and poverty, but still she remains
						a sympathetic representative of upward mobility, using what she has to
							succeed.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For this discussion of

                  <p> The second type of prostitution narrative shows the prostitute as
						tragic victim. She is driven by economic necessity to degradation and her
						feelings are sentimentalized. As one such writer describes, <quote>There are

						he seats her next to a kitten trying to fish a goldfish out of its

						prostitution as a business to make the most of their talents. Kitty Fisher

                  <p> So into which of these categories will we place Kitty Willis? Is she a
						well-known courtesan? A former courtesan or kept woman, known to all the men
						as last season’s fashionable face, but now down on her luck? Is she
						destitute and desperate? Or is she an actress? And once we have decided what
						kind of public woman she is, how will we stage her and how will she fit into
						the ensemble of other characters?</p>
                  <p> As is typical of many skilled dramatists, Cowley provides us with information that can be interpreted in a
						number of ways. On the one hand, Kitty’s name recalls the late famous Kitty Fisher, but on the other hand, another
						famed “Kitty” was the great actress Kitty
							Clive (1711-85). Both Kitty Fisher
						and Kitty Clive were well-known celebrities
						and women of wit, intelligence and ambition, but Cowley’s Kitty is “Willis” or perhaps, “will-less,” that is
						without inner strength or ambition, a woman who has simply “fallen” into her
						line of work because of her lack of discipline or fortitude. Cowley even makes a subtle allusion to the
						desperation of this latter kind of prostitute when she has the fop Flutter
						entertain Lady Frances with the description of a family at the masquerade:
							<quote>In the next apartment there’s a whole family, who, to my
							knowledge, have lived on watercresses this month to make a figure here
							tonight; but, to make up for that, they’ll cram their pockets with cold
							ducks and chickens for a carnival tomorrow. (4.1.82-86)</quote>
						Cowley here alludes to Henry Fielding’s
						poetic description in his <title level="m">The Masquerade</title>: <quote>

                  <p>And how precisely do the men “know” Kitty? They are all on familiar
						enough terms with her to address her simply as “Kitty,” when they discover
						her in Courtall’s rooms, while they address none of the women of their own
						class so informally. Is she communal property? As a whore or as a celebrity?
						Is there anything particular about her relationship with Courtall that might
						add to her enjoyment of the joke? </p>
                  <p>Again, I reiterate, there is no one right answer to this question,
						only choices – although some choices are more interesting than others. These
						are more places where Cowley is silent and
						where the script must be fleshed out. This is where actors and directors
						ask, “What if?” What if Courtall was Kitty’s original seducer? Or what if he
						had formerly kept her? How would such possibilities contribute to deepening
						Courtall’s sense of humiliation in mistaking Kitty for Lady Frances when he
						has her in his bedroom? What would such an interpretation add to the
						significance of Kitty’s line to Courtall after he has damned those present
						for humiliating him, “What! Me, too, Mr. Courtall? Me, whom you have knelt
						to, prayed to, and adored?” (4.2.61-62). Is Kitty just adding to the banter
						or is she getting her own revenge?</p>

                  <p>When staging a performance of <title level="m">Belle’s
							Stratagem</title>, one has to make one choice and commit to it. All
						further choices build upon those that have gone before. How should Kitty be
						costumed? If she is wearing a domino, as Cowley describes, do we see her own clothes under it when she
						unmasks? If so, will they be the equivalent of the society women’s we have
						seen. More ornate? Will they be shabby or dirty? Who is revealed when Kitty
						unmasks? A proud woman of the world or one closer to the prostitute
						described by the uncomfortable <title level="j">Spectator</title> on an
						evening in the early part of the century? Kitty’s unmasking prefigures
						Letitia’s unmasking at the conclusion of the play. How do they connect to
						each other? </p>

                  <p>Understanding who prostitutes were in the London of the late eighteenth century as well as understanding
						who the women of high society were and what was expected of them, gives
						students a grasp of the visceral reaction an audience would have to seeing
						both respectable and disreputable women in the same public place or
						confusing them. It calls their attention to questions the play is raising
						about how women are categorized and about the fluidity of anyone’s identity.
						When Cowley dresses Sir George, Lady
						Frances, Courtall, and Kitty in interchangeable costumes, she suggests with
						the different pairings that result in the course of the ball, the ease with
						which the rake can be confused with the devoted husband and the harlot with
						the virtuous wife. Does Kitty becomes Leah to Lady Frances’s Rachel, sisters
						under the veil, in some ways indistinguishable? Does Courtall’s inability to
						distinguish between the masked Kitty Willis and Lady Frances reflect on
						Doricourt’s inability to distinguish the real Letitia behind her many masks?
						If so, how?</p>
                  <p>When teaching the play in class, however, I advocate exploring as many
						of the choices as time permits. Asking our students to look at a variety of
						perspectives increases their understanding of a play as a living art. Each
						choice is an interpretation of the play. How do we come to see how examining
						a particular facet of a play from a particular angle reflects throughout the
						whole gem of the play? How do we consciously lead an audience to view a play
						based on a particular interpretation? For this, I recommend further readings
						about the art of dramaturgy and ideas and theories about how to connect
						audiences with classic productions.</p>
                  <p>One of the best texts for introducing students to dramaturgy as a
						discipline is <title level="m">Dramaturgy in American Theater: A Source
							Book</title>, a collection of essays on various aspects and uses of
						dramaturgical theory and practice. Selected essays from the section entitled
						“New Contexts” are especially appropriate for teachers and students of
						Romantic Drama. In her essay, “Aiming the Canon at Now: Strategies for
						Adaptation,” Susan Jonas examines “how
						theatermakers can employ the canon to <hi>reveal</hi> its own biases” <note place="foot" resp="editors">
							Susan Jonas, “Aiming the Canon at Now:
							Strategies for Adaptation,” in Susan
							Jonas, Geoffrey Proehl, and Michael Lupu, <title level="m">Dramaturgy in American Theater: A Source Book.</title> (Orlando,
							FL: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1997), 244. Future references are cited
							in the text. </note>(emphasis hers). One technique Jonas suggests to amplify marginalized voices
						from an historical text is one she terms “simultaneity” (255). Simultaneity
						refers to seeing a silenced aspect of the play at the same time as the play
						proceeds as scripted. Such a technique encourages the audience to view the
						play from the perspective of the less-privileged characters and thus
						critically comments on the actions of the central characters and expands our
						understanding of the world of the play. I will use this technique to suggest
						one possible way of exploring <title level="m">Belle’s Stratagem</title>
						dramaturgically. </p>
                  <p>While there are several scenes of lower-class characters used as
						transitions in Cowley’s comedy, there are
						also public scenes for which little description is provided. The play opens
						with Saville arriving with his servant at Lincoln’s Inn, one of the inns of
						court where lawyers keep offices. Courtall describes the place as “the most
						private place in town” (1.1.39-40) of a morning because no fashionable
						person would be seen there – unless on legal business. But Lincoln’s Inn is
						inhabited by lawyers, their families, their servants and their clients.
						People indeed may be coming and going during the scene, just not people of
						high society. Saville begins the scene at a loss for where to go and is
						talking with his servant before he sees Courtall. What if before he sees
						Courtall, the audience sees Courtall being accosted by or in conversation
						with Kitty – perhaps trying to extricate himself from her; perhaps giving
						her money? If we have made the choice that Kitty has seen better days, how
						will this contribute to their later confrontation? There is nothing in the
						script to prevent such a meeting. Might Courtall be a poseur? Are his
						vaunted relationships with “women of quality” really only assignations with
						prostitutes or seductions of young girls? How might such a choice play out
						over the production? Or is Kitty some relic from his past? Is he in her
						debt? Does he owe her money? No dialogue needs to be spoken, yet questions
						can be raised in the audience’s mind. </p>
                  <p>Other public scenes include the auction and the masquerade. Are there
						possibilities for simultaneous actions in any of these? Cowley provides dialogue for the auctioneer
						and his puffers before the gentry enter, yet she doesn’t account for the
						actions of the shills once the fashionable characters arrive. What are they
						doing? Are they interacting? Pickpocketing? Are they successful in
						impersonating the visitors? Does Kitty Willis make an appearance? Is she the
						celebrated, wealthy courtesan, shunned by the women but fawned over by the
						men? Or is she, like the puffers, trying to appear fashionable, but coming
						up short? Does she make any connection with Courtall here? If so, what kind?
						What about the masquerade? What is Kitty’s relationship to Saville? Is he
						hiring an impoverished whore, a moderately successful one, a kept woman, or
						a courtesan out for a lark? Do we recognize any of the servants or tradesmen
						at the masquerade? Is the tabloid writer lurking there (or at the auction,
						for that matter)? Simultaneous actions fill in the world of the play.</p>
                  <p>Other possible dramaturgical approaches might be to create framing
						devices or to utilize Brechtian alienation techniques. In the first
						transitional scene in the play, Cowley shows
						us servants and tradespeople actively observing and feeding off the lives of
						the fashionable. Might these working-class people observe, judge and/or
						profit from their masters throughout the play? Might they be watching
						everything from the sidelines or margins? Might we see their reactions to
						the stratagems and counter-stratagems of those who live the high life? Cowley embeds many metatheatrical elements
						within the comedy of various characters performing for others. Could we
						expand on the metatheatrics and create a variation of the Shakespearean
						conceit of one set of characters watching and reacting to another set
						performing a play for them? When she is not part of the action, could Kitty
						be watching and forming her own judgments that color her responses within
						her scenes? </p>
                  <p>Might some, or all, of the actors be playing their lines to the
						audience by calling attention to their own judgment of the characters? This
						type of approach deliberately distances the audience from the action of the
						play rather than draws it into a suspension of disbelief. It is part of the
						technique Bertolt Brecht uses to create
						what he calls the “alienation effect,” and its purpose is to call attention
						to the economic, political and class issues inherent in a dramatic text.
							Brecht does not want the audience to
						“feel” for the characters so much as to “think” about them and the
						significance of what they do. Brecht lays
						forth his theories in <title level="m">The Messingkauf Dialogues.</title>
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors">Bertolt
								Brecht, <title level="m">The Messingkauf Dialogues
							</title>(London: Methuen, Ltd., 1965).</note> A useful assignment to
						help students understand how Brechtian theory can be applied to historical
						drama, is to have them read and compare John
						Gay’s <title level="m">The Beggar’s Opera</title> (1728) to Brecht’s adaptation of it, <title level="m">The Threepenny Opera</title> (1928). What if the actress playing Kitty
						plays her as if she is an observer commenting on her character and the
						actions of the scene in Brechtian fashion?</p>
                  <p>All of the questions I have suggested derive from the initial question
						of how to stage the character of Kitty Willis, a character who appears in
						only two scenes of <title level="m">The Belle’s Stratagem</title> and who
						only speaks five lines in those scenes, and yet the choices we make about
						this character color the interpretation of the entire play. Such
						dramaturgical questions must be asked about every character and every scene
						in every production of a dramatic text, and so infinite interpretations are
						possible and valid. Each staging must simply be consistent within itself. </p>
                  <p>Teaching our students to approach Romantic Drama dramaturgically
						teaches them to work in a multidisciplinary fashion and create a dynamic
						relationship with the text. It encourages them to perform primary research
						into the period and to track down images, music and cultural artifacts of
						the period, including gossip columns, broadsides, and other records of
						popular culture. Understanding what connected and still connects an audience
						to a play helps them to make personal connections as well. Our goal is to
						help students see Romantic Drama as a multi-faceted art form as alive and
						open to interpretation today as it was two hundred years ago.</p>

               <p>“Holy Theatre” is a term known to drama students and theatre practitioners
					primarily from Peter Brook’s treatment of it in
					his 1968 classic, <title level="m">The Empty Space</title>. It is, Brook says, “the Theatre of the Invisible – Made –
					Visible” (42); it is the kind of theatre that arises from a deeply felt urge to
					“capture in our arts the invisible currents that rule our lives” (45). Christopher Innes, in his study <title level="m">Holy Theatre</title>, observes that its “hallmark” is an
					“aspiration to transcendence, to the spiritual in its widest sense” (3) and that
					it attempts to “transcribe subjective experience directly into stage terms”
					(29). The effect is meant to be communal: a theatre “that brings its spectators
					into emotional harmony with one another by celebrating their common identity as
					human beings” (Auslander 13).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Innes’s and
						Auslander’s descriptions may strike readers as very Romantic and therefore
						familiar, but some further clarification may be in order since the term
						“holy theatre” can be misleading and, for some, off-putting. It does not
						mean, for instance, a “religious” drama; indeed, much of Artaud’s and Grotowski’s work in the twentieth century 
						(and Ibsen’s and Strindberg’s, for that matter) was considered sacrilegious, even
						blasphemous. Most theatre that meets the criteria I discuss in this essay is
						no longer given the label of “holy,” and a look at the scholarship of Christopher Innes is instructive for
						understanding why. His book <title level="m">Holy Theatre: Ritual and the
							Avant Garde</title> (1981) was revised and updated in 1992 under the
						title <title level="m">Avant Garde Theatre 1892-1992</title>. While the
						content and organization of the book remain much the same in the course of a
						little over a decade, he felt it necessary to change his title: the term
						“holy theatre” had apparently run its course. Did it seem hopelessly dated,
						a hangover from the 1960s, like “groovy” and “far out”? The clue is found in
							Innes’s initial definition of his
						book’s subject. In the 1981 <title level="m">Holy Theatre</title> his
						introduction describes a number of qualities (e.g., exploration of dream
						states, interest in ritual) that the works of this master current of theatre
						share, and observes that “it is in light of these qualities that the term
						coined by Antonin Artaud is so apt: ‘the
						Holy Theatre’” (3). However, in 1993’s <title level="m">Avant Garde Theatre
							1892-1992</title>, following the same description of qualities, Innes remarks that “Antonin Artaud’s pretentious claim to a ‘Holy
						Theatre’—picked up by various avant garde artists . . . is revealing” (3).
						Perhaps there’s little talk of a holy theatre, then, because the idea (and
						the ideal?) of a holy theatre has become pretentious. It is considered
						affected, showy, claims more than it can actually demonstrate. This course
						is hoping to revive the term for its evocative power—or at least to revive
						an interest in this theoretical approach to theatre and its plays.</note>
					Brook took the term “holy” from Antonin Artaud’s vision of theatre as “a metaphysical
					force,” “holy rite and quasi-religious practice” (Esslin, <title level="m">Antonin
							Artaud</title> 101). Artaud’s
					work was in part a return to and a nostalgia for the prehistory of theatre, the
					ancient cult rituals and goat-songs that developed into Greek drama, and that
					were celebrated as the “Dionysian” split from “Apollonian” harmony, rationalism,
					and sculpture in Nietzsche’s highly influential <title level="m">The Birth of
						Tragedy</title> (1872). This metaphysical or “holy” impulse in theatre has a
					long history, and can be seen as one of the “master currents” of dramatic
					literature and theatre theory. </p>
               <p>As is well known, the study of European drama has greatly favored the
					master current that flows toward realism and naturalism, a narrative of progress
					that celebrates the late nineteenth century arrival of the “well-made play” and
					the “problem play” (ushered in by the reigning triumvirate of Ibsen, Strindberg, and Chekhov, with the
					frequent addition of Shaw), dramas that work from the “bottom up,” grounded in
					the material world and social issues. Plays that endeavor something else, namely
					to stage subjective states, have been dropped into the valley of the unstageable
					and unstageworthy. These are the plays of the master current of the holy
					theatre. They tend to get labeled “closet dramas,” “symbolist,” “impressionist”
					or “expressionist,” “experimental” or “avant garde.” Philosophical plays
					concerned with revealing states of mind, consciousness, dreams, ghosts, magic,
					they work from the “top down” and begin in abstraction, “sojourning through
					consciousness and affecting the ‘reality’ of the material world beneath it,” as
						William Demastes explains in <title level="m">Staging Consciousness: Theater and the Materialization of
						Mind</title> (15). The plays are an exploration of the human condition, but
					from the “inside out” rather than the social realism approach of “outside in.”
					(However, plays with the greatest lasting impact tend to be a combination of
					both these traditions, from <title level="m">Hamlet</title> to <title level="m">Death of a Salesman</title> to <title level="m">Angels in
						America</title>.)<note place="foot" resp="editors">William Demastes argues in <title level="m">Staging Consciousness: Theater and the Materialization of Mind</title>
						(Ann Arbor: U of Michigan P, 2002) that “<emph>either</emph> consciousness
							<emph>or</emph> materiality is not really a choice. Inevitably, theater
						uses a both/and proposition of confronting consciousness integrally through
						materialism rather than discretely through mystical or spiritual channels”
						(41). I have borrowed the useful terms “bottom up” and “top down” from his
						work. </note>
               </p>
               <p>The dramatists of this lineage (loosely defined) were also deeply invested
					as theorists of the theatre (or, put differently, this way of seeing theatre
					attracted theorists who became dramatists to test their theories). We see this
					pattern very clearly in the emergent Romantic theatre of the eighteenth century
					in Germany (e.g., in the work of Lessing, Schiller, Tieck, and Kleist) and in
					early nineteenth-century England in the staged theories of Joanna Baillie and  Samuel Taylor Coleridge.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Theatre and consciousness studies have
						only grown more popular in recent years, alongside and as a result of the
						rise of cognitive sciences in humanities research. In addition to Demastes’s
							<title level="m">Staging Consciousness</title>, see Ralph Yarrow, <title level="m">Sacred Theatre</title> (2007) and Yarrow and Peter Malekin’s
							<title level="m">Consciousness, Literature, and Theatre</title> (1997)
						as well as Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe’s <title level="m">Theatre and
							Consciousness</title> (2005), <title level="m">Performing
							Consciousness</title> (2010), edited with Per Brask, and his edited
						issue, “Drama and Consciousness,” for <title level="j">Studies in the
							Literary Imagination</title> (34.2: Fall 2001). Within Romantic studies,
						Alan Richardson’s work is essential reading, from his 1988 <title level="m">A Mental Theater: Poetic Drama and Consciousness in the Romantic
							Age</title> to his more recent <title level="m">British Romanticism and
							the Science of the Mind</title> (2005) and <title level="m">The Neural
							Sublime: Cognitive Theories and Romantic Texts</title> (2010).</note>
               </p>
               <p>In this drama course we examine some of the major dramatic texts that could
					be said to make up a holy theatre tradition, with Coleridge’s <title level="m">Remorse</title> (1813) and Baillie’s
						<title level="m">Orra</title> (1812) representing Romantic drama.<note place="foot" resp="editors">My argument is to incorporate Romantic
						drama into courses on drama (where it has long been neglected), but the
						approach I outline in this essay could certainly be used for an entire
						course on Romantic drama. Plays such as <title level="m">Manfred</title> and
							<title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> obviously fit the paradigm
						of exploring consciousness. For this course I have chosen to include <title level="m">Orra</title> and <title level="m">Remorse</title> because of
						their intriguing relationship to Shakespeare, the Gothic, and the avant
						garde, and for the opportunities they present for examining notions of
						“high” and “low,” “avant garde” and “popular.” They are also both included,
						most conveniently, in Jeffrey N. Cox and Michael Gamer’s <title level="m">Broadview Anthology of Romantic Drama</title> (2003).</note> Alongside
					these plays we read theatre theory and study developments in stagecraft that
					allowed dramatists to explore subjective states onstage. In this context
					students are encouraged to see Romantic drama as inspired by the vision and
					techniques learned from Shakespeare’s
					plays (rather than weak imitations of Shakespeare), as a reworking and transformation of the Gothic, and
					as the birthplace of the modern avant garde. To many Romanticists this is going
					to look (suspiciously, perhaps) like the “old” approach to Romantic drama—that
					is, Romantic drama as “mental theatre,” a label under which it has not tended to
					fare well in criticism. However, when studied within the lineage of holy
					theatre, Romantic drama can stand out as a peak—rather than a valley—in the
					history of dramatic literature and theatre theory.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <p rend="noCount">I am not interested in establishing a new hierarchy. But,
							for illustrative purposes only, let's say we charted a theatre history
							using as our standard the criteria of holy theatre (rather than the
							criteria of realism): plays in which the invisible is made visible, in
							which states of mind are explored onstage, and what is most prized is
							not verisimilitude, mimesis, the staging and working out of a dramatic
							conflict, psychological characterization, and dialogue on social issues,
							but instead the unveiling of the hidden, the representation of internal
							states of mind and feeling, and symbolic presentation of psychological
							issues. Furthermore, in these plays, language is used at its height not
							for witty stichomythia, political speechifying, or ironic distancing,
							but for the revelation of internal states, the representation of being,
							and startling the audience into communal feeling. A charting of “peaks”
							and “valleys” might show <title level="m">Remorse</title>, <title level="m">Orra</title>, <title level="m">Manfred</title>, <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, and <title level="m">A Dream
								Play</title> as peaks, and <title level="m">The Way of the
								World</title>, <title level="m">A Doll’s House</title>, and <title level="m">The Iceman Cometh</title> as valleys.</p>
                     <p rend="noCount">My idea here is not to denigrate the plays in the new
							“valley”; I’ve deliberately selected excellent, “classic” plays to point
							out the absurdity of doing so. It is instead to question the idea of
							constructing a historical narrative of peaks and valleys, “golden ages”
							and “dark ages.” Categorizing dramas by their affinities with parallel
							“master currents,” grouping them by their primary concerns and the
							approaches to staging those concerns (the “top down” and “inside out”
							versus “bottom up” or “outside in” methods mentioned above) may prove a
							more effective method. </p>
                     <p rend="noCount"> One key reason Romantic drama has been seen as odd is
							because of the way theatre history was produced and, later, reproduced
							in teaching. As Jacky Bratton has
							written, “the continuing strength of the received way of reading theatre
							history can be gauged from the difficulties critics, performers and
							historians still have when they attempt to recuperate anything from the
							early nineteenth-century stage” (<title level="m">New Readings in
								Theatre History </title>12). My long-range goal is to re-see
							dramatic history and encourage the reorganization of courses in theatre
							history and dramatic literature. For instance, instead of the standard
							two-semester survey that moves chronologically from the ancient Greeks
							to the present, we could teach a course in two master currents of world
							drama, the “holy” and the “rough,” to use Peter Brook’s terms, or the “top down” and “inside out” interest
							in consciousness, versus the “bottom up” and “outside in” interest in
							social realism. While the typical historical timeline reveals the
							dialectical development of theatre and drama between “outside in” and
							“inside out” approaches, the “master currents” approach avoids the
							conception of peaks and valleys, and may allow students to see more
							clearly patterns of influence between particular playwrights and other
							theatre artists, and of approaches to playwriting and theatre. Core
							differences on the <emph>function</emph> of drama and theatre come into
							focus, and this master current challenges some fundamental assumptions
							of drama and theatre, such as whether there is even a natural
							relationship between drama and the theatre—that a dramatic text is
							indeed intended expressly for and only completed upon performance. </p>
                     <p rend="noCount">For an argument similar to my own, see Jeffrey N. Cox’s
							discussion of Romanticism’s “counter-theatre of ‘virtuality’” (177) in
							“The Death of Tragedy; or, The Birth of Melodrama,” <title level="m">The Performing
								Century: Nineteenth-Century Theatre’s History</title>, ed. Tracy C. Davis and
							Peter Holland (Hampshire and New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007),
							161-81.</p>

               </p>
               <p>There are several tributaries of the master current of holy theatre: one
					focuses on pure form (we see this in the modernist avant garde in particular,
					e.g., in the theatrical experiments of Gertrude Stein and Wassily Kandinsky),
					another on myth and ritual (which points up the ancient origins of holy theatre,
					running from Euripides’s <title level="m">The Bacchae</title> to Peter Shaffer’s
						<title level="m">Equus</title>). In order to highlight the stream of holy
					theatre attempting the revelation of consciousness, this version of the course
					begins with Shakespeare’s “strategic
					opacity” and <title level="m">Hamlet</title>, the Ur-text of the dramatic
					representation of consciousness.</p>
               <p>To Romantics and their followers, the conditions of the Elizabethan theatre
					(and the thereby conditioned Elizabethan audiences) were ideal because they drew
					upon the imagination, truly created a “theatre of the mind.” Those early modern
					audiences viewed a virtually bare stage with no external lighting (at the
					outdoor theatres such as the Globe, anyway); the language of the plays
					frequently remind them to imagine the scene that is being played out before
					them. Shakespeare’s eighteenth-century
					admirers developed a new form of literary criticism—“character criticism”—in
					response to the complexity and seeming humanness of his characters, and gave us
					the now-familiar figure of the natural genius Shakespeare who had discovered the secret to how to reveal
					interiority on the stage. A. W.
						Schlegel’s image from his 1808 lectures is a familiar one: Shakespeare’s characters are like “watches
					with crystalline plates and cases, which, while they point out the hours as
					correctly as other watches, enable us at the same time to perceive the inward
					springs whereby all this is accomplished” (“A Course of Lectures on Dramatic Art
					and Literature” 362). More recently, Stephen
						Greenblatt has echoed this language in <title level="m">Will in the
						World</title> when he argues that Shakespeare “perfected the means to represent inwardness” (299)
					through the innovation of the soliloquy, in particular what Greenblatt refers to as “strategic opacity,”
					or a new technique of “radical excision” in which Shakespeare took out a “key explanatory element, thereby occluding
					the rationale, motivation, or ethical principle that accounted for the action
					that was to unfold” (323-24). Relying on “inner logic” rather than causal
					events, Shakespeare “fashioned an inner
					structure through the resonant echoing of key terms, the subtle development of
					images, the brilliant orchestration of scenes, the complex unfolding of ideas,
					the intertwining of parallel plots, the uncovering of psychological obsession”
					(324). Greenblatt’s Shakespeare is remarkably Romantic, and
					effectively introduces holy theatre dramaturgy; strategic opacity was “not only
					a new aesthetic strategy,” but “expressed Shakespeare’s root perception of existence, his understanding of
					what could be said and what should remain unspoken, his preference for things
					untidy, damaged, and unresolved over things neatly arranged, well made, and
					settled” (324). </p>
               <p>Both <title level="m">Hamlet</title> (1600-01) and <title level="m">The
						Tempest</title> (1610-11) exhibit the Renaissance view of the world as a
					stage and faith in theatre as a means of revealing truth. Thanks in large part
					to Romantic writers and critics—Goethe, Lamb, Hazlitt, Coleridge—<title level="m">Hamlet</title> has come to be considered a play about
					consciousness, and Hamlet the “prince of the inward insurrection” (Greenblatt 303). When read as a foundational
					text of holy theatre, what comes into focus are Hamlet's conversation with the

                  <p>The main plotline of <title level="m">Remorse</title> echoes themes in
							<title level="m">The Tempest</title>; in both, an ambitious and
						rebellious younger brother (Antonio in <title level="m">The Tempest</title>,
						Ordonio in <title level="m">Remorse</title>) plots to kill a virtuous older
						brother (Prospero, Alvar) and sends that virtuous brother into exile. (The
						differences can be illuminating to discuss. Prospero can set up
						circumstances to awaken Antonio to his wrongdoing, but cannot ultimately
						transform Antonio’s inner self; while Prospero expresses forgiveness in the
						end, Antonio does not appear to express remorse.) In <title level="m">Remorse</title>, while Alvar is gone (Ordonio had arranged to have him
						killed, and assumes him dead), Ordonio tries to win over Alvar’s beloved,
						Teresa. She wants nothing to do with Ordonio, and, anyway, is waiting with
						hope for Alvar’s eventual return, since his body has never turned up.
						Ordonio designs a spectacular illusion to convince Teresa of Alvar’s death:
						a glowing altar which will summon the image of the dead Alvar. Unbeknownst
						to all (except the audience), Alvar is not dead; he had escaped the assassin
						and has returned with a plot to awaken Ordonio to his evil deeds. Notably,
						this plan is <emph>not</emph> to seek revenge on Ordonio, but to bring him
						to remorse. Alvar manipulates the altar trick, making it boomerang on
						Ordonio: the altar bursts into flames to reveal a picture of the
						assassination attempt on Alvar, masterminded by Ordonio. Thus Ordonio
						realizes (1) Alvar is still alive, and (2) he knows about the plot to kill
						him. </p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">Remorse</title> (1813) is a reworking of an earlier
						revolution-oriented play entitled <title level="m">Osorio</title> (1797)
						into a deeper, more psychological study of consciousness: the revision of
						title alone gives us a clue. In <title level="m">Remorse</title>
						Coleridge is staging a shift in
						consciousness, which brings about a change in conscience.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The psychological state of remorse was a familiar
							theme in Gothic plays, although Jeffrey
								Cox points out that Coleridge's work, as one in the second wave of Gothic
							popularity, reassesses the theme and can be read as a “culminating work
							in the Gothic tradition” (30). Cox charts
							two major surges of Gothic drama, the first in the 1790s, which Coleridge catches onto with
								<title level="m">Osorio</title> (1797), the second hitting its peak
							in 1815, which Coleridge
							anticipates with <title level="m">Remorse</title> (1813). Cox links these two surges to political
							issues surrounding the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars,
							particularly the fall of the Bastille and the fall of Napoleon. See
								Cox, ed. and intro., <title level="m">Seven Gothic Dramas 1789-1825</title> (Athens: Ohio UP, 1992),
							30-32.</note> In the <title level="m">Table Talk</title> jottings,
						Coleridge expressed a special fondness for <title level="m">Remorse</title>:
						“the ‘Remorse’ is certainly a great favourite of mine,” he stated, “the more
						so as certain pet abstract notions of mine are therein expounded” (II: 360).
						Exactly what those pet abstract notions were was never explicitly stated,
						but reading <title level="m">Remorse</title> within the communality that is
						characteristic of holy theatre illuminates the play as a tragedy intended to
						wake not just the character Ordonio but the audience from their dogmatic
						slumbers or wrongdoings and force them to confront the Otherness that exists
						inside as well as outside themselves. As has been discussed in a number of
							studies,<note place="foot" resp="editors">As well as Sophie Thomas’s “Seeing Things (‘As They
							Are’)” from <title level="j">Studies in Romanticism</title> (included on
							the Reading List), see John David

							Coleridge drew upon the
						spectacular stagecraft of the popular Gothic drama, which contradicts his
						theoretical writing, where he finds the Gothic weak and even dangerous.</p>
                  <p n="10">As a companion text, students can read “Letter II” of “Satyrane’s
						Letters”—included in Chapter XXII of the 1816 <title level="m">Biographia
							Literaria</title> but written in 1798—where Coleridge as much as accuses the
						Gothic theatre of inciting terror. He found the self-reflection of Gothic
						drama dangerous on at least two counts. The Gothic drama had a tendency
						merely to reflect, rather than to challenge, the selves of the audience; the
						values often reflected an easy morality that kept the audiences complacent
						and inert. Also a dangerous aspect of facile self-reflection, and a more
						tempting one for Coleridge and
						others, was, as Jeffrey Cox notes in his
						discussion of North's <title level="m">The Kentish Barons</title>, that the
						emotions can be “more deeply rooted by reflection,” a feature much
						glamourized in Gothic hero/villains. One ideally wants neither passive
						reflection nor the dangerous inward turn to self-consciousness, both of
						which can result in fixation and a resistance to change, but instead a
						self-consciousness which has its ultimate origin in a moral relation to
						others and which develops dialectically in continual relation to others. One
						way to break out of a potentially solipsistic cycle is to engage with
						others, and for a writer, the stage is therefore an ideal medium. Coleridge was frustrated with the
						limitations of the commercial stage of his day, but he knew that that was
						the means through which to present such ideas visibly and publicly, and to
						reach the widest audience for his ideas. As William Galperin points out in <title level="m">The Return of
							the Visible in British Romanticism</title>, issues of the visible
						continually verge upon issues involving <emph>community</emph> (164) and,
						though Coleridge in his criticism
						may have occasionally demonstrated an anti-theatrical bias, he reached for
						the visible to present the transformation of a consciousness to and for a
						community. In <title level="m">Remorse</title> he adapted the Gothic formula
						to his own purpose, and used the Gothic spectacle to affect his audiences,
						as he advises in “Satyrane’s Letters,” “in union with the activity both of
						[their] understanding and imagination” (XXII:437).</p>
                  <p>The Drury Lane playbill for <title level="m">Remorse</title>
						advertises all new sets, which, according to the dictates of the stage
						directions, included “wild and mountainous” country scenery and a desolate
						cavern dripping with water; the setting is the Spanish Inquisition, a remote
						and terror-ridden time. Coleridge
						commissioned a score from Michael Kelly, who had composed the music for the
						most successful of all Gothic dramas, Matthew Lewis’s <title level="m">The
							Castle Spectre</title> (1797). As Paula Backscheider has noted, “Gothic
						drama used music in sophisticated ways to engage the senses while
						subliminally both exercising and containing anxieties” (173); it was as
						crucial to the play as scores are to film and, increasingly, theatre today.
						The dramatic structure of the play, however, is focused on Ordonio's
						consciousness. Coleridge wastes no
						time getting to his purpose; very little exposition is given before Alvar
						declares that he has returned to confront his brother and “rouse within him
						/ REMORSE!” in order to “save him from himself” (I.i.18-19). Preparations
						begin at once for the visible spectacle which will force upon Ordonio a
						cathartic experience, described by Alvar as “the punishment that cleanses
						hearts” (I.ii.319)—remorse, rather than revenge. This experience is designed
						to raise Ordonio's self-consciousness which will in turn prick his
						conscience and force him to face his transgressions. The visual elements are
						crucial: Alvar queries his servant Zulimez concerning what they need, “Above
						all, the picture / Of the assassination—.” “—Be assured / That it remains
						uninjured, Zulimez answers him (I.i.92-4). The spectacle will work in such a
						way, Alvar discloses when alone, that “That worst bad man shall find / A
						picture, which will wake the hell within him, / And rouse a fiery whirlwind
						in his conscience” (II.ii.172-74).</p>
                  <p>In order to understand how Gothic techniques can work to present
						onstage the awakening of a consciousness—and, perhaps, to model a
						transformation of consciousness in the audience—try staging the key scene of
						the play in your classroom. This is the moment of the climactic trick that
						boomerangs on Ordonio, the overwhelming spectacle that results in the first
						awakening of his conscience.<note place="foot" resp="editors">It
							should be noted that the scene enacted, III.i, is <emph>not</emph> the
							scene in which Ordonio feels remorse. It works much like “The Mouse
							Trap” in <title level="m">Hamlet</title> in that the consequence is that
							Ordonio (like Claudius) has been aroused to the point where he is
							conscious that someone is working on him, and so he becomes watchful. He
							feels guilty, yes, but only to the extent that, again, like Claudius, he
							is anxious to rid himself of the external causes of his pain; in other
							words, he seeks to kill the “traitors” (Isidore, and the “sorcerer” [the
							disguised Alvar]) rather than experience fully the internal pain and
							attempt to alleviate it through conversion and reformation. However,
							others notice the experience he underwent, and become players in the
							process of forcing his essential confrontation with what he tried to do
							to Alvar, which finally occurs in V.i. Unfortunately, Ordonio has hardly
							begun to experience the pangs of true remorse when Alhadra and a band of
							Morescos enter and demand Ordonio's life in exchange for his murder of
							Isidore, a conclusion that comes far too quickly for many spectators
							(and readers) to feel the full impact of the remorse, and undercuts
								Coleridge’s apparent
							design.</note> This spectacle is the showpiece of the evening. It was
						well-advertised, and no theatrical elements were spared. Thomas Barnes’s
						review of the play (included in the <title level="m">Broadview Anthology of
							Romantic Drama</title>) provides an eyewitness description: “the altar
						flaming in the distance, the solemn invocation, the pealing music of the
						mystic song, altogether produced a combination so awful, as nearly to
						overpower reality, and make one half believe the enchantment which delighted
						our senses” (392). Barnes’s choice of words—“mystic,” “awful,” “overpower
						reality,” and “half believe the enchantment”—are all central to the desired
						effect of the holy theatre.</p>

						awakening of consciousness. You will need at least six actors to play Alvar,
						Ordonio, Teresa, Valdez, Monviedro, and a few “familiars of the Inquisition”
						who act but don’t have speaking parts. Others can create music “expressive
						of the movements and images” of the scene, play it according to the stage

                     <item>From the text, gather information about the stage setting and

                     </item>

                     <item>The goal of the altar spectacle is to awaken Ordonio’s

							controlling the action, and comments that it would be a joy to see Alvar

							the stinging “it gives fierce merriment to the damned, / To see these
							proud men, that loath mankind, / At every stir and buzz of coward
							conscience, / Trick, cant, and lie, most whining hypocrites!” Alvar then

                  <p>Shelley’s sonnet “Lift not the
						painted veil” (1818) provides an effective lead-in to this reading of <title level="m">Orra</title> because holy theatre, like Orra herself, seeks to
						lift the painted veil, with often (and necessarily) painful—or, as Artaud later famously phrased it,
							<emph>cruel</emph>—results. Baillie’s
						tragedy on <emph>fear</emph> in the <title level="m">Plays on the
							Passions</title>, <title level="m">Orra</title>’s dramaturgical concept
						is to show the progression of fear in Orra, which starts in a somewhat
						playful fashion with the enjoyment of ghost stories, and ends in a terrible
						madness; this aspect of the play takes precedence over the plotline about
						Orra’s resistance to a forced courtship. <title level="m">Orra</title> shows
						Orra’s internal state; the audience doesn’t physically see any ghosts, but
						instead watches the actor playing Orra unveil her hauntedness, or, in other
						words, react to fear. </p>
                  <p>Julie Carlson’s essay “Baillie’s <title level="m">Orra</title>:
						Shrinking in Fear” (included in the recent collection <title level="m">Joanna Baillie, Romantic
							Dramatist</title>) works well as a contemporary supplement to the play.
							Carlson proposes the idea that
						“hauntology” rather than ontology describes our current being and time, and
						writes that <title level="m">Orra</title> is a haunted and haunting play; it
						is the exception rather than the rule in the <title level="m">Plays on the
							Passions</title> and undermines Baillie’s usual emphasis on rational morality. Orra herself is a
						“spectral subject” in the play (216), a position between the “twos” of
						binaries (much like Baillie’s own unusual
						situation in Romanticism and theatre history—not yet acknowledged as a truly
						“major” figure, yet too major to be “minor”).<note place="foot" resp="editors">This conundrum is discussed in Thomas Crochunis’s introductory essay
							to <title level="m">Joanna Baillie,
								Romantic Dramatist</title>, ed. Crochunis (New York and London: Routledge, 2004), 3.</note>
						Like <title level="m">Remorse</title>, <title level="m">Orra</title> draws
						upon the conventions of the Gothic and of Romantic medievalism, and
						similarly, the spectacle is utilized, Carlson argues, as a way of transporting us to a psychic space
						of sensory perceptions—a “before-human” state that precedes meaning-making
						(217)—a technique used in Artaud’s
						twentieth-century performance events that gave audiences a “sensory
						overload” to break down their habitual rational responses. Gothic spectacle
						provided “a way of exploring the psychological even before twentieth-century
						constructions of it,” and “becomes linked to the internal state of the
						characters’ minds as authors explore how individuals react in times of great
						stress,” Christine Colón explains (xxiii). Furthermore, since the Gothic
						“compels an audience to derive pleasure from fear,” it “clearly allies
						itself with the idea of the sublime”; and “for a playwright like Baillie who desperately wishes to stir her
						audience members’ imaginations and compel them to transform their lives, the
						spectacle of the Gothic sublime would have been appealing. It had the
						potential to awaken audiences and cause them to act” (Colón xxii-xxiii). </p>

							theorist. Furthermore, while scholarship on Baillie has been impressive, it hasn’t yet penetrated drama
							scholarship deeply to show Baillie’s
							influence on the modern avant garde. For instance, one description of
							expressionist drama is not just that it is a highly subjective art form
							in which “internal acts become externalized,” but, more specifically,
							that the “drama becomes concentrated to a point of ‘pure’ emotion”
								(Innes, <title level="m">Holy
								Theatre</title> 44, 45), an innovation of Baillie’s. </note> (Both are excerpted in <title level="m">The Broadview Anthology of </title>
                     <title level="m">Romantic Drama</title>.) As do the other
						dramatist-theorists in the holy theatre tradition, Baillie is writing a manifesto: creating drama for a theatre
						that could be—that is, the theatre she wants rather than the theatre she
						has. It is in the “Introductory Discourse” that Baillie develops the idea for which she’s become best known,
						that of “sympathetic curiosity.” She does not just make the point that we
						are curious about other humans, especially when they are experiencing
						emotional trauma, but that we want to fix our eyes on the manifestation of
						such trauma on their bodies and faces—to observe their
						<emph>symptoms</emph>, as it were. To take just one example that works well
						with teaching <title level="m">Orra</title>, Baillie writes that one of the things humans are most curious
						about, yet most scared of, are ghosts. “No man wishes to see the Ghost
						himself, which would certainly procure him the best information on the
						subject, but every man wishes to see one who believes that he sees it, in
						all the agitation and wildness of that species of terror” (359). In other
						words, we are more interested in reactions to ghosts, in witnessing the
						experience of having seen a ghost, than in the ghosts themselves. We are
						aware that it is rude to stare at people, yet we have an overwhelming urge
						to watch people in distress: “how sensible are we of this strong propensity
						within us, when we behold any person under the pressure of great and
						uncommon calamity!” Out of courtesy we will turn our eyes away, yet “the
						first glance we direct to him will involuntarily be one of the keenest
						observation, how hastily soever it may be checked; and often will a
						returning look of enquiry mix itself by stealth with our sympathy and
						reserve” (359). In short, we enjoy staring at others who are experiencing
						emotional turmoil; while we restrain ourselves, and offer merely expressions
						of sympathy, we covertly observe in minute detail the features and
						physicality that indicate the person’s suffering. Such gazes are
						inappropriate in polite society; however, our sympathetic curiosity is
						satisfactorily aroused and exercised by attending the theatre. It gives
						spectators the opportunity to vicariously steal into the closet—and into the
						mind—of another. For, as Baillie writes,
						“there is, perhaps, no employment which the human mind will with so much
						avidity pursue, as the discovery of concealed passion, as the tracing the
						varieties and progress of a perturbed soul” (360). </p>
                  <p n="16">The success of Baillie’s designs to
						allow audiences to trace the varieties and progress of Orra’s perturbed soul
						depend heavily on the skill and style of the actors, and thus it is no
						surprise that her script is filled with detailed prescriptions for gesture
						and movement to convey the internal state of the character. Here, too, she
						is advocating for a transformed, intimate theatre in opposition to the
						conventional performance spaces of her day, which were growing ever larger;
						in “To the Reader” she writes that the “department of acting that will
						suffer most under these circumstances, is that which particularly regards
						the gradual unfolding of the passions, and has, perhaps, hitherto been less
						understood than any other part of the art—I mean Soliloquy” (375). The plays
						she is creating need actors who can exhibit “the solitary musings of a
						perturbed mind” with “muttered, imperfect articulation which grows by
						degrees into words” or “that rapid burst of sounds which often succeeds the
						slow languid tones of distress” (375). These precisely observed descriptions
						remind us of what may be most remarked upon about Baillie’s playwriting, in her own day as well as ours: her
						diagnostically observant eye and analytic, “anatomical” dramaturgy. The
						reviewer from <title level="j">Edinburgh Magazine</title> writes in 1818
						(excerpted in the <title level="m">Broadview Anthology of Romantic
							Drama</title>) that “no one” except Baillie ever thought of giving, in dramatic form, “an anatomical
						analysis, a philosophical dissection of a passion” (381). Her plays work as
						a kind of “microscope, by means of which she seems to think that she has
						brought within the sphere of our vision things too minute for the naked
						intellectual eye” (381-2). The reviewer thinks this is the “radical defect”
						of her plays, but today it is considered perhaps her most brilliant
						endeavor, an innovative theatrical experiment. </p>
                  <p>The names of Joanna Baillie and Constantin Stanislavski are rarely,
						if ever, linked, but he too taught a form of anatomical observation, telling
						his students that, when creating a role, they should first read the text
						carefully for the “physical truths” about the character. The fame of
						American Method acting’s “inside out” approach has obscured other ways of
						building characters and distorted part of Stanislavski’s original teachings; he instructs his actors not
						to “truncate” the “inner line” of a role and replace it with their own
						“personal line,” but to begin with the “physical life” of the character,
						which is tangible. “The spirit cannot but respond to the actions of the
						body, provided of course that these are genuine, have a purpose, and are
						productive,” he explains (<title level="m">Creating a Role</title> 149). Put
						differently, instead of the later Method acting technique of drawing on the
						actor’s own emotional and sense memory, the actor was to take on the
						physical stance, gestures, posture that signaled the emotional feeling of
						the character. By putting oneself into the physical position, the emotion
						would follow. </p>
                  <p n="18">In the eighteenth century, the use of ritualized gestures and poses to
						convey specific states of emotion had been made popular, codified in acting
						manuals that illustrated the proper appearance of the gesture or pose and
						explained what each indicated. (This often seems oddly nonrealistic to us.
						Similarly, in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century avant garde
						theatre, actors would strike archetypal poses, rather than move and pause in
						the realistic manner that’s familiar to us now; these poses were meant to
						convey certain emotional effects, indeed to heighten the emotional effect
							altogether.)<note place="foot" resp="editors">It is not unusual
							for playwrights to prescribe the acting style that fits the view of how
							consciousness is presented in the play, particularly in this holy
							theatre tradition in which realistic causal explanations for behavior
							are eschewed or excised. For instance, Sam Shepard told the cast of
								<title level="m">Angel City</title>, one of his earliest
							experimental plays (written right before <title level="m">Suicide in B
								Flat</title> and predating his turn to more naturalistic family
							dramas with <title level="m">Curse of the Starving Class</title> and
								<title level="m">Buried Child</title>): “Instead of the idea of a
							‘whole character’ with logical motives behind his behavior which the
							actor submerges himself into, he should consider instead a fractured
							whole with bits and pieces of character flying off the central theme . .
							. . In other words, more in terms of collage construction or jazz
							improvisation” (105). See Don Shewey,
								<title level="m">Sam Shepard</title> (New York: Da Capo Press,
							1997).</note> The unveiling or revelation of a character’s internal
						state was a primary feature of late eighteenth-century and Romantic acting
						theories; the matter of expressing a character’s “passion” is considerably
						more complicated than having the actors constantly emoting onstage, which
						would eventually result in a flattened-out performance and not move the
						audience. To express internal states convincingly, performers developed a
						number of techniques that included drawing upon their own memories,
						thoughts, and emotions and transferring them to the character; focusing on
						communicating explicitly the specific <emph>shifts</emph> of feeling of
						thought that a character experiences from one moment to the next; and
						cultivating an attitude of sympathy among the triangle of character,
						performer, and viewer by finding the vulnerability of the character and
						inviting the audience to experience it. As we see featured in <title level="m">Orra</title>, one way an actor would reveal the interiority of
						a character was by focusing on the way the character <emph>reacted</emph> to
						the dramatic situation. As Jonathan Bate has
						written, the popular view among Romantic theatre artists was that “the
						essence of human nature is to be found in reaction, not action, and so it
						was that their performances were most intense at certain moments of
						reflection” (“The Romantic Stage” 97). </p>
                  <p>Baillie’s detailed descriptions of
						Orra’s physical actions and gestures, particularly in her mad scene,
						instruct the actor on how to accurately depict the progression of her fear.
						To see how Baillie’s stage directions
						“direct” the play and help her actors create their roles through anatomical
						analysis, and to experience how physical gestures can work to help
						performers feel for themselves and reveal to spectators the characters'
						emotions, try the following exercise.</p>

                  <p>In this exercise students can test Baillie’s
						instructions to the actor playing Orra in the key scene where she finally
						goes mad from fear (IV.iii). To play the entire scene you will need actors
						for Orra, Rudigere, Cathrina, Theobald, and Franko. You could also choose to
						play just Orra’s soliloquies (IV.iii.27-52 and IV.iii.147-165), as these are
						the moments for which Baillie provides most
						specific direction. </p>
                  <list type="ordered">
                     <item>Make a list of all the stage directions that describe Orra’s

                     <item>To experience the physical life of the character and the “arc”

                  <head>CLASS DISCUSSION</head>
                  <p>What did performing the gestures and actions feel like? Did you ever feel
						fear rising in yourself simply from doing the physical gestures associated
						with a person feeling fear? If so, when in particular did you feel it? Of
							Baillie’s descriptions of a person
						becoming overwhelmed with fear, in what ways were they <emph>accurate</emph>
						and in what ways merely <emph>literary</emph>?</p>
                  <p>How did others look when they played Orra? Which gestures or postures most
						effectively conveyed fear? Which looked most outdated or stagy?</p>
                  <p>The final scene of <title level="m">Orra</title> makes a nice pairing with
						Strindberg's <title level="m">The Ghost Sonata</title> (1907). Orra returns
						to the stage, completely mad, and tells her guardian Hughobert, upon hearing
						the news that his son died, that “the damn’d and holy / The living and the
						dead, together are / In horrid neighbourship. – ‘Tis but thin vapour, /
						Floating around thee, makes the wav’ring bound” (V.ii.208-12). <title level="m">The Ghost Sonata</title> also takes up the notion that the
						living and dead are in “horrid neighbourship” together, with only the finest
						boundary between them, although it does so to more psychological ends. In
						the second act’s famous “ghost supper,” the characters “look like ghosts”
						and have been drinking tea together for twenty years, “always the same
						people, saying the same things, or else too ashamed to say anything” (279).
						“God, if only we could die! If <emph>only</emph> we could die!” the
						character named the Mummy cries (283). <title level="m">Remorse</title> can
						be reintroduced at this point because it also pairs well with <title level="m">The Ghost Sonata</title> when the characters seek to make
						Jacob Hummel (“Old Man” in the <emph>dramatis personae</emph>) awaken to his
						past evil actions and feel remorse for them. Like <title level="m">Remorse</title> and <title level="m">Orra</title>, <title level="m">The
							Ghost Sonata</title> is rather Gothic and could profitably be brought
						into a discussion of distinctions between “Gothic,” “Romantic,” “symbolist,”
						and “expressionist,” for the same elements of stagecraft are alternately
						labeled “Gothic” when describing <title level="m">Remorse</title>, <title level="m">Orra</title>, and many other Romantic dramas and are thus
						often considered “low,” pandering to the masses’ love of being surprised
						with special effects; or they are labeled “Romantic,” “experimental,” or
						“avant garde,” and then considered “high art.”</p>

                  <head>Romantic drama as the birthplace of the modern avant garde</head>
                  <p>When works of the modern avant garde are studied immediately after
							<title level="m">Remorse</title> and <title level="m">Orra</title>, the
						kinship with Romantic drama becomes clear in both the shared vision of
						theatre and the stagecraft employed to realize it. As Peter Brook explains, the holy theatre does not only
							<emph>present</emph> the invisible in drama, it “also offers
							<emph>conditions that make its perception possible</emph>” (56), such as
						theatrical spectacle, lighting, a use of ritualistic devices, dance and
						movement, musical scores and other kinds of sound, and even, in some cases,
							smell.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Amiri Baraka’s use of
							smell in <title level="m">Slave Ship</title> to convey a sense of
							“atmosfeeling” is a good example.</note> Far from being “mere” spectacle
						or surface—an entertaining painted veil—these elements, whether labeled
						Gothic, Romantic, or Holy, are employed to lift or transcend reality. Paula Backscheider writes in <title level="m">Spectacular Politics</title>, in a discussion of <title level="m">The Castle Spectre</title>, that Gothic playwrights who added
						the word “romance” to their titles “signaled their freedom from the
						referential, veridical world of realist texts and allied themselves with a
						highly symbolic art, often reaching for a higher reality or a deeper
						psychology” (156). Theorists of the Gothic, Backscheider continues, have argued that the form “is best
						distinguished by the experience its readers or spectators have, and it is
						now widely accepted as an expression of dissatisfaction with the
						possibilities of conventional literary realism” (156). This dissatisfaction
						leads to the modern avant garde tendency to elevate mood over plot, or
						internal over external states, presaged by Baillie’s work in particular. </p>
                  <p>The twentieth century part of the course looks at Strindberg’s <title level="m">A Dream
							Play</title> (1901); one-act experiments <title level="m">Interior</title> (1891) by Maurice Maeterlinck, <title level="m">The
							Wayfarer</title> (1910) by Valery Briusov, and Wassily Kandinsky’s
							<title level="m">The Yellow Sound</title> (1909); Beckett’s <title level="m">Waiting for Godot</title> (1953), the text seen by Peter Brook as the apotheosis of holy theatre;
						Sam Shepard’s <title level="m">Suicide in B Flat</title> (1976) and the
						off-off Broadway movement; Amiri Baraka’s Artaudian “historical pageant”
							<title level="m">Slave Ship</title> (1967) and Ntozake Shange’s
						“choreopoem” <emph>for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the
							rainbow is enuf</emph> (1975); and ends with consideration of the career
						of Sarah Kane, particularly her plays <title level="m">Blasted</title>
						(1995) and <title level="m">4:48 Psychosis</title> (2000). We also discuss
						the influence of director-theorists Antonin
							Artaud (<title level="m">The Theatre and Its Double</title>
							[1938])<note place="foot" resp="editors">It might be interesting
							for students to note that Artaud’s
							Théâtre Alfred Jarry planned seasons that included Strindberg’s <title level="m">A Dream
								Play</title> (a favorite, intended for his first season, 1926/27,
							but produced in 1928), Büchner’s <title level="m">Woyzeck</title> and
								Shelley’s <title level="m">The
								Cenci</title> (perhaps Artaud’s
							best-known production—as well as the best-known version of <title level="m">The Cenci</title>), as well as an archival reconstruction
							of the story of Blue-Beard and the Jacobean drama <title level="m">The
								Revenger’s Tragedy</title>) (Esslin,
								<title level="m">Antonin
								Artaud</title> 96; Artaud,
								<title level="m">The Theatre and Its Double</title> 99-100).</note>
						and Jerzy Grotowski (<title level="m">Towards a Poor Theatre</title>
						[1968]—probably best known to people outside the theatre from Andre
						Gregory’s descriptions of his participation in Grotowski’s life-changing
						rituals in the film <title level="m">My Dinner with Andre</title> [1981]),
						whose methods and experiments are probably what first come to mind when one
						learns about holy theatre. What often strikes twenty-first-century students
						about this current of theatre is how raw it seems, how earnest or even naïve
						in its search for authenticity; there’s an openness and vulnerability that
						can make contemporary audiences conditioned to irony uncomfortable.
						Contemporary traces of holy theatre are difficult to find; we see them more
						in rave music, light shows, art installations, and communal performance
						events such as Burning Man than in staged drama. Postmodernism so changed
						the tenor of much of the aesthetic that when consciousness is examined in
						contemporary performance, the tendency has been toward a deconstruction
						rather than a search for universals and communality. An important response
						comes in the form of Jill Dolan’s argument for “reanimating humanism (after
						we’ve deconstructed the blind, transcendent universalisms it once espoused)”
						(163) and her conceptualization of “utopian performatives” in <title level="m">Utopia in Performance: Finding Hope at the Theater</title>
						(2005). </p>
                  <p>Film is probably the most engaging and accessible contemporary
						porthole for entering the realms of the holy theatre tradition. As Bert Cardullo notes of modernist avant-garde
						plays, Romantic dramas would perhaps have been “better suited to the screen
						than to the stage, assaulting as they did the theater’s traditional
						objectivity or exteriority and its bondage to continuous time and space”
						(3). Film is a medium that has been friendly to experiments with the
						concerns of holy theatre—consciousness, dream states, alternative realities,
						magic—as can be seen in the popularity of films about consciousness, such as
						Richard Linklater’s <title level="m">Waking Life</title> (2001) and the
						documentary <title level="m">What the Bleep Do We Know?</title> (2004),
						critical acclaim for Julian Schnabel’s evocation of human consciousness in
							<title level="m">The Diving Bell and the Butterfly</title> (2007), the
						work of Michel Gondry (<title level="m">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
							Mind</title> [2004], <title level="m">The Science of Sleep</title>
						[2006]), and Christopher Nolan’s <title level="m">Inception</title> (2010),
						to name just a few recent examples. A work like <title level="m">Prometheus
							Unbound</title> (1820), for example, seems to call out for a film
						adaptation (although the first known staging, by the Rude Mechanicals
						theatre company in Austin, Texas, in 1998 would challenge that statement. It
						was excellent.) While film lacks the communality in liveness called for in
						holy theatre, it can conjure the images and experience of transcendence that
						were desired onstage. Students probably bring a curiosity about the
						philosophical, scientific, and psychological matters explored in these
						films, which may raise interest in seeing how Romantic drama attempts to
						explore them, too, with the result that Romantic drama is seen as relevant,
						even prescient, to our artistic concerns, and as a fertile ground for
						theatrical experimentation.</p>

               <p>In the past two decades, scholarship on British Romantic drama has illustrated
					the centrality of theater to understanding the era’s “geo-historical and
					geo-political” issues, and to appreciating women writers’ previously
					unacknowledged roles in public debates (Purinton, <title level="a">On Teaching</title> 353).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Regarding British Romantic drama and
						international politics, see monographs by Matthew S. Buckley, Julie Carlson, Jeffrey Cox, Daniel
						O'Quinn, Jane Moody, Gillian Russell, and
						George Taylor.</note> Key among these geo-historical and geo-political
					issues was the French Revolution. The dramatic events of the French Revolution
					shaped British Romantic writers’ thinking on social justice campaigns such as
					democracy, women’s rights, and abolitionism. However, our critical lens for
					these international crises often remains rather Anglo-centric, perhaps because
					dramas from Continental authors do not receive enough attention, except in
					contemporary translations. Oft-cited examples include Elizabeth Inchbald’s <title level="m">Lovers’ Vows</title> (1798),
					adapted from August von Kotzebue’s comedy
						<title level="m">Child of Love</title> (<title level="m">
                     <foreign>Kind der
							Liebe</foreign>
                  </title>) or Richard
						Brinsley Sheridan’s <title level="m">Pizarro</title> (1799), adapted
					from Kotzebue’s <title>The Spaniards in
						Peru</title> (<title level="m">
                     <foreign>Die Spanier in
						Peru</foreign>
                  </title>) (Burwick,
					“German Romantic Drama” 157). This paper reflects on the pedagogical benefits of
					incorporating Europe and its drama into Romantic coursework. An eight-day
					teaching unit on <title level="a">
                     <ref target="commons4.2011.nielsen_syllabus.html">Romantic Revolutions in
							Europe</ref>
                  </title> explores the international dimensions of Romantic
					drama. </p>
               <p>Recommending introductory reading about the French Revolution is a rather
					difficult task, and Matthew S. Buckley’s
					recent book, <title level="m">Tragedy Walks the Streets: The French Revolution
						in the Making of Modern Drama</title>, explains why: the ostensible truth
					about the Revolution is as elusive as the tragic drama it evokes. As Buckley and others maintain, one can only
					understand the French Revolution by dissecting its theater.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Paul Friedland, Marie-Hélène Huet, Mona Ozouf, and
						Susan Maslan all dissect theater in order to explicate the
						Revolution.</note> Republicans employed the methodologies of theater in
					order to broadcast Revolutionary propaganda abroad. These theatrical techniques
					also resembled those of the aristocracy and the Church, who communicated with
					the masses through allegorical parades and pictorials. <foreign xml:lang="fr">
                     <emph>Fêtes publiques</emph>
                  </foreign> (or public festivals) replaced
					religious feasts, and actors, actresses, playwrights, and artists such as Jacques-Louis David participated in their
						production.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On Revolutionary
						festivals, see Ozouf and Nielsen ("Staging Rousseau's
						Republic").</note> The first ever use of the term "theatricality" in
					English, as Tracy C. Davis points out, appears in
					Thomas Carlyle’s <title>The French Revolution: a History</title> (1837), and his
					accounts of festivals demonstrate the <foreign>
                     <emph>theatrum
						mundi</emph>
                  </foreign> sense of the word (Davis 132). The playhouses experienced a transformation as well.
					Strict licensing for spoken-word dramas disappeared in January 1791, and
					theaters reenacted the happenings on the streets of Paris with astonishing rapidity. After Charlotte Corday assassinated Jean-Paul
						Marat, theaters adorned their buildings with the bust of the “Friend
					of the People,” and dozens of productions recreated the event for
						spectators.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On productions of
						Marat's assassination onstage in France, see Marie-Hélène Huet's
						book.</note> New playhouses and authors were founded to meet the demand for
					these spectacles, although after 1792, Jacobins began to censor dramas that
					questioned the new order. For example, Jean-Louis
						Laya’s comedy, <title level="m">The Friend of the Laws</title>
							(<foreign>
                     <title level="m">L’Ami des loix</title>
                  </foreign>), faced
					scrutiny because it satirized Jacobins like Robespierre and Marat.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title level="m">L'Ami des
							loix</title> premiered 2 Jan. 1793 and played through 15 January before
						being suspended against the will of the public. See Susan Maslan, esp.
						61-64.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The British press represented the French Revolution in similarly theatrical
					terms. Thus when Burke calls the Revolution “this
					great drama” in <title level="m">Reflections on the Revolution in France</title>
					(1790), he appears to mimic the Republicans’ rhetorical mode (74). Many critics
					have noted the histrionics in the following passage from <title level="m">Reflections on the Revolution in France</title>:<note place="foot" resp="editors">Some reflections on <title level="m">Reflections</title> include those written by Steven Blakemore, Paul
						Hindson and Tim Gray, Jacqueline M. Labbe, Ronald Paulson, Elizabeth D.
						Samet, and Linda M. G. Zerilli.</note>
                  <quote rendition="#indent2">A band of cruel ruffians and assassins, reeking with
						[her sentinel’s] blood, rushed into the chamber of the queen, and pierced
						with a hundred strokes of bayonets and poniards the bed, from whence this
						persecuted woman had but just time to fly almost naked, and, through ways
						unknown to the murderers, had escaped to seek refuge at the feet of a king
						and husband, not secure of his own life for a moment (71).</quote>
                  <lb/> A
					Gothic cast of characters populates Burke’s
					melodrama: the vulnerable queen in distress, the chivalrous father/king, and the
					villainous masses seeking revenge. Burke evokes a
					domesticated ideal of the queen as wife and mother in order to lament the loss
					of chivalry. Other women, notably the tragic actress Sarah Siddons (1755-1831), reminded Burke about his
					<hi rend="italics">true</hi> feelings for Marie Antoinette, whom he met in 1777.
					Recalling the “tears that Garrick formerly, or
					that Siddons not long since, have exhorted” from
					him, Burke admits to feeling “truly ashamed” for
					these “tears of hypocrisy” and “folly;” “that superficial, theatric sense of
					painted distress” hardly compares to exulting “over it in real life” (71).</p>
               <p> While Burke’s histrionic rhetoric has long
					puzzled and amused modern readers, we might compare it to the ambivalent
					theatricality of the Revolution. French theater, politics, and journalism—in
					some respects, one and the same entity—played with the lines between realism and
					abstract representation. Direct representation was a powerful tool of the Old
					Regime, which equated the royal body with divine right and power. So in
					broadsheets, Republicans advertised the death of the nation as
							<foreign>
                     <emph>corpus mysticum</emph>
                  </foreign>, or the mystical
						body.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Dorinda Outram has brought this
						type of iconography to light.</note> In his book <title level="m">Political
						Actors: Representative Bodies and Theatricality in the Age of the French
						Revolution</title>, Paul Friedland insists
					that French theatricality is not what it seems: “Theatrical actors were
					prevailed upon to represent their characters abstractly, in a manner that <hi rend="italics">seemed realistic</hi> to the audience, rather than a manner that
					the actors experienced <hi rend="italics">as real</hi>” (6). Politicians, according
					to Friedland, practiced this methodology as
					well: “unlike previous political bodies that had claimed to <hi rend="ital">be</hi> the French nation, the National Assembly merely claimed to speak on
					the nation’s behalf” (6). So in fact, Burke’s
					sympathetic portrait of Marie Antoinette,
					that “Roman matron,” resembles the representational strategies of the Old Regime
					and the counter-revolution, which also rely on metaphors (Burke 72). Moreover, Burke’s portrait contrasts with Marie
						Antoinette’s reputation in France. Revolutionaries charged the Queen with incest, pornography,
					and other acts of debauchery.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Lynn Hunt
						documents the Republicans' attack on the morality of the
					Queen.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the undergraduate classroom, sharing this theatrical history might help to
					clarify why the French Revolution remains such an opaque subject. Reading <title level="m">The Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen</title> (1789)
					alongside the United States' <title level="m">Declaration of
						Independence</title> (1776) further orients students to the similarities
					between the American and French Revolutions (see Day 2 of my online syllabus for
						<title level="a">
                     <ref target="commons4.2011.nielsen_syllabus.html#n2">Romantic Revolutions in Europe</ref>
                  </title>). A wealth of information
					about the Revolution exists in standard anthologies, and students can learn a
					lot about the early 1790s in Britain and France by reading Helen
						Maria Williams’s <title level="m">Letters Written in France</title>,
						Thomas Paine’s <title level="m">The Rights of
						Man</title>, Mary Wollstonecraft’s
						<title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Men</title>, and William Godwin’s <title level="m">An Enquiry
						Concerning Political Justice</title> alongside Burke’s text. However, sometimes when students attempt to decipher
					the complex events of the Revolution, they may become frustrated with the
					pointed rhetoric that writers like Burke and
						Wollstonecraft employ to debate the
					rights of man and woman. Whereas Paine writes
					with what my students claim is uncomplicated clarity, Wollstonecraft sometimes baffles these
					twenty-first century readers with her series of rhetorical questions, and Burke, likewise, carries a few of his metaphors so
					far that the impatient reader might mistake their meaning.<note place="foot" resp="editors">An example of Burke's use of extended metaphors is the following: "When
						the old feudal and chivalrous spirit of <emph>fealty</emph>, which, by
						freeing kings from fear, freed both kings and subjects from the precautions
						of tyranny, shall be extinct in the minds of men, plots and assassinations
						will be anticipated by preventive murder and preventive confiscation, and
						that long roll of grim and bloody maxims, which form the political code of
						all power, not standing on its own honour, and the honour of those who are
						to obey it. Kings will be tyrants from policy, when subjects are rebels from
						principle" (<title level="m">Reflections</title> 74).</note>
               </p>
               <p>Pedagogy rooted in the dramatic arts could very well lead to a deeper
					appreciation of the Revolution and its legacy in Romantic writing. As
					instructors, we can paint pictures of the different scenes of the Revolution.
					More importantly, students benefit from applying these dramatic techniques to
					their own writing. One creative writing exercise that works well is the
					following. Students write a dramatic sketch between Burke and Wollstonecraft in
					pairs. The setting is a London
					coffeehouse, where the two meet by chance and
					discuss the French Revolution. In another in-class writing exercise, students
					write on an online discussion board (see Day 4). In this
					exercise, half of the class adopts the personae of either Wollstonecraft, Godwin, or Paine, and the other half
					writes an anti-Jacobin response to <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights
						of Men</title>, <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of
						Woman</title>, <title level="m">An Enquiry Concerning Political
						Justice</title>, or <title level="m">Rights of Man</title> in the voices of
					a Church parson, Richard Polwhele, Edmund Burke, Hannah
						More, or another persona of their choosing. I strongly suggest using
					a discussion board, because students adapt easily to aliases online.</p>
               <p>These in-class writing exercises prepare students to write their final essay for
					this unit. One formal writing assignment, <title level="a">Romantic
							Revolutionaries and their Personae</title>, requires students to
					compose a creative writing piece and a critical introduction that analyzes their
					own work and one to three texts from the unit on <title level="a">Romantic
						Revolutions in Europe.</title> In addition to a version of the assignment
					described above, students are invited to convert a scene from a prose work into
					a dramatic sketch. Olaudah Equiano’s <title level="m">Interesting
						Narrative</title> or Mary Prince’s <title level="m">History</title> work
					well as potential screenplays since they feature episodic styles. The success of
					these creative writing pieces depends on how well students are able to construct
					their hypothetical audiences. Instructors might also support the writing process
					by requiring class participants to read and perform their dialogues and scenes
					aloud. These composition exercises serve two purposes. They prompt students to
					articulate the debate about the rights of men and women, issues evoked by events
					in France. Secondly, class participants adopt Romantic
					aliases, and this technique foregrounds authors’ attempts to construct ethos, or
					the invention of authoritative and ostensibly good personae. Of course, in
						<title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Men</title>
					Wollstonecraft critiqued Burke on these very grounds, his apparent misuse of
					ethos: “My indignation was roused by the sophistical arguments, that every
					moment crossed me, in the questionable shape of natural feelings and common
					sense” (77). Rhetoricians have recently rediscovered the powerful role that
					persona, ethos, and creative writing can play in the English classroom.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On composition and creative writing, see
						Starkey's collection. On ethos, see Gonçalves.</note> As Gary Thompson suggests, incorporating ethos into
					the English classroom transforms the process of writing into a type of
					performance: “Seeing writing as performance can direct attention to the nature
					of literacy as dialogic. All forms of communication involve recursion, and,
					ultimately, the socially constructed subject in dialogue with a wider audience”
					(89). </p>
               <p>These same subjects—writers and audiences—faced official scrutiny in the Romantic
					period. To teach Romantic drama and the Revolution means to teach about
					censorship. The Lord Chamberlain's Examiner of Plays, John Larpent, censored
					most British dramas about the French Revolution regardless of their political
						viewpoint.<note place="foot" resp="editors">An example of this
						arbitrary censorship is Edmund John Eyre's <title level="m">The Maid of
							Normandy; or, the Death of the Queen of France</title> (1793), which
						sympathizes with the royal family (see Nielsen, "Edmund Eyre's
							<title level="m">The Maid of Normandy</title>" and L. W. Conolly,
						esp. p. 93). George Taylor and Jane Moody also
						provide excellent references on censorship.</note> This environment
					encouraged self-censorship even when dramas made no reference to Revolution but
					seemed nonetheless incendiary. The refusal of managers to produce Shelley’s <title level="m">The Cenci</title>
					(1819) exemplifies this phenomenon. Friends also convinced Elizabeth Inchbald to withhold her only tragedy,
						<title level="m">The Massacre</title> (1792), from print and the stage (see
						<ref target="commons4.2011.nielsen_syllabus.html#n5">Day 5</ref>). Given
					current concerns about violence in entertainment, students appear ready to
					discuss why these tragedies could or could not be produced, and their essays
					might analyze the suitability of <title level="m">The Cenci</title> and <title level="m">The Massacre</title> for performance. Ostensibly set during the
					massacre of French Protestants in the late sixteenth century, Inchbald’s play actually refers to the slaughter
					of Parisians during August/September 1792. The leading man, Eusèbe, gets caught
					up in the violence offstage, and he fails to defend his wife and children, who
					are presented on biers in the final scene. </p>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">The Massacre</title> also exemplifies a critique of Burkean
					rhetoric about chivalry and its ostensible role in protecting women, and Daniel O’Quinn’s essay on this issue (readily
					available online alongside the text of Inchbald’s play on <title level="s">
                     <ref target="http://www.etang.umontreal.ca/bwp1800/">British Women
							Playwrights around 1800</ref>
                  </title>) makes these connections explicit.
					I like to point out to students that in the French original of the play (<title level="m">Jean Hennuyer, or the Bishop of Lizieux</title> by Louis-Sébastien Mercier), the figure of
					the wife is invited to arm herself, but Inchbald
					alters this event; Eusèbe would not have his wife’s “feminine virtues” disturbed
					by engaging in violence (Inchbald 15).<note place="foot" resp="editors">I discuss the French roots of <title level="m">The Massacre</title> elsewhere (Nielsen, "A Tragic
						Farce").</note> This commentary on women’s supposed defenselessness
					highlights Burkean rhetoric about the fragility of the female sex. </p>
               <p>Romantic drama also augments students’ study of slavery and abolitionism in the
					Romantic period. My syllabus recommends reading Olympe de Gouges’s <title>Black
						Slavery or the Happy Shipwreck</title> (<title level="m">
                     <foreign>L’esclavage des noirs ou l’heureux
					naufrage</foreign>
                  </title>), which advocates emancipation and argues for the
					rights of illegitimate children. The plot of the short three-act play, available
					in English, is as follows. The ex-slaves Zamor and Mirza escaped to an island
					because their master’s steward made sexual advances on Mirza, and Zamor killed
					him. They save the French couple Valère and Sophie, who shipwreck on the island,
					but soon troops arrive and arrest the escaped slaves. Valère and Sophie help to
					free Zamor and Mirza by entreating the Governor, who turns out to be Sophie’s
					father (from a youthful liaison). <title>Black Slavery</title> was performed in
					the prestigious Comédie-Française (then called Théâtre de la Nation) in December
					1789, before emancipation took effect. Among the play’s several production
					difficulties, the actors refused to paint their faces black and instead dressed
					as “Indians,” and lobbyists for the colonists probably influenced poor reviews
					in the press.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Marie-Pierre Le Hir

               </p>
               <p>The author of <title level="m">Black Slavery</title>, Olympe de Gouges (1745-93),
					is a significant figure in women’s history as well. She wrote <title level="m">The Rights of Woman and Citizen</title> a year before Mary Wollstonecraft composed <title level="m">A
						Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title level="m">The Rights of Woman and Citizen</title> is available
						in English online as well. See <ref target="commons4.2011.nielsen_syllabus.html#n4">Day 4</ref> of my
						syllabus.</note> Gouges was guillotined not long afterwards, and her brief
					trial focused on the plot of an unfinished play, <title level="m">France
						Preserved, or the Tyrant Dethroned</title> (<title level="m">La France
						sauvée ou le tyran détroné</title>), because it featured the Queen as a
					character. Although Gouges’s politics upset her contemporaries (she advocated
					constitutional monarchy alongside her fight for human rights), she mirrored
					ideas prevalent in Romantic-era Britain. Like Mary Prince’s <title level="m">History of Mary Prince</title> and Equiano’s <title level="m">Interesting
						Narrative</title>, <title level="m">Black Slavery</title> addresses the
					painful but important topic of sexual violence against women of color. For an
					analytical essay topic, students can compare Prince’s <title level="m">History</title>, Gouges’s <title level="m">Black Slavery</title>, and
					Equiano’s <title level="m">Interesting Narrative</title> and argue which text
					would make Romantic audiences most sympathetic to the cause of abolitionism.
					Student papers on this subject might examine the role of violence in these three
					texts and address the effect of reading in the closet versus seeing a play in
					performance (see <ref target="commons4.2011.nielsen_assignments.html#n2">Revolutionary Violence and Romantic Drama</ref>). </p>
               <p>While several English dramas document the history of slavery and
						abolitionism,<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Jeffrey Cox and volume five of <title level="m">Slavery, Abolition, and Emancipation</title>.</note> the case of
					slavery in France exhibits the far-reaching consequences of the Revolution. The
						<title level="m">Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen</title>
					provoked rebellions in the Caribbean (such as the rebellion in Saint Domingue)
					when colonists refused to extend human rights to slaves. The French abolished
					slavery in its colonies in 1794, but Napoleon revoked the ordinance in 1802. The
					inclusion of this French drama opens up discussion about slavery in the
					Americas. For example, in 1804, Toussaint l'Ouverture helped to found Haiti, the
					first free Black nation in the Western hemisphere. There is material online, a
					nineteenth-century biography of Toussaint l'Ouverture, for further research (see
						<ref target="commons4.2011.nielsen_syllabus.html#n7">Day 7</ref> of my
					syllabus). </p>
               <p>In Continental literary traditions, the term Romantic extends further into the
					nineteenth century than is the case within English Romanticism.<note place="foot" resp="editors">It is also worth considering Romantic
						drama as a genre after 1830. After all, the Danish Romantic writer Adam
						Oehlenschläger (1779-1850) influenced Henrik Ibsen's early historical
						plays. <title level="m">The Warrior's Barrow</title> (prem. Sept. 1850
						in Christiania, now called Oslo) resembles Romantic drama more than
						Ibsen's later Naturalist plays.</note> French Studies reserves the label
					Romantic for writers like Alfred de Musset (1810-57) and Victor Hugo (1805-85),
					whose “Preface to Cromwell” (“Préface à Cromwell” 1827) announces the arrival of
					the movement. For Hugo and Stendhal, in <title level="m">Racine et Shakespeare</title> (1823), “the proving
					ground of romantic doctrine” is not lyrical poetry, but rather historical
					tragedy, the genre that Shakespeare
					introduces to French audiences (Roussetzki 493). Thus Hugo’s accessible text
					demonstrates the impact of Shakespeare on
					literature beyond Britain’s borders, while acquainting students with key terms
					such as the Gothic, melancholy, and the sublime. Musset’s greatest drama, <title level="m">Lorenzaccio</title> (1834) pairs well thematically with Shelley’s <title level="m">Cenci</title>.
					Hugo’s <title level="m">Hernani</title> (1829, prem. Paris Feb. 1830) echoes
					Schiller’s <title level="m">The Robbers</title> (<title level="m">Die
						Räuber</title> 1781, prem. Mannheim Jan. 1782) in its raucous reception.
					However, <title level="m">The Robbers</title>’ theme of the outlaw hero ties it
					to Wordsworth’s tragedy, <title level="m">The Borderers</title> (1795-96/1842), as well. At least two translations
					and performances of <title level="m">The Robbers</title> appeared in London in the 1790s, and Matthew Lewis translated
					Schiller’s politically-charged comedy, <title level="m">Intrigue and
						Love</title> (<title level="m">Kabale und Liebe</title> 1783/84), as <title level="m">The Harper’s Daughter</title> (Covent Garden, May 1803).<note place="foot" resp="editors">G. G. and J. Robinson Keppel published a
						translation of <title level="m">The Robbers</title> in 1795. Keppel
						Craven's translation of <title level="m">The Robbers</title> (<title level="m">Die Räuber</title>, 1781) was performed at Brandenburgh House
						Theatre in 1798 and published in 1799. Perhaps that is the same translation
						that appeared at the Haymarket on 21 August 1799. For Schiller's
						connections to Coleridge, see Carlson.</note> Other German dramas—notably
					Lessing’s <title level="m">Emilia Galotti</title> (1772), Goethe’s <title level="m">Iphigenia</title> (1787), and Kleist’s <title level="m">Penthesilea</title> (1808)—resemble English she-tragedies because they
					feature female protagonists who sacrifice themselves for love and patriotism. </p>
               <p>Another commonality between the study of British and European Romantic drama is
					the recovery of women writers.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The work
						of Catherine Burroughs, Thomas C. Crochunis, Ellen Donkin, Michael Eberle-Sinatra, Judith
						Pascoe, and Marjean Purinton reminds us
						of some of the important scholarship on female dramatists.</note> The canon
					of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century German literature does not include many
					women writers, with the exception of Annette von Droste-Hülshoff (1797-1848,
					once a face on German money), Sophie von La Roche (1731-1807, author of one of
					the first female Bildungsromane), and more recently, her granddaughter, Bettina
					Brentano von Arnim (1785-1859). In fact, women played integral roles in
					eighteenth-century German theater. The actress Caroline Neuber (1697-1760)
					founded one of the first national, non-court-based theaters in Leipzig (where
					she produced Lessing’s first play), and Luise Adelgunde Gottsched (1713-62)
					translated several dramas for the stage. Gottsched—also commonly called by the
					feminine form of her name, “die Gottschedin,” in order not to confuse her with
					her playwright husband—struggled with a problem that plagued other female
					dramatists in Germany: anonymity.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Susanna Kord wrote a compendium that traces the multiple pseudonyms of over
						200 eighteenth- and nineteenth-century female dramatists. On censorship of
						women dramatists in Germany, see Becker-Cantarino and Kaiser.</note>
					Gottsched’s most famous comedy, <title level="m">Pietism in a Whale-Bone Corset
						or the Learned Lady</title> (<title level="m">Die Pietisterey im Fischbein
						Rocke; Oder die Doctormässige Frau</title>, 1736), was attributed to her
					only after her death because it was published anonymously. The field is rich
					with under-researched female dramatists. Christine von Westphalen (1758-1840),
					Schiller’s sister-in-law Caroline von Wolzogen (1763-1847), and even Catherine
					the Great (1729-96) wrote tragedies in German. Writing under the pseudonym of
					Tian, Karoline von Günderrode (1780-1806) composed dramas that typify some of
					the Gothic and poetic tendencies of Romantic drama. Only a few of these dramas
					are available in English such as Gottsched’s <title level="m">The
						Witling</title> (1745) or Charlotte von Stein’s dramatic sketch, <title level="m">Rino</title> (1776).<note place="foot" resp="editors">English translations of German women writers are available, although these
						feature more prose and fiction than drama. See Blackwell's and
						Zantop's collection <title level="m">Bitter Healing</title> and the
						online database, <title level="m">Sophie: a Digital Database of Works by
							German-speaking Women</title>.</note> However, French theater appears to
					be more widely available for English readers. Elizabeth Inchbald even adapted Stéphanie Félicité de Genlis’s (1746-1830)
						<title level="m">The Child of Nature</title> (1781, <title level="m">Zélie,
						ou l’ingénue</title>) for the stage in 1788, and Thomas Holcroft translated
					some of her other dramatic works.</p>
               <p>At the graduate level, students can explore these connections further. I have
					taught a graduate seminar on the European inspirations for Mary Shelley’s <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. We read one of the books the monster found, Goethe’s
						<title level="m">The Sufferings of Young Werther</title> (1774). In addition
					to this text and Frederick Reynolds’s play, <title level="m">Werther</title>
					(1796), seminar participants read Charlotte von Stein’s response to her young
					friend Goethe, <title level="m">Rino: a Play in Three Parts</title>. Stein wrote
					this satirical piece for a matinee at the court in Weimar.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Charlotte von Stein (1742-1827) knew Goethe because
						she grew up in the court of Weimar. Stein also wrote a tragedy, <title level="m">Dido</title> (1794), translated partially by Goodman, p.
						86-88.</note> The Faustian motifs of <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>
					merit the inclusion of Goethe’s <title level="m">Faust</title> (Part 1 prem.
					1829 in Weimar) in such a seminar. Although <title level="m">Faust</title> is
					written in verse (see Walter Kaufmann’s translation for an excellent rendition
					of Goethe’s style), theaters have recently attempted productions of both
						parts.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Cyrus Hamlin's review
						of Peter Stein's three-day-long production of <title level="m">Faust</title>, Parts 1 and 2, in Berlin in 2001. In New York City, the
						Classic Stage Company produced a six-hour-long version of both parts (May
						2006, trans. Douglas Langworthy and dir. David Herskovits).</note> Rousseau
					also influenced the writing of Mary
						Shelley’s famous novel. Seminar participants read portions of <title level="m">Emile</title> (1762) and <title level="m">Letter to M.
						D’Alembert</title> (1758). Rousseau’s <title level="m">Letter</title>
					outlines theories on the theater and is useful for understanding some of the
					issues involving sympathy in <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See David Marshall for a comparison of
						Shelley and Rousseau.</note> I also suggest reading Hugo’s previously
					mentioned “Preface to Cromwell,” since this text details Romantic theories of
					the grotesque. A graduate seminar with a unit on the French Revolution might
					also include Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais’s (1732-99) <hi rend="emph">The Follies of the Day or the Marriage of Figaro</hi> (public premier Apr.
					1784 in Paris), another translation by Holcroft. The Old Regime suppressed this
					sequel to <title level="m">The Barber of Seville</title> (1775) for five years
					and sent its author to prison for mocking the corrupt behavior of aristocrats.
					The bilingual <ref target="http://www.cesar.org.uk/">César database</ref> makes

               <p>Scholars of British Romanticism have long recognized the central role that

						authors.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For comparative studies of
						Romanticism, see Frederick Burwick, Angela Esterhammer, Michael Ferber,
						Lillian Furst, Gerald Gillespie, Gregory Maertz, Martin Meisel, and Virgil
						Nemoianu.</note> European Romantic drama offers many ways to make the past
					come alive in the classroom and to augment the study of late eighteenth- and
					early nineteenth-century literature and history. Moreover, when instructors
					internationalize the Romantic curriculum, they recreate the cosmopolitan flavor
					of London in the years around 1800. Romantic drama can
					play a powerful role in shaping students’ understanding of personae, and through
					creative writing and dialogue, class participants have the opportunity to

                  <head>Background</head>
                  <p> During the spring 2006 semester, I taught a senior-level course in British
						Romantic Drama for English majors, a course that satisfied for them a genre
						upper-division requirement. My first-day assessments of my students revealed
						that several had taken an introductory course in drama, and some had taken a
						junior-level course in Shakespeare,
						but no one enrolled in the course had pursued a course in the Romantic
						period. This course was, therefore, the students’ only contact with the
						Romantic period as well as a course involving the reading, discussing,
						writing, and performing of drama from the 1780s to the 1830s. </p>
                  <p> During the spring 2005, when I was teaching the senior capstone course in
						English, I included Joanna Baillie’s 1798
							<title level="m">Plays on the Passions</title> (<title level="m">Count
							Basil, The Tryal, and De Monfort</title>) in a culminating activity I
						termed “The Baillie Project,” and during
						the fall 2006 semester, I included Baillie’s <title level="m">Count Basil</title> in a sequence of
						plays for an Honors College course entitled Introduction to Drama:
						Tragically Monstrous, a course that is offered as a First-Year Experience
						requirement for incoming Honors College students. The first-year students
						read <title level="m">Count Basil</title> in tandem with Euripedes’ <title level="m">Medea</title> and Shakespeare’s <title level="m">Othello</title>. When I teach the
						junior-level course in the British Romantic period, I routinely include two
						or three dramas, including <title level="m">Count Basil</title> and Thomas
						Bellamy’s 1789 <title level="m">The Benevolent Planters</title> (both are
						anthologized in Mellor and Matlak’s <title level="m">British Literature
							1780-1830</title>). And when I teach the graduate-level course in
						British Romantic literature, I add P. B.
							Shelley’s 1819 <title level="m">The Cenci</title> and Lord Byron’s 1822 <title level="m">Manfred</title> to the two plays from the undergraduate
						course. My point is that while I had integrated Romantic drama into other
						courses I had taught, I had never taught an entire course devoted to
						Romantic drama until the spring of 2006. In spring, 2007, I taught the
						graduate version of the course as an Advanced Problems topic entitled
						British Romantic Drama. This course was actually a “piggy-back” course in
						that it was taught as a graduate seminar and an Honors College seminar for
						4000-level credit for English majors and minors with the appropriate
						prerequisites. </p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Course Description</head>
                  <p> To help students identify what a course entitled Senior Seminar in Studies
						in Drama: British Romantic Drama was about, I supplied the following
						description, which provided them a sense of the cultural and political
						aspects of the course we would emphasize as well as strategies they could
						use for reading the plays:</p>
                  <p>After more than a decade of recovering and recontextualizing Romantic drama
						in Great Britain, we have come to recognize the central role that drama
						played during the period. Romantic drama, staged and read, was its culture’s
						most popular medium, crossing class, national, and gender divisions, as well
						as a serious literary form written by the period’s major writers. Manifested
						in diverse ways (melodrama, gothic, verse drama, opera, pantomime, puppet
						shows, children’s drama, monodrama, tragedy, comedy, burlesque), Romantic
						drama performed, reflected, and influenced the political, social, and
						cultural issues of its day. The Licensing Act of 1737, granting patents to
						the Royal Theatres of Drury Lane, Covent Garden, and the Haymarket, and the
						Lord Chamberlain’s censorship (willingness to grant performance licenses)
						meant that playwrights had to be clever in their stagings of controversial
						and taboo subjects.</p>
                  <p> In this seminar, we will examine diverse plays from the period as
						negotiations of theatrical politics. We will look at the performative
						aspects of Romantic drama, including the role of the actor, the design of
						stages, non-dramatic performances (such as itinerant medical shows), and
						private theatricals. We will consider the thematic and dramaturgical
						handling of the revolutionary and changing Romantic culture from which its
						drama emanated. We will contextualize the ways in which Romantic drama
						engaged with the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries as British
						society became increasingly democratized, commercialized, and bourgeois. We
						will discover how the theatre was a site for performing gender and how
						playwriting was particularly problematic for women. We will situate Romantic
						drama in the history of theatre. </p>

                  <p rend="noCount"> I ask students to come to this seminar prepared to engage in
						interactive learning, to be willing to explore all dimensions of Romantic
						drama as reading and performance texts, as stage spectacles, as serious
						commentary on the period and its culture. I inform them during our first
						class meeting that because my pedagogy and scholarship are informed by
						feminism and feminist theory, they will encounter a learning environment of
						decentralized authority with an invitation to participate in their own
						learning/discovery process, their own knowledge- and meaning-making. I tell
						them that because Romantic drama is a genre that uses performance as well as
						the printed page, they should be prepared to engage in some reading and
						performance activities that will require them to learn affectively as well
						as intellectually. Students are given multiple opportunities to pursue their
						own interests and lines of inquiry involving the drama, and my writing and
						discussion prompts are directive but open-ended. </p>

						activity is a kind of “thinking-on-paper” writing in which you are still its
						primary reader, but I am dropping in on the thinking process. Make your
						reflections honest, useful, and specific. These responses may serve you well
						later in your reshaping of initial reactions and ideas into more
						reader-based discourse for the researched critical analysis assignment. (See

                  <ab> While I recognize that what you may submit may well represent work in
						progress more than a “finished” product, you want to think about this

                  <ab>What do they know about the issue and the play(s) at the center of my

						clearly and persuasively, using primary and secondary evidence? Remember
						that we share the reading and understanding of the dramas, but in order to
						access your arguments and evidence, you will have to supply contextual clues
						and connections. </ab>
                  <lb/>

							(primary-source evidence);</item>
                     <item>Analyze your audience carefully, for it is crucial to your argument.
							Select the best quotations and paraphrases from primary and secondary
							sources to support your major points of development and your argument
							(thesis);</item>
                     <item>Set up the context of evidence (primary and secondary) for your
							audience and make reasonable connections between evidence and your major
							points of development, and then between that supporting point and your
							thesis;</item>
                     <item>Contextualize adequately the evidence for your readers—help them to
							access it and then to see its importance to your argument;</item>
                     <item>Insert primary-source evidence correctly (use MLA Style for in-text
							citations) and explain it thoroughly;</item>
                     <item>Turn to your five secondary sources to supplement your discussion (at
							least one must be a journal article, and only two may be derived from
							online sites);</item>
                     <item>Follow MLA Style (in-text or endnotes) in citing secondary source
							materials (summaries, paraphrases, quotations);</item>
                     <item>Use secondary sources only to supplement your discussion, to
							demonstrate your knowledge of current scholarly discourse about British
							Romantic drama. Points of agreement or disagreement might be included in
							your discussion or packaged as endnotes. Remember that the analysis
							should reflect your thesis, arguments, developments, and discussion.
							Keep the number and length of all direct quotations to a minimum. You

                  <ab> We want our exchanges to be thoughtful, responsible, and professional. As

						Try to ground and situate your comments and responses within our readings,
						cultural or theoretical contexts, or experiential knowledge. In other words,
						we want to avoid communication that is the more student-based
						“shooting-from-the-hip” form and to strive for the more scholarly,

						meetings.</ab>
                  <lb/>
                  <ab> You may also find yourself led outside your “comfort zone” a bit by seminar
						activities that require our reading aloud or enacting parts of the plays we
						read and discuss, experimenting with staging and voice that generally do not
						occur in conventional English courses. Be willing to take risks and to
						exercise creative aspects of “reading” and “learning” that you might
						otherwise leave latent. You get credit for your willingness to participate,
						so enjoy this opportunity, for you have nothing to lose and possibly some

						clustering so that plays can be read dialogically.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For another syllabus and discussion of teaching
							British Romantic drama by women, see ]Catherine Burroughs, “Teaching the Theory and Practice of
							Women’s Dramaturgy,” <title level="j">Romanticism on the Net</title> 12
							(November 1998) [22 February 2010]
							http://www.erudit.org/revue/ron/1998/v/n12/005823ar.html</note> One
						reason for my including so much drama by Joanna
							Baillie is that about one third of my students needed to satisfy
						a major requirement for a single author, and so they were able to do so by
						taking this course that highlighted Baillie
						as its major playwright. I tried to include representative plays by male and
						female playwrights, but we began with three late eighteenth-century comedies
						by women: Hannah Cowley’s <title level="m">A
							Bold Stroke for a Husband</title> (1783), Elizabeth Inchbald’s <title level="m">Everyone Has His
							Fault</title> (1793), and Joanna
							Baillie’s <title level="m">The Tryal</title> (1798). These
						comedies opened onto discussions of Georgian courtship and marriage customs
						that cast men and women in stereotypical relationships that favored men. We
						discovered how Cowley displaces British
						manner and customs onto Madrid, and, like Baillie, relies on disguise and cross-dressing to suggest
						gender-bending in which women gain control over their lives. Inchbald’s comedy, we agreed, brings the legal
						issues of divorce, custody, adoption, bankruptcy, and robbery into the
						contexts of women’s rights and gender stereotypes. While <title level="m">A
							Bold Stroke for a Husband</title> is also a play that stages ambivalent,
						gender-bending heroines, we looked at how gender was even more complicated
						in performances featuring Mary Robinson as Victoria. All three plays show
						the centrality of marriage for women of Georgian Britain. All three comedies
						also push generic bounds. Cowley deploys
						conventions of Spanish intrigue and recycles the motifs of the comedy of
							manners.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See my essay “On
							Teaching <title level="m">A Bold Stroke for a Husband</title> and Other
							Comedies by Romantic Women Playwrights,” <title level="j">European
								Romantic Review</title> 17.3 (July 2006): 351-60, for an extended
							discussion of teaching Hannah Cowley’s
							comedy.</note>
						Inchbald’s play resonates with pathos of
						character and novel-like structure. Baillie’s comedy revolves around subplots of play-making; Marianne
						and Agnes are themselves playwrights in this metadramatic comedy. Because
						these comedies are critical of the culture’s dominant practices, the
						students find them fun, but they help to draw students into Romantic period
						culture as well as into the playwrights’ resistance to its dominant
						ideologies.</p>
                  <p> We next turned to tragedies, beginning the next cluster of plays with Baillie’s <title level="m">De Monfort</title>
						(1798), <title level="m">Orra</title> (1812), and Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s <title level="m">Remorse</title> (1813)—three plays that address sensibilities
						of the early nineteenth-century, including the Gothic. In <title level="m">De Monfort</title>, we continued our exploration of gender-bending
						strategies, but here in tragic forms, and we considered whether or not the
						play holds up a tragic hero for emulation or admiration, whether it hints at
						homoerotic or incestuous relationships, and whether it presents the tragic
						consequences of immoderate passions, especially hatred.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a discussion of the teaching of Joanna Baillie’s dramas, see my essay,
							“Pedagogy and Passions: Teaching Joanna
								Baillie’s Dramas,” in <title level="m">Joanna Baillie,
								Romantic Dramatist: Critical Essays</title>, ed. Thomas Crochunis (New York: Routledge,
							2004), 315-47.</note> We learned how Baillie stages the Gothic, more fully developed, in the
						kidnapping and brainwashing of the tragic heroine in <title level="m">Orra</title>. Like the other plays we had read, <title level="m">Orra</title> puts marriage center stage, as well as the heroine’s
						resistance to patriarchal control. We found that <title level="m">Orra</title> also demonstrates the power of storytelling and the
						consequences to those whose naïve understandings of the world give them
						limited critical ability to discern reality from fiction. Similarly, <title level="m">Remorse</title>, we agreed, explores gender-bending and
						mistaken identities so as to expose the fallacies and inconsistencies in
						social orders that are shaped by misogyny. While Baillie’s tragedies explore the crises for female identity and
						expose the subjection of femininity within patriarchal structures, Coleridge’s tragedy brings early
						nineteenth-century constructions of masculinity under scrutiny. All three
						plays can be read through postmodern lenses as historically specific—both in
						terms of their medieval settings and their Romantic-era contexts of
						composition—enactments of gender; the tragedies’ theatricality and
						performance, furthermore, expose the artificiality and even the fluidity of
						gender roles and gendered behaviors at the very time when codifications of
						those roles were being scripted off-stage as well as on-stage. </p>
                  <p> The next grouping of tragedies—P. B.
							Shelley’s <title level="m">The Cenci</title> (1816), Baillie’s <title level="m">Count
							Basil</title> (1798), and Lord
							Byron’s <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> (1821)—took us into
						deeper and darker spaces of Romantic thought by way of historically based
						incidents and characters. All three of these plays involve despotic rulers
						of corrupt governments, but they similarly feature stories of dysfunctional
						families, thus bringing the crises of public and private spaces together in
						shared space on the stage. <title level="m">The Cenci</title>, like <title level="m">De Monfort</title> from the previous cluster, is a play that
						opens onto discussions of censorship and licensing of plays in the Romantic
						period. The settings of Italy for <title level="m">Cenci</title> and <title level="m">Basil</title>, and Assyria for <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> offer spaces where taboo and disturbing issues
						affecting early nineteenth-century British culture could be displaced and
						displayed. These three tragedies open onto explorations of criminal behavior
						and punishment, the efficacy of language, the function of the public body,
						and the pathology of madness. <title level="m">Count Basil</title> exposes
						the folly of excessive passions, coded masculine or feminine, and the
						segregated and gendered spaces that impede an individual’s healthy
						participation in the public sphere. P. B.
							Shelley’s tragedy presents us also with the problem of morality
						sanctioned by state and religion. <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> adds
						layers of colonialism and orientalism to its questioning of gendered agency
						and effective leadership. All three tragedies hint at Romantic
						preoccupations with transgressive public figures under surveillance and then
						put on trial for their moral and legal infractions. </p>
                  <p> As afterpieces to the course, we read George Colman the Younger’s <title level="m">Blue-Beard; or Female Curiosity! </title>(1798), and Matthew
						Lewis’s <title level="m">Timour the Tartar; A Grand Romantic Melo-drama in
							Two Acts</title> (1811), two plays that demonstrate to students the kind
						of experimentation that was occurring with drama, particularly staged drama,
						during the Romantic period. These two fantasies are fanciful but disturbing
						in their staging of the abuses of misogyny and of orientalism (both set in
						the Near East) under the guise of children’s theatre, harlequinade,
						pantomime, and spectacle. Both Bluebeard and Timour are representations of
						actual figures whose stories become thoroughly mythologized and fantasized.
						Their stories and depictions, like that of Beatrice Cenci, have been
						replayed in multiple forms—theatre, novels, visual arts, opera, and film—and
						we talked about why Romantic theatergoers would find these characters so
						interesting and engaging. </p>
                  <p> To supplement each clustering of dramas, we read, as the schedule above
						indicates, the performance reviews that Cox
						and Gamer have included in the Broadview
						anthology and that Duthie has included in his edition of <title level="m">Plays on the Passions</title> and that are relevant to the play we are
						discussing. The creative discovery activity enables students to work closely
						with these reviews and to think critically about performance aspects of the
						plays. Graduate students work beyond the reviews of the anthology, seeking
						additional performance information and reviews from online and traditional
						scholarly sources in the preparation of their assignment. They may also look
						at reviews of contemporary stagings of Romantic plays.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See, for example, Jeffrey

                     </note>Two other recordings Burwick and Douglass have made and that

						live performance of Thomas Lovell Beddoes’s <title level="m">Death’s
							Jest-Book: A Grotesque Musical Comedy</title> and Inchbald’s <title level="m">Animal
							Magnetism</title>. </p>
                  <p>As we moved to the cluster of tragic plays with gothic overtones, I
						introduced the cluster with a small segment of the video of the Readers’
						Theatre production of <title level="m">A Tale of Mystery</title> (1806) that
						was performed and video-taped at the 2003 meeting of the International
						Conference on Romanticism at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
						The setting of the reading in the St. Joan of Arc Chapel on the Marquette
						University campus was a spectacular way for students to get a visual clue
						about how to read settings in <title level="m">De Monfort, Orra, </title>and
							<title level="m">Remorse</title>. The live accompaniment of the reading
						gave students a sense of how music was, in fact, a vital component to the
						play—something I asked them to pay close attention to in their readings of
						the plays’ stage directions. Likewise, our reading and discussion of <title level="m">Count Basil</title> was enriched by two video supplements. In
						March of 2002, in celebration of Women’s History Month, the Women’s Studies
						Program and the Theatre Department at Texas Tech University worked together
						to present a parlour reading of Romantic period dramas by Felicia Hemans, Elizabeth Inchbald, and Joanna Baillie. We held the reading in the
						parlor of a local, private home, and relied on student and faculty volunteer
						performers, and I served as dramaturg for the production. We videotaped the
						performance, and thus, I have a segment of <title level="m">Count
							Basil</title> as amateur readers’ theatre that I can show the students.
						In August of 2003, the North American Society for the Study of Romanticism
						brought a Horizons Theatre production of <title level="m">Count
							Basil</title> to Fordham University, Lincoln Center Campus for the
						association’s annual meeting. Having procured a DVD recording of that

						Cenci, as demonstrated by the many revisions of her life story in plays,
						operas, novel, and film. For <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title>, we
						looked at Eugène Delacroix’s painting <title level="m">The Death of
							Sardanapalus</title>, 1827-1828 which is on display at the Louvre. For
						Colman the Younger’s play, we viewed Gustav Doré’s nineteenth-century
						illustrations of Bluebeard. <title level="m">Timour the Tartar</title>
						became more accessible for the students with the visual enrichment of
						Skelt’s Scenes from the novel version of Timour’s story, J.K. Green’s
						illustrations of the characters and scenes of the play, and the playbill of

                  <head>Sample Student Responses</head>
                  <p> In the creative discovery activity #2, one student took the reviewers of
							Joanna Baillie’s <title level="m">Plays
							on the Passions</title>, in particular of an 1804 staging of <title level="m">Count Basil</title>, to task. She writes: “…I find Baillie’s
						endeavors to capture the state of one passion incredibly impressive and
						thought provoking. The reviewers seemed to have missed some of the points of
							Baillie’s unchecked and exaggerated
						passions.” A researched critical analysis of Baillie’s <title level="m">Orra</title> explores the
						“patriarchal-taught self-fear” that Orra experiences and its contribution to
						her madness. The student writes: “This self fear is beneficial to the
						patriarchal, hierarchal society because it keeps women in their ‘place’ by
						making them emotionally weak and easily scared. They either run to men for
						help and/or readily submit to men without question.” Another student
						astutely observes gender dichotomies: “[v]iolence directed at women in
						Romantic drama serves the masculine standard by placing the dramatic burden
						firmly on the shoulders of the female characters—both as actor and acted
						upon.… Clearly, Baillie is interested in
						how her contemporaries utilized violence and gender both to control action
						on stage and, in many ways, to control the making of this action.” </p>
                  <p> For the re-staging of <title level="m">The Cenci</title>, one student
						elaborates on the scenery and costuming: “Lighting would be very warm, reds,
						oranges, and yellows…Once Count Cenci reveals the demise of his sons and
						openly celebrates their death, the brightness of the stage will begin to
						diminish and the darkness of the Palace will take over, like a foreboding
						shadow. Beatrice would, like the other characters, begin the play, except
						for Cenci, in drab and colorless apparel, but when she starts to plan her
						father’s murder, she changes to richly colored costumes so that by the
						height of her madness, she would be donning apparel almost equal to the
						richness and color of the costuming worn by Cenci.” Another student proposes
						a contemporary cast for a new film version of P. B. Shelley’s tragedy: Scarlet Johansen as Beatrice, Michael
						Douglas as Count Cenci, Jessica Lange as Lucretia, and Anthony Hopkins as
						Cardinal Camillo. As for an interesting stage effect at the end of the play,
						another student writes: “The Hall of Justice would be a long hallway, with
						the prisoners positioned at one end, each seated in a rolling office chair,
						and Camillo and the judges at the other. As characters are given their turns
						to speak, their chairs roll forward toward the judges, and as they are
						dismissed, their chairs will roll into a doorway off to the side of the
						hall.”</p>
                  <p> A response to 1813 reviews of Coleridge’s tragedy <title level="m">Remorse</title> indicates
						how the student better appreciates the importance of the play’s scenery for
						spectators. He writes: “With these reviews, it was somewhat easier to
						imagine what key scenes would have looked like, the sorcery scene
						specifically. They also gave me a sense of what early nineteenth-century
						audience thought of acting capabilities. By giving our imagination a
						direction, the reviews let me see different perspectives, things I can’t see
						from merely reading the play.” Another student recommends <title level="m">Remorse</title> for a made-for-TV movie, recast as a story about
						high-school kids and cliques. The outsider Alvar would be chunky and nerdy,
						and Ordonio would be thin and popular. Ordonio teases Alvar and spreads
						malicious rumors about his brother, eventually causing Alvar to transfer
						schools, despite the fact that Teresa finds him attractive. When Alvar
						returns to the school months later, he has lost weight, wears contacts, and
						is immediately a hit with the popular crowd.” Another student recommends
						filming Byron’s <title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> for the big screen, with a setting in the
						1940s in Washington, D.C. and involving a congressional scandal with a
						closeted effeminate male and a press leak, so that the story would be about
						the fall of democratic leadership rather than the fall of the Assyrian
						empire. Another student, however, sees contemporary appeal for a movie that
						retains Byron’s Near East
						setting, particularly given our political interests in the very region that
						was seen as vital to the emerging commercial economy of early
						nineteenth-century Britain. A passage from a researched critical analysis of
							<title level="m">Sardanapalus</title> reveals how clothing becomes code
						for sexuality for this reader: “Clothing is used in this play to reveal
						Sardanapalus’ femininity, and Sardanapalus’s preoccupation with battle
						clothing makes him seem less of a man. When Sardanapalus orders his servant
						to bring him a mirror, we see his narcissism, his feminine concern with
						appearances rather than the impending battle for control of Nineveh.” </p>
                  <p> In general, the course evaluations for British Romantic Drama were similar
						to what I receive from other courses I teach, but here are some comments
						that are particularly relevant to the content and delivery of the seminar
						and that indicate how students were able to integrate the learning
						experiences. One student writes: “This class taught me something very
						different; reading drama can be just as fulfilling or more fulfilling than
						actually seeing a play read.” Another student points to the ways in which
						the drama contributed to his self-awareness: “I learned a lot about myself
						over the course of this semester in class. It took me a while to learn how
						to read the plays, but once I learned what worked, I fell in love with some
						of the plays we read. I wish I had taken a course in Romanticism before my
						senior year.” Another student emphasizes connections between
						self-actualization and the drama we read: “Through this class, I have been
						exposed to literature and drama that, up until this point, I had not heard
						of and I was able to learn. I think that the most important thing that I
						have learned about myself this semester is that I really enjoy reading drama
						and that I am drawn to these plays because of their interesting content. I
						think that groupings of the plays are helpful since it allows for
						progression through the semester with smooth transition between plays.” And
						finally, a student admits ending up in this course quite by happenstance,
						but finds it a surprisingly pleasant and instructional experience: “This
						class has been an invaluable learning experience for me. I thoroughly
						enjoyed the curriculum and loved learning about, for me, a new kind of
						drama. Joanna Baillie was my favorite
						dramatist, and I must confess that I took this course because the Shakespeare class was full, but I am
						very glad that I had this opportunity.” </p>

                  <head>Expected Outcomes</head>
                  <p>At the end of the semester, I was able to report to my department chair that
						students who successfully completed English 4312: Studies in Drama: British
						Romantic Drama during the spring 2006 were able to write analytical essays
						that summarized, explicated, and judged diverse cultural expressions in the
						plays we read. The students contributed to class discussions with analyses,
						comparisons, contrasts, and presentations of experiential knowledge informed
						by close textual readings of Romantic drama and reviews. The students
						demonstrated generic and periodic understandings of how literary and
						language studies function through their response papers and the researched
						critical analysis. The students integrated understandings and applications
						of skills acquired through the study of literature and language as part of
						their last response paper (see Appendix), which required them to perform a
						self-assessment and to discuss the ways in which the skills and strategies
						they had acquired in this course would be helpful to them in the future.
						Finally, the students composed a research essay in which secondary materials
						supplement and support close readings of the drama, an essay that was built,
						in part, by the cumulative assignments of the secondary source discovery
						activity, the response papers, the critical analysis proposal, and class
						discussions. By the end of the course, most students were able to identify
						historical and current developments in the study of British Romantic drama
						and were cognizant of the ways in which British Romantic drama reflected the
						cultural and historical issues of the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth
						centuries. </p>
