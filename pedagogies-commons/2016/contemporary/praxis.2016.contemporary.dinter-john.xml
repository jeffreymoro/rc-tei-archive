                <p rend="noCount">This article discusses the theme and methodology of the course
                    “(Post-)Romantic Childhoods in British Literature” as previously taught at
                    Bielefeld University in Germany. The course covered constructions of childhood
                    in British literature from the Romantic period and their appropriations in
                    Victorian and contemporary fiction by Dickens, McEwan, Lessing, and Boyne.
                    Reflecting upon the teaching goals and outcomes, we draw on two fields of
                    research into contemporary literature: constructivist childhood studies and the
                    critical study of Romantic legacies. After an introduction to our terminology,
                    the cultural context, and its implications for classroom scenarios, we outline
                    the syllabus in detail, adding handouts, activities, and tasks as illustrative

                    Childhood in Contemporary British Fiction</head>
                <div type="section">
                    <p>The ideal of childhood in contemporary Western cultures is a legacy of
                        Romanticism. Incarnations of the innocent child as once imagined by Blake,
                        Wordsworth, Coleridge and others are perceived as pervasive norms that
                        continue to inform discourses concerning children, including debates on
                        education, social policy, law, and media. This preoccupation with childhood
                        comes to the fore in a great number of British and Irish novels published
                        since the 1980s. This article addresses this recent trend and the
                        opportunities it creates for the teaching of contemporary literature in
                        English Studies degree courses. It presents the structure, methodology, and
                        content of an advanced undergraduate course on the legacies of the Romantic
                        child as previously taught at Bielefeld University in Germany. Reflecting
                        upon the course’s goals and outcomes, we unite two fields of research into
                        contemporary literature: constructivist childhood studies and the critical
                        study of responses to and appropriations of Romanticism, epitomized by the
                        notion of the post-Romantic. After an introduction to our terminology and
                        its implications for classroom scenarios, we will outline the syllabus.
                        Handouts, activities, and tasks will serve as illustrative examples, which
                        colleagues are welcome to adapt for their own teaching. </p>

                    <p>Contemporary Britain provides a gripping cultural and political context for
                        students’ enquiries into constructions of childhood.<note place="foot"
                            resp="editors"> It must be noted that the syllabus included a novel by
                            the Irish author John Boyne, which is, however, not particularly
                            relevant for the novel’s rendering of childhood. Depictions of childhood
                            in a specifically Irish context would undoubtedly constitute a
                            fascinating subject for research and teaching, too (Frank McCourt’s
                            memoir <title level="m">Angela’s Ashes</title> comes to mind) but could
                            not be included here. Colleagues who are interested in Irish
                            childhood(s) may refer to Dunne and Kelly.</note> Despite its
                        long-standing artistic celebration of childhood and ongoing political
                        investments into child welfare, the United Kingdom has frequently been
                        referred to as “a serious contender for the title of worst place in Europe
                        to be a child” (Micklewright and Stewart 23). Having recently received harsh
                        criticism in the assessment of children’s general well-being from the United
                        Nations and UNICEF (Kehily 7), the UK is notorious for its widespread child
                        poverty and its comparatively low age of criminal responsibility alongside
                        its unusually high number of young offenders held in custody (Wyness 73).
                        Moreover, the media coverage of events featuring binary constructions of
                        children as vicious perpetrators and as innocent victims, such as the public
                        condemnation of the two ten-year-old boys who murdered James Bulger in 1993
                        or the torture and death of Victoria Climbié in 2000, continue to fuel moral
                        panics. Phenomena such as the disintegration of traditional family
                        practices, excessive media consumption, juvenile delinquency, and bullying
                        are often construed as indicators of an apparent crisis of contemporary
                        childhood in Britain.</p>
                    <p>Since the 1980s, fiction from the British Isles has played a marked role in
                        negotiating these very issues. Acclaimed novels by such authors as Pat
                        Barker, A.S. Byatt, Roddy Doyle, Kazuo Ishiguro, Ian McEwan, and Ali Smith
                        have tackled the debates surrounding childhood. Many of these works depict
                        child characters’ subjectivities and attempt to convey cognitive development
                        through formal means, which are specifically available to the medium of
                        narrative, such as free indirect discourse and focalization. American,
                        Canadian, and Australian childhood novels by Emma Donoghue, Jonathan Safran
                        Foer, M.J. Hyland, and Lionel Shriver have been equally successful in the
                        British Isles. Besides fiction, autobiographical accounts of childhood have
                        enjoyed immense popularity in recent years. The contemporary childhood novel
                        is, moreover, explicitly marketed as an emerging subgenre, with a group of
                        leading authors in the field repeatedly commenting upon each other’s works
                        (Dinter 54). The course, “(Post-)Romantic Childhoods in British Literature,”
                        aimed to illustrate the remarkable thematic and formal variety in which the
                        novels respond to Romantic concepts of childhood, by reaffirming,
                        transforming, or subverting their precursors.</p>
                    <p>A crucial point of departure for the Romantics was Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s
                        understanding of childhood as a separate, formative period of life
                        characterized by a condition of natural innocence, as outlined in <title
                            level="m">Emile</title> (1762). Since, for Rousseau, civilization
                        immediately corrupts the state of natural goodness, he outlines an
                        educational program that would form and prolong childhood according to this
                        ideal. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, poetry by
                        William Blake, William Wordsworth, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, as well as
                        books for children by Anna Barbauld, Charlotte Smith, Maria Edgeworth, and
                        Charles Lamb, appropriated the subject of childhood and turned it into a
                        prevalent literary concept of the period. In Blake’s <title level="m">Songs
                            of Innocence and of Experience</title>, childhood emerges as an ideal
                        state of purity, authenticity, and spontaneity. Yet Blake always contrasts
                        the pastoral world of innocence displayed in poems such as “Laughing Song,”
                        “Nurse’s Song,” or “Infant’s Joy” with darker realms of experience, and his
                        poetry also speaks to the harsh social conditions for children of his time.
                        The child speaker in “The Chimney Sweeper,” (from <title level="m"
                            >Innocence</title>) for instance, laments how “my father sold me while
                        yet my tongue, / Could scarcely cry weep weep weep weep” (Blake 18).
                        Wordsworth’s poetry, too, incorporates pastoral child figures, often setting
                        them amid scenes of loss and death. The young girl in “We Are Seven,” for
                        instance, refuses to confront the facts of death on adult terms. Her
                        persistence first seems naïve, but comes, over the course of the poem, to
                        win out over the reductive, rational response of her interlocutor. In the
                        “Ode: Intimations of Immortality,” <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, and
                        other works, Wordsworth employs childhood in distinctly autobiographical
                        contexts as a basis for explorations of memory and selfhood (cf.
                        introductory overviews by Chaplin; McGavran and Smith Daniel; McGillis).
                        Already these examples of two canonical poets suggest that no such thing as
                        one homogeneous, self-evident and fixed concept of “the Romantic child”
                        exists in the literature of the period. Although we are very much aware of
                        this variety, we employ the term “the Romantic child” as a perceived norm in
                        contemporary fiction. It is above all the celebratory stance, the idea of
                        childhood as a near-sacred stage of inherent yet transient goodness and
                        innocence, which has enjoyed powerful afterlives. </p>
                    <p>In our course, one major goal was that learners become familiar with
                        contemporary fiction’s wide spectrum of responses to this received Romantic
                        norm. A major section of the course addressed these responses in detail by
                        examining three thematically and formally disparate novels: Ian McEwan’s
                            <title level="m">The Cement Garden</title> (1979), Doris Lessing’s
                            <title level="m">The Fifth Child</title> (1988), and John Boyne’s <title
                            level="m">The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas</title> (2006). Discussions of
                        the novels drew on constructivist approaches to childhood. Such approaches
                        first emerged in the 1980s with the rise of the so-called “new sociology of
                        childhood.” Directed against a “widespread tendency to routinize and
                        ‘naturalize’ childhood” in a variety of discourses in which it is “regarded
                        as necessary and inevitable, and thus part of normal life” (Jenks 7), the
                        most central assumption in this field is that childhood is a variable social
                        and cultural construct (Prout and James 8) determined by complex power
                        structures. </p>
                    <p>In literary studies, childhood is still predominately associated with the
                        study of children’s literature, although an increasing amount of research
                        into other literary genres has emerged in recent years under the heading of
                        “children in literature.” Several survey texts constitute helpful resources
                        for teachers and students and were consulted for the design of this course.

                        on childhood from a post-Romantic perspective. The largest corpus of
                        secondary literature derives from scholarship on Romantic literature,
                        including, for instance, Judith Plotz’s <title level="m">Romanticism and the
                            Vocation of Childhood</title> (2001) and Ann Wierda Rowland’s <title
                            level="m">Romanticism and Childhood: The Infantilization of British
                            Literary Culture</title> (2012).</p>
                    <p>It should not come as a surprise that this recent interest in constructions
                        of childhood in sociology and literary studies has been paralleled by a wave
                        of research focusing on the multifaceted legacies of and responses to
                        Romanticism. These studies have looked at cultural and literary afterlives
                        of Romanticism throughout Victorianism, Modernism, and Postmodernism.
                        Examples include Edward Larrissy’s volume <title level="m">Romanticism and
                            Postmodernism</title> (1999), Andrew Radford and Mark Sandy’s <title
                            level="m">Romantic Echoes in the Victorian Era</title> (2008), Carmen
                        Casaliggi and Paul March-Russell’s <title level="m">Legacies of Romanticism:
                            Literature, Culture, Aesthetics (</title>2012), and Michael O’Neill’s
                        monograph <title level="m">The All-Sustaining Air: Romantic Legacies and
                            Renewals in British, American, and Irish Poetry since 1900</title>
                        (2007). While the interest in poetic inheritances of Romanticism is
                        certainly not a new phenomenon (cf. earlier publications by Bloom [1976] or
                        Bornstein [1976]), scholarship has broadened its scope as it regards the
                        cultural range of post-Romantic material examined, from poetry to pop music,
                        films, and fiction. Recent studies also increasingly point to the challenge
                        of defining Romanticism as a literary epoch and of conceptualizing the very
                        idea of its continuities or legacies.</p>
                    <p>This research therefore provides a second fruitful point of departure for
                        discussing contemporary fiction’s negotiation of “the Romantic child” in the
                        classroom. A term pervading these studies that may prove helpful is the
                        notion of the “post-Romantic.” This term, which has mostly been used in a
                        historical sense but has hardly been theoretically defined, lends itself
                        well as a structural category to describe the simultaneous affirmations of
                        and resistances to the “norm” of Romantic childhood as found in contemporary
                        novels. Through the prefix “post,” it puts emphasis on the (self-conscious)
                        awareness of historical and conceptual difference as viewed from the
                        perspective of the contemporary. As Michael O’Neill asserts, with regard to
                        twentieth-century poetry, “‘Post-Romantic’ is, in its way, as uncertain and
                        fluid a term as ‘Romantic’; it is a necessary term, however, since, even as
                        poets .&#160;.&#160;. seek to renew the Romantic for a later age, they are
                        conscious of differences from Romanticism” (10). </p>
                    <p>Reading negotiations of the “naturally” innocent child in post-1980s fiction
                        as post-Romantic thus highlights the self-conscious dimension of responses
                        to Romantic concepts in these texts. The notion of post-Romanticism enables
                        students to develop an awareness of literary epochs as heterogeneous
                        constructions, which emerge <emph>a posteriori</emph> and may change over
                        time. In this context, students may be invited to reflect on the importance
                        of maintaining a self-critical distance towards seemingly given concepts in
                        literary scholarship. The importance of such an awareness is of course a key
                        argument of Jerome McGann’s <title level="m">The Romantic Ideology</title>
                        (1985), which points to the risk encountered by any reader of Romantic—and,
                        indeed, post-Romantic—texts of pursuing an “uncritical absorption in
                        Romanticism’s own self-representations” (1).</p>

                    <head>Teaching (Post-)Romantic Childhoods: The Course</head>
                    <p>Our course on “(Post-)Romantic Childhoods in British Literature” was part of
                        the module “Advanced British Studies” designed for third year undergraduate
                        students at a German university. In order to be admitted to the degree
                        program <title level="m">Anglistik: British and American Studies</title>,
                        which is taught entirely in English, students need to demonstrate advanced
                        skills in English (level C1/C2 of the Common European Framework of Reference
                        for Languages). The participants had practiced the analysis and discussion
                        of literary and historical texts in previous modules and had acquired a
                        basic overview of the literary history of the British Isles. They were thus
                        familiar with the tools and literary categories necessary for the analysis
                        and interpretation of poetry and narrative as well as a critical reception
                        of secondary literature. To a lesser extent, they had already engaged in
                        reading critical theory. Noteworthy in the specific context of post-Romantic
                        childhoods is the fact that most participants studied English literature as
                        part of a degree that would lead to the German postgraduate certificate in
                        secondary school teaching. The course was thus directly linked to the
                        practical dimensions of their future professional lives. Moreover, most
                        students would have encountered essentialist notions of childhood in their
                        pedagogy seminars, notions that our course sought to question. </p>
                    <p>Like most seminars at German universities, the course was taught on a weekly
                        basis for a total of fifteen weeks, with each session consisting of ninety
                        minutes. After the introductory seminar, two weeks were dedicated to
                        theoretical approaches to childhood. A historical overview prepared the
                        group for the engagement with Romantic constructions of childhood in the
                        subsequent three sessions, followed by a brief excursion into the legacy of
                        Romanticism in the Victorian era. The eighth session then moved over to
                        cover contemporary British culture and literature. The remaining seven weeks
                        were dedicated to the three contemporary novels before a final seminar
                        summarized what the students had learned. Three “study questions” were
                        assigned by the tutor in advance of each session (see appendix).</p>
                    <p>The introductory session included a group activity, in which students were
                        asked to define what they believed to constitute “childhood” and
                        “non-childhood” in a chart on a handout (see appendix). What became clear
                        through this exercise was that most students’ conceptions of childhood
                        corresponded to a simplified notion of Romantic childhood; often, however,
                        they were not aware of its origins. Furthermore, students’ definitions of
                        childhood always related to what they claimed to be its binary opposition:
                        adulthood. Students referred to aspects such as sexuality, political
                        participation, paid employment, education, and maturity as distinguishing
                        features of what they regarded as two poles. The chart exercise motivated
                        students to start thinking critically about their assumptions. In the final
                        seminar, they were asked to look at the chart again in order to reflect on
                        the learning outcomes. In addition, an enquiry into the course’s title
                        “(Post-)Romantic Childhoods in British Literature” intended to encourage
                        students to identify some of the leading questions and topics of the course
                        by problematizing the implications of the title’s three major concepts:
                        “Romantic,” “post-Romantic,” and “childhoods.”</p>
                    <p>For the next week, students prepared an excerpt of a seminal theoretical work
                        on childhood: Philippe Ariès’s <title level="m">Centuries of Childhood: A
                            Social History of Family Life</title> (1960). Ariès, a representative of
                        the <foreign>histoire des mentalités</foreign>, is known as the founding
                        father of the constructivist approach. He claimed that the modern conception
                        of childhood as a separate stage in human life with distinct privileges and
                        restrictions arose as a product of a complex set of social transitions
                        active since the Renaissance, such as the formation of the private nuclear
                        family, the institutionalization of education, and newly emerging notions of
                        morality. Despite its massive impact, Ariès’s claims have been harshly
                        critiqued from a variety of angles. Students thus also read Roger Cox’s “The
                        Child in History: Introduction,” a short book chapter which outlines some of
                        the major points of attack. In addition, it proved productive to analyze
                        some of the paintings Ariès refers to in <title level="m">Centuries</title>,
                        including Pieter Brueghel’s <title level="m">The Peasant Dance</title> and
                            <title level="m">Peasant Wedding</title> (both 1568), Hans Holbein’s
                        portrait of Prince Edward (ca. 1538), and the portrait of Barbara Sidney,
                        Countess of Leicester with six of her children painted by Marcus Gheeraerts
                        the Younger (c.1596). The group was asked to describe these pictures, paying
                        attention to aesthetic means, such as composition, colors, and perspective.
                        They noticed that children are constructed as miniature adults, wearing the
                        same clothes and engaging in the same activities as adults. At the same
                        time, they noticed that these paintings also function as prestigious status
                        symbols and cannot be taken as representations of a given reality, which is
                        exactly one of the major points of criticism concerning Ariès’s
                        methodology.</p>
                    <p>The second part of this block moved on to more recent theories. Students
                        prepared an excerpt from Jacqueline Rose’s <title level="m">The Case of
                            Peter Pan: Or the Impossibility of Children’s Fiction</title> (1984) as
                        well as the essay “Childhood Studies: Past, Present and Future” by Martin
                        Woodhead. Woodhead reflects upon transformations in research on childhood,
                        which eventually led to the constructivist paradigms of a disciplinary
                        conglomerate he labels “childhood studies.” We discussed these shifts,
                        related them to their previous reading of Ariès, and critically debated
                        Woodhead’s impetus of “‘child centered’ research” which is “built around
                        children’s agency, their rights and well-being” (25). This agenda partly
                        undermines a constructivist approach as it claims knowledge of “the child”
                        in a process that is, from the start, governed by adults. Rose’s text makes
                        a similar point as it deconstructs children’s fiction as: <quote>a world in
                            which the adult comes first (author, maker, giver) and the child comes
                            after (reader, product, receiver), but where neither of them enter the
                            space in between. To say that the child is inside the book—children’s
                            books are after all as often as not <emph>about</emph> children—is to
                            fall straight into a trap. It is to confuse the adult’s intention to get
                            at the child with the child it portrays. If children’s fiction builds an
                            image of the child inside the book, it does so in order to secure the
                            child who is outside the book, the one who does not come so easily
                            within its grasp. (58, emphasis in original)</quote> As this quotation
                        suggests, Rose problematizes numerous common assumptions about children’s
                        literature. In order to give students an idea of the heated debates Rose
                        triggered amongst scholars, a longer exercise consisted of reading part of
                        Perry Nodelman’s response entitled “The Case of Children’s Fiction: Or The
                        Impossibility of Jacqueline Rose” and relating it to the texts previously
                        read in class.</p>
                    <p>With these theoretical foundations in mind, the fourth seminar gave a broad
                        overview of changing conceptions of childhood in Britain in their social and
                        historical contexts. Harry Hendrick’s “Constructions and Reconstructions of
                        British Childhood: An Interpretative Survey, 1800 to the Present” served as
                        the basis for discussion. Hendrick emphasizes the crucial role of ideology
                        and the desire for control pervading adult perspectives on what constitutes
                        a “proper” childhood (60). He thus introduces the function of constructions
                        of childhood as <emph>norms</emph>, a concept relevant to understanding the
                        lasting power of Romantic ideas of the child in literary texts. Powerpoint
                        slides helped to summarize the central authoritative constructions of
                        childhood listed by Hendrick (including, for example, the “Natural” and the
                        “Romantic child,” the “delinquent child,” the “schooled child,” the “child
                        of the nation,” and the “psychological child”). In a group exercise,
                        students worked with two documents that exemplified Hendrick’s claims: an
                        extract from Rousseau’s <title level="m">Emile</title> (1762) and John
                        Locke’s <title level="m">Some Thoughts Concerning Education</title> (1693).
                        As the authors and origin of the text passages were not given to the
                        students, they had to deduct which of Hendrick’s concepts the respective
                        text advocated and guess the authors themselves.</p>
                    <p>This overview paved the way for two weeks focusing on literature from the
                        Romantic period. For the fifth session, students prepared a section from
                        Aidan Day’s introduction to Romanticism that focuses on “Constructions of
                        the term ‘Romantic’” as well as three of Wordsworth’s shorter lyric poems,
                        “We are Seven,” “Lucy Gray,” and “My Heart Leaps up When I Behold.” The
                        chronology was reversed here and Blake was discussed in the subsequent week,
                        so that a full seminar could be devoted to the <title level="m">Songs of
                            Innocence and of Experience</title>. Day’s chapter served to reactivate
                        students’ prior knowledge of the Romantic period and its key authors,
                        concepts, and literary practices. Day also emphasizes the fact that literary
                        epochs are always conceptualized retrospectively: “the identification and
                        historical description of a named British Romantic movement really began to
                        take shape only in the second half of the [nineteenth] century” (87). This
                        insight may help students more generally to understand how childhood came to
                        be associated prominently with the Romantics. Powerpoint slides helped to
                        briefly outline concepts such as the sublime, the elevation of the poet as
                        prophet, and the poetic focus on subjectivity and authenticity. Some of
                        these issues could be linked to ideas of childhood as encountered earlier in
                        the seminar series, for example in Hendrick’s text. The second half of the
                        seminar was then dedicated to Wordsworth’s poems. The aim was to highlight
                        his use of natural motifs in relation to children, the role of the
                        autobiographical self, and the function of the seeming simplicity of verse
                        structures and other linguistic features that support the idea of childhood
                        as a superior state, which is celebrated by the speaker. The advantage of
                        Wordsworth’s shorter works for the teaching scenario was clearly the
                        accessibility of these texts in terms of vocabulary and structure. <title
                            level="m">The Prelude</title>, the Immortality Ode, and other longer
                        works were briefly introduced by the lecturer and suggested as possible
                        topics for student essays.</p>
                    <p>The next seminar then took a chronological step backwards, looking at Blake’s
                            <title level="m">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</title> in their
                        entirety. At home, the students had researched the pastoral tradition and
                        acquired contextual information on Blake’s illustration and writing
                        practices from Mary Lynn Johnson and John E. Grant’s introduction to the
                            <title level="m">Songs</title> (Blake 811). They were also asked to
                        think about similarities and differences between the introductory poems to
                        the volume’s two sections, which helped to explore the opposing states of
                        innocence and experience. Divided into five groups, the class studied “The
                        Lamb,” “Little Black Boy,” and “The Chimney Sweeper” from the <title
                            level="m">Innocence</title> section, as well as “Holy Thursday” and “The
                        School Boy” from the <title level="m">Experience</title> section. The form
                        and content of Blake’s seemingly simple yet symbolically charged lyrics were
                        analysed, with special attention paid to their uses and their
                        functionalization of childhood. Similarities with and differences to
                        Wordsworth were examined, for example with regard to the function of the
                        lyrical persona, religious motifs, and the hymn-like structure of many of
                        Blake’s “songs.”</p>
                    <p>Having thus covered some canonical Romantic conceptualizations of childhood,
                        while also pointing out differences among poets, the course then took a
                        brief excursion into the Victorian period, taking as a point of focus
                        Chapters I to IV of Charles Dickens’s <title level="m">Oliver Twist
                        </title>(1837–39). The novel was introduced as central to the ambivalent
                        “cult” of childhood in Victorian literature and culture. The Victorians were
                        also the first in England to establish the idea of Romanticism as a literary
                        movement as such—in a way, acting as posthumous creators of the Romantics.
                        Finally, Dickens constitutes an initial canonical example for discussing
                        post-Romantic textual strategies—how authors adopt, but also extend or
                        subvert aspects of Wordsworth’s or Blake’s Romantic childhoods. The session
                        was introduced with a historical contextualization of the themes covered in
                            <title level="m">Oliver Twist</title>. The class gained a more profound
                        idea of the miserable condition of the lower classes in Victorian England,
                        looking at the situation in the workhouses and key government policies, such
                        as the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act. The classroom discussion of the novel
                        was partly informed by an article on childhood in Dickens by Robert Newsom,
                        who delineates but also questions Dickens’s decisive role in perpetuating
                        Romantic ideas of childhood in fiction. The students examined the beginning
                        of <title level="m">Oliver Twist</title> in regard to its melodramatic
                        sentimentalizing of the child character, its use of an authorial narrator
                        and irony, hyperbole, and other tropes. While the class easily recognized
                        continuations from Wordsworth’s and Blake’s works, they also reflected on
                        alterations in comparison to Romantic constructions of the child. These were
                        also related to the different characteristics and techniques of the social
                        novel as opposed to poetry. </p>
                    <p>The subsequent session left the nineteenth century behind and addressed the
                        current state of childhood in Britain. An inquiry into the alleged crisis of
                        childhood from the Thatcher years up to the present day provided the first
                        thematic focus. Students began by reading a copy of the entry “Disappearance
                        of Loss of Childhood” from Allison James and Adrian James’s <title level="m"
                            >Key Concepts in Childhood Studies</title>. James and James refer to
                        Neil Postman’s thesis that there has been a disappearance of childhood in
                        contemporary society based on the transition from textual to visual media.
                        Students were asked to scrutinize some of the rather problematic arguments
                        Postman provides and to formulate counter-arguments to his hypothesis. They
                        referred to the opposing thesis of a prolongation of childhood and
                        adolescence in late modernity, the datedness of Postman’s argument in the
                        age of the digital revolution as well as his ignorance regarding children’s
                        media literacies. Students were then asked to debate how Phil Scraton’s more
                        nuanced texts and the newspaper article by Amelia Hill et al. position
                        themselves towards the notion of a crisis of childhood and what historical
                        factors and incidents they refer to. Then the discussion shifted to
                        literature. Of particular interest were Katherina Dodou’s claims that
                        “[w]hat is particular about contemporary fiction is the prevalence of the
                        aim to scrutinize the idea that the child is inherently innocent and that
                        this innocence is precious and worth protecting” and that “the contemporary
                        novel invites an approach to the child that views it as an artifact” (239,
                        249). These claims clearly relate to Romantic notions of childhood as
                        previously discussed in class. Furthermore, Dodou points to a
                        “self-consciousness” of contemporary texts concerning their literary
                        precursors, which provides an overarching theme according to which one could
                        analyze the three contemporary novels. </p>
                    <p>The first of these novels was Ian McEwan’s <title level="m">The Cement
                            Garden</title> (1979). Narrated retrospectively by Jack, the eldest
                        brother, the novella depicts a summer in the lives of four siblings who
                        decide to encase their mother’s corpse in cement in the basement of their
                        house instead of informing the local authorities of her death. Without any
                        parental supervision, the children engage in a series of transgressive
                        activities, which climax in sexual intercourse between Jack and Julie, the
                        eldest sister. Whilst obviously breaking with the ideal of childhood as a
                        state of innocence, the novella equally perpetuates and partially perverts
                        simplified notions of Romantic childhood. This shows in the child
                        characters’ primitivism, their utopian spirit, and the nature vs. nurture
                        debate, captured in the once highly stylized and later overgrown garden.
                        After a brief introduction to McEwan’s life and the prevalence of the theme
                        of childhood in his oeuvre (based on Childs), the first exercise consisted
                        of a close reading of the novella’s first paragraph. The students recognized
                        that the paragraph introduces several of the central conflicts and sets up
                        the particular style of Jack’s narration. Further exercises included an
                        analysis of the novella’s constructions and transformations of spaces and
                        temporalities. Noteworthy aspects are the role of the basement as the sphere
                        of the unconscious and the repressed, the garden as a symbol of patriarchy,
                        and the fairytale-like atmosphere evoked by images of sleep and references
                        to timelessness, which prompted several students to a Freudian reading. The
                        lecturer used the opportunity to point out the significant ramifications
                        Freudian psychoanalysis brought about in the twentieth century by
                        introducing theories of infant sexuality. An analysis of McEwan’s
                        constructions of gender and sexuality followed, including the power struggle
                        between Jack and Julie, the employment of the male gaze, Tom’s cross
                        dressing, and the idea of original sin.</p>
                    <p>The next novel considered was Doris Lessing’s <title level="m">The Fifth
                            Child</title> (1988), published only nine years after <title level="m"
                            >The Cement Garden</title>, at the height of Thatcherism in Britain.
                        Often interpreted as a Gothic narrative (Anievas Gamallo 115), the novella
                        focuses on the couple Harriet and David Lovatt whose family idyll shatters
                        when their eponymous fifth child Ben is born. Narrated by a third-person
                        narrator and internally focalized through Harriet (and thus formally
                        distinct from <title level="m">The Cement Garden</title>) Lessing’s novella
                        constructs Ben as a deviant, violent, and opaque child. Ben’s perspective,
                        in contrast, is left out. The aim of the first session was to read Ben as an
                        allegorical figure against the backdrop of Thatcherism, as initiated by one
                        of the study questions. As various scholars have noted, Ben can be viewed as
                        “figure of the ‘enemy within’” (Yelin 104) as “Lessing utilizes the
                        xenophobic paranoia characteristic of Britain in the aftermath of the
                        Falklands War as a departure point for a comprehensive satirical dismantling
                        of the contradictions and paradoxes that render Thatcherism unsustainable
                        and doom it to collapse” (Brock 7). After a broad introduction to the 1980s
                        in Britain, students analyzed the Lovatt family as a microcosm of
                        Thatcherism (Brock 7). </p>
                    <p>The subsequent session drew attention to the issue of childhood as it focused
                        on Ben and his constellation to the other child characters. In a close
                        reading of Ben’s birth (Lessing 59–62), students explored the strategies and
                        metaphorical language the narrator employs to construct Ben as “the other.”
                        At this point the tutor also introduced Freud’s notion of “the uncanny” as a
                        possible approach to read his otherness. Afterwards, students compared the
                        literary construction of Ben to his siblings Helen, Luke, and Paul whose
                        “fair hair and blue eyes and pink cheeks” (27) can be read as a
                        stereotypical reference to Romantic imagery of childhood. The major aim of
                        this exercise was to make students aware of the fact that Lessing
                        self-consciously juxtaposes and complicates different constructions of
                        childhood. Whereas Ben clearly deviates from the norm of the innocent and
                        endearing child, he nevertheless remains the novel’s center of attention; by
                        contrast, the other child characters do not advance beyond their status as
                        rather underdeveloped archetypes. </p>
                    <p>The final two sessions on contemporary fiction dealt with John Boyne’s
                        controversial <title level="m">The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas</title> (2006)
                        and its 2008 film adaptation by Mark Herman. The novel is set in Nazi
                        Germany, a challenging and problematic context for negotiating childhood. It
                        concerns the unlikely friendship between Bruno, the nine-year-old son of an
                        SS officer, and Shmuel, a Jewish boy imprisoned in a death camp. Again
                        narrated by a third-person narrator and internally focalized through Bruno,
                        the novel instrumentalizes and exaggerates concepts of childhood innocence
                        and ignorance as Bruno displays no knowledge whatsoever of the Nazi regime.
                        Two study questions prepared the students for a discussion of the allegation
                        that the novel downplays the cruelty of the Holocaust. In addition, they
                        were asked to come up with two study questions themselves and to post them
                        on the course’s e-learning platform.</p>
                    <p>Bearing the controversies in mind, the first session on Boyne also gave
                        students time to reflect on whom they considered to be the novel’s target
                        audience, based on its narrative techniques, plot, and themes. The novel can
                        be approached as a work of crossover fiction, being marketed for children
                            <emph>and</emph> adult readers. The following seminar then looked in
                        more detail at the sentimental functionalization of Romantic childhood by
                        means of character construction, narrative perspective, and setting. These
                        issues were taken up again when discussing excerpts of the film adaptation
                        of the novel. Here, the students could practice translating their acquired
                        knowledge about childhood from narrative texts to film. Participants
                        examined how the film struggles to approximate the novel’s construction of
                        the child characters’ strikingly limited capacity to “see,” evident, for
                        example, in Bruno’s inability to interpret the symbolic meaning of the
                        swastika.</p>
                    <p>The final week concluded the course by returning to the chart on “childhood”
                        and “non-childhood” compiled in week one, an exercise that enabled students
                        to revise their original preconceptions about childhood. In order to
                        recapitulate the knowledge acquired throughout the course, groups worked on
                        an unmarked end of term quiz, which included one question for each week’s
                        contents. Based on the seminar group’s feedback and the tutor’s own
                        reflections, we can conclude that the course achieved most of its goals. The
                        students appreciated that the subject of childhood serves as a point of
                        departure to explore a great variety of socio-political contexts (e.g., the
                        Victorian workhouse and the New Right in Britain), theoretical approaches
                        (e.g., the history of mentalities and psychoanalysis), and aesthetic and
                        formal concepts (e.g., the sublime and the pastoral). They also found the
                        study questions particularly helpful. A point of criticism was the high
                        workload, particularly the lengthy texts. From the tutor’s point of view, it
                        can be noted that the particular design of this course afforded a great
                        amount of preparation and marking. This was largely due to the size of the
                        group (forty students), which made it difficult to include more
                        learner-centered activities, such as student presentations. Whereas in the
                        class discussions students demonstrated a profound understanding of the
                        constructivist approach, some of the essays still displayed essentialist
                        notions of childhood. This could be seen as a consequence of the demanding,
                        often meta-theoretical, issues addressed in this course. It must also be
                        admitted that the course excluded over one hundred and fifty years of
                        British literary history between the early Victorian period and the present,
                        which could also have been studied in terms of post-Romantic engagements
                        with childhood. However, as we hope to have shown, the topic of
                        post-Romantic childhoods provides further scope for both research and
                        teaching. </p>
