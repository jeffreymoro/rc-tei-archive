                <p>Any discussion of teaching the Romantic with the contemporary will necessarily
                    invite questions about the relative value accorded to each of the literary
                    historical periods being brought into relation. Are we introducing contemporary
                    texts (or debates or images) into our classrooms in order to “sell” Romanticism
                    (to make it appear more relevant; more interesting; more, in our
                    common-but-unfortunate parlance, “sexy”)? And is this type of appeal, arising
                    out of a well-intentioned attempt to maintain a space for Romanticism in our
                    curricula, misguided? (That is, are we merely reinforcing the secondary status
                    we’re attempting to correct for?) Will comparisons between contemporary and
                    Romantic texts always remain superficial? Does a presentist approach to pedagogy
                    depreciate the texts under study by undermining their historical specificity?
                    Might we, on the other hand, be giving the false impression that contemporary
                    phenomena are simply a given and <emph>only</emph> distant historical phenomena
                    are worthy of intensive analysis? I won’t be able to address all of these
                    questions here—not least because I don’t think I have all of the answers to
                    them—but these are the kinds of questions that inform the present essay. </p>
                <p>I’ve been tempted to call my contribution to this special issue a defense of
                    “relatability”: a persistent pedagogical bugbear that has of late been
                    challenged, to widespread acclaim, in the popular press as well (see Mead and
                    Onion). The idea that literature should be “relatable,” critics argue, is
                    symptomatic of an epidemic of narcissism, evidence of a prevailing cultural
                    aversion to difference. The ubiquity of the selfie (casual but posed
                    self-portraiture, usually shared on social media) is often taken to be
                    emblematic of this millennial penchant for naval-gazing. While I remain
                    ambivalent about the term “relatability,” I have to admit that it’s true: I
                        <emph>am</emph> defending the impulse to relate as a far more complex and
                    generative response than these critics suggest. More importantly, though, I hope
                    to offer an argument toward <emph>using</emph> relatability, especially when
                    teaching the novel (the genre that has, since its emergence in
                    mid-eighteenth-century Britain, been seen as most susceptible to this sort of
                    response). The idea that literary texts (and, more precisely, literary
                    characters) ought to be relatable, ought to respond readily to the advances of
                    readerly identification, does, indeed, pose a pedagogical challenge. I, too,
                    want my students to think about the choices that go into crafting a character
                    and the implicit formal laws by which a character must abide, rather than simply
                    responding to that character as if it were fully human. </p>
                <p>However, I think this impulse to connect (or to seek connection where it is found
                    lacking) also holds the potential to open up fruitful conversations in the
                    classroom about how we read now (and how they used to read back then). In
                    particular, I aim here to sketch out a series of attempts to use contemporary
                    texts to disrupt students’ assumptions about their emotional and psychological
                    distance from Romantic-era fiction. Rather than dismissing talk of readerly
                    identification, I have attempted to leverage my students’ desire to relate in
                    order to launch a discussion of historical reading practices and the emergence
                    of relatability as a value. To put it another way, I use my classroom as a site
                    for uncovering the prehistory of relatability. These conversations require both
                    careful historicizing and, at the same time, a willingness to remain limber
                    enough to move between kinds of texts, between kinds of attention, and between
                    points in time.</p>
                <p>My current thoughts on these questions were prompted by an obstacle I encountered
                    while teaching a unit on sentimental reading in my Gothic novel course. My aim
                    in this series of class meetings was to help students connect the sentimental
                    novel to the Gothic as they completed Ann Radcliffe’s <title level="m">The
                        Mysteries of Udolpho </title>(1794) and took up Jane Austen’s <title
                        level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> (1817). I provided them with background
                    on the culture of sensibility, and we read passages from eighteenth-century
                    letters describing the (for my students, peculiarly) physical response readers
                    had to novels like <title level="m">Clarissa </title>(such as Sarah Fielding’s
                        <title level="m">Remarks on </title>Clarissa [1749]: “Tears without Number
                    have I shed .&#160;.&#160;.”; or her brother Henry’s letter to Richardson: “I
                    then melt into Compassion, and find what is called an Effeminate Relief for my
                    Terror”). This background reading informed our discussion of Austen’s famous
                    defense of novel reading and, as I argued, its inextricability from an
                    understanding of novel reading as a shared experience. You’re no doubt familiar
                    with Austen’s digression: <quote> if a rainy morning deprived [Catherine and
                        Isabella] of other enjoyments, they were still resolute in meeting in
                        defiance of wet and dirt, and shut themselves up, to read novels together.
                        Yes, novels;—for I will not adopt the ungenerous and impolitic custom so
                        common with novel writers, of degrading by their contemptuous censure the
                        very performances, to the number of which they are themselves adding—joining
                        with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such
                        works, and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine,
                        who, if she accidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over its insipid
                        pages with disgust. (23)</quote> I won’t rehash here the contours of a
                    discussion I’m sure many of my readers have led in their own classrooms, but I
                    will say that the discussion of <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> in my
                    classroom tends to highlight the ways that novel reading as a practice is
                    experienced as both performed and shared—from Catherine and Isabella’s
                    relentlessly annoying, fashionable slang (“[A]re [the novels] all horrid, are
                    you sure they are all horrid?”) to the moment when Eleanor Tilney throws her
                    brother under the bus in Catherine’s presence, outing him as a selfish, solitary
                    reader: “I remember that you undertook to read [<title level="m">The Mysteries
                        of Udolpho</title>] aloud to me, and that when I was called away for only
                    five minutes to answer a note, instead of waiting for me, you took the volume
                    into the Hermitage-walk, and I was obliged to stay till you had finished it”
                    (77). My students and I use these passages (and others) to think about the ways
                    that reading practices are both representative of cultural trends and, at the
                    same time, constitutive of character.</p>
                <p>While this particular course had gone well up to this point, in this unit I found
                    it difficult to help my students consider the socio-historical specificity of
                    the culture of sensibility without dismissing out of hand the reading practices
                    we were discussing, most of which they found simply bizarre. My students, in a
                    rare united voice, expressed a knowing disdain for the reading practices of the
                    readers and protagonists of Gothic fiction. The complaint concentrated around a
                    claim about unbridgeable historical distance: people just aren’t like that these
                    days (and so, it followed, my students couldn’t be expected to understand these
                    aberrant historical creatures). It seems to me that the choice before me in this
                    kind of moment is between, on the one hand, taking advantage of that historical
                    distance and, on the other, mitigating it. In this particular instance, when
                    what I wanted my students to understand was precisely the collective experience
                    of immersive reading, I chose the latter. </p>
                <p>Trying to find an analog for these intense—and shared—emotional experiences of
                    literary texts, I came to our next class armed with examples from our
                    contemporary culture: YouTube reaction videos. </p>

                    neo-Gothic), depicting moments of intense affective response alongside a running
                    narrative of that response provided for the benefit of the reader. Consider the
                    case of Nutty Madam, a devoted “Twi-hard” who posts short videos to discuss the
                        <title level="m">Twilight </title>novels and to react to film trailers,
                    celebrity gossip, or book news. Nutty Madam shrieks, sobs, covers her mouth or
                    her eyes, bounces urgently in anticipation of a particular character’s
                    appearance on screen. She leans in closer to her webcam until her face floods
                    the screen, and then flings herself away from her computer, disappearing from
                    view entirely. She is utterly solitary (never joined by a fellow host) but also
                    affectionately chummy with her viewers, greeting them with an eager “Hiya!” and
                    joining the conversation in the (always lengthy, sometimes nasty) comment
                    threads below. She has, by virtue of her videos, become a minor celebrity; she
                    is invited to film premieres and tasked by various entertainment news outlets
                    with interviewing actors. </p>
                <p>Invariably, the creators of these reaction videos fill their (and our) screens,
                    their legible facial expressions clearly the main event. In most cases, the
                    viewer does not actually see what the subject is seeing (though in rare cases an
                    inset image displays the clip that is being responded to). Often, however, the
                    videos assume prior knowledge of the clip being viewed by the subject. In other
                    words, the reaction of the subject is more entertaining if the viewer can, on
                    her own, anticipate and then call up the particular images that are eliciting a
                    corresponding response from the subject. In this way, the videos experiment with
                    a kind of asynchronous shared viewing experience, even as the subject draws
                    particular attention and the viewer sharing this experience remains unknown
                    (save for any supplementary interaction in the comments). This shared viewing is
                    complicated further by the fact that the clips to which subjects react are often
                    adaptations; this means that levels of familiarity with the shared text are
                    layered. When watching the reaction to a movie trailer, for example, a viewer
                    may be looking for both the response to the trailer which she has already seen
                    and, at the same time, the response to a depiction that deviates in some way
                    from a representation in the book both she and the subject have previously
                    read.</p>
                <p>These videos, like the novels we discussed in class, triangulate the experience
                    of readerly interaction in a fascinating—if somewhat unsettling—way. Our
                    viewings led to a lively discussion about the physical performance of affect,
                    about both Romantic and contemporary fandoms (subcultures organized around
                    shared fascinations with a particular cultural phenomenon), and about why
                    certain characters might be more likely to provoke an intense response of
                    identification or revulsion (for more on Romantic fandom, see Eisner; on fandom
                    more broadly, see Jamison). This discussion also led to a serious consideration
                    of how gender expectations figure into our understanding of companionate reading
                    and performed emotion. My students, most of them women, traced some of their own
                    initial distaste to concerns about the performance of affect as the performance
                    of a certain kind of femininity (and, in particular, to a sense that to cry
                    publicly would mean exposing vulnerability). These concerns seemed to be
                    troubled, if not resolved, by the realization that the work of orchestrating and
                    then broadcasting public crying imbricates vulnerability with authority. </p>
                <p>At my students’ prompting, we looked at other subgenres of reaction videos,
                    including those that documented responses to sports losses or victories (a
                    subject bursts into tears after a winning World Cup goal, the camera squarely
                    focused on his face to capture a live, real-time reaction) and the wildly
                    popular reaction videos showing viewers of the HBO series <title level="m">Game
                        of Thrones</title> (a bar full of subjects scream in horror and peer through
                    their fingers when viewing a particularly grisly scene); many of these reaction
                    videos featured men exhibiting the same intense physical responses we’d already
                    seen (on <title level="m">Game of Thrones</title> reaction videos, see Hudson).
                    Our discussion of gender became more complex as we built our network of examples
                    and then returned to the novel. (As if to provide additional fodder for this
                    unit, Stephenie Meyer has since published a gender-swapped “reimagining” of
                        <title level="m">Twilight</title>, a reengagement with her own source
                    material that we might think of as a kind of self-reflexive fan fiction.)</p>
                <p>I want to stress that the obstacle I encountered in teaching my students about
                    the culture of sentiment was not that students too eagerly invested themselves
                    in these characters and their lives. Rather (and, I think, typically), they
                    were, at first, quite sure that these texts were alien to them, to the point of
                    presumed unknowability. To help them explore their own reactions, I didn’t just
                    present them with evidence that these characters <emph>were</emph> in fact
                    relatable (by showing how those characters were <emph>like</emph> characters my
                    students expressed more comfort sympathizing with). Instead, we looked at
                    contemporary texts that tend <emph>also</emph> to seem strange or unknowable,
                    texts that may be familiar by virtue of their recognizable allusions or
                    reference points, but that, for many of my students, still inspired feelings of
                    unease or even disapproval. Indeed, I’m dubious of the idea that using
                    contemporary texts is only useful as a kind of incentive to coax students to
                    read texts about which they would otherwise voice reluctance (a carrot to lead
                    them ever further into the past). While many of my (in this case, mostly young
                    and female) students were still ready to hold the (again, mostly, though not
                    only, young and female) YouTube hosts in contempt, this response started to
                    break down over the course of our discussion, and started to become a curious
                    (but productive) blend of critical engagement and empathy. I know I’m far from
                    alone in making these kinds of connections. In a brilliant essay, “Our Bella,
                    Ourselves,” Sarah Blackwood has written of the resistance she met with when
                    teaching another late-eighteenth century sentimental novel, <title level="m"
                        >Charlotte Temple</title> (1791): her students “complain that all Charlotte
                    does is swoon and cry. She isn’t ‘a strong heroine’ they protest.” Blackwood
                    likewise sees the <title level="m">Twilight</title> Saga as a way to invigorate
                    often difficult class discussions: “to revitalize a number of our larger
                    conversations about feminism, especially those related to sex, pregnancy,
                    desire, and autonomy.” This investigation is possible not because her students
                    would rather talk about <title level="m">Twilight</title> than <title level="m"
                        >Charlotte Temple</title>, but because her students reject <title level="m"
                        >Twilight</title> for the same reasons they reject <title level="m"
                        >Charlotte Temple.</title> The juxtaposition helps them (and us) start to
                    think about why.</p>

                <p>Building on our conversation about reaction videos, I also showed students this
                    caricature of two young women reading together in a vis-à-vis carriage. In doing
                    so, I quite pointedly wrested the image from its historical context. (The
                    caricature is poking fun at fashionability more than it is demonstrating
                    companionate reading.) One serendipitous visual effect is that the young ladies’
                    letters look (at least to me and to my students) startlingly like our modern
                    electronic devices; like passengers on the Subway, they aren’t, as the name of
                    their conveyance would otherwise suggest, “face-to-face” but staring down,
                    intent on their reading. The time warp of the image is immediately suggestive;
                    the figures in the image seem both of their time and alarmingly familiar. That
                    hunch, that stare are a part of our own muscle memory. This familiarizing effect
                    allows the image to raise questions about our own habits of media consumption:
                    Can immersion coexist with shared intimacy? When we stare at screens, do we
                    necessarily shut out those around us? And what of the intimacy we share with
                    those we encounter on the screen (or on the page)? A similar effect is produced
                    by the work of digital artist Kim Dong-Kyu, whose “When You See an Amazing
                    Sight”—featured at the beginning of this essay—wrenches perhaps the most clichéd
                    image of the Romantic sublime into a commentary on our modern tendency to
                    document rather than experience. The commentary, like the discussions I try to
                    have in my classes, raises questions about just how different our contemporary
                    phenomenology might be: was the Romantic sublime ever <emph>purely</emph>
                    experienced? Or are paintings like Friedrich’s (and, we might add, poems like
                    Shelley’s or essays like Burke’s) analogous at all to our Facebook posts? Was
                    the Claude glass an Instagram filter? What difference does the immediacy of
                    (iPhone) photography make to the registration of aesthetic experience? Can we
                    constantly document our lives and still “recollect in tranquility”? (I’m
                    reminded of my beloved high school English teacher’s story of her visit to
                    Tintern Abbey: She gasped upon seeing the abbey on her first trip outside of the
                    US, dropping her camera and breaking it beyond repair. In tears, she comforted
                    herself by repeating, “It’s what Wordsworth would have wanted. It’s what
                    Wordsworth would have wanted.”) As I hope these questions suggest, it’s crucial
                    for me to bring these texts into conversation with each other in order to
                    provoke a discussion of <emph>both</emph> the Romantic texts and the
                    contemporary phenomena. It’s all too easy to fall into what Ted Underwood has
                    called, in his valuable discussion of using pop lyrics in the classroom, “the
                    naïve assumption that popular culture is absorbed directly by the ears, and that
                    only high culture has to be mediated through the analytic intelligence” (12).
                    These discussions only work, in my experience, if my students and I are invested
                    together in examining our own practices along with those of the historical
                    figures we’re studying. </p>
                <p>While I would contend that these kinds of metacritical discussions could be
                    valuable in a variety of classes, courses in Romantic fiction are uniquely
                    situated to explore the complexity of students’ responses to fictional
                    character. This is because, as Deidre Shauna Lynch has shown, “It is
                    romantic-period characters who first succeed in prompting their readers to
                    conceive of them as beings who take on lives of their own and who thereby escape
                    their social as well as their textual contexts” (8). Lynch makes clear that
                    Romantic fiction mobilized a complex response to literary character that can’t
                    simply be summed up with the term “identification” or “relatability”:<quote>
                        <emph>Identification</emph>, the modern term for what we do with characters
                        .&#160;.&#160;. . obscures the historical specificity, the relative novelty,
                        of our codes of reading. With the beginnings of the late eighteenth
                        century’s ‘affective revolution’ and the advent of new linkages between
                        novel reading, moral training, and self-culture, character reading was
                        reinvented as an occasion when readers found themselves and plumbed their
                        own interior resources of sensibility by plumbing characters’ hidden depths.
                        (10)</quote> Lynch is certainly right to encourage us to develop more
                    specificity when exploring the historical dimensions of character in our
                    scholarship. At the same time, it’s clear that “identification” and
                    “relatability” <emph>are</emph>, however diluted, part of the legacy of this
                    Romantic revolution in the long history of reading. For that reason alone, it’s
                    worth reconsidering their role in our classrooms.</p>
                <p>We take a risk when we assume that students are just trying to relate to
                    everything and are eliding differences along the way. So much of what I expose
                    my students to is unknown to them. Why rob them of what isn’t? Relatability, as
                    I see it, isn’t a way for them to dig out; it’s a way for them to get in. We can
                    all relate (sorry!) to Michael Warner’s characterization of his classroom:
                    “Students who come to my literature classes, I find, read in all the ways they
                    aren’t supposed to. They identify with characters” (13). But Warner’s argument
                    is that we can only figure out what we mean by “critical reading” if we allow
                    ourselves to consider it as always bound up in relation to its uncritical other.
                    I share with critics of relatability a frustration with inert critical
                    responses—the sort that shut down or close off analysis rather than encouraging
                    it. But I’m less convinced that “relatable” is more disposed to this kind of
                    danger than any other initial response to literary fiction. In fact, in my
                    experience, relatable (and, crucially, the kinds of probing questions that it
                    necessarily prompts) holds particular potential to compel students to trace
                    their responses back to their textual causes, to think through the intricacy of
                    their connections to Romantic texts. To scrub the term from our classrooms is to
                    foreclose serious discussions of the complex work that goes into (and has long
                    gone into) novel reading. </p>
