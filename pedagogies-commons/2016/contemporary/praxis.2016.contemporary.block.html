            <p class="noCount">This essay explains the rationale behind a willfully anachronistic creative writing
               prompt: if one of the British Romantics were alive today, how would he or she craft
               a literary response to 9/11 and the ensuing War on Terror? Instead of asking what
               makes the twenty-first-century experience of terror new, my assignment encourages
               students to approach today’s affective environment through the medium of British Romantic
               literature. The following discussion offers a pedagogical framework and theoretical
               justification for inviting undergraduates to map the untimely affects that fuse the
               contemporary age of terror with its Romantic-era double. The essay concludes with

                  <p>In what way does Edward Snowden’s story read like an updated version of William Godwin’s <em>Caleb Williams</em>? If Samuel Taylor Coleridge had composed “Fears in Solitude” during the April 2013
                     manhunt for the Boston marathon bombers, how would the poem change? How would Ann
                     Radcliffe dramatize the experience of encountering an unattended bag while waiting
                     at the airport? These are only a few of the questions that students considered in
                     their final creative projects for my Hampshire College seminar on “Literature in the
                     Age of Terror.”

                     Romantics were alive today, how would he or she craft a literary response to 9/11
                     and the ensuing War on Terror?</p>
               </div>
               <p>Instead of assigning a traditional analytic essay in which students might compare
                  the concerns of British Romantic literature and culture with those of our twenty-first-century
                  moment, I invited the class to write in a creative mode. The approach let them tap
                  into the affective registers of historical consciousness that eludes analytic writing,
                  or so Thomas Pfau’s <em>Romantic Moods</em> leads me to argue. To guide their efforts, I had everyone transpose their present
                  perspectives into the idiom of Romantic literature. Imitating the voice of a Romantic-era
                  writer provided a methodology for estranging one’s affective environment and thereby
                  making it newly available for analysis. The resulting exercise enabled students to
                  produce what Jonathan Flatley terms an “affective map” of the attunement between past
                  and present.</p>
               <p>The seminar drew on British Romantic literature as a medium for reflecting on our
                  emotional life in the present. Instead of asking what makes the twenty-first-century
                  experience of terror new, I posed a different question: where have we already seen
                  our own range of moods and structures of feeling before? Toward this end, I led the
                  class through a series of texts—among them, Ann Radcliffe’s <em>Mysteries of Udolpho</em> (1794), William Godwin’s <em>Caleb Williams</em> (1794), and Jane Austen’s <em>Persuasion</em> (1816)—that are fascinated by how impersonal historical forces condition one’s moods,
                  sentiments, and visceral sensations. These readings served, in turn, as the occasion
                  to put British anxieties about the French “Reign of Terror” and subsequent Napoleonic
                  Wars into dialogue with America’s cultural response to 9/11. My goal was to reframe
                  the age of terror as doubly contemporary, which is to say both characteristic of the
                  present and simultaneous with the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century.</p>
               <p>To borrow Walter Scott’s comment from the “Dedicatory Epistle” to <em>Ivanhoe</em>, I encouraged students to search for the “extensive neutral ground” between past
                  and present (18). At the same time, my comparative approach relied on the otherness
                  of Romantic-era literature to reorient or even disorient our intuitive understanding
                  of things as they are, to borrow Godwin’s phrase. Oscillating between affinity and
                  alterity, the seminar routed today’s affective attachments through the foreignness
                  of the past while simultaneously foregrounding an abiding archive of intensities that
                  were set into motion by British Romantic literature. My underling premise was that
                  category of affect could enable a pivot (or series of pivots) between the Romantic
                  and the contemporary. Consistent with the notoriously unsettled meaning of the word
                  “affect,” my use of the term indicates a broad array of felt experiences that warp
                  the cognition of time.</p>
               <p>The following essay describes the pedagogical rationale behind my course’s untimely
                  treatment of “Literature in the Age of Terror.” To begin, I explain my strategies
                  for juxtaposing our contemporary age of terror with its Romantic-era double. From
                  there, I draw on the work of Thomas Pfau and Jonathan Flatley to justify my core methodology:
                  constructing a comparative archive of affective intensities to calibrate the interplay
                  between British Romantic literature and culture and our post-9/11 moment. The essay
                  concludes by assessing the writing that my students completed for their final projects.

               <h2><span class="head">I. Teaching the Romantic with the contemporary</span></h2>
               <p>At the outset of the semester, my first task was to persuade the class that it makes
                  sense to study late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century literature alongside
                  the contemporary. To establish a connection between these two seemingly disparate
                  moments, I turned to Marc Redfield’s <em>The Rhetoric of Terror</em>, which argues that <span class="quote">‘our specifically political use of the words “terror” and “terrorism” emerged at the
                     end of the eighteenth century, forming part of the broad historical phenomenon that
                     literary scholars call romanticism. The capitalized nominative “Terror” has, of course,
                     a historiographical referent: it designates more or less the period between the fall
                     of the Girondins (June 1793) and the fall of Robespierre (July 27, 1794 or 9 Thermidor).
                     (72)’</span> To Redfield’s point, the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> cites Edmund Burke and Helen Maria Williams as among the first to introduce the word
                  “terrorist” into the English language circa 1795 as a pejorative label for violent
                  political actors (“Terrorist, n. and adj”). While Redfield acknowledges that “we obviously
                  no longer mean quite the same things by ‘terrorist’ that Burke did,” it is nevertheless
                  fair to say that British anxieties about the French Revolution crystalize emerging
                  notions about terror, terrorism, and terrorists (73).</p>
               <p>Building on this point, I invited students to compare our current geopolitical situation
                  with that of the Romantic authors we were reading. For instance, I called their attention
                  to the time that elapsed between William Wordsworth’s travels in France during the
                  early 1790s and his eventual description of those experiences in the 1805 <em>Prelude</em>. What does Wordsworth’s belated reflection on the French Revolution have to teach
                  us about our own evolving response to the trauma of 9/11, I asked? Likewise, I proposed
                  that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan offer a twenty-first-century parallel for the
                  Napoleonic Wars that contextualize Jane Austen’s <em>Persuasion</em>. In this light, Austen’s novel provides an opportunity to consider the personal costs
                  of the protracted military conflicts that define our moment.</p>
               <p>To complement the discussion, I introduced students to scholarship that implicitly
                  or explicitly affirms Romanticism’s bearing on the present. We began the semester
                  by considering Terry Castle’s thought-provoking observations about the continuity
                  between visual representations of 9/11 and the history of art that finds sublimity
                  in scenes of destruction. Through John Barrell’s account of the British obsession
                  with imagining political violence during the mid-1790s, we saw the makings of twenty-first-century
                  arguments both for and against government surveillance and other anti-terrorism measures.
                  Jan Mieszkowski’s analysis of Coleridge’s “Fears in Solitude” prompted a conversation
                  about the patriotic rhetoric that followed 9/11 and the Boston marathon bombing. What
                  David Clark describes as Kant’s wariness about celebrating military victory also raises
                  hard questions about the riotous celebrations that took place on American college
                  campuses following the May 2011 assassination of Osama bin Laden. </p>
               <p>All of these conversations reinforced the point that Romanticism functions as an anachronism
                  in Jerome Christensen’s (or for that matter, Percy Bysshe Shelley’s) sense of the
                  term: namely, a “potent icon of the past’s incapacity to coincide with itself, to
                  seal itself off as a period or epoch or episode with no or necessary consequences
                  for our time. Anachronism is the herald of the future as yet unknown” (3). Christensen’s
                  formulation usefully challenged the class’s tendency to assume that the eighteenth
                  and nineteenth centuries are over and done with. Instead, he suggests that Romanticism
                  cannot be walled off behind the perfected closure of the past. As with all writing,
                  the definitive meaning of British Romantic literature has yet to be written; its history
                  remains in process and open to future reinterpretation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.3">
               <h2><span class="head">II. Creative imitation assignment</span></h2>
               <p>In keeping with the seminar’s embrace of anachronism as a strategy for bringing British
                  Romantic literature into the present, while simultaneously filtering contemporary
                  life through the otherness of the past, I gave students a purposefully anachronistic
                  prompt for their final assignment: if one of the British Romantics were alive today,
                  how would he or she craft a literary response to 9/11 and the ensuing War on Terror?
                  The challenge was to imagine how Ann Radcliffe, for example, might react to our own
                  time. The unorthodox prompt invited the class to compose a creative work that addresses
                  the repercussions of 9/11 in the voice or characteristic style of a Romantic-era writer.
                  But why ask students to write in a creative mode instead of composing a traditional,
                  analytic essay? Furthermore, how does literary imitation give students a fresh perspective
                  on the present? What’s to be gained by using Romantic literature to remediate our
                  contemporary situation?</p>
               <p>My response to the first question expands upon arguments put forward in Thomas Pfau’s
                  <em>Romantic Moods</em>. In light of Pfau’s discussion, I take the view that creative writing makes it possible
                  for students to tap into the affective registers of historical consciousness that
                  cannot quite be put into propositional statements. Drawing on Kant and Heidegger,
                  Pfau theorizes what he terms the mood of history, which “speaks—if only circumstantially—to
                  the deep-structural situatedness of individuals within history as something never
                  actually intelligible to them in fully coherent, timely, and definitive form” (7).
                  In Pfau’s account, mood channels the latent force of historical events that otherwise
                  elude conscious understanding. Rather than look to “what may be logically verified
                  and discursively represented as knowledge,” Pfau contends that history’s power makes
                  itself felt on a visceral level. Indeed, Pfau maintains that an affective understanding
                  of one’s historical condition cannot be properly represented or pinned down (10).
                  To adapt a remark from Favret, mood “offers up symptoms of a history not entirely
                  possessed” (146). Applying Pfau’s discussion to my own pedagogy, I deemphasized assignments
                  that required students to explicitly define their historical situatedness in favor
                  of offering creative writing as a practice that let the class access an otherwise
                  inchoate spirit of our age.</p>
               <p>If anything, college-age students in 2016 are primed to reflect on the affective tenor
                  of historical experience. After all, they were only in kindergarten or first grade—five
                  or six years old,—when the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks occurred. Experiencing
                  9/11 and its aftermath from a child’s perspective gives today’s young people an intuitive
                  understanding of the visceral yet elusive force of historical events that are felt
                  more than understood.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>But why should my class’s efforts to mobilize the affective dimension of historical
                     consciousness take the form of a literary imitation, as I stipulate in my assignment?
                     Building on Jonathan Flatley’s notion of <em>Affective Mapping</em>, I argue that the work of emulating a historical literary style can estrange one’s
                     affective environment while simultaneously activating the felt relation between past
                     and present. According to Flatley, affective mapping serves as “a technology for the
                     representation to oneself of one’s own historically conditioned and changing affective
                     life” (7). The procedure works through self-estrangement: <span class="quote">‘By this term [self-estrangement] . . . I mean a self-distancing that allows one to
                        see oneself as if from outside. But I also mean estrangement in the sense of defamiliarization,
                        making one’s emotion life—one’s range of moods, set of structures of feeling, and
                        collection of affective attachments—appear weird, surprising, unusual, and thus capable
                        of a new kind of recognition, interest, and analysis. (80)’</span> Affective mapping entails a depersonalization of the moods, sentiments, and visceral
                     sensations that are commonly taken as the hallmark of selfhood. In order to decouple
                     affect from subjectivity, Flatley invokes the specifically aesthetic device of defamiliarization.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> As with Pfau, Flatley contends that literary writing has the capacity to reframe one’s
                     affective makeup as other, or <em>not</em> one’s own, and hence render it freshly available.</p>
               </div>
               <p>To give Flatley’s discussion a concrete pedagogical application, I asked my classes
                  to imitate a Romantic-era author on the syllabus. On the one hand, doing so made our
                  “now” resemble the otherness of a “then.” On the other hand, the reverse is also true,
                  in that any movement away from our “own” moment and into the Romantic period eventually
                  makes a circuitous return to the moods and affects that define the present as much
                  as the past. Through their writing project, students hereby produced maps or mappings
                  in the sense of calibrating the resonance between Romanticism’s structure of feeling
                  and our contemporary mood. As Flatley aptly observes, “we never experience an affect
                  for the first time; every affect contains within it an archive of its previous objects”
                  (81). My goal was to provide students with a framework for charting the age of terror
                  that inflects both the Romantic and the contemporary.</p>

                  as the affect of everyday war. Students gravitated to Austen’s <em>Persuasion</em>, Godwin’s <em>Caleb Williams</em>, and Radcliffe’s <em>Mysteries of Udolpho</em> as touchstones for mapping the changing contours of daily life in the aftermath of
                  9/11. Channeling an array of affects that ranged from the banal to the phantasmatic,
                  regret to dread, curiosity to paranoid anxiety, the class used their creative writing
                  to investigate the feeling of being adrift in uncertain times. In the double sense
                  of that last phrase, my students’ projects suggested that the War on Terror has disoriented
                  their sense of time and destabilized their sense of certainty.</p>
               <p>To understand how students went about capturing the echoes of war in everyday life,
                  consider the work of Hillary Lynch, who rewrote Coleridge’s “Fears in Solitude” as
                  if it were composed during the April 2013 manhunt for the Boston marathon bombers.
                  Aptly retitled “Fears in Collective Solitude,” Lynch’s poetic imitation explores the
                  strange time that Bostonians spent “sheltering in place”: </p>

               </blockquote>
               <p> Where Coleridge’s original poem contends that the threat of war has a pernicious
                  influence on public discourse, Lynch underscores the similarly far-reaching impact
                  of an actual terror attack, which reverberates out from the scene of carnage to radically
                  disrupt the ordinary routines and daily rhythms of an entire country. According to
                  Lynch, the collective terror of “wait[ing] along, together, breadth held” has a visceral
                  intensity that distantly echoes the physical damage wrought on Boylston Street. What
                  Favret says about Austen’s <em>Persuasion</em> applies equally well to Lynch’s Coleridgean rendition of the Boston bombings: both
                  “reveal the everyday not as a zone of peace in contrast to a distant war, but as the
                  unspectacular register or correspondent of wartime” (154). Dogs go quiet, children
                  fall silent, personified flowers wither; the mundane becomes uncanny. Such is the
                  unspectacular yet palpably affecting reality of a terror attack.</p>
               <p>The spectacle of war has no less of an effect on the phantasmagoria of our emotional
                  lives, or so student Rae Purdom holds. Specifically, Purdom offers a Radcliffean meditation
                  on the medium of television news, which simultaneously reports distant conflicts and
                  evokes the ghostly presence of a lost love one. Purdom takes her inspiration from
                  the scene in which Emily St. Aubert returns to the library of her recently deceased
                  father. Coming upon her father’s armchair and an open book by one of his favorite
                  authors, “the idea of him rose so distinctly to [Emily’s] mind,” writes Radcliffe,
                  “that she almost fancied she saw him before her” (95). In Purdom’s version, the familiar
                  easy chair faces a television tuned to CNN. As the stream of martial images washes
                  over her, Purdom’s young protagonist, Jessica, recalls <span class="quote">‘watching <em>Apocalypse Now </em>with her [dead] mother, who would have sat in this armchair and played gently with
                     Jessica’s hair to soothe her and keep her grounded in the safety of home, far from
                     the threat of imminent violence, as the [television] announcer intoned the words,
                     “guerilla warfare,” and Jessica felt the absence of her mother’s hand tousling her
                     hair. (unpublished essay)’</span> In keeping with what Terry Castle describes as that characteristically Radcliffean
                  tendency to “spectralize” the dead or absent as “an image . . . on the screen of consciousness
                  itself,” Purdom uses the medium of the television to frame the ghostly intersection
                  between geopolitical conflict and personal loss (“Spectralization” 237). Specifically,
                  Purdom brings Jessica’s visceral encounter with the felt “absence of her mother’s
                  hand tousling her hair” into alignment with the ambient grief of watching war from
                  a distance.</p>
               <p>Another distinctive feature of Purdom’s efforts to map the resonance between home
                  life and a war zone is the gesture of conflating Vietnam, 9/11, and the “threat of
                  imminent violence” into one long, interminable conflict. Purdom’s anachronistic thinking
                  is just one example of the class’s broader interest in the affect of broken time.
                  Fellow student Michael Samblas makes the point explicit in noting that like contemporary
                  Americans, the characters of Austen’s <em>Persuasion</em> are caught between regretting the past and dreading the future: <span class="quote">‘Ever since the September 11 attacks, we have been constantly looking back at that
                     momentous event, and allowing it to define our society to this day. We constantly
                     refer to the time we live in as “post 9/11” and observe the anniversary of the event
                     every year. This is in keeping with Austen’s themes of living in the past . . . [Having
                     said that] our obsession with the past seems to stem more from a fear of having to
                     repeat it. Austen’s characters, on the other hand, are actively <em>trying</em> to relive these moments that they keep reflecting back on. (unpublished essay)’</span> Just as Anne Elliot’s life stagnates during the almost eight years since she ended
                  her brief engagement with Captain Frederick Wentworth and he went off to war, our
                  “post-9/11” era likewise seems to hover around the recent past, Samblas astutely observes.
                  The hallmark of our—and Anne’s—belated temporal condition is captured in the fear
                  and/or fantasy that the past is about to repeat itself.</p>
               <p>Renata Anuhea Sebstad’s imitation of Austen raises the same issue. In her short story,
                  Sebstad dramatizes a mother’s anxiety about a son who is stationed at the military
                  base in Fort Hood, Texas. The Austenian element can be found in Sebstad’s choice to
                  begin her story shortly before the first Fort Hood shooting incident of November 2009
                  and end just prior to the second mass shooting, which took place in April 2014. Much
                  as Austen’s audience knew that Anne Elliot’s concluding “dread of a future war” would
                  soon become a reality, Sebstad invites her reader to anxiously await an event that
                  has not yet taken place within the diegetic universe of the narrative, thereby validating
                  the protagonist’s overwhelming sense of foreboding. Through the modalities of apprehension
                  and unease, both protagonist and reader intuit that the linear advance of time bends
                  back on itself to form an untimely cycle of violence.</p>
               <p>Ben Socolofsky picks up the thread again in adopting Radcliffe’s distinctive style
                  of haunted consciousness to evoke the spectral afterlife of 9/11. Reimagining St.
                  Aubert as a casualty of the World Trade Center collapse, Socolofsky follows his daughter,
                  Emily, through the subsequent months of mourning. Of particular interest is Socolofsky’s
                  dramatization of Emily’s post-traumatic encounter with the “Tribute in Light” art
                  installation, which periodically projects two columns of light skyward from the former
                  World Trade Center site. Unable to believe her eyes, Emily briefly wonders whether
                  the Twin Towers are about to collapse all over again—a sense of <em>déjà vu</em> reinforced by a subsequent encounter with a <span class="foreign">doppelgänger</span> of her dead father. Like Sebstad, Socolofsky explores the recursive temporality of
                  life post-9/11 though the eerie affect of its uncanny repetitions.</p>
               <p>Even as a number of students sought to elaborate on Favret’s claim that the affect
                  of everyday war “eludes the usual models for organizing time such as linearity, punctuality,
                  and periodicity,” others found that their experience of uncertain times did not raise
                  issues of temporality so much as emphasize their sense of uncertainty (11). For one,
                  Teddy S. Miller used <em>Caleb Williams</em> as a vehicle for experimenting with the affect of uncertainty. His piece tells the
                  fictional story of Adael Goldman, a character charged with watching over the shrouded
                  body of Osama bin Laden until it is interred at sea. Like Godwin’s protagonist, Caleb
                  Williams, Adael is consumed by both curiosity and paranoia. On receiving strict orders
                  not to look underneath the corpse’s shroud, Adael becomes obsessed with verifying
                  the identity of the body with his own eyes. At the same time, Adael is unnerved by
                  nagging questions about why he has been left alone with the dead man in the first
                  place and whether he might be under some form of surveillance.</p>
               <p>The tension between curiosity and paranoia comes to a head in the conclusion of Miller’s
                  short story, which describes the thought process behind Adael’s resolution to keep
                  bin Laden’s body covered: <span class="quote">‘Not once, even when I held the body in my hands did I allow the veil to slip off
                     and reveal the identity of the man beneath. In doing so I sentenced myself to live
                     the rest of my life in uncertainty, with the only thing that could make me believe
                     in truth again lying at the bottom of the sea. (unpublished essay) ’</span> Without attempting to reproduce Godwin’s plot, Miller emulates the dynamic of the
                  novel’s original courtroom ending, in which Falkland never confesses his guilt and
                  Caleb’s accusations remain unverified. As Pfau notes about Godwin’s original ending,
                  “nothing ever offers extrinsic and objective confirmation for Caleb’s key hypothesis
                  regarding Falkland’s guilty past” (140). The point applies equally well to Miller’s
                  conclusion, in which the protagonist fails to confirm bin Laden’s ultimate fate and
                  consequently descends into paranoid uncertainty.</p>
               <p>Dominic Poropat’s imitation of Radcliffe’s <em>Udolpho</em> achieves similar results by using the device of the “explained supernatural” to prolong
                  doubt and elicit anxiety. In Poropat’s hands, Radcliffe’s much-derided trope becomes
                  a recurrent motif of everyday life post-9/11. To make the point, he dramatizes the
                  experience of a young woman, who encounters an unattended bag while waiting at the
                  airport. After the manner of Austen’s <em>Northanger Abbey</em>, Poropat’s Radcliffean heroine imbues a commonplace object with supernatural powers
                  and dread import. But unlike Austen, however, Poropat does without parody. In the
                  era of “see something, say something” when everything is simultaneously a potential
                  threat and nothing to be concerned about, Poropat intimates that we have little cause
                  to mock the Radcliffean heroine’s tendency to overreact. His short story makes the
                  point that 9/11 has introduced an element of anxious uncertainty into what we see
                  and how we hear.</p>
               <p>Despite Austen’s sendup of <em>Udolpho</em>, Poropat implies that we have all become Radcliffean subjects whose exaggerated suspicions
                  and unsubstantiated fears are no laughing matter. When Poropat’s protagonist finally
                  summons the courage to open the suspicious bag, it contains “nothing more than a few
                  mundane travel items,” which she hands over to the lost and found. “Thirty minutes
                  later,” Poropat concludes, “she boarded her plane and forgot all about that old, cracked
                  leather bag.” The anticlimactic <span class="foreign">denouement</span> works in part because 9/11 seems to have restored the visceral force of Radcliffe’s
                  much-derided techniques for creating suspense. Paradoxical though it may sound, Poropat
                  succeeds at capturing the specifically <em>historical</em> potency of <em>Udolpho</em>’s “explained supernatural” circa 1794 by bringing the trope into the twenty-first
                  century. The resulting exploration simultaneously modernizes Radcliffe and backdates
                  our present-day anxieties about the omnipresent yet unspecified threat of terrorism.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">IV. Conclusion</span></h2>
               <p>Poropat’s short narrative shares in the class’s collective effort to map the affective
                  dimension of life in uncertain times. Mobilizing an array of affects that ranged from
                  the banal to the phantasmatic, regret to dread, curiosity to paranoid anxiety, students
                  used their creative writing as a vehicle for tapping into a tacit sense that the “War
                  on Terror” has unmoored their sense of time and left them adrift in doubt. To do so,
                  the class embraced anachronism. By addressing the legacy of 9/11 in the voice or literary
                  style of a writer from the syllabus, students navigated the double contemporaneity
                  that makes Romanticism both characteristic of the present and simultaneous with the
                  late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. In the process, students began to channel
                  the visceral power of historical experience that cannot quite be named. </p>
