                <p rend="noCount">This essay challenges students to think about how we might make
                    the case for the public value of the humanities by grounding our own debates
                    about these issues in a close reading of Percy Shelley’s “Defence of Poetry.” It
                    argues that Shelley’s argument against the primacy of utilitarian pragmatism is
                    not, despite its apparent rhetoric, a lofty and off-putting retreat into elitist
                    claims for the arts, but quite the contrary, a radical and politically engaged
                    account of why the arts ultimately matter more than applied forms of “useful
                    knowledge,” even within the context of social reform.</p>

                <div type="section">
                    <p>There is a question that I always open our discussion of Percy Shelley’s
                        “Defence of Poetry” with in my Romantic Literature classes: what exactly
                        does Shelley mean by his reference to “all invention for abridging and
                        combining labour”? (134). It was clearly important to Shelley. He had
                        offered a very similar description just four paragraphs earlier: “Whilst the
                        mechanist abridges, and the political economist combines, labour” (132). My
                        experience when I ask it is virtually always the same. Students find the
                        question difficult precisely because the answer is so obvious, and in many
                        ways, so mundane. It’s not so much the purloined letter as the industrial
                        elephant in the room. He’s talking about the assembly line, that innovation
                        that would become the cornerstone of the modern factory system. Labor would
                        be “abridged” because the task demanded of every worker would be narrowed to
                        a single, highly specialized function, and “combined” because that act would
                        only gain its value alongside the equally specialized functions of several
                        other laborers as the product passed from hand to hand. </p>
                    <p>We look at those passages in Shelley’s text alongside Adam Smith’s famous
                        description of a pin factory in the opening pages of <title level="m">Wealth
                            of Nations</title>, which was intended to demonstrate the extraordinary
                        productivity that would flow from precisely this sort of arrangement. In a
                        pin factory, Smith explained, the simple act of making a pin would be
                        “divided into about eighteen distinct operations” (15). As Smith put it, “in
                        consequence of a proper division and combination of their different
                        operations” a relatively small group of people could soon be producing
                        48,000 pins a day (15). The system worked “by reducing every man’s business
                        to some one simple operation, and by making this operation the sole
                        employment of his life” (18). All that was needed was that the workers be
                        “collected into the same workhouse” (14). </p>
                    <p>Shelley clearly expected readers to understand his reference, both in terms
                        of its literal meaning and the much broader economic and political arguments
                        that it had become a shorthand for, but that is no longer something that we
                        can take for granted. I begin my discussion of Shelley’s “Defence” with this
                        apparently simple question about this reference to “all invention for
                        abridging and combining labor” every time I teach it and what is striking is
                        that no one has ever come up with that particular answer: the assembly line.
                        Nor, I want to emphasize, should we blame them. The high rhetorical style of
                        the text itself, the elevated nature of its claims for poetry, and the
                        natural tendency of a classroom situation to encourage answers that reach
                        for the sophisticated rather than the commonplace all militate against it.
                        But if we don’t understand this reference then we miss out on much of the
                        real force of Shelley’s argument, which is crucial because this is also the
                        basis of what may be the most sophisticated and most radical argument that
                        emerged in these years, not just about the value of poetry, but about what
                        Raymond Williams identified as an emerging definition of culture and, bound
                        up with that, a crucial case for the broader importance of the humanities
                        themselves. At a time when those of us who work in the humanities face
                        unprecedented pressure to make the case for what we do to numerous different
                        audiences—university administrators, government policy-makers, the media,
                        and the general public—this argument is worth emphasizing. </p>
                    <p>On one level, this question is bound up with a more fundamental pedagogical
                        issue that colors the study of all literary history (or history in general).
                        Whether we theorize it explicitly or not, the study of any period of
                        literary history is shaped by the question of whether we are interested in
                        that earlier period because of the ways that it differs from our own age, or
                        the ways that it resembles us. Does its very strangeness offer a perspective
                        on our own world that can be critically productive and politically enabling,
                        or do we react more strongly to the ways that the uncanny parallels that we
                        find in these texts resonate across time? In practice, of course, it is
                        never a simple either/or proposition. The real challenge lies in being as
                        aware as we can be of the shaping influence of the dynamic tension between
                        these perspectives.</p>
                    <p>This has certainly been the case with the Romantic period. In many ways, our
                        most basic approaches to it have always said as much about the spirit of our
                        own age as they did about the period itself. In an age when civil rights
                        campaigners and anti-war protestors made common cause with a new generation
                        of singers and poets, we became aware of just how big a part the French
                        Revolution had played in shaping the consciousness of the group of writers
                        that would become known as the Romantics. As the reform movement faltered,
                        we grew used to thinking about the Romantics’ ideas about poetry as an
                        evasion rather than an extension of their own fading radical politics. In
                        the years when a postmodern aesthetic emphasizing fragmentation and
                        vertiginous self-referentiality dominated the academy, we discovered
                        Romantic irony. In recent years, caught up in the profound technological
                        changes unleashed by the digital revolution, we have increasingly emphasized
                        the ways that late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth-century debates about
                        print culture were already focusing squarely on the complex assumptions and
                        multiple forms of mediation that structured literature as a field of
                        cultural production. In so many of these ways, the Romantics turn out to
                        have anticipated our major preoccupations long before we ever became aware
                        of them. But they also did so in remarkably different social and political
                        conditions, and in ways that are ultimately very different from our own
                        beliefs and practices today.</p>
                    <p>Negotiating this blend of historical echoes and epistemic ruptures is
                        complicated by a further pedagogical twist that runs through all of this:
                        the challenge, which none of us ever fully master, of recognizing the sheer
                            <emph>presentness</emph> of any earlier age: the fact that people were
                        living, thinking, and writing in the present tense and without the benefit
                        of hindsight. It can be difficult for students to fully appreciate that
                        these people—<emph>all people</emph>—correctly thought of themselves as
                        living in the most modern age that had ever existed, and that they were
                        wrestling with changes that were often far more rapid and far more
                        fundamental than anything we are living through today. They were continually
                        struck by their exceptional modernity rather than their historicity. The
                        challenge of adequately recognizing this is exacerbated by the temporal
                        equivalent of a familiar optical illusion: the sense that objects far away
                        are moving very slowly, if they’re moving at all. In a similar way, the
                        further back we look into the past, the easier it is to underestimate the
                        impact of the sense of change that they were living through, and the lack of
                        the sort of hindsight that we too often impose on them. Socrates never
                        thought of himself as a Classical thinker, nor did Elizabethan writers know
                        that they were living in the Renaissance. Wordsworth and Blake would
                        probably have been puzzled to learn that they were Romantics. The labels
                        come later, and even where they are appropriate, they can have the
                        unfortunate effect of tidying history up in ways that erase the messiness,
                        which may be the most important part of what we’re studying. Recognizing the
                        impact of all of this makes studying literary history, including the
                        challenge of negotiating the changing nexus of historical parallels and
                        differences that we discover in it, simultaneously more challenging and more
                        important. </p>

                    <p>Shelley’s effort to articulate a transformative social and political role for
                        poetry in a rapidly changing industrial world, and in ways that now seem
                        both profoundly outmoded and strikingly current, exemplifies these various
                        theoretical questions about the study of literary history. This is
                        especially true when we read his argument in the context of one further
                        academic debate that has become increasingly urgent over the past few years:
                        the issue of the role of the humanities. As Martha Nussbaum has recently
                        argued, “we are in the midst of a crisis of massive proportions and grave
                        global significance”: not “the global economic crisis that began in 2008”
                        but the decline of support for the humanities in terms of both pedagogical
                        and research priorities within universities (1–2). Nussbaum’s book—<title
                            level="m">Not For Profit: Why Democracy Needs the Humanities</title>—has
                        become a widely cited element of this debate, but the urgency of the topic
                        has ensured an equally strong chorus of responses. Google “crisis in the
                        humanities” and you are confronted with a very long and rapidly growing list
                        of people weighing in on the subject. There is a “crisis in the humanities”
                        home page, blogs, links to numerous columns and articles, whether in the
                        mainstream media or academic journals, a Wikipedia site, amazon.com links
                        containing references to numerous books on the topic, and so on. The outlook
                        they share is that things are pretty bleak. As Robert Weisbuch put it,
                        “[t]oday’s consensus about the state of the humanities” is that “it’s bad,
                        it’s getting worse, and no one is doing much about it,” all of which “ is
                        supported by dismal facts” (B4).</p>
                    <p>As many of these critics emphasize, the immediate problems generated on a
                        practical level by declining support for the humanities are exacerbated by a
                        far more serious failure to understand the broader social worth of the
                        humanities in an age when the perceived benefits of knowledge production are
                        increasingly viewed in terms of market forces. An editorial entitled
                        “Liberal Arts and Commercial Utility” in Canada’s leading national
                        newspaper, the<title level="m"> Globe and Mail</title>, neatly summed these
                        problems up in its warning that, “the liberal arts are necessary and good,
                        but not sufficient in the modern age.” It didn’t bother to explain what it
                        might mean to be “sufficient in the modern age,” but given the editorial’s
                        headline, it didn’t really need to. As Stefan Collini has argued in a widely
                        cited <title level="m">TLS</title> Commentary, this absolute inability to
                        imagine the worth of the humanities in any socially useful sense was starkly
                        demonstrated in the Research Excellence Framework that was recently
                        established as the official basis for determining research funding
                        allocations amongst English universities. As Collini has pointed out, part
                        of this formula for funding allocation depends on what the Research
                        Excellence Framework calls “impact,” which it breaks down into thirty-seven
                        possible categories, each of which is in turn measured by a series of
                        “indicators” such as “creating new businesses,” “commercializing new
                        products or processes,” and “attracting R&amp;D investment from global
                        business” (18). </p>
                    <p>It is not difficult or inaccurate to draw a line of connection between the
                        narrow market-based vision of the Research Excellence Framework and the
                            <title level="m">Globe and Mail</title>’s editorial on “Liberal Arts and
                        Commercial Utility,” which share both a diplomatic sense that “the liberal
                        arts are necessary and good,” and an equal confidence that they are not
                        somehow “sufficient in the modern age.” Certainly it is hard to see how they
                        could be “adequate,” given the list of “indicators” supplied by the
                        Framework. But as Collini also points out, the most serious evidence of the
                        magnitude of this problem lies in the lack of any indicators in the final
                        category, the only one where the work of most humanities scholars might
                        easily be slotted, which is headed “other quality of life benefits” (18).
                        This category is the only one of the thirty-seven that had no examples
                        provided. It contains a one-line note, which merely says: “please suggest
                        what might also be included in this list” (18). They had to invite
                        suggestions because they themselves had no idea. They simply could not
                        imagine any way that the liberal arts could be seem to have any valid social
                        impact. It beggared their imagination.</p>
                    <p>Nor is any of this unprecedented, which is where we rejoin Shelley. His
                        complaint that poets had been challenged, “to resign the civic crown to
                        reasoners and mechanists” remains every bit as true today, but so too does
                        the argument that he developed in the face of this resistance (131). For
                        early nineteenth-century advocates such as Shelley, William Hazlitt, and
                        Leigh Hunt, the arts constituted a central aspect of a larger struggle for
                        social progress, but like today, these arguments were themselves sharpened
                        by the need to challenge a utilitarian emphasis on the primacy of applied
                        knowledge. In Book III of <title level="m">The Rationale of Reward</title>,
                        Jeremy Bentham famously insisted, “that Prejudice apart, the game of
                        push-pin is of equal value with the arts and sciences of music and poetry.
                        If the game of push-pin furnish more pleasure, it is more valuable than
                        either. Everybody can play at push-pin: poetry and music are relished only
                        by a few.” Nothing but “Prejudice” could explain the persistent faith in the
                        value of the arts. Echoing Plato’s eviction of the poet in <title level="m"
                            >The Republic</title>, Bentham went on to suggest that poetry was not
                        only hopelessly elitist, it was actually dangerous: <quote> The game of
                            push-pin is always innocent: it were well could the same be always
                            asserted of poetry. Indeed, between poetry and truth there is natural
                            opposition: false morals and fictitious nature. The poet always stands
                            in need of something false. When he pretends to lay his foundations in
                            truth, the ornaments of his superstructure are fictions; his business
                            consists in stimulating our passions, and exciting our
                            prejudices.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. If poetry and music deserve to be
                            preferred before a game of push-pin, it must be because they are
                            calculated to gratify those individuals who are most difficult to be
                            pleased. (206–07)</quote> Bentham may have been more polemical than
                        most, but his position was a familiar one. His fellow utilitarian, Thomas
                        Love Peacock (a poet himself in earlier days), insisted in <title level="m"
                            >The Four Ages of Poetry</title> that the cultivation of poetry could
                        only be “to the neglect of some branch of useful study,” in stark contrast
                        with the tendency of “the thinking and studious, and scientific and
                        philosophical part of the community” to draw on “the materials of useful
                        knowledge” in order to prepare one’s self for “the real business of life”
                        (578–79). The logic that structures the Research Excellence Framework is
                        many ways a natural extension of these earlier utilitarian positions, which
                        is what makes the opportunity to situate Shelley’s “Defence” within our own
                        utilitarian debates today especially important. </p>
                    <p> Responding to Peacock’s criticisms, Shelley distinguished between two
                        different types of utility: spiritual nourishment (“whatever strengthens and
                        purifies the affections, enlarges the imagination, and adds spirit to
                        sense”) and what he dismissed as the “narrower one of banishing the
                        importunity of the wants of our animal nature, the surrounding men with
                        security of life, the dispersing the grosser delusions of superstition, and
                        the conciliating such a degree of forbearance among men as may consist with
                        the motives of personal advantage” (132). The first is “universal and
                        permanent,” the latter merely “transitory and particular” (132). Given this
                        choice, Shelley suggests, the real priority is clear: what were the
                        inconveniences of poverty, starvation and war (issues connected with “the
                        wants of our animal nature”) compared with this higher good (“whatever
                        strengthens and purifies the affections, enlarges the imagination, and adds
                        spirit to sense”)? </p>
                    <p> The problem, as students are rightly quick to notice, is that Shelley’s
                        reaction winds up being as hopelessly self-serving and elitist as Peacock’s
                        criticisms were shortsighted. At first glance it seems to be guilty of
                        self-absorption in ways that make him indifferent to the needs of the worst
                        off around him. Peacock was well-intentioned but reductive, but Shelley
                        seems to be ranking the challenge of providing people with food, shelter,
                        and security somewhere far beneath the task of “enlarg[ing] our
                        imagination.” He compounds the problem by going on to dismiss mere
                        “reasoners” such as Locke, Hume, Gibbon, Voltaire, and Rousseau, who
                        struggled in their limited way on behalf of “oppressed and deluded
                        humanity.” Not that they were completely useless. Had the world not
                        benefitted from their efforts, Shelley conceded, “a little more nonsense
                        would have been talked for a century or two; and perhaps a few more men,
                        women and children, burnt as heretics. We might not at this moment have been
                        congratulating each other on the abolition of the Inquisition in Spain”
                        (132). But these changes paled in comparison with the spectre of “the moral
                        condition of the world if neither Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Chaucer,
                        Shakespeare, Calderon, Lord Bacon, nor Milton, had ever existed; if Raphael
                        and Michael Angelo had never been born; if the Hebrew poetry had never been
                        translated; if a revival of the study of Greek literature had never taken
                        place; if no monuments of ancient sculpture had been handed down to us”
                        (132). One can understand people’s outrage to this position, which seems to
                        epitomize the worst kinds of special pleading that people associate with the
                        liberal arts: a forerunner of what Alex Usher has recently dismissed as the
                        “‘we're-not-sure-how-but-boy-the-Arts-are-important’ hand-waving we do now”
                        (“Re-imagining”). </p>
                    <p> Usher is right to bristle at this sort of self-congratulatory posturing,
                        except that in Shelley’s case, it is not quite this simple. In many ways,
                        the text sets us up to believe the worst, and therefore to align ourselves
                        with the positions espoused by Bentham and Peacock, as well as by the
                        authors of the Research Excellence Framework and the <title level="m">Globe
                            and Mail</title> editorial, only to demonstrate why this would be so
                        shortsighted. And the key to this reversal lies in his references to the
                        assembly line. Far from indulging in the
                        “‘we're-not-sure-how-but-boy-the-Arts-are-important’ hand-waving” that his
                        argument seems to suggest, Shelley’s argument was ultimately clear sighted
                        and materialist. His objection is not to the ideal of economic
                        rationalization <emph>per se</emph>, but to its broader social impact: the
                        fact that increased productivity had led, for want of the sort of larger
                        perspective that he associated with poetry, to “the exasperation of the
                        inequality of mankind” (134). Or as Shelley rather unpoetically put it, “the
                        rich have become richer, and the poor have become poorer” (132). In a just
                        society, many would argue, dramatically increased productivity should be a
                        great equalizer, a powerful means of tackling the class contradictions that
                        had been exacerbated by the onset of the industrial revolution. But for lack
                        of imagination, greater productivity had only magnified these inequalities.
                        Recognizing the importance of the relation between technological advances
                        and the visionary impulse that would ensure that these advances translate
                        into progressive social changes means that the choice between the two
                        different types of utility (the poetic spirit and material needs) turns out
                        to be a false opposition that ignores the valuable relations between them.
                        Social reformers required the visionary potential that Shelley identified
                        with the imagination in order to recognize both the potential unintended
                        consequences of their work and the avenues for change that might not
                        otherwise have been envisioned. The poetic spirit expanded rather than
                        negated or transcended the impact of applied knowledge by insisting on the
                        larger contexts within which its deployment (or “impact”) would ultimately
                        be felt.</p>
                    <p> The problem, Shelley argued, was that rapid technological change across a
                        range of applied sciences had fostered a sense of technological determinism
                        that led to a politically paralyzing distortion of this relation: “We have
                        more moral, political and historical wisdom, than we know how to reduce into
                        practice; we have more scientific and economical knowledge than can be
                        accommodated to the just distribution of the produce which it multiplies.
                        The poetry in these systems of thought, is concealed by the accumulation of
                        facts and calculating processes” (134). The problem lay in an imbalance
                        between applied and critical, or instrumentalist and self-reflexive
                        knowledge: “a cultivation of the mechanical arts in a degree disproportioned
                        to the presence of the creative faculty.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. From what
                        other cause has it arisen that these inventions which should have lightened,
                        have added a weight to the curse imposed on Adam?” (134).</p>
                    <p> Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno would pose a very similar argument in
                            <title level="m">Dialectic of Enlightenment</title> but where, for
                        Horkheimer and Adorno, there was no escape from the Enlightenment’s
                        “indefatigable self-destructiveness,” Shelley embraced the much broader
                        perspective that he associated with poetry as both a basis for critical
                        insight and a stimulant for radical intervention (xi). “We want the creative
                        faculty to imagine that which we know; we want the generous impulse to act
                        that which we imagine” (134). For Shelley, the poetic imagination was
                        ultimately a form of praxis: “There is no want of knowledge respecting what
                        is wisest and best in morals, government, and political economy, or at
                        least, what is wiser and better than what men now practise and endure. But
                        we let ‘<emph>I dare not</emph> wait upon <emph>I would</emph>, like the
                        poor cat in the adage’” (134). </p>
                    <p>Shelley’s claim, ultimately, is that the poetic imagination marked a radical
                        extension of Enlightenment rationalism; a self-reflexive domain capable of
                        both interrogating the potential consequences of reformers’ interventions
                        and of helping to maximize their progressive impact. But even more
                        importantly, the terms in which Shelley makes this particular
                        argument—seeming to be guilty of a flagrant case of
                        “‘we're-not-sure-how-but-boy-the-Arts-are-important’ hand-waving we do now”
                        only to show why this is precisely not that case through his allusions to
                        the negative impact of the assembly line—rehearses the failure of critics to
                        recognize the “impact” of the arts (or the humanities) in order to show why
                        they are not just “sufficient in the modern age,” but more important than
                        ever. At a time when the humanities face renewed pressure to justify
                        themselves in the utilitarian terms that have come to dominate these
                        discussions, his point is once again worth making. Learning to be good
                        readers of Shelley’s text can foster a clearer understanding of the real
                        nature of these debates about the humanities, both today and two hundred
                        years ago, but it can also help to train people to be more critically
                        engaged in the broader dynamics of our age in precisely the ways that
                        Shelley’s argument about the power relations that inform the social impact
                        of all applied knowledge suggests. In doing so it helps us to answer the
                        question about the broader social worth of the humanities by making us
                        recognize just how complicated the idea of the “impact” of knowledge can
                        actually be.</p>
