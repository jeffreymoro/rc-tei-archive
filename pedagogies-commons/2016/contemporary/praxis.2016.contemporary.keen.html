            <p class="noCount">This essay challenges students to think about how we might make the case for the public
               value of the humanities by grounding our own debates about these issues in a close
               reading of Percy Shelley’s “Defence of Poetry.” It argues that Shelley’s argument
               against the primacy of utilitarian pragmatism is not, despite its apparent rhetoric,
               a lofty and off-putting retreat into elitist claims for the arts, but quite the contrary,
               a radical and politically engaged account of why the arts ultimately matter more than
               applied forms of “useful knowledge,” even within the context of social reform.</p>

               <p>There is a question that I always open our discussion of Percy Shelley’s “Defence
                  of Poetry” with in my Romantic Literature classes: what exactly does Shelley mean
                  by his reference to “all invention for abridging and combining labour”? (134). It
                  was clearly important to Shelley. He had offered a very similar description just four
                  paragraphs earlier: “Whilst the mechanist abridges, and the political economist combines,
                  labour” (132). My experience when I ask it is virtually always the same. Students
                  find the question difficult precisely because the answer is so obvious, and in many
                  ways, so mundane. It’s not so much the purloined letter as the industrial elephant
                  in the room. He’s talking about the assembly line, that innovation that would become
                  the cornerstone of the modern factory system. Labor would be “abridged” because the
                  task demanded of every worker would be narrowed to a single, highly specialized function,
                  and “combined” because that act would only gain its value alongside the equally specialized
                  functions of several other laborers as the product passed from hand to hand. </p>
               <p>We look at those passages in Shelley’s text alongside Adam Smith’s famous description
                  of a pin factory in the opening pages of <em>Wealth of Nations</em>, which was intended to demonstrate the extraordinary productivity that would flow
                  from precisely this sort of arrangement. In a pin factory, Smith explained, the simple
                  act of making a pin would be “divided into about eighteen distinct operations” (15).
                  As Smith put it, “in consequence of a proper division and combination of their different
                  operations” a relatively small group of people could soon be producing 48,000 pins
                  a day (15). The system worked “by reducing every man’s business to some one simple
                  operation, and by making this operation the sole employment of his life” (18). All
                  that was needed was that the workers be “collected into the same workhouse” (14).</p>
               <p>Shelley clearly expected readers to understand his reference, both in terms of its
                  literal meaning and the much broader economic and political arguments that it had
                  become a shorthand for, but that is no longer something that we can take for granted.
                  I begin my discussion of Shelley’s “Defence” with this apparently simple question
                  about this reference to “all invention for abridging and combining labor” every time
                  I teach it and what is striking is that no one has ever come up with that particular
                  answer: the assembly line. Nor, I want to emphasize, should we blame them. The high
                  rhetorical style of the text itself, the elevated nature of its claims for poetry,
                  and the natural tendency of a classroom situation to encourage answers that reach
                  for the sophisticated rather than the commonplace all militate against it. But if
                  we don’t understand this reference then we miss out on much of the real force of Shelley’s
                  argument, which is crucial because this is also the basis of what may be the most
                  sophisticated and most radical argument that emerged in these years, not just about
                  the value of poetry, but about what Raymond Williams identified as an emerging definition
                  of culture and, bound up with that, a crucial case for the broader importance of the
                  humanities themselves. At a time when those of us who work in the humanities face
                  unprecedented pressure to make the case for what we do to numerous different audiences—university
                  administrators, government policy-makers, the media, and the general public—this argument
                  is worth emphasizing. </p>
               <p>On one level, this question is bound up with a more fundamental pedagogical issue
                  that colors the study of all literary history (or history in general). Whether we
                  theorize it explicitly or not, the study of any period of literary history is shaped
                  by the question of whether we are interested in that earlier period because of the
                  ways that it differs from our own age, or the ways that it resembles us. Does its
                  very strangeness offer a perspective on our own world that can be critically productive
                  and politically enabling, or do we react more strongly to the ways that the uncanny
                  parallels that we find in these texts resonate across time? In practice, of course,
                  it is never a simple either/or proposition. The real challenge lies in being as aware
                  as we can be of the shaping influence of the dynamic tension between these perspectives.</p>
               <p>This has certainly been the case with the Romantic period. In many ways, our most
                  basic approaches to it have always said as much about the spirit of our own age as
                  they did about the period itself. In an age when civil rights campaigners and anti-war
                  protestors made common cause with a new generation of singers and poets, we became
                  aware of just how big a part the French Revolution had played in shaping the consciousness
                  of the group of writers that would become known as the Romantics. As the reform movement
                  faltered, we grew used to thinking about the Romantics’ ideas about poetry as an evasion
                  rather than an extension of their own fading radical politics. In the years when a
                  postmodern aesthetic emphasizing fragmentation and vertiginous self-referentiality
                  dominated the academy, we discovered Romantic irony. In recent years, caught up in
                  the profound technological changes unleashed by the digital revolution, we have increasingly
                  emphasized the ways that late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth-century debates about
                  print culture were already focusing squarely on the complex assumptions and multiple
                  forms of mediation that structured literature as a field of cultural production. In
                  so many of these ways, the Romantics turn out to have anticipated our major preoccupations
                  long before we ever became aware of them. But they also did so in remarkably different
                  social and political conditions, and in ways that are ultimately very different from
                  our own beliefs and practices today.</p>
               <p>Negotiating this blend of historical echoes and epistemic ruptures is complicated
                  by a further pedagogical twist that runs through all of this: the challenge, which
                  none of us ever fully master, of recognizing the sheer <em>presentness</em> of any earlier age: the fact that people were living, thinking, and writing in the
                  present tense and without the benefit of hindsight. It can be difficult for students
                  to fully appreciate that these people—<em>all people</em>—correctly thought of themselves as living in the most modern age that had ever existed,
                  and that they were wrestling with changes that were often far more rapid and far more
                  fundamental than anything we are living through today. They were continually struck
                  by their exceptional modernity rather than their historicity. The challenge of adequately
                  recognizing this is exacerbated by the temporal equivalent of a familiar optical illusion:
                  the sense that objects far away are moving very slowly, if they’re moving at all.
                  In a similar way, the further back we look into the past, the easier it is to underestimate
                  the impact of the sense of change that they were living through, and the lack of the
                  sort of hindsight that we too often impose on them. Socrates never thought of himself
                  as a Classical thinker, nor did Elizabethan writers know that they were living in
                  the Renaissance. Wordsworth and Blake would probably have been puzzled to learn that
                  they were Romantics. The labels come later, and even where they are appropriate, they
                  can have the unfortunate effect of tidying history up in ways that erase the messiness,
                  which may be the most important part of what we’re studying. Recognizing the impact
                  of all of this makes studying literary history, including the challenge of negotiating
                  the changing nexus of historical parallels and differences that we discover in it,
                  simultaneously more challenging and more important.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">II</span></h2>
               <p>Shelley’s effort to articulate a transformative social and political role for poetry
                  in a rapidly changing industrial world, and in ways that now seem both profoundly
                  outmoded and strikingly current, exemplifies these various theoretical questions about
                  the study of literary history. This is especially true when we read his argument in
                  the context of one further academic debate that has become increasingly urgent over
                  the past few years: the issue of the role of the humanities. As Martha Nussbaum has
                  recently argued, “we are in the midst of a crisis of massive proportions and grave
                  global significance”: not “the global economic crisis that began in 2008” but the
                  decline of support for the humanities in terms of both pedagogical and research priorities
                  within universities (1–2). Nussbaum’s book—<em>Not For Profit: Why Democracy Needs the Humanities</em>—has become a widely cited element of this debate, but the urgency of the topic has
                  ensured an equally strong chorus of responses. Google “crisis in the humanities” and
                  you are confronted with a very long and rapidly growing list of people weighing in
                  on the subject. There is a “crisis in the humanities” home page, blogs, links to numerous
                  columns and articles, whether in the mainstream media or academic journals, a Wikipedia
                  site, amazon.com links containing references to numerous books on the topic, and so
                  on. The outlook they share is that things are pretty bleak. As Robert Weisbuch put
                  it, “[t]oday’s consensus about the state of the humanities” is that “it’s bad, it’s
                  getting worse, and no one is doing much about it,” all of which “ is supported by
                  dismal facts” (B4).</p>
               <p>As many of these critics emphasize, the immediate problems generated on a practical
                  level by declining support for the humanities are exacerbated by a far more serious
                  failure to understand the broader social worth of the humanities in an age when the
                  perceived benefits of knowledge production are increasingly viewed in terms of market
                  forces. An editorial entitled “Liberal Arts and Commercial Utility” in Canada’s leading
                  national newspaper, the<em>Globe and Mail</em>, neatly summed these problems up in its warning that, “the liberal arts are necessary
                  and good, but not sufficient in the modern age.” It didn’t bother to explain what
                  it might mean to be “sufficient in the modern age,” but given the editorial’s headline,
                  it didn’t really need to. As Stefan Collini has argued in a widely cited <em>TLS</em> Commentary, this absolute inability to imagine the worth of the humanities in any
                  socially useful sense was starkly demonstrated in the Research Excellence Framework
                  that was recently established as the official basis for determining research funding
                  allocations amongst English universities. As Collini has pointed out, part of this
                  formula for funding allocation depends on what the Research Excellence Framework calls
                  “impact,” which it breaks down into thirty-seven possible categories, each of which
                  is in turn measured by a series of “indicators” such as “creating new businesses,”
                  “commercializing new products or processes,” and “attracting R&amp;D investment from global
                  business” (18).</p>
               <p>It is not difficult or inaccurate to draw a line of connection between the narrow
                  market-based vision of the Research Excellence Framework and the <em>Globe and Mail</em>’s editorial on “Liberal Arts and Commercial Utility,” which share both a diplomatic
                  sense that “the liberal arts are necessary and good,” and an equal confidence that
                  they are not somehow “sufficient in the modern age.” Certainly it is hard to see how
                  they could be “adequate,” given the list of “indicators” supplied by the Framework.
                  But as Collini also points out, the most serious evidence of the magnitude of this
                  problem lies in the lack of any indicators in the final category, the only one where
                  the work of most humanities scholars might easily be slotted, which is headed “other
                  quality of life benefits” (18). This category is the only one of the thirty-seven
                  that had no examples provided. It contains a one-line note, which merely says: “please
                  suggest what might also be included in this list” (18). They had to invite suggestions
                  because they themselves had no idea. They simply could not imagine any way that the
                  liberal arts could be seem to have any valid social impact. It beggared their imagination.</p>
               <p>Nor is any of this unprecedented, which is where we rejoin Shelley. His complaint
                  that poets had been challenged, “to resign the civic crown to reasoners and mechanists”
                  remains every bit as true today, but so too does the argument that he developed in
                  the face of this resistance (131). For early nineteenth-century advocates such as
                  Shelley, William Hazlitt, and Leigh Hunt, the arts constituted a central aspect of
                  a larger struggle for social progress, but like today, these arguments were themselves
                  sharpened by the need to challenge a utilitarian emphasis on the primacy of applied
                  knowledge. In Book III of <em>The Rationale of Reward</em>, Jeremy Bentham famously insisted, “that Prejudice apart, the game of push-pin is
                  of equal value with the arts and sciences of music and poetry. If the game of push-pin
                  furnish more pleasure, it is more valuable than either. Everybody can play at push-pin:
                  poetry and music are relished only by a few.” Nothing but “Prejudice” could explain
                  the persistent faith in the value of the arts. Echoing Plato’s eviction of the poet
                  in <em>The Republic</em>, Bentham went on to suggest that poetry was not only hopelessly elitist, it was actually
                  dangerous: <span class="quote">‘The game of push-pin is always innocent: it were well could the same be always asserted
                     of poetry. Indeed, between poetry and truth there is natural opposition: false morals
                     and fictitious nature. The poet always stands in need of something false. When he
                     pretends to lay his foundations in truth, the ornaments of his superstructure are
                     fictions; his business consists in stimulating our passions, and exciting our prejudices. . . .
                     If poetry and music deserve to be preferred before a game of push-pin, it must be
                     because they are calculated to gratify those individuals who are most difficult to
                     be pleased. (206–07)’</span> Bentham may have been more polemical than most, but his position was a familiar one.
                  His fellow utilitarian, Thomas Love Peacock (a poet himself in earlier days), insisted
                  in <em>The Four Ages of Poetry</em> that the cultivation of poetry could only be “to the neglect of some branch of useful
                  study,” in stark contrast with the tendency of “the thinking and studious, and scientific
                  and philosophical part of the community” to draw on “the materials of useful knowledge”
                  in order to prepare one’s self for “the real business of life” (578–79). The logic
                  that structures the Research Excellence Framework is many ways a natural extension
                  of these earlier utilitarian positions, which is what makes the opportunity to situate
                  Shelley’s “Defence” within our own utilitarian debates today especially important.</p>
               <p>Responding to Peacock’s criticisms, Shelley distinguished between two different types
                  of utility: spiritual nourishment (“whatever strengthens and purifies the affections,
                  enlarges the imagination, and adds spirit to sense”) and what he dismissed as the
                  “narrower one of banishing the importunity of the wants of our animal nature, the
                  surrounding men with security of life, the dispersing the grosser delusions of superstition,
                  and the conciliating such a degree of forbearance among men as may consist with the
                  motives of personal advantage” (132). The first is “universal and permanent,” the
                  latter merely “transitory and particular” (132). Given this choice, Shelley suggests,
                  the real priority is clear: what were the inconveniences of poverty, starvation and
                  war (issues connected with “the wants of our animal nature”) compared with this higher
                  good (“whatever strengthens and purifies the affections, enlarges the imagination,
                  and adds spirit to sense”)? </p>
               <p>The problem, as students are rightly quick to notice, is that Shelley’s reaction winds
                  up being as hopelessly self-serving and elitist as Peacock’s criticisms were shortsighted.
                  At first glance it seems to be guilty of self-absorption in ways that make him indifferent
                  to the needs of the worst off around him. Peacock was well-intentioned but reductive,
                  but Shelley seems to be ranking the challenge of providing people with food, shelter,
                  and security somewhere far beneath the task of “enlarg[ing] our imagination.” He compounds
                  the problem by going on to dismiss mere “reasoners” such as Locke, Hume, Gibbon, Voltaire,
                  and Rousseau, who struggled in their limited way on behalf of “oppressed and deluded
                  humanity.” Not that they were completely useless. Had the world not benefitted from
                  their efforts, Shelley conceded, “a little more nonsense would have been talked for
                  a century or two; and perhaps a few more men, women and children, burnt as heretics.
                  We might not at this moment have been congratulating each other on the abolition of
                  the Inquisition in Spain” (132). But these changes paled in comparison with the spectre
                  of “the moral condition of the world if neither Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Chaucer,
                  Shakespeare, Calderon, Lord Bacon, nor Milton, had ever existed; if Raphael and Michael
                  Angelo had never been born; if the Hebrew poetry had never been translated; if a revival
                  of the study of Greek literature had never taken place; if no monuments of ancient
                  sculpture had been handed down to us” (132). One can understand people’s outrage to
                  this position, which seems to epitomize the worst kinds of special pleading that people
                  associate with the liberal arts: a forerunner of what Alex Usher has recently dismissed
                  as the “‘we're-not-sure-how-but-boy-the-Arts-are-important’ hand-waving we do now”
                  (“Re-imagining”). </p>
               <p>Usher is right to bristle at this sort of self-congratulatory posturing, except that
                  in Shelley’s case, it is not quite this simple. In many ways, the text sets us up
                  to believe the worst, and therefore to align ourselves with the positions espoused
                  by Bentham and Peacock, as well as by the authors of the Research Excellence Framework
                  and the <em>Globe and Mail</em> editorial, only to demonstrate why this would be so shortsighted. And the key to
                  this reversal lies in his references to the assembly line. Far from indulging in the
                  “‘we're-not-sure-how-but-boy-the-Arts-are-important’ hand-waving” that his argument
                  seems to suggest, Shelley’s argument was ultimately clear sighted and materialist.
                  His objection is not to the ideal of economic rationalization <em>per se</em>, but to its broader social impact: the fact that increased productivity had led,
                  for want of the sort of larger perspective that he associated with poetry, to “the
                  exasperation of the inequality of mankind” (134). Or as Shelley rather unpoetically
                  put it, “the rich have become richer, and the poor have become poorer” (132). In a
                  just society, many would argue, dramatically increased productivity should be a great
                  equalizer, a powerful means of tackling the class contradictions that had been exacerbated
                  by the onset of the industrial revolution. But for lack of imagination, greater productivity
                  had only magnified these inequalities. Recognizing the importance of the relation
                  between technological advances and the visionary impulse that would ensure that these
                  advances translate into progressive social changes means that the choice between the
                  two different types of utility (the poetic spirit and material needs) turns out to
                  be a false opposition that ignores the valuable relations between them. Social reformers
                  required the visionary potential that Shelley identified with the imagination in order
                  to recognize both the potential unintended consequences of their work and the avenues
                  for change that might not otherwise have been envisioned. The poetic spirit expanded
                  rather than negated or transcended the impact of applied knowledge by insisting on
                  the larger contexts within which its deployment (or “impact”) would ultimately be
                  felt.</p>
               <p>The problem, Shelley argued, was that rapid technological change across a range of
                  applied sciences had fostered a sense of technological determinism that led to a politically
                  paralyzing distortion of this relation: “We have more moral, political and historical
                  wisdom, than we know how to reduce into practice; we have more scientific and economical
                  knowledge than can be accommodated to the just distribution of the produce which it
                  multiplies. The poetry in these systems of thought, is concealed by the accumulation
                  of facts and calculating processes” (134). The problem lay in an imbalance between
                  applied and critical, or instrumentalist and self-reflexive knowledge: “a cultivation
                  of the mechanical arts in a degree disproportioned to the presence of the creative
                  faculty. . . . From what other cause has it arisen that these inventions which should
                  have lightened, have added a weight to the curse imposed on Adam?” (134).</p>
               <p>Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno would pose a very similar argument in <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> but where, for Horkheimer and Adorno, there was no escape from the Enlightenment’s
                  “indefatigable self-destructiveness,” Shelley embraced the much broader perspective
                  that he associated with poetry as both a basis for critical insight and a stimulant
                  for radical intervention (xi). “We want the creative faculty to imagine that which
                  we know; we want the generous impulse to act that which we imagine” (134). For Shelley,
                  the poetic imagination was ultimately a form of praxis: “There is no want of knowledge
                  respecting what is wisest and best in morals, government, and political economy, or
                  at least, what is wiser and better than what men now practise and endure. But we let
                  ‘<em>I dare not</em> wait upon <em>I would</em>, like the poor cat in the adage’” (134).</p>
               <p>Shelley’s claim, ultimately, is that the poetic imagination marked a radical extension
                  of Enlightenment rationalism; a self-reflexive domain capable of both interrogating
                  the potential consequences of reformers’ interventions and of helping to maximize
                  their progressive impact. But even more importantly, the terms in which Shelley makes
                  this particular argument—seeming to be guilty of a flagrant case of “‘we're-not-sure-how-but-boy-the-Arts-are-important’
                  hand-waving we do now” only to show why this is precisely not that case through his
                  allusions to the negative impact of the assembly line—rehearses the failure of critics
                  to recognize the “impact” of the arts (or the humanities) in order to show why they
                  are not just “sufficient in the modern age,” but more important than ever. At a time
                  when the humanities face renewed pressure to justify themselves in the utilitarian
                  terms that have come to dominate these discussions, his point is once again worth
                  making. Learning to be good readers of Shelley’s text can foster a clearer understanding
                  of the real nature of these debates about the humanities, both today and two hundred
                  years ago, but it can also help to train people to be more critically engaged in the
                  broader dynamics of our age in precisely the ways that Shelley’s argument about the
                  power relations that inform the social impact of all applied knowledge suggests. In
                  doing so it helps us to answer the question about the broader social worth of the
                  humanities by making us recognize just how complicated the idea of the “impact” of
                  knowledge can actually be.</p>
