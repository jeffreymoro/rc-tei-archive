                <p>This essay discusses how a course on nineteenth-century literature can become a
                    course on persistent preoccupations with available forms of political thought
                    and action. This outcome I would like to count as a kind of success, and this
                    success, in a course I have taught, has been inextricable from a certain set of
                    “pathologies” that developed in the process of reading the course material with
                    the students. In a course about “revolution,” I teach students how to use a
                    history of imagination and writing about the conditions and possibility of
                    significant social change to curb their own political optimism. To become so
                    depressed in this course is good for them, I insist, because this is how
                    nineteenth-century reading material becomes relevant to the present. </p>
                <p>The kind of depression I refer to is that which Eve Sedgwick identified as
                    integral for pedagogical and generational transmission, and different from the
                    “common sense” understanding of depression. It is not a dis-ease imposed from
                    the outside on a sufferer aspiring to escape this state so as to differentiate
                    it from the ostensibly normal condition of thought and spirit.<note place="foot"
                        > Sedgwick’s rendition of the common sense understanding of depression: a
                        “chronic natural gloominess,” or “exogenous malady, from who knows where,
                        that is liable to descend on its unsuspecting host until heroically routed
                        by medicine and positive mental hygiene.”</note> Sedgwick offers “the
                    depressive personality in the educator” and “the depressive position,”
                    elaborations by Silvan Tomkins and Melanie Klein respectively, as accounts of
                    depression more illuminating of the teaching situation because they suggest how
                    the pedagogical relationship is one of precarious growth and pervasive
                    ambivalence about the distribution of the power to know. For Tomkins, Sedgwick
                    points out, “the depressive personality in the educator” accounts for a person
                    in whom “the depressive personality or script” is “a durable feature” of their
                    way of being, “a constitutive feature of their best aptitudes as well as
                    disabilities,” regardless of their experience of depression. In a description
                    that could alarm many an impassioned educator with its peculiar familiarity,
                    Tomkins’s “depressive, like his parent before him, is not altogether a
                    comfortable person to be around.” Still, the discomforts he (or she) creates are
                    instrumental in the forming of the depressive pair. An other is (or multiple
                    others are) “seduced” into a pair by the depressive’s genuine care and interest,
                    only to be found lacking and compelled to “seek restitution, to atone, and to
                    please the other” (Tomkins 225). This is how depressives make other depressives,
                    both students and teachers. </p>
                <p>While Tomkins’s is an account of a “particular kind of individual who emerges
                    from the contingency of a particular history,” Klein’s “depressive position” is
                    a universally available developmental phase, a “uniquely spacious rubric,” which
                    “encompasses not only preconditions of severe depression, but also resources for
                    surviving, repairing, and moving far beyond that depression.” It is a labile
                    position of dependence on objects whose solidity one has had to establish for
                    oneself, which could become one’s undoing. Yet the depressive position is an
                    “anxiety-mitigating achievement” (an improvement over the paranoid/schizoid
                    position), marked by the “foundational, authentically difficult understanding
                    that good and bad tend to be inseparable at every level.” </p>
                <p>Both of these are accounts of the work of depression—or, rather, the work on
                    depression—and they seem apt to me as descriptions of the work in a course that
                    encourages students to consider the character of their position as revolutionary
                    subjects. From the perspective of the institution, this course is one of the
                    required “historical perspectives” on literature, of which each English major
                    has to take four. They must all know that there is a relationship between
                    literature and historical change. <note place="foot"> Requirement checklist for
                        English majors at John Jay College CUNY is at <ref

                            >http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/departments/english/Checklist_for_English_Major-F2010.pdf</ref>.
                    </note> I advertise the course as a semester-long investigation of
                    nineteenth-century texts’ relationship to a period that seems to have been
                    marked by relentless political and social upheaval. The course is organized
                    around texts published between the French (1789) and the Russian (1917)
                    revolutions. <note place="foot">The cutoff revolutions could have been
                        different, but I decided to stay with 1789 as the opening date that figures
                        prominently in many historical accounts of European modernity. In an article
                        that will be required reading in the next iteration of the course, Michael
                        Keith Baker uses newly digitized and searchable repositories of early modern
                        texts to trace the transformations in the meaning and uses of the word
                        “revolution.” The article is a model deployment of new methodology:
                        technologically savvy, conservative about machine intelligence, and
                        sophisticated in defining search terms. Its analysis of the newly legible
                        resources sustains Baker’s larger claim that revolution is a “historically
                        constituted category of historical understanding.” This is a claim not just
                        about linguistic trends and statistics, but also about how words have been
                        trusted to reflect and effect a change in the world. Baker argues that the
                        meaning of the word shifted around the political change initiated in France
                        in 1789, a “revolution revolutionized” (189). The word referred no longer to
                        the completed events (albeit dramatic and transformative) but to an “ongoing
                        political act” (190), an “expression of the dynamic transformational process
                        advancing the progress of humankind, not endless meaningless variations on
                        the same thing” (206). It was thus also a “script for future political or
                        social action” (199), a socialized and normalized requirement for an
                        optimistic political imagination for anyone committed to “progress” and
                        “society,” whose shared future is shaped by a good grasp and management of
                        the present.</note> It is a course on “Literature and Revolution” in the
                    “long” nineteenth century: the unrest seems to spill over the ends of a century,
                    over the borders of European nation states, and over the ends of continents. The
                    interest in revolution, I propose, has to be an interest in the narratives and
                    expectations that made radical change seem, for over a hundred years, necessary
                    and worthwhile to some, terrifying and impossible to others, and certainly never
                    finished. What made the change worthwhile? Wrecking the known world was one
                    thing, but doing it in the name of a better new one nobody had ever seen had to
                    be something quite different. Was the “world” different from “society?” Who was
                    “society” anyway? Who were the “radicals” and how radical were they? Was all
                    that revolution a success? Are we living in it now? </p>
                <p>As a historical event or notion, “revolution” figured very vaguely in the
                    students’ imaginations, a fairly sparse catalogue of revolutionary facts and
                    figures. (The vibrancy of their historical imagination of the long nineteenth
                    century in Europe may remain unchanged in the aftermath of the course.) Most of
                    them claimed at the beginning of the course that they had heard of the French
                    Revolution before signing up, and guessed wildly about when it started and how
                    it ended. Only a few had heard of the Russian revolution: the closer the country
                    of their parents’ origin to the former Soviet Union, the more likely they were
                    to know that this revolution happened at all, and (rarely) to point accurately
                    to the century in which it began. Virtually no one in the class had ever heard
                    of the revolutions of 1848, although all of them had heard of the specter of
                    Karl Marx, and most knew of the existence of the “Communist Manifesto.” Very few
                    had thought of Marx as the kind of menace whose motor, especially in depictions
                    of communism in the United States, was his writing.<note place="foot"> When I
                        rehearsed in front of the class a brief narrative about the Bolshevik
                        Revolution’s aspiration to create and preserve unprecedented change, change

                    Romanticism, but had no idea what it may have to do with radical political
                    change.</p>
                <p>The relevance of the course overall seemed to many students fairly unclear since
                    there was no confusion about the position we could take on revolution: we were
                    neither in it nor about it. The revolution was not for us, not something we
                    would learn to admire, being free to be or do (or study) anything, in the
                    country self-defined by a break from the tradition of government by fiat and
                    repression. Political stability and gradual reform were clearly
                        preferable—<emph>that</emph> was what we were there for. And where we were
                    matters a great deal: I teach at the City University of New York, a state-funded
                    system established to serve new immigrants, the aspiring optimists among New
                    York City’s servants, and other varieties of the working poor. The undergraduate
                    college where I teach is a federally registered “Hispanic-serving institution”
                    which anticipates in the shape of its remedial curriculum and its attention to
                    English for Academic Purposes that the majority of its students will be fluent
                    (although not necessarily academically proficient) in at least one language that
                    is not the language of college instruction.<note place="foot"> For many, English
                        language proficiency is a form of deference to the language of higher
                        education as an engine of social mobility; used competently in the register
                        of professional communication, “good English” constitutes a promise of
                        economic prosperity and personal advancement. The full name of the college
                        is “John Jay College of Criminal Justice,” an educational profile that now
                        serves as a marketable brand of specialty professional education and steady
                        tuition income, but also an impediment to John Jay’s transformation into a
                        “college of liberal arts” serving more traditional students, better prepared
                        academically and capable of paying more for their tuition. </note>

                <p>This college-level literature classroom is a kind of fulfillment of eighteenth-
                    and nineteenth-century revolutionary visions of universal access to democratic
                    public institutions, to all avenues of social mobility, and to the
                    transformative effects of art. It is these young people, not just Voltaire’s,
                    who would see great things.These English majors are hardly cynical about
                    narratives of liberation and progress, or about the promises of individualism
                    and self-determination as the ends of education. They know and live what Lauren
                    Berlant has called the “centrality of optimistic fantasy to reproducing and
                    surviving in zones of compromised ordinariness.” (35) To find out that reading
                    and writing may be their means of personal and professional advancement is for
                    many students a minor revolutionary turn. Often they are academic refugees from
                    fields that promised greater or more tangible rewards (financial security,
                    social mobility), but also failed students intellectually and emotionally. Their
                    first experience of textual interpretation is impossible to ignore precisely
                    because it provides an opportunity to admit into the university classroom their
                    doubts about what such a classroom can or should do.<note place="foot"> Under
                        the latest transformation of the general education curriculum, adopted
                        against loud protests from the faculty, students now choose from topical
                        “buckets” (e.g., Individual and Society, or Learning from the Past), in
                        which any number of disciplines can compete for students’ attention, to the
                        point of mutual exclusion of history and literature, or literature and fine
                        art. As a result, it is possible to graduate from college without ever
                        taking a literature or a history class. </note>
                </p>
                <p>A course on “literature and revolution” promises to examine the logic and the
                    significance of narratives that bring students to literature in the university
                    classroom as two spaces through which to project one’s desires. It makes use of
                    the students’ concern that the class may want to put in question the viability
                    of their chosen method of progress, liberation, and self-determination, and the
                    awkwardness of their self-congratulation. Depression is at the center of this
                    pedagogical situation, in which interpretation of texts concerned with radical
                    social change is a way of producing fraught histories of the students’ own
                    interpretive positions, of their ambivalent commitments to the narrative visions
                    of futurity, and to the languages in which they reach the present. </p>
                <p>The rhetoric of revolution permeated the course atmosphere, as official media
                    tried to assess the clearly dramatic events of the “Arab Spring,” a season of
                    change that had by then spanned over three years, and social media supplied the
                    extraordinary detail of the extraordinary events at unprecedented speed. The
                    surfeit of data was expected to help standardize the magnitude of political
                    transformations that qualified as “real” revolution. By the time our course
                    began, the unrest had spread from Egypt across several countries in the Middle
                    East and North Africa, and the cultivation of optimism regarding the direction
                    and magnitude of the change gave way to pronouncements of disaster and
                    incompetent management of progress. Initial appraisals had wondered if
                    “revolutionary” transformation could happen over the course of one day (January
                    25, 2010 in Cairo), in a year,<note place="foot">

                    By 2013, the <title level="m">New York Times </title>was declaring that making
                    revolution was no swift or clean business. Although it was still easy to
                    understand why the status quo was untenable, it was clear that what was once
                    “optimistically known as the Arab Spring,” had become a drawn-out, chaotic mess.
                    In face of the damage done in the three years since the Egyptian revolt, it was
                    clear that the “Spring” never stood for a viable “replacement model” for the
                    broken societies; now these societies “find peace is harder than
                        revolution.”<note place="foot"> By way of comparison of the new situation on
                        the ground to the pre-revolutionary condition, the <title level="m">Times
                        </title>article offers that “the region’s old status quo, dominated by
                        imperious rulers who fixed elections, ruled by fiat and quashed dissent, has
                        been fundamentally damaged, if not overthrown.” In 2015, the civil wars in
                        Syria and Iraq, and the resulting refugee crisis affecting every continent,
                        seem to be the fruit of that “revolution.”</note> (Hubbard and Gladstone
                    2013)</p>
                <p>The distance between what these revolutionaries knew they no longer wanted and
                    the shape of what they desired was a useful reminder that “societies” can be
                    difficult quantities to grasp and dangerous to tinker with. Even with all the
                    information available, contemporary revolutions (if that is what they are) snag
                    precisely because the political desires of one society could take on many,
                    contrary, and even murderous shapes.<note place="foot">Paul Mason of the <title
                            level="m">Guardian</title>, assessing what made for twenty-first century
                        revolution, ventured that “something real and important was unleashed in
                        2011” that had not “gone away,” despite the clear dents in public optimism
                        about the events’ trajectory, the supremely destructive civil war in Syria
                        their dystopian apex. “Confident enough” to call the events a revolution in
                        2013, Mason pointed to “a change in consciousness, the intuition that
                        something big is possible; that a great change in the world's priorities is
                        within people's grasp.” </note> In our course about a history of definitions
                    and descriptions of depressing presents and bright futures, a series of readings
                    in the nineteenth century could become a sustained discussion about how (or
                    whether) a “replacement model” justifies the beginning or the reiteration of a
                    “revolution,” about what one can make of others’ attempts to risk life and limb,
                    and how revolution can become a contagious social practice—a way of thinking
                    others’ thoughts and doing their deeds in the name of the bright future of a
                    “society.” The students’ work is to orient themselves in that history by
                    recognizing the contingencies of narratives they tell themselves about
                    themselves—assuming there is a self—and their relationship to others. How does
                    one become responsible for one’s own well-being, and relate to that of others,
                    if, as Marx was to put in a moment of predictable disappointment at the sight of
                    revolutionary momentum turning into a joke, no one can select the circumstances
                    in which to make their own history?</p>
                <p>The course suggests that these are questions of interpretation explicitly
                    politicized by what we now read as literature of Romanticism. By “Romanticism”
                    we imagine not just the canonical male poets, but the many writers for whom the
                    turn of the nineteenth century was a period of enormous exhilaration and
                    disappointment, what they recognized as a whole new order of experience, for
                    which they proposed a new kind of relationship to representation—to writing and
                    reading. Students react perhaps most dramatically at the epistolary narratives
                    of Helen Maria Williams, the author of “letters to friends” in England from the
                    eye of the revolutionary storm in France, with surprise and amazement at what to
                    them seems like an unlikely life-narrative for a late eighteenth-century woman.
                    Tracing her “career” from the early exhilaration about acting on the futuristic
                    principles of universal equality, to the onset of paranoid social imagination
                    justifying mass murder, students find Williams disorienting. We know these are
                    not real personal letters, but still, how appealing! How did she know so early
                    that this was the future? Why is it news to us that a woman acted thus on her
                    vision? How does our hindsight compare to her knowing at the time that an epoch
                    was being made? </p>
                <p>Romanticism, in this course on revolution, addresses the significance of textual
                    interpretation for understanding the constantly shifting grounds of pleasure,
                    knowledge, and action. It is a conceptual tool for thinking about how a
                    “literary” text from the turn of the nineteenth century may want to be read as a
                    kind of historical document, but also as a document of recognition, of
                    comprehension from the readers’ remove, from the present in which it is expected
                    to do its work. Under the changing circumstances for the work of representation,
                    what does “Romanticism” offer readers to be curious, if not excited, about? Of
                    Wordsworth’s “The Thorn,” one student writes, <quote>
                The first point that the writer wants us to understand, is that the place where
                    this thorn is located is hard to reach/find. It says “high on a mountain’s
                    highest ridge, where oft the stormy winter gale cuts like a scythe.” From this
                    we gather that we would have to climb a mountain and risk the heavy stormy winds
                    to get to this place, but we have no idea why we would want to reach this place.
                    The constant descriptions of this place without giving us a reason as to why we
                    would want to know this is a good way to keep the reader engaged. It pulls you
                    in. (unpublished essay)</quote>
                To let oneself be led to a strange place can be pedagogically depressing, in that
                    the teacher may be inviting the students to perform self-annihilating tasks.
                    What is a “good” student to read into Burke’s response to the French Revolution
                    immediately after reading Williams? Are students to learn how to take on his
                    knowing position on what is good for all the decent people? Can a “good” student
                    find unacceptable the arguments of an assigned canonical writer who now seems
                    prescient about how badly prepared everybody was for radical change? The little
                    patience and plenty of discomfort students have upon reading Wordsworth’s
                    “Michael” has to do not just with the poetic form the suffering takes (Too long!
                    Set too far off in the country!), but also with the conditions in which the
                    tragedy in the poem appears to them neither too complex nor particularly moving.
                    They are bored with the narrative about a young man chewed up by the great wide
                    world, his tragedy clearly not theirs. Indeed, they are lost on the newness of
                    the then-greatness of the world, in which change is already inevitable and
                    occasionally eats its own children. They are out to get chewed up better, the
                    post-revolutionary beneficiaries of transparency. That the poet should try to
                    bring up the case is not interesting, not now, and this is not what the poet’s
                    work is.</p>
                <p>But what is a poet’s work? In response to the discussion of the Preface to <title
                        level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, one student wanted the class to watch
                    videos of performances by spoken word artists whose work, the class agreed,
                    could be understood as a kind of legacy of the work begun by Wordsworth and
                    Coleridge, an afterlife of Romanticism. Most of these are videos recorded at
                    regular gatherings in the Bronx, the place, as Marshall Berman pointed out,
                    where much that is solid has been known to melt into air. They draw a crowd of
                    New Yorkers in their late teens and early twenties, mostly people of color for
                    whom these are social and political events. The events’ political momentum
                    derives from the attention they give to language and poetic form—to the
                    speakers’ and listeners’ appreciation of rhythm and delivery—as living forces
                    that intervene in the common ways of thinking about the relationship between
                    “individuals” and “society.” The artists—individuals—speak on behalf of other
                    individuals, the young people in the audience, physical and virtual, and any
                    imagined occupying comparable subjective positions and recognizing their
                    personal narratives in the ones performed on stage.<title

                        students relate to or constitute “society.”</title></p>
                <p>The relevance of these events to our class has to do with their manifestly
                    Romantic (and romantic) commitment to giving living form to the political and
                    poetic premises of the performed texts. The draw of the events for those who
                    attend is the possibility that this use of language is a relevant kind of
                    engagement with the emergency facing all who aspire to change their individual
                    circumstances against the emergent knowledge that structural pressure makes any
                    meaningful change implausible and impossible. The most moving to all in class
                    was a piece called “Strive!”—an injunction to persist in believing in the
                    promises the great society makes to its young and unconnected who find
                    themselves facing ubiquitous obstacles to self-realization. Being at the event,
                    performing and appreciating the performance (in the physical or virtual space),
                    serves to galvanize the resolve of everyone present (voiced by the speakers on
                    behalf of the audience) not to succumb to evident and pervasive pessimism.
                    Alternatively, or additionally, the point is to perform an affirmation of one’s
                    awareness that there is a place from which to assess one’s position, that the
                    work of improvement is underway, that those sharing the space are not losing
                    their sight of it. Going back to the events is a form of productive action—a
                    signal that someone is taking stock of everyone’s commitments to the future,
                    rather than cultivating a singular fantasy about the promises tendered.</p>
                <p>Brought into the college classroom, these events are no longer obscure or
                    “subcultural” in the same way. They are contemporary echoes that make room for
                    reading students’ experience of frustration with responses to their impossible
                    demands. A sustained reading of long-nineteenth-century texts about revolution
                    becomes a discussion about the relationship of the students’ present to the
                    history of disappointments and failures of partially shared visions of
                    liberation and justice. It is a huge disappointment and relief to a constituency
                    of mostly first-generation college students, children of the working poor and
                    first-generation immigrants to think that the philosophical, ideological, and
                    political questions of “speculative philosophers,” poets, and reactionaries of
                    the Romantic period look for answers in our own day, and that we may be asking
                    them. The old texts may suggest that history cannot and should not repeat
                    itself, but they also make it possible to think that these are—that the course
                    is set in—revolutionary times.</p>
                <p>So we practice making impossible demands. The course creates a cycle of hope
                    about the prospect of acting freely, on the ideals that make the teaching
                    situation possible. We speak as if we knew what place the classroom took in the
                    larger political process; we say the processes of change are unstoppable and
                    indispensable. We also say our goals are so ambitious that none of us can ever
                    hope to see them realized: the work is unfinished but also unfinishable.
                    Students begin to see themselves as beneficiaries and dupes of the pedagogical
                    relationship, offered the inexorable pleasures of learning about the capacity of
                    their position by a teacher whose work it is to point to the limitations and
                    disappointments of their potential. They loved reading P. B. Shelley’s <title
                        level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title>: did not mind the length, or the
                    style, and certainly were deeply moved by its conviction about the significance
                    to “the world” of language as an art form. When I asked whether they would
                    qualify it as a manifesto or a blueprint for action, a “good” student said, “I
                    knew you would say that!” </p>
                <p>This is a class about the bind in which we have to believe in action because we
                    have no choice but to act, although we know not exactly how or what for. In the
                    older languages of change, the class learns to hear in the call for revolution
                    not just promises of progress, but also promises of displacement, malaise,
                    anxiety, and uncertainty. Participation in such cycles of reading of one
                    another, and the reading of texts, makes room for the possibility that we are in
                    the middle of the process that Raymond Williams was right to call, in the first
                    reading on our schedule, a “long revolution,”<note place="foot"> Williams
                        comments that the title of his text is taken from a sentence in his earlier
                        book, <title level="m">Culture and Society, 1780–1950, </title>but in the
                        Introduction to <title level="m">The Long Revolution </title>explains
                        specifically that it “seems” to him that “we are living through a long
                        revolution, which our best descriptions only in part interpret. It is a
                        genuine revolution, transforming men and institutions; continually extended
                        and deepened by the actions of millions, continually and variously opposed
                        by explicit reaction and by the pressure of habitual forms and ideas”
                        (10).</note> a complex condition of which repetitive “failure” is a
                    constitutive element. Our narratives of failure are not tales of singular and
                    private blockage in a depressive state from which students need to be
                    extricated; in fact, the teacher could never be saved from it herself, let alone
                    save anyone else. It is rather a class on the possibility that exhilaration or
                    failure may not be anyone’s own, but rather a function of what Lauren Berlant
                    has called the “cruel optimism” of (especially contemporary) political
                    imagination, ruled by the “relation of attachment to compromised conditions of
                    possibility” (21). That the possibilities are compromised is depressing news,
                    and students shift around the point at which they think they heard it. The class
                    about revolution lets them say that this was not the first time they found
                    themselves in that strange place. Students who have spoken to me outside of
                    class and come to office hours put their questions about the work in a telling
                    form. They tend to ask me, “What do you do with yourself now?” The question is
                    of course about what they should do with themselves now, and the best I know how
                    to say is that this is all we ever do: know of the depressing future and still
                    demand to see great things. </p>
