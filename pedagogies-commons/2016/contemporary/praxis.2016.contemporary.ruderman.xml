            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">In this essay, I relate my experience of teaching an
                    upper-division class on romantic poetry—my struggles, assumptions and
                    discoveries, and my ultimate decision to revise the way I teach, and to some
                    extend think about, romanticism. The problem—the contemporary/romantic
                    opposition (the topic of this volume of essays)—turned out to be a pedagogical
                    and critical opportunity. It also became a way for my students and me to think
                    and talk about an even deeper split, the schism between the values of our
                    contemporary culture (including the culture of an increasingly professionalized
                    and professionalizing academia) and those of an “aesthetic education.” In what
                    follows, I give firsthand reports about what worked and what didn’t in a class
                    that came to be called “Repetitions of the Romantic,” an engagement with
                    romantic and post-romantic art. Along the way, I address some methodological
                    problems, and offer some reflections on the fragility of teaching the humanities
                    in the contemporary classroom and more specifically on what I see to be the
                    challenges and benefits of teaching the romantic within specific contexts, in my
                    case within the economic and social micro-culture of central Ohio. </p>

                    <p>I teach at a small regional campus of a large state institution in the
                        Midwest. Many of my students are first generation college students. As the
                        resident romanticist<note place="foot">In this essay, I have consciously
                            decided (with the support of the editors of RCPC) to break with
                            convention and de-captitalize the “romantic” and “romanticism.” My
                            reason for doing so is in order to foreground the everydayness and
                            demotic character of the romantic as I see it, as well as to suggest its
                            dialectical and iterative (but not trans-historical) nature. It recurs
                            at/as different moments, assuming a different character but bringing
                            with it an immanent challenge to existing orders and structures.
                        </note>, part of my job is to teach the upper-division romantic poetry
                        seminar. I initially looked forward to this with tremendous relish—what
                        could be better, I thought, than reading and teaching Byron, Hemans,
                        Coleridge, and Keats? </p>
                    <p>The first time I taught the course I discovered to my dismay a look of
                        blankness on the faces of many of my students. With our books open to “Mont
                        Blanc” or “Ruined Cottage,” there seemed to be a disconnect between what I
                        knew to be the pleasures of this poetry and the bewilderment and
                        disaffection my students seemed to be experiencing. Having taught some of
                        these same students in my “intro to poetry,” twentieth-century poetry, or
                        Brit-lit survey classes I knew many of them to be bright, inquisitive, and
                        able to associate and analogize across different discursive realms and
                        between periods and media. So I was puzzled. I did what I often do when a
                        class is not going well (it never works but I do it anyway)—I tried harder.
                        I gave them bits of historical and cultural background, for which they
                        seemed grateful, but a handout or even a half-hour lecture about the Corn
                        Laws or Burke’s theory of the sublime could not do the work of enlivening
                        these texts for these particular readers. In any case, we muddled through. </p>
                    <p>It wasn’t that my students couldn’t “read” the texts. It was, in part, that
                        they couldn’t recognize themselves, much less their own social, cultural,
                        and political situations, in the material. On a theoretical level, I knew
                        this inability to identify could have certain advantages: what would it be
                        like to read against the grain of “identity” and the “self?” But this was
                        all too philosophical and general. I had—perhaps we have—a real problem. It
                        wasn’t so much that my students felt alienated from Coleridge and Keats.
                        Rather it was that they found Coleridge and Keats, and especially
                        Wordsworth, irrelevant. On some level I had to entertain the possibility
                        that, at least for these students, these thinkers were in fact irrelevant.
                        It seemed to me that only through keeping open the possibility of the
                        irrelevance of these texts could we possibly hope to discover, recover, or
                        reactivate in them something meaningful for us in the moment. Hegel calls
                        this commitment to doubt and despair “the education of consciousness” (50).
                        The pertinence of these questions seem immediate and clear, not only as
                        someone who teaches the long nineteenth century, but also for all of us who
                        teach in the humanities.</p>

                    <head>Interlude on method #1</head>
                    <p>Because, I imagine like you, I am committed (through experience,
                            disposition, as well as through employment) to the continual
                            possibilities of an aesthetic education, I did not want to believe that
                            the powers of these Romantic-era texts were exhausted. But neither could
                            I believe that my students were entirely at fault in their ambivalence.
                            Having trained as a romanticist, and therefore having a part of my
                            professional and personal identity invested in these texts, I could not
                            help but be defensive. But I did my best to be open and curious about my
                            students’ reactions. Keats and Blake could defend themselves. Besides, I
                            thought, maybe it’s time to stop defending our poets. Perhaps the
                            backlash against the “hermeneutics of suspicion” has left us (yet again)
                            too identified with writers that we write on and teach.</p>
                    <p>In any case, the experience of teaching at my campus has convinced me
                            of the rightness of Gayatri Spivak’s claim that as teachers we “‘learn
                            to learn’ .&#160;.&#160;. how to teach from the historic-cultural text
                            within which a certain group of students might be placed” (9). In other
                            words, the students themselves provide an essential intertext (their
                            lives, their experiences, their varied frames of reference), without
                            which the primary texts in the classroom cannot live; they cannot
                            complete the (always incomplete) circuit from reader to text and back
                            again. We need to create opportunities in the classroom (and perhaps in
                            the curricula) to allow for these connections—not so that students can
                            better “relate,” although that might be the initial experience of the
                            student, but rather so that they can become “critical” and experience
                            the strangeness of their own textuality, not as given selves, but as
                            contingent, multi-determined, and continuously created assemblages of
                            images, ideas, values, and beliefs. Spivak, writing of teaching in
                            subaltern situations, quotes Prabhat Patnaik who writes that we must “go
                            beyond the mere imitation of research agendas set by the established
                            centers of learning .&#160;.&#160;.” (21). My own intuition is that an
                            aesthetic education in central Ohio today (ditto rural Virginia,
                            Southern Florida, or any number of city and state schools that serve
                            vastly diverse populations) cannot continue to replicate, more or less,
                            received models of liberal arts education. This process cannot, however,
                            be a mattering of “watering down,” but rather of inclusion and
                            listening, not just of and to diverse student populations (although that
                            is an essential element) but of and to the cultural, societal, and
                            economic surround.</p>

                    <p>Reflecting on my dilemma over the summer I came across this quotation from

                            however, has a way of renewing itself. It can be said of the romantic,
                            just as it can be said of the imagination, that it can never effectively
                            touch the same thing twice in the same way. It is partly because the
                            romantic will not be what has been romantic in the past that it is
                            preposterous to think of confining poetry hereafter to the revelation of
                            reality. The whole effort of the imagination is toward the production of
                            the romantic.<note place="foot">See also Stevens’
                                    preface to William Carlos Williams’ <title level="m">Collected
                                        Poems, 1921–1931 </title>in which he calls Williams a
                                    “romantic poet.” In a deconstructive turn, Stevens claims that
                                    it is precisely Williams’ “anti-poetic” tenacity, his refusal of
                                    the “accepted sense of things,” that makes him a romantic, in
                                        <title level="m">Opus, </title>255. Stevens would go on to make a similar claim
                                    for “nobility,” that it is a “force,” not its “manifestations.”
                                    Thus although the word and the concept seem belated, it
                                    continues nonetheless to have an effect in the world of the
                                    imagination (“The Noble Rider” 35).
                            </note> (266) </quote> This definition allowed me to conceive of the
                        “romantic” (not “romanticism”—that, for now, I would bracket) more broadly,
                        not just as trans-historical but also as a “self-renewing” repetition,
                        neither repressed nor disavowed but rather as perceptible but
                        not-quite-thought, an aspect of our everyday lives. I decided then to teach
                        the class as a “special topics class”: <title level="m">Repetitions of the
                            Romantic.</title>
                    </p>
                    <p>The course would attempt to locate resonances in romantic and post-romantic
                        art—feelings, forms, thoughts, attitudes, perspectives, and aesthetic
                        practices—that we could, with some justification, call romantic. Having
                        often used other media (MP3 files, movies, essays, image files, etc.) and
                        contemporary materials in the past as a way to elucidate aspects of romantic
                        poetry, I decided to “flip the script.” Rather than treat the contemporary
                        texts as supplemental, ways of connecting students to some deeper
                        understanding of Romantic-era texts, I chose instead to treat all the texts
                        as “primary.” I organized the class around certain structures of feeling
                        that to me seemed likely candidates for the romantic: “affect and emotion”;
                        “ecology and interconnectedness”; “melancholy vs. negative capability”;
                        “ecology and alienation”; “uncanny intimacy”; “the domestic imagination”;
                        “the subject of history”; “immortality and the death drive”; “forms of
                        intoxication”; and so on.</p>
                    <p>The class was small—twelve students—and met once a week in the evening for
                        three hours. Each week we read from a course-pack as well as from a
                            textbook—<title level="m">Poems for the Millennium, Vol. 3: Romantic and
                            Post-Romantic Poetry </title>from the University of California Press.
                        Most weeks there was also a movie or experimental film, seen out of class
                        via the university media server, but with certain scenes reviewed in class. </p>
                    <p> For my part I purposely eschewed, or, at the very least downplayed, the
                        received narratives of romanticism (our “family romance” if you will) such
                        as romanticism’s resistance to enlightenment reason, its ambivalent relation
                        to the French Revolution, its complicity in the partial erasure of its
                        history, etc. Instead, I emphasized the notion of a reciprocal critique, a
                        sense in which contemporary texts could be read not as fuller realizations
                        of Romantic-era texts, but rather as specific instances or expressions
                        within a shared symptomology. I intuited that this reciprocity might reveal
                        strange temporalities and determinations in which Romantic-era texts might
                        be read as “later” and contemporary texts as “earlier,” a topic I explore
                        below. I began each three-hour class having us address the Romantic-era
                        texts assigned for that day. So for example, for the module entitled
                        “uncanny intimacy” we read “Anecdote for Fathers” and “Old Man Traveling” by
                        Wordsworth, and, of course, “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” by Coleridge.
                        After working for ninety minutes or so, we took a short break. When we came
                        back from break we read the post-romantic texts, in this case, two sonnets
                        by Gerard Manley Hopkins from the 1870s, “The Snowman” by Wallace Stevens,
                        ca. 1918, and the film entitled “Northwest Passage,” the pilot episode of
                        the <title level="m">Twin Peaks </title>television series, directed by David
                        Lynch in 1990. When I taught the class again, I alternated the order of
                        readings between Romantic-era and contemporary texts, so that one week we
                        read the romantic texts first and the next week the contemporary, and so on.
                        That way no period is necessarily privileged in terms of its importance. </p>
                    <p> Students were asked to post responses to an online discussion board before
                        each week’s class, a day or two before the class meeting time. Often
                        students struggled to fit their reading of a particular text into the
                        specific topic designation I had given to the class. I hoped at the time
                        that their struggle would be generative, and I now believe that it was. The
                        students for the most part did marvelous associative work. For example, in
                        the module on “Ecology and Interconnectedness” students were making links
                        from the movie <title level="m">Magnolia, </title>to poems by A. R. Ammons
                        and S. T. Coleridge, to the “Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical
                            Ballads</title>,” and finally to a song by rapper Aesop Rock. In some
                        instances, students seem to grasp intuitively the connections, as in the
                        following fragment from a post: <quote> Highly charged with emotion,
                            Magnolia shows interconnectedness amongst humans in a dramatic way,
                            including (mostly) subtle natural events. And while I don’t necessarily
                            agree with all that Wordsworth said of poets in “Preface to Lyrical
                            Ballads,” I do accept that we are connected with nature, [and that] some
                            of us finding more meaning and understanding in a poet’s work than a
                            scientist’s .&#160;.&#160;.yet all of the other pieces that look at
                            human connection with nature provide quite a different view
                            .&#160;.&#160;.in fact, our relationship with nature .&#160;.&#160;.now
                            seems increasingly vulgar. A.R. Ammons gives a wonderful description of
                            the forced and unnatural contributions man has made to our beautiful
                            surroundings and in his work our well-intended endeavors pale in
                            comparison. This also seems to be one of the messages of “Gopher Guts”
                            [the song by Aesop Rock]: we’ve steadily replaced that which was
                            naturally occurring and good with something we thought to be better,
                            screwing things up as we go .&#160;.&#160;. (Aaron J. Ensman)</quote>
                        What I especially appreciate in this student’s response is its unconscious
                        recapitulation of the message of Wordsworth’s “Lines Written in Early
                        Spring,” a text that was also assigned for the module. In other words, the
                        student discovered for himself—through the engagement with an assortment of
                        romantic and post-romantic texts—an aspect of the romantic. Thus, he
                        articulates in his own language, “what man has made of man.”</p>
                    <p>What is more—and I too must have intuited this rather than conceived this
                        connection since I was only dimly aware of a link when I assigned Wordsworth
                        and Aesop Rock together—Wordsworth’s juxtaposition in “Lines Written in
                        Early Spring” of the movements of birds, leaves, and wind on the one hand
                        and man-made disorder on the other is itself recapitulated (Geoffrey
                        Hartman’s word would be rephrased) in Aesop Rock’s song “Gopher Guts.” In
                        Aesop Rock’s lyric, the intense disconnection and alienation described in
                        the verses is juxtaposed to strangely beautiful scenes of encounters with
                        the natural world in the choruses: <quote><lg>
                                <l>Today I pulled three green frogs out of leaf and bark</l>
                                <l>Where the grape vines climb a convenient barn</l>
                                <l>I told them, “You will grow to be something tenacious and
                                    exalted;</l>
                                <l>You are mighty, you are gracious, you are lauded”</l>
                                <l>Then I let them go</l>
                                <l>Oh .&#160;.&#160;. (“Gopher Guts”)</l>
                            </lg></quote> Again, for me what matters is not so much that Aesop Rock,
                        like Wordsworth, “must think, do all [he] can” in order to abide if not
                        reconcile the gap between so-called nature and so-called culture, but rather
                        that my student grasps through his own research, his own thinking and
                        feeling, this vital feature of our “increasingly vulgar” relation to our
                        environments. </p>
                    <p>Another student wrote about Aesop Rock’s song as well. She said that she felt
                        compelled to write about it (I allowed students to write about all or one of
                        the texts, so long as they made connections to the larger themes of the
                        module) because she had a “love/hate” relationship to it and wanted to find
                        out why. She found the verses—intensely condensed lyrical raps about human
                        failure—disconcerting and wrote that she had the: <quote> .&#160;.&#160;.
                            feeling of being disconnected and unable to break through the membrane
                            of meaning at times. Strangely what did translate clearly for me were
                            the hooks [by “hooks” she means the choruses]. The hooks were so weirdly
                            intriguing. Snakes, frogs and crabs being told they are “electric,
                            present, exalted, gallant.” What the hell? This seriously melted my
                            heart. It melted my heart because these beautiful words are coming from
                            the man—the man who is the representation of everything that is
                            disgustedly human, our sweating stinking blood-filled bodies in the
                            garbage heap of a world we have created versus the natural world which
                            is still pure and virtuous. The natural world seems like our only hope
                            to cleanse ourselves/redeem ourselves, although we have to "let them go"
                            to do that because we are the despoiled ones. (Elizabeth Byers
                            Gaubert)</quote> This student, like the previous student, articulates an
                        important aspect of the romantic. While she doesn’t comment on this
                        connection in her response (did she know it?), she seems to recognize Aesop
                        Rock’s perhaps unconscious allusion to “Rime of the Ancient Mariner,”
                        specifically the scene where the Mariner blesses the water snakes
                        “unawares.” This seems especially uncanny since we hadn’t read “Ancient
                        Mariner” in class yet. These types of resonant reversals happened constantly
                        in the class. They seemed to validate T. S. Eliot’s concept of the
                        historical sense (from “Tradition and the Individual Talent,” a text we read
                        in class), in which changes in the aesthetic tradition produce temporal
                        rearrangements in such a way as to allow for the feeling that somehow
                        “Gopher Guts” (ca. 2012) is the progenitor to Coleridge’s 1790’s poem. I
                        take is as more than coincidental that this temporal reversal has deep
                        affinities with the psychoanalytic theory of
                            <foreign>nachtraglikeit</foreign> or re-transcription. If the study of
                        literature requires that we take a position toward the text (that is, toward
                        history), it provides us at once with an understanding that we are ourselves
                        embodied with a past as well as with the imaginative means to take up one or
                        more positions on our history. This seems to me one of the most important
                        aspects of the romantic, namely that our senses (and I would place the
                        unconscious within that sensorial circle) both “half-create” and perceive
                        the “mighty world.” </p>

                    <p>Let me reiterate: I do not believe that our students do not need to be
                        “confirmed” in their positions or tastes (although I believe that all of our
                        students’ positions need to be considered and listened carefully to; they
                        all “make sense” in some way, even if we do not understand them), nor do we
                        need to protect our students from ideas that threaten their beliefs.
                        Spivak’s definition, the “displacement of belief onto the terrain of the
                        imagination,” is as apt a definition of the goal of an aesthetic education
                        as any that I know of (10). Having adopted this as our code, it becomes our
                        responsibility to expose students — and also to be exposed. Mutual
                        contamination is the goal. In this sense, Coleridge’s “Rime of the Ancient
                        Mariner” can serve as a model. In the pedagogical poetics I have in mind
                        teacher and student take turns being alternately mariner and wedding guest,
                        infector and infected, traumatized and wiser.</p>
                    <p>Meeting the students where they are is only the first step. My sense is that
                        many if not most of my students arrive in my classroom “pre-critical.”<note
                            place="foot">I am borrowing here a concept from psychoanalytic theory,
                            namely that certain people show up for treatment pre-analytical, not yet
                            ready to be analyzed. More and more, post-classical psychoanalysis
                            strives to include these people, working with them with mixed modalities
                            until they are ready for analysis proper. See Shuren.</note>They think
                        that reading and writing at the university level is primarily an issue of
                        solving a puzzle, getting pieces (themes, forms, ideas, emotions) into the
                        proper arrangement. As teachers in the humanities we know that no text ever
                        stays put for long and that the work of reading and writing is not always to
                        offer interpretations at all, but rather to ask questions. It is my belief
                        that we cannot ask students to do this kind of critical work all at once.
                        The work of criticism requires an openness (about the text and the so-called
                        self) that is not easy for anyone. Furthermore, it requires a sense of
                        security and support (emotional, psychic, and yes, economic) that our
                        current anxiety-riddled academic culture is less and less inclined or able
                        to provide. Absent a wholesale resurgence of support for and revaluation of
                        the humanities, it seems to me that moving students from pre-critical
                        reading to critical engagement is easier when they are offered seemingly
                        more “familiar” texts, genres, and media. It short-circuits at least some of
                        the natural defensiveness.</p>
                    <p>If Wallace Stevens and William Wordsworth are correct and the goal of the
                        poet is to help people to live more fuller and richer lives, then, in an
                        increasingly global and glutted world, an aesthetic education will have to
                        offer new definitions and conceptions of the romantic.<note place="foot">
                            Noble Rider, Preface to LB.</note>These cannot be top-down or absolute
                        definitions. Students must have an active role in these reformations. Yet
                        this is not a cry for a digital humanities or an alternative (more
                        “democratic”) pedagogy, although both are no doubt necessary; rather it is
                        an argument for awareness and acceptance of how much of our aesthetic
                        experience is already digital and how impossible knowledge production is
                        without the willing co-creation of our students.</p>
                    <p>So why teach romanticism at all? In part, we need the romantic because of our
                        need for self-estrangement and cross-contamination. According to Spivak, one
                        of the greatest disservices done to the subaltern community by European
                        educators is the attempt to keep them culturally pure, robbing them of an
                        awareness of global politics and culture, new cultural and political
                        histories of which they might form a part.<note place="foot"> Spivak,
                            30.</note> In a related way, I worry that if we withhold from some
                        student populations certain texts—Shelley’s “Defence of Poetry” or David
                        Hume’s “Treatise on Human Nature” for example—on the grounds that they are
                        too “difficult,” we rob them of a deeper understanding of a shared, if
                        constantly shifting heritage of aesthetic and political resistance and
                        change. This class has taught me that reading Shelley’s resonant
                        politico-poetics (the “unacknowledged legislators”) in combination with
                        Charles Olson’s re-appropriation of the polis (“polis is this”) and P.O.S.’s
                        re-appropriation of political rap and rock (“I be the new generation of
                        slaves”) gives students a greater (more critical) purchase on the
                        material—helps them, that is, to continue to question—as well as revealing
                        at a deeper level the ways in which the romantic is constantly in motion, in
                        history, in flux.</p>

                <div type="section">
                    <p>Looking back, some of the material that I assigned was difficult—“Beyond the
                        Pleasure Principle” for example—and I had to spell out quite precisely what
                        I took to be the connections between the death drive and Wordsworth’s
                        concept of immortality. This does not seem to be a problem for the reasons
                        just mentioned above. Other inter-texts were more favorably and immediately
                        received, and, interestingly, judged to be as or more “romantic” than many
                        of the romantic-era texts we read for the class. Two of the most popular
                        readings for example were Annie Dillard’s essay “A Field of Silence” and
                        Todd Haynes’s movie <title level="m">Safe</title>. Although uniformly
                        pleased with the class, when students were asked at the end of the class
                        what worked and didn’t, many wished that I had provided more of a “road map”
                        of where the class would lead. Perhaps this is a pedagogical problem for all
                        of us—precisely to the degree that I believe I know the shape and arc of a
                        class’s narrative when I begin, to that degree will the ultimate findings of
                        the class seem rehearsed and unremarkable. I intend to offer a bit more
                        scaffolding next time, but I want all of us to feel free to lose our way
                        from time to time with these texts.</p>
                    <p>As “old school” as it may sound, it seems to me that an aesthetic education
                        should be integrative, reaching into all aspects of a students’ lives, not
                        just those areas that can potentially be monetized, although that is an
                        essential component of what we do. Reading and writing romantically might
                        mean engaging the romantic in all of its permutations in such a way that we
                        pay conscious attention to the production and reproduction of all of our
                        experience—surely this is one of the most lasting legacies of the romantic.
                        That is, while I get that an education in the humanities can be, in certain
                        circumstances, ideologically normalizing, I do not see that as an inevitable
                        outcome, especially if students and teachers can co-create environments in
                        which critical engagement with the romantic can happen. Perhaps the
                        shrinking proportion of these classroom environments in the academy, and
                        their seeming erasure in the larger culture, is what drives some students’
                        ambivalent responses to the romantic. By breaking down the barriers between
                        high and low cultures, periods, media, and forms, classes like “Repetitions
                        of the Romantic” and the others described in this collection of essays might
                        recover for us a different legacy, more recursive and responsive, an
                        opportunity to move from the pre-critical to more properly critical,
                        unstable yet pleasurable practices that the romantic has traditionally
                        promised. This last mention of pleasure brings us, of course, back to
                        Wordsworth as well as to Stevens, who agreed absolutely in the necessity of
                        pleasure as the means as well as the end of aesthetic experience.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I confess (I know, how romantic, right?) to a feeling of ambivalence
                        about not teaching more texts from Romantic period in this class. But I feel
                        I must live with this ambivalence, at least for now. My students are
                        engaged, asking meaningful questions, making connections, creating
                        interesting work. Perhaps learning the romantic today involves learning to
                        tolerate our ambivalences, to hear the “thousand blended notes,” learning
                        that is, to listen for patterns in dissonance, in our work, our curricula,
                        and in our students’ lives, in Aesop Rock as well as in Wordsworth, in the
                        lake district as well as in central Ohio. </p>
