                <p rend="noCount"> This essay explains the rationale behind a willfully
                    anachronistic creative writing prompt: if one of the British Romantics were
                    alive today, how would he or she craft a literary response to 9/11 and the
                    ensuing War on Terror? Instead of asking what makes the twenty-first-century
                    experience of terror new, my assignment encourages students to approach today’s
                    affective environment through the medium of British Romantic literature. The
                    following discussion offers a pedagogical framework and theoretical
                    justification for inviting undergraduates to map the untimely affects that fuse
                    the contemporary age of terror with its Romantic-era double. The essay concludes
                    with a survey of exemplary student work. </p>

                    <p>In what way does Edward Snowden’s story read like an updated version of
                        William Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>? If Samuel Taylor
                        Coleridge had composed “Fears in Solitude” during the April 2013 manhunt for
                        the Boston marathon bombers, how would the poem change? How would Ann
                        Radcliffe dramatize the experience of encountering an unattended bag while
                        waiting at the airport? These are only a few of the questions that students
                        considered in their final creative projects for my Hampshire College seminar
                        on “Literature in the Age of Terror.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Thank
                            you to the students enrolled in the Spring 2014 course I taught at
                            Hampshire College: Taylor Carlson, Nikolas Costello, Hillary Lynch,
                            Christian May, Teddy S. Miller, Dominic Poropat, Rae Purdom, Michael
                            Samblas, Renata Anuhea Sebstad, Ben Socolofsky, Sofia (last name
                            withheld), and a student who wishes to remain anonymous. I am also
                            grateful to Kate Singer for commenting on a draft of this essay as well
                            as L. Brown Kennedy and Marc Redfield for their input on the seminar.
                        </note> The assignment asked them to compose a poem or short narrative that
                        addresses our contemporary situation in the voice or characteristic literary
                        style of a Romantic-era writer. Or as I put it in my willfully anachronistic
                        prompt: if one of the British Romantics were alive today, how would he or
                        she craft a literary response to 9/11 and the ensuing War on Terror? </p>
                    <p>Instead of assigning a traditional analytic essay in which students might
                        compare the concerns of British Romantic literature and culture with those
                        of our twenty-first-century moment, I invited the class to write in a
                        creative mode. The approach let them tap into the affective registers of
                        historical consciousness that eludes analytic writing, or so Thomas Pfau’s
                            <title level="m">Romantic Moods</title> leads me to argue. To guide
                        their efforts, I had everyone transpose their present perspectives into the
                        idiom of Romantic literature. Imitating the voice of a Romantic-era writer
                        provided a methodology for estranging one’s affective environment and
                        thereby making it newly available for analysis. The resulting exercise
                        enabled students to produce what Jonathan Flatley terms an “affective map”
                        of the attunement between past and present.</p>
                    <p>The seminar drew on British Romantic literature as a medium for reflecting on
                        our emotional life in the present. Instead of asking what makes the
                        twenty-first-century experience of terror new, I posed a different question:
                        where have we already seen our own range of moods and structures of feeling
                        before? Toward this end, I led the class through a series of texts—among
                        them, Ann Radcliffe’s <title level="m">Mysteries of Udolpho</title> (1794),
                        William Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> (1794), and Jane
                        Austen’s <title level="m">Persuasion</title> (1816)—that are fascinated by
                        how impersonal historical forces condition one’s moods, sentiments, and
                        visceral sensations. These readings served, in turn, as the occasion to put
                        British anxieties about the French “Reign of Terror” and subsequent
                        Napoleonic Wars into dialogue with America’s cultural response to 9/11. My
                        goal was to reframe the age of terror as doubly contemporary, which is to
                        say both characteristic of the present and simultaneous with the late
                        eighteenth and early nineteenth century. </p>
                    <p>To borrow Walter Scott’s comment from the “Dedicatory Epistle” to <title
                            level="m">Ivanhoe</title>, I encouraged students to search for the
                        “extensive neutral ground” between past and present (18). At the same time,
                        my comparative approach relied on the otherness of Romantic-era literature
                        to reorient or even disorient our intuitive understanding of things as they
                        are, to borrow Godwin’s phrase. Oscillating between affinity and alterity,
                        the seminar routed today’s affective attachments through the foreignness of
                        the past while simultaneously foregrounding an abiding archive of
                        intensities that were set into motion by British Romantic literature. My
                        underling premise was that category of affect could enable a pivot (or
                        series of pivots) between the Romantic and the contemporary. Consistent with
                        the notoriously unsettled meaning of the word “affect,” my use of the term
                        indicates a broad array of felt experiences that warp the cognition of time. </p>
                    <p>The following essay describes the pedagogical rationale behind my course’s
                        untimely treatment of “Literature in the Age of Terror.” To begin, I explain
                        my strategies for juxtaposing our contemporary age of terror with its
                        Romantic-era double. From there, I draw on the work of Thomas Pfau and
                        Jonathan Flatley to justify my core methodology: constructing a comparative
                        archive of affective intensities to calibrate the interplay between British
                        Romantic literature and culture and our post-9/11 moment. The essay
                        concludes by assessing the writing that my students completed for their
                        final projects. </p>

                    <head>I. Teaching the Romantic with the contemporary</head>
                    <p>At the outset of the semester, my first task was to persuade the class that
                        it makes sense to study late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century
                        literature alongside the contemporary. To establish a connection between
                        these two seemingly disparate moments, I turned to Marc Redfield’s <title
                            level="m">The Rhetoric of Terror</title>, which argues that <quote>our
                            specifically political use of the words “terror” and “terrorism” emerged
                            at the end of the eighteenth century, forming part of the broad
                            historical phenomenon that literary scholars call romanticism. The
                            capitalized nominative “Terror” has, of course, a historiographical
                            referent: it designates more or less the period between the fall of the
                            Girondins (June 1793) and the fall of Robespierre (July 27, 1794 or 9
                            Thermidor). (72)</quote> To Redfield’s point, the <title level="m"
                            >Oxford English Dictionary</title> cites Edmund Burke and Helen Maria
                        Williams as among the first to introduce the word “terrorist” into the
                        English language circa 1795 as a pejorative label for violent political
                        actors (“Terrorist, n. and adj”). While Redfield acknowledges that “we
                        obviously no longer mean quite the same things by ‘terrorist’ that Burke
                        did,” it is nevertheless fair to say that British anxieties about the French
                        Revolution crystalize emerging notions about terror, terrorism, and
                        terrorists (73). </p>
                    <p>Building on this point, I invited students to compare our current
                        geopolitical situation with that of the Romantic authors we were reading.
                        For instance, I called their attention to the time that elapsed between
                        William Wordsworth’s travels in France during the early 1790s and his
                        eventual description of those experiences in the 1805 <title level="m"
                            >Prelude</title>. What does Wordsworth’s belated reflection on the
                        French Revolution have to teach us about our own evolving response to the
                        trauma of 9/11, I asked? Likewise, I proposed that the wars in Iraq and
                        Afghanistan offer a twenty-first-century parallel for the Napoleonic Wars
                        that contextualize Jane Austen’s <title level="m">Persuasion</title>. In
                        this light, Austen’s novel provides an opportunity to consider the personal
                        costs of the protracted military conflicts that define our moment. </p>
                    <p>To complement the discussion, I introduced students to scholarship that
                        implicitly or explicitly affirms Romanticism’s bearing on the present. We
                        began the semester by considering Terry Castle’s thought-provoking
                        observations about the continuity between visual representations of 9/11 and
                        the history of art that finds sublimity in scenes of destruction. Through
                        John Barrell’s account of the British obsession with imagining political
                        violence during the mid-1790s, we saw the makings of twenty-first-century
                        arguments both for and against government surveillance and other
                        anti-terrorism measures. Jan Mieszkowski’s analysis of Coleridge’s “Fears in
                        Solitude” prompted a conversation about the patriotic rhetoric that followed
                        9/11 and the Boston marathon bombing. What David Clark describes as Kant’s
                        wariness about celebrating military victory also raises hard questions about
                        the riotous celebrations that took place on American college campuses
                        following the May 2011 assassination of Osama bin Laden. </p>
                    <p>All of these conversations reinforced the point that Romanticism functions as
                        an anachronism in Jerome Christensen’s (or for that matter, Percy Bysshe
                        Shelley’s) sense of the term: namely, a “potent icon of the past’s
                        incapacity to coincide with itself, to seal itself off as a period or epoch
                        or episode with no or necessary consequences for our time. Anachronism is
                        the herald of the future as yet unknown” (3). Christensen’s formulation
                        usefully challenged the class’s tendency to assume that the eighteenth and
                        nineteenth centuries are over and done with. Instead, he suggests that
                        Romanticism cannot be walled off behind the perfected closure of the past.
                        As with all writing, the definitive meaning of British Romantic literature
                        has yet to be written; its history remains in process and open to future
                        reinterpretation.</p>

                    <head>II. Creative imitation assignment</head>
                    <p>In keeping with the seminar’s embrace of anachronism as a strategy for
                        bringing British Romantic literature into the present, while simultaneously
                        filtering contemporary life through the otherness of the past, I gave
                        students a purposefully anachronistic prompt for their final assignment: if
                        one of the British Romantics were alive today, how would he or she craft a
                        literary response to 9/11 and the ensuing War on Terror? The challenge was
                        to imagine how Ann Radcliffe, for example, might react to our own time. The
                        unorthodox prompt invited the class to compose a creative work that
                        addresses the repercussions of 9/11 in the voice or characteristic style of
                        a Romantic-era writer. But why ask students to write in a creative mode
                        instead of composing a traditional, analytic essay? Furthermore, how does
                        literary imitation give students a fresh perspective on the present? What’s
                        to be gained by using Romantic literature to remediate our contemporary
                        situation?</p>
                    <p>My response to the first question expands upon arguments put forward in
                        Thomas Pfau’s <title level="m">Romantic Moods</title>. In light of Pfau’s
                        discussion, I take the view that creative writing makes it possible for
                        students to tap into the affective registers of historical consciousness
                        that cannot quite be put into propositional statements. Drawing on Kant and
                        Heidegger, Pfau theorizes what he terms the mood of history, which
                        “speaks—if only circumstantially—to the deep-structural situatedness of
                        individuals within history as something never actually intelligible to them
                        in fully coherent, timely, and definitive form” (7). In Pfau’s account, mood
                        channels the latent force of historical events that otherwise elude
                        conscious understanding. Rather than look to “what may be logically verified
                        and discursively represented as knowledge,” Pfau contends that history’s
                        power makes itself felt on a visceral level. Indeed, Pfau maintains that an
                        affective understanding of one’s historical condition cannot be properly
                        represented or pinned down (10). To adapt a remark from Favret, mood “offers
                        up symptoms of a history not entirely possessed” (146). Applying Pfau’s
                        discussion to my own pedagogy, I deemphasized assignments that required
                        students to explicitly define their historical situatedness in favor of
                        offering creative writing as a practice that let the class access an
                        otherwise inchoate spirit of our age. </p>
                    <p>If anything, college-age students in 2016 are primed to reflect on the
                        affective tenor of historical experience. After all, they were only in
                        kindergarten or first grade—five or six years old,—when the World Trade
                        Center and Pentagon attacks occurred. Experiencing 9/11 and its aftermath
                        from a child’s perspective gives today’s young people an intuitive
                        understanding of the visceral yet elusive force of historical events that
                        are felt more than understood.</p>
                    <p>But why should my class’s efforts to mobilize the affective dimension of
                        historical consciousness take the form of a literary imitation, as I
                        stipulate in my assignment? Building on Jonathan Flatley’s notion of <title
                            level="m">Affective Mapping</title>, I argue that the work of emulating
                        a historical literary style can estrange one’s affective environment while
                        simultaneously activating the felt relation between past and present.
                        According to Flatley, affective mapping serves as “a technology for the
                        representation to oneself of one’s own historically conditioned and changing
                        affective life” (7). The procedure works through self-estrangement:
                            <quote>By this term [self-estrangement] . . . I mean a self-distancing
                            that allows one to see oneself as if from outside. But I also mean
                            estrangement in the sense of defamiliarization, making one’s emotion
                            life—one’s range of moods, set of structures of feeling, and collection
                            of affective attachments—appear weird, surprising, unusual, and thus
                            capable of a new kind of recognition, interest, and analysis.
                            (80)</quote> Affective mapping entails a depersonalization of the moods,
                        sentiments, and visceral sensations that are commonly taken as the hallmark
                        of selfhood. In order to decouple affect from subjectivity, Flatley invokes
                        the specifically aesthetic device of defamiliarization.<note place="foot"
                            resp="editors">For a seminal discussion of this technique, see Viktor
                            Shklovsky’s “Art as Device.”</note> As with Pfau, Flatley contends that
                        literary writing has the capacity to reframe one’s affective makeup as
                        other, or <emph>not</emph> one’s own, and hence render it freshly available. </p>
                    <p>To give Flatley’s discussion a concrete pedagogical application, I asked my
                        classes to imitate a Romantic-era author on the syllabus. On the one hand,
                        doing so made our “now” resemble the otherness of a “then.” On the other
                        hand, the reverse is also true, in that any movement away from our “own”
                        moment and into the Romantic period eventually makes a circuitous return to
                        the moods and affects that define the present as much as the past. Through
                        their writing project, students hereby produced maps or mappings in the
                        sense of calibrating the resonance between Romanticism’s structure of
                        feeling and our contemporary mood. As Flatley aptly observes, “we never
                        experience an affect for the first time; every affect contains within it an
                        archive of its previous objects” (81). My goal was to provide students with
                        a framework for charting the age of terror that inflects both the Romantic
                        and the contemporary.</p>

                    <head>III. The affect of uncertain times</head>
                    <p>The result was a wealth of thought-provoking work examining what Mary Favret
                        describes as the affect of everyday war. Students gravitated to Austen’s
                            <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb
                            Williams</title>, and Radcliffe’s <title level="m">Mysteries of
                            Udolpho</title> as touchstones for mapping the changing contours of
                        daily life in the aftermath of 9/11. Channeling an array of affects that
                        ranged from the banal to the phantasmatic, regret to dread, curiosity to
                        paranoid anxiety, the class used their creative writing to investigate the
                        feeling of being adrift in uncertain times. In the double sense of that last
                        phrase, my students’ projects suggested that the War on Terror has
                        disoriented their sense of time and destabilized their sense of
                        certainty.</p>
                    <p>To understand how students went about capturing the echoes of war in everyday
                        life, consider the work of Hillary Lynch, who rewrote Coleridge’s “Fears in
                        Solitude” as if it were composed during the April 2013 manhunt for the
                        Boston marathon bombers. Aptly retitled “Fears in Collective Solitude,”
                        Lynch’s poetic imitation explores the strange time that Bostonians spent
                        “sheltering in place”: <quote><lg>
                                <l>They all wait alone, together, breath held.</l>
                                <l>Sitting in a unique situation</l>
                                <l>Contemplating on what should ne’er be thought.</l>
                                <l>A day off, not by choice, is a strange sight,</l>
                                <l>Dogs stop barking, kids stop laughing, silence.</l>
                                <l>Blooming flowers falter without water,</l>
                                <l>Facing towards the sky, looking for answers. (unpublished
                                    essay)</l>
                            </lg></quote> Where Coleridge’s original poem contends that the threat
                        of war has a pernicious influence on public discourse, Lynch underscores the
                        similarly far-reaching impact of an actual terror attack, which reverberates
                        out from the scene of carnage to radically disrupt the ordinary routines and
                        daily rhythms of an entire country. According to Lynch, the collective
                        terror of “wait[ing] along, together, breadth held” has a visceral intensity
                        that distantly echoes the physical damage wrought on Boylston Street. What
                        Favret says about Austen’s <title level="m">Persuasion</title> applies
                        equally well to Lynch’s Coleridgean rendition of the Boston bombings: both
                        “reveal the everyday not as a zone of peace in contrast to a distant war,
                        but as the unspectacular register or correspondent of wartime” (154). Dogs
                        go quiet, children fall silent, personified flowers wither; the mundane
                        becomes uncanny. Such is the unspectacular yet palpably affecting reality of
                        a terror attack.</p>
                    <p>The spectacle of war has no less of an effect on the phantasmagoria of our
                        emotional lives, or so student Rae Purdom holds. Specifically, Purdom offers
                        a Radcliffean meditation on the medium of television news, which
                        simultaneously reports distant conflicts and evokes the ghostly presence of
                        a lost love one. Purdom takes her inspiration from the scene in which Emily
                        St. Aubert returns to the library of her recently deceased father. Coming
                        upon her father’s armchair and an open book by one of his favorite authors,
                        “the idea of him rose so distinctly to [Emily’s] mind,” writes Radcliffe,
                        “that she almost fancied she saw him before her” (95). In Purdom’s version,
                        the familiar easy chair faces a television tuned to CNN. As the stream of
                        martial images washes over her, Purdom’s young protagonist, Jessica, recalls
                            <quote>watching <title level="m">Apocalypse Now </title>with her [dead]
                            mother, who would have sat in this armchair and played gently with
                            Jessica’s hair to soothe her and keep her grounded in the safety of
                            home, far from the threat of imminent violence, as the [television]
                            announcer intoned the words, “guerilla warfare,” and Jessica felt the
                            absence of her mother’s hand tousling her hair. (unpublished essay)
                        </quote> In keeping with what Terry Castle describes as that
                        characteristically Radcliffean tendency to “spectralize” the dead or absent
                        as “an image . . . on the screen of consciousness itself,” Purdom uses the
                        medium of the television to frame the ghostly intersection between
                        geopolitical conflict and personal loss (“Spectralization” 237).
                        Specifically, Purdom brings Jessica’s visceral encounter with the felt
                        “absence of her mother’s hand tousling her hair” into alignment with the
                        ambient grief of watching war from a distance.</p>
                    <p>Another distinctive feature of Purdom’s efforts to map the resonance between
                        home life and a war zone is the gesture of conflating Vietnam, 9/11, and the
                        “threat of imminent violence” into one long, interminable conflict. Purdom’s
                        anachronistic thinking is just one example of the class’s broader interest
                        in the affect of broken time. Fellow student Michael Samblas makes the point
                        explicit in noting that like contemporary Americans, the characters of
                        Austen’s <title level="m">Persuasion</title> are caught between regretting
                        the past and dreading the future: <quote>Ever since the September 11
                            attacks, we have been constantly looking back at that momentous event,
                            and allowing it to define our society to this day. We constantly refer
                            to the time we live in as “post 9/11” and observe the anniversary of the
                            event every year. This is in keeping with Austen’s themes of living in
                            the past .&#160;.&#160;. [Having said that] our obsession with the past
                            seems to stem more from a fear of having to repeat it. Austen’s
                            characters, on the other hand, are actively <emph>trying</emph> to
                            relive these moments that they keep reflecting back on. (unpublished
                            essay)</quote> Just as Anne Elliot’s life stagnates during the almost
                        eight years since she ended her brief engagement with Captain Frederick
                        Wentworth and he went off to war, our “post-9/11” era likewise seems to
                        hover around the recent past, Samblas astutely observes. The hallmark of
                        our—and Anne’s—belated temporal condition is captured in the fear and/or
                        fantasy that the past is about to repeat itself.</p>
                    <p>Renata Anuhea Sebstad’s imitation of Austen raises the same issue. In her
                        short story, Sebstad dramatizes a mother’s anxiety about a son who is
                        stationed at the military base in Fort Hood, Texas. The Austenian element
                        can be found in Sebstad’s choice to begin her story shortly before the first
                        Fort Hood shooting incident of November 2009 and end just prior to the
                        second mass shooting, which took place in April 2014. Much as Austen’s
                        audience knew that Anne Elliot’s concluding “dread of a future war” would
                        soon become a reality, Sebstad invites her reader to anxiously await an
                        event that has not yet taken place within the diegetic universe of the
                        narrative, thereby validating the protagonist’s overwhelming sense of
                        foreboding. Through the modalities of apprehension and unease, both
                        protagonist and reader intuit that the linear advance of time bends back on
                        itself to form an untimely cycle of violence.</p>
                    <p>Ben Socolofsky picks up the thread again in adopting Radcliffe’s distinctive
                        style of haunted consciousness to evoke the spectral afterlife of 9/11.
                        Reimagining St. Aubert as a casualty of the World Trade Center collapse,
                        Socolofsky follows his daughter, Emily, through the subsequent months of
                        mourning. Of particular interest is Socolofsky’s dramatization of Emily’s
                        post-traumatic encounter with the “Tribute in Light” art installation, which
                        periodically projects two columns of light skyward from the former World
                        Trade Center site. Unable to believe her eyes, Emily briefly wonders whether
                        the Twin Towers are about to collapse all over again—a sense of <emph>déjà
                            vu</emph> reinforced by a subsequent encounter with a
                            <foreign>doppelgänger</foreign> of her dead father. Like Sebstad,
                        Socolofsky explores the recursive temporality of life post-9/11 though the
                        eerie affect of its uncanny repetitions. </p>
                    <p>Even as a number of students sought to elaborate on Favret’s claim that the
                        affect of everyday war “eludes the usual models for organizing time such as
                        linearity, punctuality, and periodicity,” others found that their experience
                        of uncertain times did not raise issues of temporality so much as emphasize
                        their sense of uncertainty (11). For one, Teddy S. Miller used <title
                            level="m">Caleb Williams</title> as a vehicle for experimenting with the
                        affect of uncertainty. His piece tells the fictional story of Adael Goldman,
                        a character charged with watching over the shrouded body of Osama bin Laden
                        until it is interred at sea. Like Godwin’s protagonist, Caleb Williams,
                        Adael is consumed by both curiosity and paranoia. On receiving strict orders
                        not to look underneath the corpse’s shroud, Adael becomes obsessed with
                        verifying the identity of the body with his own eyes. At the same time,
                        Adael is unnerved by nagging questions about why he has been left alone with
                        the dead man in the first place and whether he might be under some form of
                        surveillance. </p>
                    <p>The tension between curiosity and paranoia comes to a head in the conclusion
                        of Miller’s short story, which describes the thought process behind Adael’s
                        resolution to keep bin Laden’s body covered: <quote>Not once, even when I
                            held the body in my hands did I allow the veil to slip off and reveal
                            the identity of the man beneath. In doing so I sentenced myself to live
                            the rest of my life in uncertainty, with the only thing that could make
                            me believe in truth again lying at the bottom of the sea. (unpublished
                            essay) </quote> Without attempting to reproduce Godwin’s plot, Miller
                        emulates the dynamic of the novel’s original courtroom ending, in which
                        Falkland never confesses his guilt and Caleb’s accusations remain
                        unverified. As Pfau notes about Godwin’s original ending, “nothing ever
                        offers extrinsic and objective confirmation for Caleb’s key hypothesis
                        regarding Falkland’s guilty past” (140). The point applies equally well to
                        Miller’s conclusion, in which the protagonist fails to confirm bin Laden’s
                        ultimate fate and consequently descends into paranoid uncertainty.</p>
                    <p>Dominic Poropat’s imitation of Radcliffe’s <title level="m">Udolpho</title>
                        achieves similar results by using the device of the “explained supernatural”
                        to prolong doubt and elicit anxiety. In Poropat’s hands, Radcliffe’s
                        much-derided trope becomes a recurrent motif of everyday life post-9/11. To
                        make the point, he dramatizes the experience of a young woman, who
                        encounters an unattended bag while waiting at the airport. After the manner
                        of Austen’s <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>, Poropat’s Radcliffean
                        heroine imbues a commonplace object with supernatural powers and dread
                        import. But unlike Austen, however, Poropat does without parody. In the era
                        of “see something, say something” when everything is simultaneously a
                        potential threat and nothing to be concerned about, Poropat intimates that
                        we have little cause to mock the Radcliffean heroine’s tendency to
                        overreact. His short story makes the point that 9/11 has introduced an
                        element of anxious uncertainty into what we see and how we hear. </p>
                    <p>Despite Austen’s sendup of <title level="m">Udolpho</title>, Poropat implies
                        that we have all become Radcliffean subjects whose exaggerated suspicions
                        and unsubstantiated fears are no laughing matter. When Poropat’s protagonist
                        finally summons the courage to open the suspicious bag, it contains “nothing
                        more than a few mundane travel items,” which she hands over to the lost and
                        found. “Thirty minutes later,” Poropat concludes, “she boarded her plane and
                        forgot all about that old, cracked leather bag.” The anticlimactic
                            <foreign>denouement</foreign> works in part because 9/11 seems to have
                        restored the visceral force of Radcliffe’s much-derided techniques for
                        creating suspense. Paradoxical though it may sound, Poropat succeeds at
                        capturing the specifically <emph>historical</emph> potency of <title
                            level="m">Udolpho</title>’s “explained supernatural” circa 1794 by
                        bringing the trope into the twenty-first century. The resulting exploration
                        simultaneously modernizes Radcliffe and backdates our present-day anxieties
                        about the omnipresent yet unspecified threat of terrorism. </p>

                    <head>IV. Conclusion</head>
                    <p>Poropat’s short narrative shares in the class’s collective effort to map the
                        affective dimension of life in uncertain times. Mobilizing an array of
                        affects that ranged from the banal to the phantasmatic, regret to dread,
                        curiosity to paranoid anxiety, students used their creative writing as a
                        vehicle for tapping into a tacit sense that the “War on Terror” has unmoored
                        their sense of time and left them adrift in doubt. To do so, the class
                        embraced anachronism. By addressing the legacy of 9/11 in the voice or
                        literary style of a writer from the syllabus, students navigated the double
                        contemporaneity that makes Romanticism both characteristic of the present
                        and simultaneous with the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. In
                        the process, students began to channel the visceral power of historical
                        experience that cannot quite be named. </p>
