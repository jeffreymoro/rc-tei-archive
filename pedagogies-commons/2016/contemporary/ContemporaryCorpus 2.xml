            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">This special issue explores the notion that many of the forms,
                    ideas, and practices inaugurated or exemplified in the Romantic period continue
                    to shape and drive our contemporary discourses. Literary critics, cultural and
                    political theorists, and, indeed, our students continue to encounter new
                    permutations—if not the continued presence—of something that might be called the
                    romantic. But how is the (neo-)romantic expressed in contemporary culture? And
                    how might we best prepare students to listen for and hear its repetitions? How
                    might we teach the romantic alongside the contemporary without either reducing
                    one to the other or eliding important historical, cultural, and social contexts?
                    In response to these questions, the nine essays and three interviews that
                    comprise this volume address the repetitions and reverberations of the romantic
                    as it recurs across genre, period, and media boundaries in popular culture,
                    contemporary political situations, changing classroom dynamics, and the
                    constantly shifting domains of literary and pedagogical practice and
                    production.</p>

               <head>Introduction</head>
               <p>The impetus for this volume came from the 2013 NASSR/Romantic Circles New Course
                    Development Prize, for which we were both finalists. Along with fellow finalists
                    Sara Guyer and Samantha Harvey, we convened a panel to discuss our recent
                    pedagogical experiments, moderated by Kate Singer, without whom
                    this project would not have been possible. Throughout the ensuing conversation,
                    one trend emerged: an interest in and focus on teaching the Romantic alongside
                    the art, media, and social and political phenomena contemporary with our own
                    lives and with our students’ lives.</p>
               <p>At one point in the panel conversation, an attendee asked whether we taught the
                    Romantic with the contemporary despite the potential anti-historicist
                    implications of that move—in other words, did we teach in this way because it
                    worked, or because it was engaging, despite the fact that we somehow knew better
                    as literary historians? As committed historicist readers from a shared
                    intellectual lineage, we countered that, in the classroom as in our research,
                    sometimes one must think trans-historically in order to produce a historicist
                    understanding. In our undergraduate classrooms, the juxtaposition of the
                    Romantic and the contemporary reveals work from both historical periods in the
                    contexts of popular culture, social shifts, and artistic experiments. Put
                    another way, it is possible to wield the contemporary to peel back the cloak of
                    canonicity that sometimes obscures Romantic literary experiments, all the while
                    making students better readers—indeed, Romanticist readers—of their own
                    literary, cultural, and historical moments.</p>
               <p>Beyond its startling implications for our pedagogy, historicizing the
                    neo-Romantic in our own culture has the potential to enrich our thinking as
                    scholars attuned to the Romantic, to its repetitions, and to the ways in which
                    it encodes its own repetitions. While the essays enclosed herein focus on
                    pedagogical approaches, we thus also highlight the extent to which such teaching
                    exercises are also thought experiments with the potential to open up news ways
                    of thinking about the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century texts at the heart of
                    our teaching.</p>
               <p>Being so convinced we put out a call for papers. We also invited Marjorie
                    Levinson, Forest Pyle, and Brian McGrath to be interviewed on the topic, and,
                    wonderfully, they all agreed. Specifically, we asked contributors to write or
                    talk about their day-to-day experiences of teaching the romantic with the
                    contemporary, broadly—and diversely—conceived. Since we can only teach and write
                    from within our own current situations, we each find ourselves enveloped in our
                    lived contemporaneity, whether we like it or not. The question then is not how
                    to close the gap between now and then, nor even how to keep from repeating the
                    trauma of history, but rather, for us as it was for Shelley or Keats, how to
                    situate these temporal gaps or “moments” so as to allow us to repeat
                    differently, with more awareness and attention. </p>
               <p>The writers of the following essays address this question from various creative,
                    pedagogical, and theoretical perspectives. Each identifies and develops in the
                    classroom some aspect of the Romantic—then and now—that reveals productive
                    connections and disconnections, discrete moments, breaks, and continuities. For
                    Daniel Block, whose essay begins our volume, reading our current war on terror
                    through the lens of British Romanticism provides an opportunity for students to
                    “tap into the affective registers of historical consciousness.” Block shows how
                    working creatively with Romantic affect in the classroom can address issues of
                    trauma at multiple levels at once. Sandra Dinter and Stefanie John follow with a
                    meditation on teaching post-Romantic constructions of childhood in contemporary
                    Irish and British fiction. Dinter and John reflect on their experience in
                    teaching the class as well as on the disconnect between the role of British
                    literature in inaugurating the image of the Romantic child and the vulnerable
                    economic/social/political status of so many children living in the U.K. The
                    course, originally taught at the University of Bielefeld in Germany, traces the
                    afterlives of the Romantic child, specifically as refigured in the late
                    twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.</p>
               <p>Next we offer “Fundamental Tensions,” a recorded interview with Marjorie
                    Levinson. Levinson shares her experience of teaching the Romantic with the
                    contemporary as a way to renew our “critical purchase” on the literatures of the
                    Romantic period. In a wide-ranging interview, in which she discusses Stevens,
                    Spinoza, Sartre, and Althusser, Levinson traces the ways in which connected
                    strands of Romantic and post-Romantic thinking continue to motivate and inform
                    her teaching and research. D.B. Ruderman’s essay, “Repetitions of the
                    Romantic,” follows. Ruderman recounts his experience of teaching Romanticism at
                    a regional campus of a large research university in the Midwest. He shows how
                    “working backward toward a structure of feeling,” that is, beginning with
                    contemporary and resonant so-called post-Romantic genres and media (hip-hop,
                    film, essays, etc.) allows for a revitalized understanding of canonical
                    Romanticism. This revitalization is essential for Ruderman insofar as a) he
                    refuses “sealed-off” iterations of the Romantic; and b) he believes that
                    effective teaching in the humanities must involve sensitive attunement to the
                    many micro-cultures of the classroom and its surround. Olivera Jokic’s “Pedagogy
                    of the Depressed: Romanticism and the Long Revolution” takes up this challenge,
                    triangulating optimism, depression, and revolution in a discussion of a class
                    that asks students to bring Romantic works to bear on contemporary questions of
                    political hope. Jokic situates this pedagogical project in the context of
                    teaching “a constituency of mostly first-generation college students, children
                    of the working poor and first-generation immigrants,” thereby asking broader
                    questions regarding whether or how, while teaching Romantic literature, we
                    should teach or temper optimism. </p>
               <p>Next follows an interview with Brian McGrath, who talks with colleague Walt
                    Hunter about teaching contemporary American experimental poets in his
                    Romanticism classes. He does so, he says, in order to complicate students’
                    received and “easy” ideas about Romanticism: its expressivity, for example, or
                    its focus on the individual subject. He also brings together Romantic and
                    contemporary rhetorics and tropes in the classroom, comparing, for example,
                    cloud computing and Wordsworth’s “I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud.” From here,
                    McGrath and Hunter, Romantic and contemporary poetry scholars respectively,
                    trade insights on the deep and reciprocal relationship between contemporary and
                    Romantic poetics. They arrive at an intimation of the Romantic as continuously
                    revitalized and reactivated, especially through what they term the “ambition” of
                    contemporary experimental poetry. Following this enlightening interview and
                    broadening the context for understanding the Romantic literature classroom, Paul
                    Keen’s “Against Utilitarianism: Two Hundred Years of ‘Useful Knowledge’” takes
                    on the crisis in the humanities. Keen finds in Romantic-era defenses of and
                    debates about the value of the arts important precedents for current
                    conversations, and perspectives that might complicate our understanding of
                    knowledge’s ability to “impact.” Taking another macro-context into
                    consideration, Laura Haigwood’s “Romantic Continuities and Feminist
                    Contemporaries” offers a thoughtful blueprint for introducing students to
                    feminism’s roots in Romantic-era human rights discourse and demonstrates how
                    careful discussion of texts such as <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility
                    </title>and <title level="m">The Victim of Prejudice</title> alongside writing
                    assignments ranging from personal reflections to feminist polemics, can help
                    students understand the persistence of and tensions within feminist
                    movements.</p>
               <p>In our final interview, Forest “Tres” Pyle chats with Chet Lisiecki about the
                    emergence of images in Romantic and post-Romantic texts. Pyle discusses using
                    Patti Smith and John Coltrane in the classroom, not only as a way of evoking for
                    the students an aural Kantian sublime, but also as a prelude to asking the
                    students to find their own “constellations or connections” between Romantic-era
                    and contemporary texts. It is clear from this expansive interview that Pyle’s
                    erudition and curiosity inform his teaching and research equally, offering us
                    all a model for an engaged and radical aesthetic.</p>
               <p>The volume concludes with two pieces on praxis. Rachel Feder’s “Zonkey
                    Romanticism” offers four theses on the effects of using creative writing
                    exercises in courses on Romantic literature, and Stephanie Insley Hershinow’s
                    “Romantic Selfhood and the Selfie: Relating to the Novel” offers a nuanced
                    defense of “relatability” in the classroom. By way of example, Hershinow shows
                    how a cultural analysis of YouTube reaction videos can “disrupt students’
                    assumptions about their emotional and psychological distance from Romantic-era
                    fiction.”</p>
               <p>It is our hope that the essays and interviews collected herein will provide food
                    for thought regarding how we define the contours and potentials of the
                    Romanticist classroom circa 2017—a question that has become even more pressing
                    while this volume has been in production. Whether you come to this volume to
                    theorize the pedagogical implications of including artifacts and phenomena from
                    the current (or recent) historical moment(s) in your courses, or whether you
                    come in search of a useful pedagogical tool, assignment, or idea to help you
                    bring the Romantic to bear on a discussion of the contemporary, it is our hope
                    that the work of our contributors will provide frameworks and strategies for
                    thinking through your own Romantic literature classroom—a classroom that is, of
                    course, always already contemporary.</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">In his latest book Art’s Undoing: In the Wake of a Radical
                    Aestheticism (Fordham University Press, 2013), Forest (Tres) Pyle asserts that
                    certain poetic texts “produce a radical engagement with the very processes by
                    which we conceive of the aesthetic, those processes by which the world is not
                    merely known, but felt—and felt as an effect of representation” (5). This model
                    for a poetics of history draws on a rich web of sources, from Shelley, Benjamin,
                    and de Man to John Coltrane, Todd Haynes, and Cy Twombly, in which
                    constellations of aesthetic experience, not unlike signs and flowers, are
                    self-originating. They “flash up” like flares in a night sky whose apprehension,
                    always possible but never determined, is felt with something of a shiver. In
                    this conversation, Tres and I discuss the poetry, music, painting, cinema, and
                    scholarship that make him shiver, focusing on how this constellation of art,
                    artists, philosophy, and criticism, which spans two centuries, has shaped his
                    approach to understanding and teaching Romanticism. That which makes the
                    Romantic poem particular, Tres says, those characteristics around which we have
                    organized a canon and a name, are precisely what challenge periodization in the
                    first place. If Ian Curtis exhibits a sense of possession that summons up
                    Coleridge, then how are we to reconcile historical specificity with aesthetic
                    continuity? What are the “strange subterranean force[s]” that exert themselves
                    in “adventurous poetic forms, musical examples, cinematic forms, or the visual
                    arts?” Since this conversation, Tres and co-editor Jacques Khalip have assembled
                    a collection of essays that addresses these questions. With essays by Ian
                    Balfour, Sara Guyer, and Gayatri Spivak, among many notable others, <title level="m">Constellations of a Contemporary Romanticism</title> (Fordham
                    University Press, 2016) inquires into the implications of Agamben’s notion of
                    contemporaneity, as an adherence to one’s own time through disjunction and
                    anachronism, for studies of Romanticism. As a constellation itself, the book not
                    only illuminates certain shadows, or future anteriors, of Romanticism as they
                    irrupt in Benjaminian now-time, but it also postulates Romanticism itself as a
                    trope that dramatizes—or “detonates”—such now-time by forcing an experience
                    precisely with that which has been passively deposited into the archives of
                    historical time. It is this sense of Romanticism “with its tentacles extended
                    into the future” that drives our conversation. </p>

                     <hi rend="bold">Chet Lisiecki:</hi> Who taught you about Romanticism and how has this
                    influenced your own pedagogy?</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">
                     <hi rend="bold">Tres Pyle:</hi> I remember, as an undergraduate, already being drawn to
                    Keats and Shelley and Romantic poetry in general. Even in high school I remember
                    reading “Ode to the West Wind.” And I grew up on a cattle ranch in west Texas.
                    There the west wind usually brought either dust, or cold, or storms. So I
                    remember reading this exquisite poem and thinking “what a strange ode,” you
                    know, “what a strange thing.” It was as if I were in a radically different
                    ecosystem than the romantic poets. There was always a kind of weird resonance
                    that I felt with them, and I was really drawn to poems such as “Ode to the West
                    Wind” or “The Prelude.” Then in college at UT Austin I had a teacher named
                    Charles Sherry, who’s still teaching now at the University of Arizona, who
                    taught a course on Romanticism. And it felt as if, when we were reading the
                        <title level="m">Defence of Poetry</title>, when we were reading Shelley,
                    that it was speaking a language I already knew and felt. And at the time I
                    didn’t notice that he was a student of de Man’s, had studied with de Man at
                    Cornell, so that there were inflections of a kind of deconstructive and
                    phenomenological reading already happening there. And in some ways it felt like
                    a second skin. I remember reading, as a freshman, the Signet edition of Keats’s
                    poems, which was introduced by Paul de Man, and I remember finding it both
                    incredibly difficult but also exhilarating to think about the poems in this way.
                    So those were my earliest models, but of course I worked with Gayatri Spivak,
                    who we don’t often think of as a Romanticist. But when I was working with her,
                    both as an undergraduate and graduate student, she was still writing essays on
                    Coleridge and Wordsworth and regularly teaching and thinking about Romantic
                    poetics and Kantian philosophical aesthetics as manifest in Romanticism. So I
                    felt like my education in Romanticism started early and never stopped; it just
                    found different avenues and conduits.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">
                     <hi rend="bold">Chet:</hi> So what to you constitutes an introduction to Romanticism,
                    and what contemporary cultural artifacts do you draw on when you’re
                    teaching?</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">
                     <hi rend="bold">Tres:</hi> Some of the things that have been really important to me in
                    trying to think about a fundamental Romantic interest certainly are the question
                    of aesthetic experience and the Romantic concern with the nature of aesthetic
                    experience, poetics that are devoted to the aesthetic, whether they are
                    ekphrastic poems or poems in which nature itself takes on an aesthetic
                    dimension, an aestheticized dimension. The questions of the sublime and the
                    beautiful are really interesting pedagogically for getting students to think
                    about Romanticism. And for that I’ve always liked to go back to Kant, even if
                    I’m teaching a lower-level Romantic poetry class or introduction to Romanticism.
                    We’ll read “Hymn to Intellectual Beauty” or “Mont Blanc” alongside passages or
                    extracts from Kant’s <title level="m">Critique of Judgment</title> to think
                    about how refined and interesting and distinct the thinking about aesthetics is,
                    from Kant through the Romantics, and to sharpen my students’ own critical and
                    aesthetic attentions. So to do that I try to help them read the poems in such a
                    way that certain poems not only want to represent these aesthetic judgments (the
                    sublime and beautiful), but also become them, become examples of them. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">I often find it helpful to look at contemporary instances of this
                    and, depending on the historical moment, I’ve had students listen to Patti
                    Smith’s <title level="m">Horses</title> as an example of a kind of sublime
                    experience and put that alongside a song by Nick Drake that always strikes me as
                    a kind of popular example of sheer beauty. One of my favorite examples is John
                    Coltrane’s version of “My Favorite Things.” We listen to standard versions of it
                    and then listen to Coltrane’s own versions where he goes off on that soprano sax
                    and you don’t quite know where you’re going, in the sense of the circumferences
                    of our comprehension being shattered by these sounds. I think of this as one way
                    of trying to get students to recognize concretely what that might feel like or
                    look like. So it’s often contemporary pop or jazz or musical examples, and then
                    visual examples as well. I try to bring in contemporary paintings and
                    representations of paintings that seem to either function within a kind of
                    harmoniousness of beauty or push an apprehension that seems to break the
                    boundaries or frames of comprehension.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">
                     <hi rend="bold">Chet:</hi> Which artists?</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">
                     <hi rend="bold">Tres:</hi> Cy Twombly is someone who I’m interested in, in part because
                    he’s so interested in Romantic poets. He’s a painter who has always interested
                    me in part because of the sheer scale of his work and his ability to work within
                    moments of delicacy and beauty in his canvases, on the one hand, but also with a
                    kind of energy that seems to push beyond, into the realm of the sublime. I feel
                    with Twombly I can move back and forth between those registers. I’m also
                    interested in the poetry of Frank O’Hara in part because he seems the modern
                    poet most engaged with Keats but also engaged with ekphrastic tradition, linking
                    this back to the romantics. So it’s his own interest with the visual, or poetic
                    representations of the visual, that has led me to think about him and his
                    thinking about paintings as well.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">
                     <hi rend="bold">Chet:</hi> Do you have any specific assignments or activities for
                    students that help facilitate analysis of a painting by Twombly or a Nick Drake
                    song?</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">
                     <hi rend="bold">Tres:</hi> I taught a course called “The Romanticism of Contemporary
                    Culture” in which I presented case study examples, pairing a moment in music and
                    a poet. For instance, one example that I’ve been drawn to is to have students
                    read “Kubla Khan” and try to think about that iconic poem and its willingness to
                    immerse into the strange experience that Coleridge himself seems to be afraid
                    of, terrified by. We think about the connections between this poem and some
                    performances by Ian Curtis from Joy Division—not only the songs, like
                    “Transmission” or “Shadow Play,” but some of the televised versions we have that
                    display the strange sense of possession that he seems to exhibit in these
                    performances, the sense that he’s being overtaken by something. And what I ask
                    students to do is find their own analogue or moment, making it clear that this
                    isn’t a canonical body of the contemporary Romantic sublime or contemporary
                    Romantic beautiful but my own attempt to find these constellations or
                    connections. So the task for them is to find their own and find ways of trying
                    to form those.</p>

                     <title level="m">The Romantic Image</title> is a book by
                    Frank Kermode, written in 1957, and this was a really important book for me
                    early on. What I found interesting was how the notion of the image disappeared
                    from Romantic studies, substituted by probably more precise notions of figures,
                    rhetorical analysis more closely linguistically attuned than the notion of the
                    image. But I was also interested in some early work by de Man on the image and
                    emblem in Yeats and thinking about how this fascination with the image might in
                    fact connect us back to more contemporary understandings of the circulation of
                    the image in a post-Baudrillardian world where the image seems to circulate
                    without anything that it necessarily represents. This free-floating circulation
                    of the image. So these two things fascinated me. One is this very contemporary
                    interest in the image, this older slightly outmoded notion of the Romantic
                    image, which interestingly for both Kermode and de Man extended into Yeats. So
                    it wasn’t simply the Romantics as such but Romanticism with its tentacles
                    extended into the future, so that now suddenly it challenged the notion of
                    periodization. The image is not something that just belongs to Romanticism; it
                    clearly belonged to modernism. And imagism, as much as it wanted to distinguish
                    itself from Romanticism, I felt still had this Romantic subterranean dimension
                    to it that might then be connecting with our new fascination with the
                    circulation of images. So I wrote an essay on de Man and the image, the central
                    reading of which was “Kubla Khan,” as a way of thinking about images as
                    self-originating, things that just emerge and irrupt, and both the seductions
                    and the perceived dangers of the image functioning with its own agency. And that
                    was the impetus for the course and beginning to think about the image now and
                    then and in the future, how those would tie together Romanticism, modernism, and
                    a contemporary way of understanding why the image is at the core of so much
                    contemporary theoretical discussion.</p>

                    informed by our research and vice versa, this mutual interplay, but I do find
                    that the poems I find myself feeling solicited to address or come back to are
                    those that have these fascinating pedagogical moments or questions that emerge
                    around them, whether it’s voice or tone or the preposterousness of when Shelley
                    says to the west wind, “Be thou me.” Students can sometimes roll their eyes at
                    the extravagance of that apostrophe or the strangeness of “Kubla Khan.” So these
                    moments of interest or resistance become the sites of a way of thinking about
                    revisiting them. I often have found myself writing about poems that raise these
                    interesting questions in the classroom. And then I found in some ways that the
                    examples that I want to use in order to explain or develop this thinking about
                    Romanticism is often for me a way of really pushing at ways of seeing
                    contemporary culture itself . . .</p>

                    early version of this was to think about Owen’s early interest in romanticism
                    and how his version of it takes on—even as he increasingly becomes an antiwar

                    stills as well as his other abstract paintings. And it’s funny, you know,
                    because I was first introduced to Richter by Sonic Youth, by <title level="m">Daydream Nation</title>. The cover is a Gerhard Richter still. It was one
                    of those moments that was so exquisite: Sonic Youth introduced me to Richter and

                    want to ask it in case there is anything you want to add. To what extent does
                    literary theory, and deconstruction in particular, figure in your teaching of
                    Romanticism?</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">
                     <hi rend="bold">Tres:</hi> For me the remarkable thing about deconstruction is not that
                    it was a theoretical agenda or program but rather a practice of reading. It was
                    a practice of pushing at the assumptions and implications of reading and trying
                    to read as closely as possible not to determine what texts mean but rather how
                    they mean and how they perform. And I find that it perhaps sounds sort of new
                    critical, but I always found that to be a way, pedagogically, of liberating the
                    classroom as this site of mutual shared investigation of how texts are working.
                    It’s certainly the case that many of the deconstructive theorists who are most
                    important to me read these Romantic poems and read them really closely, and
                    that’s important for my own research and thinking, but it’s really the shared
                    practice of reading that I find most exciting about that. Not as an invitation
                    to theoretical arguments but really as a practice that students can come away
                    with whether they know they’re reading deconstructively or not.</p>

                     <title level="m">Defence of Poetry</title> is such an
                    important text for me. I remember first reading it, not understanding it
                    entirely, but from the beginning it always struck me that it’s a poetics of
                    history. It’s a defense of poetry in some sense but it really is a way of
                    imagining poetry as a kind of non-chronological, historical force that—you know,
                    for Shelley, one feels poetry irrupt, and there are these historical irruptions
                    of poetry and that irruptive force of poetry, which lends to poetry its own
                    agency, the spirit of its own age as a moment of irruption, strikes me as a way
                    of thinking about a poetics of history. I remember reading Benjamin and
                    thinking, these theses on the concept of history, this is Shelley, this is
                    Shelley’s argument, that these moments or events sometimes gestate and wait
                    until the moment in which they can be read. Like stars in the night need
                    appropriate times to be seen and flash up. So I think that that model—the model
                    of Romanticism not as something overlooked or missed or as something that
                    persists as a kind of dominant, but as a strange subterranean force that
                    continues to exert itself often in what I think of as adventurous poetic forms
                    or musical examples or cinematic forms—is a way that it continues to “persist.”
                    Not as Raymond Williams would call the dominant, but not simply as a residual
                    either, in the sense of something in the past, but something that continues to
                    exert an emergent force even if it belongs to the past. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">There’s an example that I often use. Todd Haynes has this great
                    film called <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title>, and the beginning of the
                    film has always struck me as an outtake from “Theses on the Concept of History.”
                    In this scene he imagines this world in which Oscar Wilde has come from one of
                    these constellations in space, landed at a doorstep in Dublin in 1854, and
                    appears as a kind of dandy with a green broach. Oscar Wilde disappears entirely
                    from the film, but the broach itself is discovered by this boy being bullied in
                    a schoolyard fight. He finds the green broach and in this gorgeous moment, his
                    lips are bloodied, he looks in the mirror and transforms the bloody lip into
                    lipstick as he’s looking at himself and smiling, imagining that one day the
                    “whole stinking world” would be his. And it’s this redemption of this moment
                    that irrupts, as the next scene is the irruption of glam rock in the streets of
                    London. As if that possibility, that irruptive possibility of something buried
                    and hidden, can suddenly, in an impossible but beautiful utopian fantasy, take
                    place. And the poetry is there in the streets. And that model, that cinematic
                    representation of Oscar Wilde connects to Benjamin and to Shelley and to Wilde
                    himself as a kind of model of a poetics of history, as a kind of redemptive
                    moment not always available but always possible. And that’s the way I see
                    Romanticism continuing to work in the twenty-first century.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">
                     <hi rend="bold">Chet:</hi> Do you see resonances of this understanding of Romanticism,
                    or poetry, in Adorno’s essay “Lyric Poetry and Society?”</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">
                     <hi rend="bold">Tres:</hi> I do, and I think that’s a really interesting example. He
                    doesn’t invoke Benjamin, as they’re still having arguments at this moment, but
                    he in some sense does seem to be invoking that kind of moment as something not
                    assigned to a reactionary past but part of something to be a kind of, for him,
                    dialectical moment that is irruptive and resistant.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">
                     <hi rend="bold">Chet:</hi> If you were teaching a course on romanticism and the
                    contemporary—and maybe you could think of a couple courses, both a
                    lower-division course and an upper-division or a grad seminar—what do you think
                    would have to be on the syllabus?</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">
                     <hi rend="bold">Tres:</hi> I think <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title> would have
                    to be on the syllabus for either as a really exquisite film for thinking about
                    culture in this way. Certainly at the lower-division I’m really interested in
                    the film <title level="m">Dead Man</title> by Jim Jarmusch, in which William
                    Blake is a gunfighter. The way it models history, thinking about poetry and the
                    western, is a fascinating undoing and rethinking of that whole project. When I
                    teach lower-division, I really try to think about these poets and form those
                    constellations. So I would read for instance “Kubla Khan” alongside the Joy
                    Division example I was referring to, and think perhaps both of them in terms of
                    Bataille, particularly <title level="m">Visions of Excess</title> and his notion
                    of expenditure and the privileged instance.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">
                     <hi rend="bold">Chet:</hi> I’ve tried to teach Bataille several times at the
                    undergraduate level, and it hasn’t really worked. What do you teach by him, and
                    do you have any tips for this?</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">
                     <hi rend="bold">Tres:</hi> I teach “The Notion of Expenditure,” which, again, I teach
                    not to think of as a kind of theory of something but as having a performative
                    element. I teach “The Sacred” and “Sacrifice,” both very brief essays that
                    develop the notion of the privileged instance. And that notion of the privileged
                    instance can dovetail with Wordsworthian notions of spots of time and these
                    lyrical bursts that take place. So I try to think of these irruptive moments as
                    “captured in images” but also that the true history of the past is an image, so
                    what is the nature of that truth as image, and in this way we try to think about
                    these irruptive moments. So once they get over the thought of, “oh my God, what
                    are we reading,” these texts can really be productive. And these are texts that
                    I would teach at undergraduate and graduate levels. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">I think that at the graduate level it’s interesting to teach
                    Badiou and Rancière alongside each other. Rancière in part because of the
                    attempt to reclaim in the aesthetic regime a Romantic notion, one that I find a
                    little too easy and democratic. But it’s interesting to read him alongside
                    Badiou who seems . . . desperate isn’t the word, but vigilant in his
                    attempt to rid all forms of philosophical thinking from its dangerous intimacy
                    with Romanticism, particularly the intimacy with poetic language that he sees as
                    forming. So it’s interesting to see this contemporary theoretical debate, which
                    may be the last major debate of the master thinkers in France, still orbiting
                    around problems in romanticism. So that’s something I would do at a graduate
                    level. But I think a lot of the examples work in helping graduate and
                    undergraduate students begin thinking about visual as well as literary
                    representations and how those function. I would read more Roland Barthes in that
                    model because I think in his late work in particular the notion of the punctum
                    or the third meaning continue to resonate with that model of Romantic
                    experience, aesthetics, and judgment.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay challenges students to think about how we might make
                    the case for the public value of the humanities by grounding our own debates
                    about these issues in a close reading of Percy Shelley’s “Defence of Poetry.” It
                    argues that Shelley’s argument against the primacy of utilitarian pragmatism is
                    not, despite its apparent rhetoric, a lofty and off-putting retreat into elitist
                    claims for the arts, but quite the contrary, a radical and politically engaged
                    account of why the arts ultimately matter more than applied forms of “useful
                    knowledge,” even within the context of social reform.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <p>There is a question that I always open our discussion of Percy Shelley’s
                        “Defence of Poetry” with in my Romantic Literature classes: what exactly
                        does Shelley mean by his reference to “all invention for abridging and
                        combining labour”? (134). It was clearly important to Shelley. He had
                        offered a very similar description just four paragraphs earlier: “Whilst the
                        mechanist abridges, and the political economist combines, labour” (132). My
                        experience when I ask it is virtually always the same. Students find the
                        question difficult precisely because the answer is so obvious, and in many
                        ways, so mundane. It’s not so much the purloined letter as the industrial
                        elephant in the room. He’s talking about the assembly line, that innovation
                        that would become the cornerstone of the modern factory system. Labor would
                        be “abridged” because the task demanded of every worker would be narrowed to
                        a single, highly specialized function, and “combined” because that act would
                        only gain its value alongside the equally specialized functions of several
                        other laborers as the product passed from hand to hand. </p>
                  <p>We look at those passages in Shelley’s text alongside Adam Smith’s famous
                        description of a pin factory in the opening pages of <title level="m">Wealth
                            of Nations</title>, which was intended to demonstrate the extraordinary
                        productivity that would flow from precisely this sort of arrangement. In a
                        pin factory, Smith explained, the simple act of making a pin would be
                        “divided into about eighteen distinct operations” (15). As Smith put it, “in
                        consequence of a proper division and combination of their different
                        operations” a relatively small group of people could soon be producing
                        48,000 pins a day (15). The system worked “by reducing every man’s business
                        to some one simple operation, and by making this operation the sole
                        employment of his life” (18). All that was needed was that the workers be
                        “collected into the same workhouse” (14). </p>
                  <p>Shelley clearly expected readers to understand his reference, both in terms
                        of its literal meaning and the much broader economic and political arguments
                        that it had become a shorthand for, but that is no longer something that we
                        can take for granted. I begin my discussion of Shelley’s “Defence” with this
                        apparently simple question about this reference to “all invention for
                        abridging and combining labor” every time I teach it and what is striking is
                        that no one has ever come up with that particular answer: the assembly line.
                        Nor, I want to emphasize, should we blame them. The high rhetorical style of
                        the text itself, the elevated nature of its claims for poetry, and the
                        natural tendency of a classroom situation to encourage answers that reach
                        for the sophisticated rather than the commonplace all militate against it.
                        But if we don’t understand this reference then we miss out on much of the
                        real force of Shelley’s argument, which is crucial because this is also the
                        basis of what may be the most sophisticated and most radical argument that
                        emerged in these years, not just about the value of poetry, but about what
                        Raymond Williams identified as an emerging definition of culture and, bound
                        up with that, a crucial case for the broader importance of the humanities
                        themselves. At a time when those of us who work in the humanities face
                        unprecedented pressure to make the case for what we do to numerous different
                        audiences—university administrators, government policy-makers, the media,
                        and the general public—this argument is worth emphasizing. </p>
                  <p>On one level, this question is bound up with a more fundamental pedagogical
                        issue that colors the study of all literary history (or history in general).
                        Whether we theorize it explicitly or not, the study of any period of
                        literary history is shaped by the question of whether we are interested in
                        that earlier period because of the ways that it differs from our own age, or
                        the ways that it resembles us. Does its very strangeness offer a perspective
                        on our own world that can be critically productive and politically enabling,
                        or do we react more strongly to the ways that the uncanny parallels that we
                        find in these texts resonate across time? In practice, of course, it is
                        never a simple either/or proposition. The real challenge lies in being as
                        aware as we can be of the shaping influence of the dynamic tension between
                        these perspectives.</p>
                  <p>This has certainly been the case with the Romantic period. In many ways, our
                        most basic approaches to it have always said as much about the spirit of our
                        own age as they did about the period itself. In an age when civil rights
                        campaigners and anti-war protestors made common cause with a new generation
                        of singers and poets, we became aware of just how big a part the French
                        Revolution had played in shaping the consciousness of the group of writers
                        that would become known as the Romantics. As the reform movement faltered,
                        we grew used to thinking about the Romantics’ ideas about poetry as an
                        evasion rather than an extension of their own fading radical politics. In
                        the years when a postmodern aesthetic emphasizing fragmentation and
                        vertiginous self-referentiality dominated the academy, we discovered
                        Romantic irony. In recent years, caught up in the profound technological
                        changes unleashed by the digital revolution, we have increasingly emphasized
                        the ways that late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth-century debates about
                        print culture were already focusing squarely on the complex assumptions and
                        multiple forms of mediation that structured literature as a field of
                        cultural production. In so many of these ways, the Romantics turn out to
                        have anticipated our major preoccupations long before we ever became aware
                        of them. But they also did so in remarkably different social and political
                        conditions, and in ways that are ultimately very different from our own
                        beliefs and practices today.</p>
                  <p>Negotiating this blend of historical echoes and epistemic ruptures is
                        complicated by a further pedagogical twist that runs through all of this:
                        the challenge, which none of us ever fully master, of recognizing the sheer
                            <emph>presentness</emph> of any earlier age: the fact that people were
                        living, thinking, and writing in the present tense and without the benefit
                        of hindsight. It can be difficult for students to fully appreciate that
                        these people—<emph>all people</emph>—correctly thought of themselves as
                        living in the most modern age that had ever existed, and that they were
                        wrestling with changes that were often far more rapid and far more
                        fundamental than anything we are living through today. They were continually
                        struck by their exceptional modernity rather than their historicity. The
                        challenge of adequately recognizing this is exacerbated by the temporal
                        equivalent of a familiar optical illusion: the sense that objects far away
                        are moving very slowly, if they’re moving at all. In a similar way, the
                        further back we look into the past, the easier it is to underestimate the
                        impact of the sense of change that they were living through, and the lack of
                        the sort of hindsight that we too often impose on them. Socrates never
                        thought of himself as a Classical thinker, nor did Elizabethan writers know
                        that they were living in the Renaissance. Wordsworth and Blake would
                        probably have been puzzled to learn that they were Romantics. The labels
                        come later, and even where they are appropriate, they can have the
                        unfortunate effect of tidying history up in ways that erase the messiness,
                        which may be the most important part of what we’re studying. Recognizing the
                        impact of all of this makes studying literary history, including the
                        challenge of negotiating the changing nexus of historical parallels and
                        differences that we discover in it, simultaneously more challenging and more
                        important. </p>

                  <p>Shelley’s effort to articulate a transformative social and political role for
                        poetry in a rapidly changing industrial world, and in ways that now seem
                        both profoundly outmoded and strikingly current, exemplifies these various
                        theoretical questions about the study of literary history. This is
                        especially true when we read his argument in the context of one further
                        academic debate that has become increasingly urgent over the past few years:
                        the issue of the role of the humanities. As Martha Nussbaum has recently
                        argued, “we are in the midst of a crisis of massive proportions and grave
                        global significance”: not “the global economic crisis that began in 2008”
                        but the decline of support for the humanities in terms of both pedagogical
                        and research priorities within universities (1–2). Nussbaum’s book—<title level="m">Not For Profit: Why Democracy Needs the Humanities</title>—has
                        become a widely cited element of this debate, but the urgency of the topic
                        has ensured an equally strong chorus of responses. Google “crisis in the
                        humanities” and you are confronted with a very long and rapidly growing list
                        of people weighing in on the subject. There is a “crisis in the humanities”
                        home page, blogs, links to numerous columns and articles, whether in the
                        mainstream media or academic journals, a Wikipedia site, amazon.com links
                        containing references to numerous books on the topic, and so on. The outlook
                        they share is that things are pretty bleak. As Robert Weisbuch put it,
                        “[t]oday’s consensus about the state of the humanities” is that “it’s bad,
                        it’s getting worse, and no one is doing much about it,” all of which “ is
                        supported by dismal facts” (B4).</p>
                  <p>As many of these critics emphasize, the immediate problems generated on a
                        practical level by declining support for the humanities are exacerbated by a
                        far more serious failure to understand the broader social worth of the
                        humanities in an age when the perceived benefits of knowledge production are
                        increasingly viewed in terms of market forces. An editorial entitled
                        “Liberal Arts and Commercial Utility” in Canada’s leading national
                        newspaper, the<title level="m"> Globe and Mail</title>, neatly summed these
                        problems up in its warning that, “the liberal arts are necessary and good,
                        but not sufficient in the modern age.” It didn’t bother to explain what it
                        might mean to be “sufficient in the modern age,” but given the editorial’s
                        headline, it didn’t really need to. As Stefan Collini has argued in a widely
                        cited <title level="m">TLS</title> Commentary, this absolute inability to
                        imagine the worth of the humanities in any socially useful sense was starkly
                        demonstrated in the Research Excellence Framework that was recently
                        established as the official basis for determining research funding
                        allocations amongst English universities. As Collini has pointed out, part
                        of this formula for funding allocation depends on what the Research
                        Excellence Framework calls “impact,” which it breaks down into thirty-seven
                        possible categories, each of which is in turn measured by a series of
                        “indicators” such as “creating new businesses,” “commercializing new
                        products or processes,” and “attracting R&amp;D investment from global
                        business” (18). </p>
                  <p>It is not difficult or inaccurate to draw a line of connection between the
                        narrow market-based vision of the Research Excellence Framework and the
                            <title level="m">Globe and Mail</title>’s editorial on “Liberal Arts and
                        Commercial Utility,” which share both a diplomatic sense that “the liberal
                        arts are necessary and good,” and an equal confidence that they are not
                        somehow “sufficient in the modern age.” Certainly it is hard to see how they
                        could be “adequate,” given the list of “indicators” supplied by the
                        Framework. But as Collini also points out, the most serious evidence of the
                        magnitude of this problem lies in the lack of any indicators in the final
                        category, the only one where the work of most humanities scholars might
                        easily be slotted, which is headed “other quality of life benefits” (18).
                        This category is the only one of the thirty-seven that had no examples
                        provided. It contains a one-line note, which merely says: “please suggest
                        what might also be included in this list” (18). They had to invite
                        suggestions because they themselves had no idea. They simply could not
                        imagine any way that the liberal arts could be seem to have any valid social
                        impact. It beggared their imagination.</p>
                  <p>Nor is any of this unprecedented, which is where we rejoin Shelley. His
                        complaint that poets had been challenged, “to resign the civic crown to
                        reasoners and mechanists” remains every bit as true today, but so too does
                        the argument that he developed in the face of this resistance (131). For
                        early nineteenth-century advocates such as Shelley, William Hazlitt, and
                        Leigh Hunt, the arts constituted a central aspect of a larger struggle for
                        social progress, but like today, these arguments were themselves sharpened
                        by the need to challenge a utilitarian emphasis on the primacy of applied
                        knowledge. In Book III of <title level="m">The Rationale of Reward</title>,
                        Jeremy Bentham famously insisted, “that Prejudice apart, the game of
                        push-pin is of equal value with the arts and sciences of music and poetry.
                        If the game of push-pin furnish more pleasure, it is more valuable than
                        either. Everybody can play at push-pin: poetry and music are relished only
                        by a few.” Nothing but “Prejudice” could explain the persistent faith in the
                        value of the arts. Echoing Plato’s eviction of the poet in <title level="m">The Republic</title>, Bentham went on to suggest that poetry was not
                        only hopelessly elitist, it was actually dangerous: <quote> The game of
                            push-pin is always innocent: it were well could the same be always
                            asserted of poetry. Indeed, between poetry and truth there is natural
                            opposition: false morals and fictitious nature. The poet always stands
                            in need of something false. When he pretends to lay his foundations in
                            truth, the ornaments of his superstructure are fictions; his business
                            consists in stimulating our passions, and exciting our
                            prejudices. . . . If poetry and music deserve to be
                            preferred before a game of push-pin, it must be because they are
                            calculated to gratify those individuals who are most difficult to be
                            pleased. (206–07)</quote> Bentham may have been more polemical than
                        most, but his position was a familiar one. His fellow utilitarian, Thomas
                        Love Peacock (a poet himself in earlier days), insisted in <title level="m">The Four Ages of Poetry</title> that the cultivation of poetry could
                        only be “to the neglect of some branch of useful study,” in stark contrast
                        with the tendency of “the thinking and studious, and scientific and
                        philosophical part of the community” to draw on “the materials of useful
                        knowledge” in order to prepare one’s self for “the real business of life”
                        (578–79). The logic that structures the Research Excellence Framework is
                        many ways a natural extension of these earlier utilitarian positions, which
                        is what makes the opportunity to situate Shelley’s “Defence” within our own
                        utilitarian debates today especially important. </p>
                  <p> Responding to Peacock’s criticisms, Shelley distinguished between two
                        different types of utility: spiritual nourishment (“whatever strengthens and
                        purifies the affections, enlarges the imagination, and adds spirit to
                        sense”) and what he dismissed as the “narrower one of banishing the
                        importunity of the wants of our animal nature, the surrounding men with
                        security of life, the dispersing the grosser delusions of superstition, and
                        the conciliating such a degree of forbearance among men as may consist with
                        the motives of personal advantage” (132). The first is “universal and
                        permanent,” the latter merely “transitory and particular” (132). Given this
                        choice, Shelley suggests, the real priority is clear: what were the
                        inconveniences of poverty, starvation and war (issues connected with “the
                        wants of our animal nature”) compared with this higher good (“whatever
                        strengthens and purifies the affections, enlarges the imagination, and adds
                        spirit to sense”)? </p>
                  <p> The problem, as students are rightly quick to notice, is that Shelley’s
                        reaction winds up being as hopelessly self-serving and elitist as Peacock’s
                        criticisms were shortsighted. At first glance it seems to be guilty of
                        self-absorption in ways that make him indifferent to the needs of the worst
                        off around him. Peacock was well-intentioned but reductive, but Shelley
                        seems to be ranking the challenge of providing people with food, shelter,
                        and security somewhere far beneath the task of “enlarg[ing] our
                        imagination.” He compounds the problem by going on to dismiss mere
                        “reasoners” such as Locke, Hume, Gibbon, Voltaire, and Rousseau, who
                        struggled in their limited way on behalf of “oppressed and deluded
                        humanity.” Not that they were completely useless. Had the world not
                        benefitted from their efforts, Shelley conceded, “a little more nonsense
                        would have been talked for a century or two; and perhaps a few more men,
                        women and children, burnt as heretics. We might not at this moment have been
                        congratulating each other on the abolition of the Inquisition in Spain”
                        (132). But these changes paled in comparison with the spectre of “the moral
                        condition of the world if neither Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Chaucer,
                        Shakespeare, Calderon, Lord Bacon, nor Milton, had ever existed; if Raphael
                        and Michael Angelo had never been born; if the Hebrew poetry had never been
                        translated; if a revival of the study of Greek literature had never taken
                        place; if no monuments of ancient sculpture had been handed down to us”
                        (132). One can understand people’s outrage to this position, which seems to
                        epitomize the worst kinds of special pleading that people associate with the
                        liberal arts: a forerunner of what Alex Usher has recently dismissed as the
                        “‘we're-not-sure-how-but-boy-the-Arts-are-important’ hand-waving we do now”
                        (“Re-imagining”). </p>
                  <p> Usher is right to bristle at this sort of self-congratulatory posturing,
                        except that in Shelley’s case, it is not quite this simple. In many ways,
                        the text sets us up to believe the worst, and therefore to align ourselves
                        with the positions espoused by Bentham and Peacock, as well as by the
                        authors of the Research Excellence Framework and the <title level="m">Globe
                            and Mail</title> editorial, only to demonstrate why this would be so
                        shortsighted. And the key to this reversal lies in his references to the
                        assembly line. Far from indulging in the
                        “‘we're-not-sure-how-but-boy-the-Arts-are-important’ hand-waving” that his
                        argument seems to suggest, Shelley’s argument was ultimately clear sighted
                        and materialist. His objection is not to the ideal of economic
                        rationalization <emph>per se</emph>, but to its broader social impact: the
                        fact that increased productivity had led, for want of the sort of larger
                        perspective that he associated with poetry, to “the exasperation of the
                        inequality of mankind” (134). Or as Shelley rather unpoetically put it, “the
                        rich have become richer, and the poor have become poorer” (132). In a just
                        society, many would argue, dramatically increased productivity should be a
                        great equalizer, a powerful means of tackling the class contradictions that
                        had been exacerbated by the onset of the industrial revolution. But for lack
                        of imagination, greater productivity had only magnified these inequalities.
                        Recognizing the importance of the relation between technological advances
                        and the visionary impulse that would ensure that these advances translate
                        into progressive social changes means that the choice between the two
                        different types of utility (the poetic spirit and material needs) turns out
                        to be a false opposition that ignores the valuable relations between them.
                        Social reformers required the visionary potential that Shelley identified
                        with the imagination in order to recognize both the potential unintended
                        consequences of their work and the avenues for change that might not
                        otherwise have been envisioned. The poetic spirit expanded rather than
                        negated or transcended the impact of applied knowledge by insisting on the
                        larger contexts within which its deployment (or “impact”) would ultimately
                        be felt.</p>
                  <p> The problem, Shelley argued, was that rapid technological change across a
                        range of applied sciences had fostered a sense of technological determinism
                        that led to a politically paralyzing distortion of this relation: “We have
                        more moral, political and historical wisdom, than we know how to reduce into
                        practice; we have more scientific and economical knowledge than can be
                        accommodated to the just distribution of the produce which it multiplies.
                        The poetry in these systems of thought, is concealed by the accumulation of
                        facts and calculating processes” (134). The problem lay in an imbalance
                        between applied and critical, or instrumentalist and self-reflexive
                        knowledge: “a cultivation of the mechanical arts in a degree disproportioned
                        to the presence of the creative faculty. . . . From what
                        other cause has it arisen that these inventions which should have lightened,
                        have added a weight to the curse imposed on Adam?” (134).</p>
                  <p> Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno would pose a very similar argument in
                            <title level="m">Dialectic of Enlightenment</title> but where, for
                        Horkheimer and Adorno, there was no escape from the Enlightenment’s
                        “indefatigable self-destructiveness,” Shelley embraced the much broader
                        perspective that he associated with poetry as both a basis for critical
                        insight and a stimulant for radical intervention (xi). “We want the creative
                        faculty to imagine that which we know; we want the generous impulse to act
                        that which we imagine” (134). For Shelley, the poetic imagination was
                        ultimately a form of praxis: “There is no want of knowledge respecting what
                        is wisest and best in morals, government, and political economy, or at
                        least, what is wiser and better than what men now practise and endure. But
                        we let ‘<emph>I dare not</emph> wait upon <emph>I would</emph>, like the
                        poor cat in the adage’” (134). </p>
                  <p>Shelley’s claim, ultimately, is that the poetic imagination marked a radical
                        extension of Enlightenment rationalism; a self-reflexive domain capable of
                        both interrogating the potential consequences of reformers’ interventions
                        and of helping to maximize their progressive impact. But even more
                        importantly, the terms in which Shelley makes this particular
                        argument—seeming to be guilty of a flagrant case of
                        “‘we're-not-sure-how-but-boy-the-Arts-are-important’ hand-waving we do now”
                        only to show why this is precisely not that case through his allusions to
                        the negative impact of the assembly line—rehearses the failure of critics to
                        recognize the “impact” of the arts (or the humanities) in order to show why
                        they are not just “sufficient in the modern age,” but more important than
                        ever. At a time when the humanities face renewed pressure to justify
                        themselves in the utilitarian terms that have come to dominate these
                        discussions, his point is once again worth making. Learning to be good
                        readers of Shelley’s text can foster a clearer understanding of the real
                        nature of these debates about the humanities, both today and two hundred
                        years ago, but it can also help to train people to be more critically
                        engaged in the broader dynamics of our age in precisely the ways that
                        Shelley’s argument about the power relations that inform the social impact
                        of all applied knowledge suggests. In doing so it helps us to answer the
                        question about the broader social worth of the humanities by making us
                        recognize just how complicated the idea of the “impact” of knowledge can
                        actually be.</p>

                  <p>This essay discusses how a course on nineteenth-century literature can become a
                    course on persistent preoccupations with available forms of political thought
                    and action. This outcome I would like to count as a kind of success, and this
                    success, in a course I have taught, has been inextricable from a certain set of
                    “pathologies” that developed in the process of reading the course material with
                    the students. In a course about “revolution,” I teach students how to use a
                    history of imagination and writing about the conditions and possibility of
                    significant social change to curb their own political optimism. To become so
                    depressed in this course is good for them, I insist, because this is how
                    nineteenth-century reading material becomes relevant to the present. </p>
                  <p>The kind of depression I refer to is that which Eve Sedgwick identified as
                    integral for pedagogical and generational transmission, and different from the
                    “common sense” understanding of depression. It is not a dis-ease imposed from
                    the outside on a sufferer aspiring to escape this state so as to differentiate
                    it from the ostensibly normal condition of thought and spirit.<note place="foot"> Sedgwick’s rendition of the common sense understanding of depression: a
                        “chronic natural gloominess,” or “exogenous malady, from who knows where,
                        that is liable to descend on its unsuspecting host until heroically routed
                        by medicine and positive mental hygiene.”</note> Sedgwick offers “the
                    depressive personality in the educator” and “the depressive position,”
                    elaborations by Silvan Tomkins and Melanie Klein respectively, as accounts of
                    depression more illuminating of the teaching situation because they suggest how
                    the pedagogical relationship is one of precarious growth and pervasive
                    ambivalence about the distribution of the power to know. For Tomkins, Sedgwick
                    points out, “the depressive personality in the educator” accounts for a person
                    in whom “the depressive personality or script” is “a durable feature” of their
                    way of being, “a constitutive feature of their best aptitudes as well as
                    disabilities,” regardless of their experience of depression. In a description
                    that could alarm many an impassioned educator with its peculiar familiarity,
                    Tomkins’s “depressive, like his parent before him, is not altogether a
                    comfortable person to be around.” Still, the discomforts he (or she) creates are
                    instrumental in the forming of the depressive pair. An other is (or multiple
                    others are) “seduced” into a pair by the depressive’s genuine care and interest,
                    only to be found lacking and compelled to “seek restitution, to atone, and to
                    please the other” (Tomkins 225). This is how depressives make other depressives,
                    both students and teachers. </p>
                  <p>While Tomkins’s is an account of a “particular kind of individual who emerges
                    from the contingency of a particular history,” Klein’s “depressive position” is
                    a universally available developmental phase, a “uniquely spacious rubric,” which
                    “encompasses not only preconditions of severe depression, but also resources for
                    surviving, repairing, and moving far beyond that depression.” It is a labile
                    position of dependence on objects whose solidity one has had to establish for
                    oneself, which could become one’s undoing. Yet the depressive position is an
                    “anxiety-mitigating achievement” (an improvement over the paranoid/schizoid
                    position), marked by the “foundational, authentically difficult understanding
                    that good and bad tend to be inseparable at every level.” </p>
                  <p>Both of these are accounts of the work of depression—or, rather, the work on
                    depression—and they seem apt to me as descriptions of the work in a course that
                    encourages students to consider the character of their position as revolutionary
                    subjects. From the perspective of the institution, this course is one of the
                    required “historical perspectives” on literature, of which each English major
                    has to take four. They must all know that there is a relationship between
                    literature and historical change. <note place="foot"> Requirement checklist for
                        English majors at John Jay College CUNY is at <ref target="http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/departments/english/Checklist_for_English_Major-F2010.pdf">http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/departments/english/Checklist_for_English_Major-F2010.pdf</ref>.
                    </note> I advertise the course as a semester-long investigation of
                    nineteenth-century texts’ relationship to a period that seems to have been
                    marked by relentless political and social upheaval. The course is organized
                    around texts published between the French (1789) and the Russian (1917)
                    revolutions. <note place="foot">The cutoff revolutions could have been
                        different, but I decided to stay with 1789 as the opening date that figures
                        prominently in many historical accounts of European modernity. In an article
                        that will be required reading in the next iteration of the course, Michael
                        Keith Baker uses newly digitized and searchable repositories of early modern
                        texts to trace the transformations in the meaning and uses of the word
                        “revolution.” The article is a model deployment of new methodology:
                        technologically savvy, conservative about machine intelligence, and
                        sophisticated in defining search terms. Its analysis of the newly legible
                        resources sustains Baker’s larger claim that revolution is a “historically
                        constituted category of historical understanding.” This is a claim not just
                        about linguistic trends and statistics, but also about how words have been
                        trusted to reflect and effect a change in the world. Baker argues that the
                        meaning of the word shifted around the political change initiated in France
                        in 1789, a “revolution revolutionized” (189). The word referred no longer to
                        the completed events (albeit dramatic and transformative) but to an “ongoing
                        political act” (190), an “expression of the dynamic transformational process
                        advancing the progress of humankind, not endless meaningless variations on
                        the same thing” (206). It was thus also a “script for future political or
                        social action” (199), a socialized and normalized requirement for an
                        optimistic political imagination for anyone committed to “progress” and
                        “society,” whose shared future is shaped by a good grasp and management of
                        the present.</note> It is a course on “Literature and Revolution” in the
                    “long” nineteenth century: the unrest seems to spill over the ends of a century,
                    over the borders of European nation states, and over the ends of continents. The
                    interest in revolution, I propose, has to be an interest in the narratives and
                    expectations that made radical change seem, for over a hundred years, necessary
                    and worthwhile to some, terrifying and impossible to others, and certainly never
                    finished. What made the change worthwhile? Wrecking the known world was one
                    thing, but doing it in the name of a better new one nobody had ever seen had to
                    be something quite different. Was the “world” different from “society?” Who was
                    “society” anyway? Who were the “radicals” and how radical were they? Was all
                    that revolution a success? Are we living in it now? </p>
                  <p>As a historical event or notion, “revolution” figured very vaguely in the
                    students’ imaginations, a fairly sparse catalogue of revolutionary facts and
                    figures. (The vibrancy of their historical imagination of the long nineteenth
                    century in Europe may remain unchanged in the aftermath of the course.) Most of
                    them claimed at the beginning of the course that they had heard of the French
                    Revolution before signing up, and guessed wildly about when it started and how
                    it ended. Only a few had heard of the Russian revolution: the closer the country
                    of their parents’ origin to the former Soviet Union, the more likely they were
                    to know that this revolution happened at all, and (rarely) to point accurately
                    to the century in which it began. Virtually no one in the class had ever heard
                    of the revolutions of 1848, although all of them had heard of the specter of
                    Karl Marx, and most knew of the existence of the “Communist Manifesto.” Very few
                    had thought of Marx as the kind of menace whose motor, especially in depictions
                    of communism in the United States, was his writing.<note place="foot"> When I
                        rehearsed in front of the class a brief narrative about the Bolshevik
                        Revolution’s aspiration to create and preserve unprecedented change, change
                        which redrew maps of Europe and assigned decades of political work of Cold
                        War de-identification from the revolutionary ideals in the United States, we
                        all sat in awkward silence for a minute or so.</note>They had all heard of
                    Romanticism, but had no idea what it may have to do with radical political
                    change.</p>
                  <p>The relevance of the course overall seemed to many students fairly unclear since
                    there was no confusion about the position we could take on revolution: we were
                    neither in it nor about it. The revolution was not for us, not something we
                    would learn to admire, being free to be or do (or study) anything, in the
                    country self-defined by a break from the tradition of government by fiat and
                    repression. Political stability and gradual reform were clearly
                        preferable—<emph>that</emph> was what we were there for. And where we were
                    matters a great deal: I teach at the City University of New York, a state-funded
                    system established to serve new immigrants, the aspiring optimists among New
                    York City’s servants, and other varieties of the working poor. The undergraduate
                    college where I teach is a federally registered “Hispanic-serving institution”
                    which anticipates in the shape of its remedial curriculum and its attention to
                    English for Academic Purposes that the majority of its students will be fluent
                    (although not necessarily academically proficient) in at least one language that
                    is not the language of college instruction.<note place="foot"> For many, English
                        language proficiency is a form of deference to the language of higher
                        education as an engine of social mobility; used competently in the register
                        of professional communication, “good English” constitutes a promise of
                        economic prosperity and personal advancement. The full name of the college
                        is “John Jay College of Criminal Justice,” an educational profile that now
                        serves as a marketable brand of specialty professional education and steady
                        tuition income, but also an impediment to John Jay’s transformation into a
                        “college of liberal arts” serving more traditional students, better prepared
                        academically and capable of paying more for their tuition. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This college-level literature classroom is a kind of fulfillment of eighteenth-
                    and nineteenth-century revolutionary visions of universal access to democratic
                    public institutions, to all avenues of social mobility, and to the
                    transformative effects of art. It is these young people, not just Voltaire’s,
                    who would see great things.These English majors are hardly cynical about
                    narratives of liberation and progress, or about the promises of individualism
                    and self-determination as the ends of education. They know and live what Lauren
                    Berlant has called the “centrality of optimistic fantasy to reproducing and
                    surviving in zones of compromised ordinariness.” (35) To find out that reading
                    and writing may be their means of personal and professional advancement is for
                    many students a minor revolutionary turn. Often they are academic refugees from
                    fields that promised greater or more tangible rewards (financial security,
                    social mobility), but also failed students intellectually and emotionally. Their
                    first experience of textual interpretation is impossible to ignore precisely
                    because it provides an opportunity to admit into the university classroom their
                    doubts about what such a classroom can or should do.<note place="foot"> Under
                        the latest transformation of the general education curriculum, adopted
                        against loud protests from the faculty, students now choose from topical
                        “buckets” (e.g., Individual and Society, or Learning from the Past), in
                        which any number of disciplines can compete for students’ attention, to the
                        point of mutual exclusion of history and literature, or literature and fine
                        art. As a result, it is possible to graduate from college without ever
                        taking a literature or a history class. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>A course on “literature and revolution” promises to examine the logic and the
                    significance of narratives that bring students to literature in the university
                    classroom as two spaces through which to project one’s desires. It makes use of
                    the students’ concern that the class may want to put in question the viability
                    of their chosen method of progress, liberation, and self-determination, and the
                    awkwardness of their self-congratulation. Depression is at the center of this
                    pedagogical situation, in which interpretation of texts concerned with radical
                    social change is a way of producing fraught histories of the students’ own
                    interpretive positions, of their ambivalent commitments to the narrative visions
                    of futurity, and to the languages in which they reach the present. </p>
                  <p>The rhetoric of revolution permeated the course atmosphere, as official media
                    tried to assess the clearly dramatic events of the “Arab Spring,” a season of
                    change that had by then spanned over three years, and social media supplied the
                    extraordinary detail of the extraordinary events at unprecedented speed. The
                    surfeit of data was expected to help standardize the magnitude of political
                    transformations that qualified as “real” revolution. By the time our course
                    began, the unrest had spread from Egypt across several countries in the Middle
                    East and North Africa, and the cultivation of optimism regarding the direction
                    and magnitude of the change gave way to pronouncements of disaster and
                    incompetent management of progress. Initial appraisals had wondered if
                    “revolutionary” transformation could happen over the course of one day (January
                    25, 2010 in Cairo), in a year,<note place="foot">

                    By 2013, the <title level="m">New York Times </title>was declaring that making
                    revolution was no swift or clean business. Although it was still easy to
                    understand why the status quo was untenable, it was clear that what was once
                    “optimistically known as the Arab Spring,” had become a drawn-out, chaotic mess.
                    In face of the damage done in the three years since the Egyptian revolt, it was
                    clear that the “Spring” never stood for a viable “replacement model” for the
                    broken societies; now these societies “find peace is harder than
                        revolution.”<note place="foot"> By way of comparison of the new situation on
                        the ground to the pre-revolutionary condition, the <title level="m">Times
                        </title>article offers that “the region’s old status quo, dominated by
                        imperious rulers who fixed elections, ruled by fiat and quashed dissent, has
                        been fundamentally damaged, if not overthrown.” In 2015, the civil wars in
                        Syria and Iraq, and the resulting refugee crisis affecting every continent,
                        seem to be the fruit of that “revolution.”</note> (Hubbard and Gladstone
                    2013)</p>
                  <p>The distance between what these revolutionaries knew they no longer wanted and
                    the shape of what they desired was a useful reminder that “societies” can be
                    difficult quantities to grasp and dangerous to tinker with. Even with all the
                    information available, contemporary revolutions (if that is what they are) snag
                    precisely because the political desires of one society could take on many,
                    contrary, and even murderous shapes.<note place="foot">Paul Mason of the <title level="m">Guardian</title>, assessing what made for twenty-first century
                        revolution, ventured that “something real and important was unleashed in
                        2011” that had not “gone away,” despite the clear dents in public optimism
                        about the events’ trajectory, the supremely destructive civil war in Syria
                        their dystopian apex. “Confident enough” to call the events a revolution in
                        2013, Mason pointed to “a change in consciousness, the intuition that
                        something big is possible; that a great change in the world's priorities is
                        within people's grasp.” </note> In our course about a history of definitions
                    and descriptions of depressing presents and bright futures, a series of readings
                    in the nineteenth century could become a sustained discussion about how (or
                    whether) a “replacement model” justifies the beginning or the reiteration of a
                    “revolution,” about what one can make of others’ attempts to risk life and limb,
                    and how revolution can become a contagious social practice—a way of thinking
                    others’ thoughts and doing their deeds in the name of the bright future of a
                    “society.” The students’ work is to orient themselves in that history by
                    recognizing the contingencies of narratives they tell themselves about
                    themselves—assuming there is a self—and their relationship to others. How does
                    one become responsible for one’s own well-being, and relate to that of others,
                    if, as Marx was to put in a moment of predictable disappointment at the sight of
                    revolutionary momentum turning into a joke, no one can select the circumstances
                    in which to make their own history?</p>
                  <p>The course suggests that these are questions of interpretation explicitly
                    politicized by what we now read as literature of Romanticism. By “Romanticism”
                    we imagine not just the canonical male poets, but the many writers for whom the
                    turn of the nineteenth century was a period of enormous exhilaration and
                    disappointment, what they recognized as a whole new order of experience, for
                    which they proposed a new kind of relationship to representation—to writing and
                    reading. Students react perhaps most dramatically at the epistolary narratives
                    of Helen Maria Williams, the author of “letters to friends” in England from the
                    eye of the revolutionary storm in France, with surprise and amazement at what to
                    them seems like an unlikely life-narrative for a late eighteenth-century woman.
                    Tracing her “career” from the early exhilaration about acting on the futuristic
                    principles of universal equality, to the onset of paranoid social imagination
                    justifying mass murder, students find Williams disorienting. We know these are
                    not real personal letters, but still, how appealing! How did she know so early
                    that this was the future? Why is it news to us that a woman acted thus on her
                    vision? How does our hindsight compare to her knowing at the time that an epoch
                    was being made? </p>
                  <p>Romanticism, in this course on revolution, addresses the significance of textual
                    interpretation for understanding the constantly shifting grounds of pleasure,
                    knowledge, and action. It is a conceptual tool for thinking about how a
                    “literary” text from the turn of the nineteenth century may want to be read as a
                    kind of historical document, but also as a document of recognition, of
                    comprehension from the readers’ remove, from the present in which it is expected
                    to do its work. Under the changing circumstances for the work of representation,
                    what does “Romanticism” offer readers to be curious, if not excited, about? Of
                    Wordsworth’s “The Thorn,” one student writes, <quote>
                The first point that the writer wants us to understand, is that the place where
                    this thorn is located is hard to reach/find. It says “high on a mountain’s
                    highest ridge, where oft the stormy winter gale cuts like a scythe.” From this
                    we gather that we would have to climb a mountain and risk the heavy stormy winds
                    to get to this place, but we have no idea why we would want to reach this place.
                    The constant descriptions of this place without giving us a reason as to why we
                    would want to know this is a good way to keep the reader engaged. It pulls you
                    in. (unpublished essay)</quote>
                To let oneself be led to a strange place can be pedagogically depressing, in that
                    the teacher may be inviting the students to perform self-annihilating tasks.
                    What is a “good” student to read into Burke’s response to the French Revolution
                    immediately after reading Williams? Are students to learn how to take on his
                    knowing position on what is good for all the decent people? Can a “good” student
                    find unacceptable the arguments of an assigned canonical writer who now seems
                    prescient about how badly prepared everybody was for radical change? The little
                    patience and plenty of discomfort students have upon reading Wordsworth’s
                    “Michael” has to do not just with the poetic form the suffering takes (Too long!
                    Set too far off in the country!), but also with the conditions in which the
                    tragedy in the poem appears to them neither too complex nor particularly moving.
                    They are bored with the narrative about a young man chewed up by the great wide
                    world, his tragedy clearly not theirs. Indeed, they are lost on the newness of
                    the then-greatness of the world, in which change is already inevitable and
                    occasionally eats its own children. They are out to get chewed up better, the
                    post-revolutionary beneficiaries of transparency. That the poet should try to
                    bring up the case is not interesting, not now, and this is not what the poet’s
                    work is.</p>
                  <p>But what is a poet’s work? In response to the discussion of the Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, one student wanted the class to watch
                    videos of performances by spoken word artists whose work, the class agreed,
                    could be understood as a kind of legacy of the work begun by Wordsworth and
                    Coleridge, an afterlife of Romanticism. Most of these are videos recorded at
                    regular gatherings in the Bronx, the place, as Marshall Berman pointed out,
                    where much that is solid has been known to melt into air. They draw a crowd of
                    New Yorkers in their late teens and early twenties, mostly people of color for
                    whom these are social and political events. The events’ political momentum
                    derives from the attention they give to language and poetic form—to the
                    speakers’ and listeners’ appreciation of rhythm and delivery—as living forces
                    that intervene in the common ways of thinking about the relationship between
                    “individuals” and “society.” The artists—individuals—speak on behalf of other
                    individuals, the young people in the audience, physical and virtual, and any
                    imagined occupying comparable subjective positions and recognizing their
                    personal narratives in the ones performed on stage.<title rend="endnote_reference">

                        students relate to or constitute “society.”</title>
                  </p>
                  <p>The relevance of these events to our class has to do with their manifestly
                    Romantic (and romantic) commitment to giving living form to the political and
                    poetic premises of the performed texts. The draw of the events for those who
                    attend is the possibility that this use of language is a relevant kind of
                    engagement with the emergency facing all who aspire to change their individual
                    circumstances against the emergent knowledge that structural pressure makes any
                    meaningful change implausible and impossible. The most moving to all in class
                    was a piece called “Strive!”—an injunction to persist in believing in the
                    promises the great society makes to its young and unconnected who find
                    themselves facing ubiquitous obstacles to self-realization. Being at the event,
                    performing and appreciating the performance (in the physical or virtual space),
                    serves to galvanize the resolve of everyone present (voiced by the speakers on
                    behalf of the audience) not to succumb to evident and pervasive pessimism.
                    Alternatively, or additionally, the point is to perform an affirmation of one’s
                    awareness that there is a place from which to assess one’s position, that the
                    work of improvement is underway, that those sharing the space are not losing
                    their sight of it. Going back to the events is a form of productive action—a
                    signal that someone is taking stock of everyone’s commitments to the future,
                    rather than cultivating a singular fantasy about the promises tendered.</p>
                  <p>Brought into the college classroom, these events are no longer obscure or
                    “subcultural” in the same way. They are contemporary echoes that make room for
                    reading students’ experience of frustration with responses to their impossible
                    demands. A sustained reading of long-nineteenth-century texts about revolution
                    becomes a discussion about the relationship of the students’ present to the
                    history of disappointments and failures of partially shared visions of
                    liberation and justice. It is a huge disappointment and relief to a constituency
                    of mostly first-generation college students, children of the working poor and
                    first-generation immigrants to think that the philosophical, ideological, and
                    political questions of “speculative philosophers,” poets, and reactionaries of
                    the Romantic period look for answers in our own day, and that we may be asking
                    them. The old texts may suggest that history cannot and should not repeat
                    itself, but they also make it possible to think that these are—that the course
                    is set in—revolutionary times.</p>
                  <p>So we practice making impossible demands. The course creates a cycle of hope
                    about the prospect of acting freely, on the ideals that make the teaching
                    situation possible. We speak as if we knew what place the classroom took in the
                    larger political process; we say the processes of change are unstoppable and
                    indispensable. We also say our goals are so ambitious that none of us can ever
                    hope to see them realized: the work is unfinished but also unfinishable.
                    Students begin to see themselves as beneficiaries and dupes of the pedagogical
                    relationship, offered the inexorable pleasures of learning about the capacity of
                    their position by a teacher whose work it is to point to the limitations and
                    disappointments of their potential. They loved reading P. B. Shelley’s <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title>: did not mind the length, or the
                    style, and certainly were deeply moved by its conviction about the significance
                    to “the world” of language as an art form. When I asked whether they would
                    qualify it as a manifesto or a blueprint for action, a “good” student said, “I
                    knew you would say that!” </p>
                  <p>This is a class about the bind in which we have to believe in action because we
                    have no choice but to act, although we know not exactly how or what for. In the
                    older languages of change, the class learns to hear in the call for revolution
                    not just promises of progress, but also promises of displacement, malaise,
                    anxiety, and uncertainty. Participation in such cycles of reading of one
                    another, and the reading of texts, makes room for the possibility that we are in
                    the middle of the process that Raymond Williams was right to call, in the first
                    reading on our schedule, a “long revolution,”<note place="foot"> Williams
                        comments that the title of his text is taken from a sentence in his earlier
                        book, <title level="m">Culture and Society, 1780–1950, </title>but in the
                        Introduction to <title level="m">The Long Revolution </title>explains
                        specifically that it “seems” to him that “we are living through a long
                        revolution, which our best descriptions only in part interpret. It is a
                        genuine revolution, transforming men and institutions; continually extended
                        and deepened by the actions of millions, continually and variously opposed
                        by explicit reaction and by the pressure of habitual forms and ideas”
                        (10).</note> a complex condition of which repetitive “failure” is a
                    constitutive element. Our narratives of failure are not tales of singular and
                    private blockage in a depressive state from which students need to be
                    extricated; in fact, the teacher could never be saved from it herself, let alone
                    save anyone else. It is rather a class on the possibility that exhilaration or
                    failure may not be anyone’s own, but rather a function of what Lauren Berlant
                    has called the “cruel optimism” of (especially contemporary) political
                    imagination, ruled by the “relation of attachment to compromised conditions of
                    possibility” (21). That the possibilities are compromised is depressing news,
                    and students shift around the point at which they think they heard it. The class
                    about revolution lets them say that this was not the first time they found
                    themselves in that strange place. Students who have spoken to me outside of
                    class and come to office hours put their questions about the work in a telling
                    form. They tend to ask me, “What do you do with yourself now?” The question is
                    of course about what they should do with themselves now, and the best I know how
                    to say is that this is all we ever do: know of the depressing future and still
                    demand to see great things. </p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">In this essay, I relate my experience of teaching an
                    upper-division class on romantic poetry—my struggles, assumptions and
                    discoveries, and my ultimate decision to revise the way I teach, and to some
                    extend think about, romanticism. The problem—the contemporary/romantic
                    opposition (the topic of this volume of essays)—turned out to be a pedagogical
                    and critical opportunity. It also became a way for my students and me to think
                    and talk about an even deeper split, the schism between the values of our
                    contemporary culture (including the culture of an increasingly professionalized
                    and professionalizing academia) and those of an “aesthetic education.” In what
                    follows, I give firsthand reports about what worked and what didn’t in a class
                    that came to be called “Repetitions of the Romantic,” an engagement with
                    romantic and post-romantic art. Along the way, I address some methodological
                    problems, and offer some reflections on the fragility of teaching the humanities

                    challenges and benefits of teaching the romantic within specific contexts, in my
                    case within the economic and social micro-culture of central Ohio. </p>

                  <p>I teach at a small regional campus of a large state institution in the
                        Midwest. Many of my students are first generation college students. As the
                        resident romanticist<note place="foot">In this essay, I have consciously
                            decided (with the support of the editors of RCPC) to break with
                            convention and de-captitalize the “romantic” and “romanticism.” My
                            reason for doing so is in order to foreground the everydayness and
                            demotic character of the romantic as I see it, as well as to suggest its
                            dialectical and iterative (but not trans-historical) nature. It recurs
                            at/as different moments, assuming a different character but bringing
                            with it an immanent challenge to existing orders and structures.
                        </note>, part of my job is to teach the upper-division romantic poetry
                        seminar. I initially looked forward to this with tremendous relish—what
                        could be better, I thought, than reading and teaching Byron, Hemans,
                        Coleridge, and Keats? </p>
                  <p>The first time I taught the course I discovered to my dismay a look of
                        blankness on the faces of many of my students. With our books open to “Mont
                        Blanc” or “Ruined Cottage,” there seemed to be a disconnect between what I
                        knew to be the pleasures of this poetry and the bewilderment and
                        disaffection my students seemed to be experiencing. Having taught some of
                        these same students in my “intro to poetry,” twentieth-century poetry, or
                        Brit-lit survey classes I knew many of them to be bright, inquisitive, and
                        able to associate and analogize across different discursive realms and
                        between periods and media. So I was puzzled. I did what I often do when a
                        class is not going well (it never works but I do it anyway)—I tried harder.
                        I gave them bits of historical and cultural background, for which they
                        seemed grateful, but a handout or even a half-hour lecture about the Corn
                        Laws or Burke’s theory of the sublime could not do the work of enlivening
                        these texts for these particular readers. In any case, we muddled through. </p>
                  <p>It wasn’t that my students couldn’t “read” the texts. It was, in part, that
                        they couldn’t recognize themselves, much less their own social, cultural,
                        and political situations, in the material. On a theoretical level, I knew
                        this inability to identify could have certain advantages: what would it be
                        like to read against the grain of “identity” and the “self?” But this was
                        all too philosophical and general. I had—perhaps we have—a real problem. It
                        wasn’t so much that my students felt alienated from Coleridge and Keats.
                        Rather it was that they found Coleridge and Keats, and especially
                        Wordsworth, irrelevant. On some level I had to entertain the possibility
                        that, at least for these students, these thinkers were in fact irrelevant.
                        It seemed to me that only through keeping open the possibility of the
                        irrelevance of these texts could we possibly hope to discover, recover, or
                        reactivate in them something meaningful for us in the moment. Hegel calls
                        this commitment to doubt and despair “the education of consciousness” (50).
                        The pertinence of these questions seem immediate and clear, not only as
                        someone who teaches the long nineteenth century, but also for all of us who
                        teach in the humanities.</p>

                  <head>Interlude on method #1</head>
                  <p>Because, I imagine like you, I am committed (through experience,
                            disposition, as well as through employment) to the continual
                            possibilities of an aesthetic education, I did not want to believe that
                            the powers of these Romantic-era texts were exhausted. But neither could
                            I believe that my students were entirely at fault in their ambivalence.
                            Having trained as a romanticist, and therefore having a part of my
                            professional and personal identity invested in these texts, I could not
                            help but be defensive. But I did my best to be open and curious about my
                            students’ reactions. Keats and Blake could defend themselves. Besides, I
                            thought, maybe it’s time to stop defending our poets. Perhaps the
                            backlash against the “hermeneutics of suspicion” has left us (yet again)
                            too identified with writers that we write on and teach.</p>
                  <p>In any case, the experience of teaching at my campus has convinced me
                            of the rightness of Gayatri Spivak’s claim that as teachers we “‘learn
                            to learn’ . . . how to teach from the historic-cultural text
                            within which a certain group of students might be placed” (9). In other
                            words, the students themselves provide an essential intertext (their
                            lives, their experiences, their varied frames of reference), without
                            which the primary texts in the classroom cannot live; they cannot
                            complete the (always incomplete) circuit from reader to text and back
                            again. We need to create opportunities in the classroom (and perhaps in
                            the curricula) to allow for these connections—not so that students can
                            better “relate,” although that might be the initial experience of the
                            student, but rather so that they can become “critical” and experience
                            the strangeness of their own textuality, not as given selves, but as
                            contingent, multi-determined, and continuously created assemblages of
                            images, ideas, values, and beliefs. Spivak, writing of teaching in
                            subaltern situations, quotes Prabhat Patnaik who writes that we must “go
                            beyond the mere imitation of research agendas set by the established
                            centers of learning . . .” (21). My own intuition is that an
                            aesthetic education in central Ohio today (ditto rural Virginia,
                            Southern Florida, or any number of city and state schools that serve
                            vastly diverse populations) cannot continue to replicate, more or less,
                            received models of liberal arts education. This process cannot, however,
                            be a mattering of “watering down,” but rather of inclusion and
                            listening, not just of and to diverse student populations (although that
                            is an essential element) but of and to the cultural, societal, and
                            economic surround.</p>

                  <p>Reflecting on my dilemma over the summer I came across this quotation from
                        Wallace Stevens, writing in the late 1930s: <quote>. . . the
                            romantic . . . looks like something completely contemptible in
                            the light of literary intellectualism and cynicism. The romantic,
                            however, has a way of renewing itself. It can be said of the romantic,
                            just as it can be said of the imagination, that it can never effectively
                            touch the same thing twice in the same way. It is partly because the
                            romantic will not be what has been romantic in the past that it is
                            preposterous to think of confining poetry hereafter to the revelation of
                            reality. The whole effort of the imagination is toward the production of
                            the romantic.<note place="foot">See also Stevens’
                                    preface to William Carlos Williams’ <title level="m">Collected
                                        Poems, 1921–1931 </title>in which he calls Williams a
                                    “romantic poet.” In a deconstructive turn, Stevens claims that
                                    it is precisely Williams’ “anti-poetic” tenacity, his refusal of
                                    the “accepted sense of things,” that makes him a romantic, in
                                        <title level="m">Opus, </title>255. Stevens would go on to make a similar claim
                                    for “nobility,” that it is a “force,” not its “manifestations.”
                                    Thus although the word and the concept seem belated, it
                                    continues nonetheless to have an effect in the world of the
                                    imagination (“The Noble Rider” 35).
                            </note> (266) </quote> This definition allowed me to conceive of the
                        “romantic” (not “romanticism”—that, for now, I would bracket) more broadly,
                        not just as trans-historical but also as a “self-renewing” repetition,
                        neither repressed nor disavowed but rather as perceptible but
                        not-quite-thought, an aspect of our everyday lives. I decided then to teach
                        the class as a “special topics class”: <title level="m">Repetitions of the
                            Romantic.</title>
                  </p>
                  <p>The course would attempt to locate resonances in romantic and post-romantic
                        art—feelings, forms, thoughts, attitudes, perspectives, and aesthetic
                        practices—that we could, with some justification, call romantic. Having
                        often used other media (MP3 files, movies, essays, image files, etc.) and
                        contemporary materials in the past as a way to elucidate aspects of romantic
                        poetry, I decided to “flip the script.” Rather than treat the contemporary
                        texts as supplemental, ways of connecting students to some deeper
                        understanding of Romantic-era texts, I chose instead to treat all the texts
                        as “primary.” I organized the class around certain structures of feeling
                        that to me seemed likely candidates for the romantic: “affect and emotion”;
                        “ecology and interconnectedness”; “melancholy vs. negative capability”;
                        “ecology and alienation”; “uncanny intimacy”; “the domestic imagination”;
                        “the subject of history”; “immortality and the death drive”; “forms of
                        intoxication”; and so on.</p>
                  <p>The class was small—twelve students—and met once a week in the evening for
                        three hours. Each week we read from a course-pack as well as from a
                            textbook—<title level="m">Poems for the Millennium, Vol. 3: Romantic and
                            Post-Romantic Poetry </title>from the University of California Press.
                        Most weeks there was also a movie or experimental film, seen out of class
                        via the university media server, but with certain scenes reviewed in class. </p>
                  <p> For my part I purposely eschewed, or, at the very least downplayed, the
                        received narratives of romanticism (our “family romance” if you will) such
                        as romanticism’s resistance to enlightenment reason, its ambivalent relation
                        to the French Revolution, its complicity in the partial erasure of its
                        history, etc. Instead, I emphasized the notion of a reciprocal critique, a
                        sense in which contemporary texts could be read not as fuller realizations
                        of Romantic-era texts, but rather as specific instances or expressions
                        within a shared symptomology. I intuited that this reciprocity might reveal
                        strange temporalities and determinations in which Romantic-era texts might
                        be read as “later” and contemporary texts as “earlier,” a topic I explore
                        below. I began each three-hour class having us address the Romantic-era
                        texts assigned for that day. So for example, for the module entitled
                        “uncanny intimacy” we read “Anecdote for Fathers” and “Old Man Traveling” by
                        Wordsworth, and, of course, “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” by Coleridge.
                        After working for ninety minutes or so, we took a short break. When we came
                        back from break we read the post-romantic texts, in this case, two sonnets
                        by Gerard Manley Hopkins from the 1870s, “The Snowman” by Wallace Stevens,
                        ca. 1918, and the film entitled “Northwest Passage,” the pilot episode of
                        the <title level="m">Twin Peaks </title>television series, directed by David
                        Lynch in 1990. When I taught the class again, I alternated the order of
                        readings between Romantic-era and contemporary texts, so that one week we
                        read the romantic texts first and the next week the contemporary, and so on.
                        That way no period is necessarily privileged in terms of its importance. </p>
                  <p> Students were asked to post responses to an online discussion board before
                        each week’s class, a day or two before the class meeting time. Often
                        students struggled to fit their reading of a particular text into the
                        specific topic designation I had given to the class. I hoped at the time
                        that their struggle would be generative, and I now believe that it was. The
                        students for the most part did marvelous associative work. For example, in
                        the module on “Ecology and Interconnectedness” students were making links
                        from the movie <title level="m">Magnolia, </title>to poems by A. R. Ammons
                        and S. T. Coleridge, to the “Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical
                            Ballads</title>,” and finally to a song by rapper Aesop Rock. In some
                        instances, students seem to grasp intuitively the connections, as in the
                        following fragment from a post: <quote> Highly charged with emotion,
                            Magnolia shows interconnectedness amongst humans in a dramatic way,
                            including (mostly) subtle natural events. And while I don’t necessarily
                            agree with all that Wordsworth said of poets in “Preface to Lyrical
                            Ballads,” I do accept that we are connected with nature, [and that] some
                            of us finding more meaning and understanding in a poet’s work than a
                            scientist’s . . .yet all of the other pieces that look at
                            human connection with nature provide quite a different view
                            . . .in fact, our relationship with nature . . .now
                            seems increasingly vulgar. A.R. Ammons gives a wonderful description of
                            the forced and unnatural contributions man has made to our beautiful
                            surroundings and in his work our well-intended endeavors pale in
                            comparison. This also seems to be one of the messages of “Gopher Guts”
                            [the song by Aesop Rock]: we’ve steadily replaced that which was
                            naturally occurring and good with something we thought to be better,
                            screwing things up as we go . . . (Aaron J. Ensman)</quote>
                        What I especially appreciate in this student’s response is its unconscious
                        recapitulation of the message of Wordsworth’s “Lines Written in Early
                        Spring,” a text that was also assigned for the module. In other words, the
                        student discovered for himself—through the engagement with an assortment of
                        romantic and post-romantic texts—an aspect of the romantic. Thus, he
                        articulates in his own language, “what man has made of man.”</p>
                  <p>What is more—and I too must have intuited this rather than conceived this
                        connection since I was only dimly aware of a link when I assigned Wordsworth
                        and Aesop Rock together—Wordsworth’s juxtaposition in “Lines Written in
                        Early Spring” of the movements of birds, leaves, and wind on the one hand
                        and man-made disorder on the other is itself recapitulated (Geoffrey
                        Hartman’s word would be rephrased) in Aesop Rock’s song “Gopher Guts.” In
                        Aesop Rock’s lyric, the intense disconnection and alienation described in
                        the verses is juxtaposed to strangely beautiful scenes of encounters with
                        the natural world in the choruses: <quote>

                        </lg>
                     </quote> Again, for me what matters is not so much that Aesop Rock,
                        like Wordsworth, “must think, do all [he] can” in order to abide if not
                        reconcile the gap between so-called nature and so-called culture, but rather
                        that my student grasps through his own research, his own thinking and
                        feeling, this vital feature of our “increasingly vulgar” relation to our
                        environments. </p>
                  <p>Another student wrote about Aesop Rock’s song as well. She said that she felt
                        compelled to write about it (I allowed students to write about all or one of
                        the texts, so long as they made connections to the larger themes of the
                        module) because she had a “love/hate” relationship to it and wanted to find
                        out why. She found the verses—intensely condensed lyrical raps about human
                        failure—disconcerting and wrote that she had the: <quote> . . .
                            feeling of being disconnected and unable to break through the membrane
                            of meaning at times. Strangely what did translate clearly for me were
                            the hooks [by “hooks” she means the choruses]. The hooks were so weirdly
                            intriguing. Snakes, frogs and crabs being told they are “electric,
                            present, exalted, gallant.” What the hell? This seriously melted my
                            heart. It melted my heart because these beautiful words are coming from
                            the man—the man who is the representation of everything that is
                            disgustedly human, our sweating stinking blood-filled bodies in the
                            garbage heap of a world we have created versus the natural world which
                            is still pure and virtuous. The natural world seems like our only hope
                            to cleanse ourselves/redeem ourselves, although we have to "let them go"
                            to do that because we are the despoiled ones. (Elizabeth Byers
                            Gaubert)</quote> This student, like the previous student, articulates an
                        important aspect of the romantic. While she doesn’t comment on this
                        connection in her response (did she know it?), she seems to recognize Aesop
                        Rock’s perhaps unconscious allusion to “Rime of the Ancient Mariner,”
                        specifically the scene where the Mariner blesses the water snakes
                        “unawares.” This seems especially uncanny since we hadn’t read “Ancient
                        Mariner” in class yet. These types of resonant reversals happened constantly
                        in the class. They seemed to validate T. S. Eliot’s concept of the
                        historical sense (from “Tradition and the Individual Talent,” a text we read
                        in class), in which changes in the aesthetic tradition produce temporal
                        rearrangements in such a way as to allow for the feeling that somehow
                        “Gopher Guts” (ca. 2012) is the progenitor to Coleridge’s 1790’s poem. I
                        take is as more than coincidental that this temporal reversal has deep
                        affinities with the psychoanalytic theory of
                            <foreign>nachtraglikeit</foreign> or re-transcription. If the study of
                        literature requires that we take a position toward the text (that is, toward
                        history), it provides us at once with an understanding that we are ourselves
                        embodied with a past as well as with the imaginative means to take up one or
                        more positions on our history. This seems to me one of the most important
                        aspects of the romantic, namely that our senses (and I would place the
                        unconscious within that sensorial circle) both “half-create” and perceive
                        the “mighty world.” </p>

                  <head>Interlude on Method #2</head>
                  <p>Let me reiterate: I do not believe that our students do not need to be
                        “confirmed” in their positions or tastes (although I believe that all of our
                        students’ positions need to be considered and listened carefully to; they
                        all “make sense” in some way, even if we do not understand them), nor do we
                        need to protect our students from ideas that threaten their beliefs.
                        Spivak’s definition, the “displacement of belief onto the terrain of the
                        imagination,” is as apt a definition of the goal of an aesthetic education
                        as any that I know of (10). Having adopted this as our code, it becomes our
                        responsibility to expose students — and also to be exposed. Mutual
                        contamination is the goal. In this sense, Coleridge’s “Rime of the Ancient
                        Mariner” can serve as a model. In the pedagogical poetics I have in mind
                        teacher and student take turns being alternately mariner and wedding guest,
                        infector and infected, traumatized and wiser.</p>
                  <p>Meeting the students where they are is only the first step. My sense is that
                        many if not most of my students arrive in my classroom “pre-critical.”<note place="foot">I am borrowing here a concept from psychoanalytic theory,
                            namely that certain people show up for treatment pre-analytical, not yet
                            ready to be analyzed. More and more, post-classical psychoanalysis
                            strives to include these people, working with them with mixed modalities
                            until they are ready for analysis proper. See Shuren.</note>They think
                        that reading and writing at the university level is primarily an issue of
                        solving a puzzle, getting pieces (themes, forms, ideas, emotions) into the
                        proper arrangement. As teachers in the humanities we know that no text ever
                        stays put for long and that the work of reading and writing is not always to
                        offer interpretations at all, but rather to ask questions. It is my belief
                        that we cannot ask students to do this kind of critical work all at once.
                        The work of criticism requires an openness (about the text and the so-called
                        self) that is not easy for anyone. Furthermore, it requires a sense of
                        security and support (emotional, psychic, and yes, economic) that our
                        current anxiety-riddled academic culture is less and less inclined or able
                        to provide. Absent a wholesale resurgence of support for and revaluation of
                        the humanities, it seems to me that moving students from pre-critical
                        reading to critical engagement is easier when they are offered seemingly
                        more “familiar” texts, genres, and media. It short-circuits at least some of
                        the natural defensiveness.</p>
                  <p>If Wallace Stevens and William Wordsworth are correct and the goal of the
                        poet is to help people to live more fuller and richer lives, then, in an
                        increasingly global and glutted world, an aesthetic education will have to
                        offer new definitions and conceptions of the romantic.<note place="foot">
                            Noble Rider, Preface to LB.</note>These cannot be top-down or absolute
                        definitions. Students must have an active role in these reformations. Yet
                        this is not a cry for a digital humanities or an alternative (more
                        “democratic”) pedagogy, although both are no doubt necessary; rather it is
                        an argument for awareness and acceptance of how much of our aesthetic
                        experience is already digital and how impossible knowledge production is
                        without the willing co-creation of our students.</p>
                  <p>So why teach romanticism at all? In part, we need the romantic because of our
                        need for self-estrangement and cross-contamination. According to Spivak, one
                        of the greatest disservices done to the subaltern community by European
                        educators is the attempt to keep them culturally pure, robbing them of an
                        awareness of global politics and culture, new cultural and political
                        histories of which they might form a part.<note place="foot"> Spivak,
                            30.</note> In a related way, I worry that if we withhold from some
                        student populations certain texts—Shelley’s “Defence of Poetry” or David
                        Hume’s “Treatise on Human Nature” for example—on the grounds that they are
                        too “difficult,” we rob them of a deeper understanding of a shared, if
                        constantly shifting heritage of aesthetic and political resistance and
                        change. This class has taught me that reading Shelley’s resonant
                        politico-poetics (the “unacknowledged legislators”) in combination with
                        Charles Olson’s re-appropriation of the polis (“polis is this”) and P.O.S.’s
                        re-appropriation of political rap and rock (“I be the new generation of
                        slaves”) gives students a greater (more critical) purchase on the
                        material—helps them, that is, to continue to question—as well as revealing
                        at a deeper level the ways in which the romantic is constantly in motion, in
                        history, in flux.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <p>Looking back, some of the material that I assigned was difficult—“Beyond the
                        Pleasure Principle” for example—and I had to spell out quite precisely what
                        I took to be the connections between the death drive and Wordsworth’s
                        concept of immortality. This does not seem to be a problem for the reasons
                        just mentioned above. Other inter-texts were more favorably and immediately
                        received, and, interestingly, judged to be as or more “romantic” than many
                        of the romantic-era texts we read for the class. Two of the most popular
                        readings for example were Annie Dillard’s essay “A Field of Silence” and
                        Todd Haynes’s movie <title level="m">Safe</title>. Although uniformly
                        pleased with the class, when students were asked at the end of the class
                        what worked and didn’t, many wished that I had provided more of a “road map”
                        of where the class would lead. Perhaps this is a pedagogical problem for all
                        of us—precisely to the degree that I believe I know the shape and arc of a
                        class’s narrative when I begin, to that degree will the ultimate findings of
                        the class seem rehearsed and unremarkable. I intend to offer a bit more
                        scaffolding next time, but I want all of us to feel free to lose our way
                        from time to time with these texts.</p>
                  <p>As “old school” as it may sound, it seems to me that an aesthetic education
                        should be integrative, reaching into all aspects of a students’ lives, not
                        just those areas that can potentially be monetized, although that is an
                        essential component of what we do. Reading and writing romantically might
                        mean engaging the romantic in all of its permutations in such a way that we
                        pay conscious attention to the production and reproduction of all of our
                        experience—surely this is one of the most lasting legacies of the romantic.
                        That is, while I get that an education in the humanities can be, in certain
                        circumstances, ideologically normalizing, I do not see that as an inevitable
                        outcome, especially if students and teachers can co-create environments in
                        which critical engagement with the romantic can happen. Perhaps the
                        shrinking proportion of these classroom environments in the academy, and
                        their seeming erasure in the larger culture, is what drives some students’
                        ambivalent responses to the romantic. By breaking down the barriers between
                        high and low cultures, periods, media, and forms, classes like “Repetitions
                        of the Romantic” and the others described in this collection of essays might
                        recover for us a different legacy, more recursive and responsive, an
                        opportunity to move from the pre-critical to more properly critical,
                        unstable yet pleasurable practices that the romantic has traditionally
                        promised. This last mention of pleasure brings us, of course, back to
                        Wordsworth as well as to Stevens, who agreed absolutely in the necessity of
                        pleasure as the means as well as the end of aesthetic experience.</p>
                  <p>Finally, I confess (I know, how romantic, right?) to a feeling of ambivalence
                        about not teaching more texts from Romantic period in this class. But I feel
                        I must live with this ambivalence, at least for now. My students are
                        engaged, asking meaningful questions, making connections, creating
                        interesting work. Perhaps learning the romantic today involves learning to
                        tolerate our ambivalences, to hear the “thousand blended notes,” learning
                        that is, to listen for patterns in dissonance, in our work, our curricula,
                        and in our students’ lives, in Aesop Rock as well as in Wordsworth, in the
                        lake district as well as in central Ohio. </p>

                  <p>Any discussion of teaching the Romantic with the contemporary will necessarily
                    invite questions about the relative value accorded to each of the literary
                    historical periods being brought into relation. Are we introducing contemporary
                    texts (or debates or images) into our classrooms in order to “sell” Romanticism
                    (to make it appear more relevant; more interesting; more, in our
                    common-but-unfortunate parlance, “sexy”)? And is this type of appeal, arising
                    out of a well-intentioned attempt to maintain a space for Romanticism in our
                    curricula, misguided? (That is, are we merely reinforcing the secondary status
                    we’re attempting to correct for?) Will comparisons between contemporary and
                    Romantic texts always remain superficial? Does a presentist approach to pedagogy
                    depreciate the texts under study by undermining their historical specificity?
                    Might we, on the other hand, be giving the false impression that contemporary
                    phenomena are simply a given and <emph>only</emph> distant historical phenomena
                    are worthy of intensive analysis? I won’t be able to address all of these
                    questions here—not least because I don’t think I have all of the answers to
                    them—but these are the kinds of questions that inform the present essay. </p>
                  <p>I’ve been tempted to call my contribution to this special issue a defense of
                    “relatability”: a persistent pedagogical bugbear that has of late been
                    challenged, to widespread acclaim, in the popular press as well (see Mead and
                    Onion). The idea that literature should be “relatable,” critics argue, is
                    symptomatic of an epidemic of narcissism, evidence of a prevailing cultural
                    aversion to difference. The ubiquity of the selfie (casual but posed
                    self-portraiture, usually shared on social media) is often taken to be
                    emblematic of this millennial penchant for naval-gazing. While I remain
                    ambivalent about the term “relatability,” I have to admit that it’s true: I
                        <emph>am</emph> defending the impulse to relate as a far more complex and
                    generative response than these critics suggest. More importantly, though, I hope
                    to offer an argument toward <emph>using</emph> relatability, especially when
                    teaching the novel (the genre that has, since its emergence in
                    mid-eighteenth-century Britain, been seen as most susceptible to this sort of
                    response). The idea that literary texts (and, more precisely, literary
                    characters) ought to be relatable, ought to respond readily to the advances of
                    readerly identification, does, indeed, pose a pedagogical challenge. I, too,
                    want my students to think about the choices that go into crafting a character
                    and the implicit formal laws by which a character must abide, rather than simply
                    responding to that character as if it were fully human. </p>
                  <p>However, I think this impulse to connect (or to seek connection where it is found
                    lacking) also holds the potential to open up fruitful conversations in the
                    classroom about how we read now (and how they used to read back then). In
                    particular, I aim here to sketch out a series of attempts to use contemporary
                    texts to disrupt students’ assumptions about their emotional and psychological
                    distance from Romantic-era fiction. Rather than dismissing talk of readerly
                    identification, I have attempted to leverage my students’ desire to relate in
                    order to launch a discussion of historical reading practices and the emergence
                    of relatability as a value. To put it another way, I use my classroom as a site
                    for uncovering the prehistory of relatability. These conversations require both
                    careful historicizing and, at the same time, a willingness to remain limber
                    enough to move between kinds of texts, between kinds of attention, and between
                    points in time.</p>
                  <p>My current thoughts on these questions were prompted by an obstacle I encountered
                    while teaching a unit on sentimental reading in my Gothic novel course. My aim
                    in this series of class meetings was to help students connect the sentimental
                    novel to the Gothic as they completed Ann Radcliffe’s <title level="m">The
                        Mysteries of Udolpho </title>(1794) and took up Jane Austen’s <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> (1817). I provided them with background
                    on the culture of sensibility, and we read passages from eighteenth-century
                    letters describing the (for my students, peculiarly) physical response readers
                    had to novels like <title level="m">Clarissa </title>(such as Sarah Fielding’s
                        <title level="m">Remarks on </title>Clarissa [1749]: “Tears without Number
                    have I shed . . .”; or her brother Henry’s letter to Richardson: “I
                    then melt into Compassion, and find what is called an Effeminate Relief for my
                    Terror”). This background reading informed our discussion of Austen’s famous
                    defense of novel reading and, as I argued, its inextricability from an
                    understanding of novel reading as a shared experience. You’re no doubt familiar
                    with Austen’s digression: <quote> if a rainy morning deprived [Catherine and
                        Isabella] of other enjoyments, they were still resolute in meeting in
                        defiance of wet and dirt, and shut themselves up, to read novels together.
                        Yes, novels;—for I will not adopt the ungenerous and impolitic custom so
                        common with novel writers, of degrading by their contemptuous censure the
                        very performances, to the number of which they are themselves adding—joining
                        with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such
                        works, and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine,
                        who, if she accidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over its insipid
                        pages with disgust. (23)</quote> I won’t rehash here the contours of a
                    discussion I’m sure many of my readers have led in their own classrooms, but I
                    will say that the discussion of <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> in my
                    classroom tends to highlight the ways that novel reading as a practice is
                    experienced as both performed and shared—from Catherine and Isabella’s
                    relentlessly annoying, fashionable slang (“[A]re [the novels] all horrid, are
                    you sure they are all horrid?”) to the moment when Eleanor Tilney throws her
                    brother under the bus in Catherine’s presence, outing him as a selfish, solitary
                    reader: “I remember that you undertook to read [<title level="m">The Mysteries
                        of Udolpho</title>] aloud to me, and that when I was called away for only
                    five minutes to answer a note, instead of waiting for me, you took the volume
                    into the Hermitage-walk, and I was obliged to stay till you had finished it”
                    (77). My students and I use these passages (and others) to think about the ways
                    that reading practices are both representative of cultural trends and, at the
                    same time, constitutive of character.</p>
                  <p>While this particular course had gone well up to this point, in this unit I found
                    it difficult to help my students consider the socio-historical specificity of
                    the culture of sensibility without dismissing out of hand the reading practices
                    we were discussing, most of which they found simply bizarre. My students, in a
                    rare united voice, expressed a knowing disdain for the reading practices of the
                    readers and protagonists of Gothic fiction. The complaint concentrated around a
                    claim about unbridgeable historical distance: people just aren’t like that these
                    days (and so, it followed, my students couldn’t be expected to understand these
                    aberrant historical creatures). It seems to me that the choice before me in this
                    kind of moment is between, on the one hand, taking advantage of that historical
                    distance and, on the other, mitigating it. In this particular instance, when
                    what I wanted my students to understand was precisely the collective experience
                    of immersive reading, I chose the latter. </p>
                  <p>Trying to find an analog for these intense—and shared—emotional experiences of
                    literary texts, I came to our next class armed with examples from our
                    contemporary culture: YouTube reaction videos. </p>

                    viewer’s experience of a text (in some cases, a <title level="m">Twilight</title> movie trailer or another fitting example of the
                    neo-Gothic), depicting moments of intense affective response alongside a running
                    narrative of that response provided for the benefit of the reader. Consider the
                    case of Nutty Madam, a devoted “Twi-hard” who posts short videos to discuss the
                        <title level="m">Twilight </title>novels and to react to film trailers,
                    celebrity gossip, or book news. Nutty Madam shrieks, sobs, covers her mouth or
                    her eyes, bounces urgently in anticipation of a particular character’s
                    appearance on screen. She leans in closer to her webcam until her face floods
                    the screen, and then flings herself away from her computer, disappearing from
                    view entirely. She is utterly solitary (never joined by a fellow host) but also
                    affectionately chummy with her viewers, greeting them with an eager “Hiya!” and
                    joining the conversation in the (always lengthy, sometimes nasty) comment
                    threads below. She has, by virtue of her videos, become a minor celebrity; she
                    is invited to film premieres and tasked by various entertainment news outlets
                    with interviewing actors. </p>
                  <p>Invariably, the creators of these reaction videos fill their (and our) screens,
                    their legible facial expressions clearly the main event. In most cases, the
                    viewer does not actually see what the subject is seeing (though in rare cases an
                    inset image displays the clip that is being responded to). Often, however, the
                    videos assume prior knowledge of the clip being viewed by the subject. In other
                    words, the reaction of the subject is more entertaining if the viewer can, on
                    her own, anticipate and then call up the particular images that are eliciting a
                    corresponding response from the subject. In this way, the videos experiment with
                    a kind of asynchronous shared viewing experience, even as the subject draws
                    particular attention and the viewer sharing this experience remains unknown
                    (save for any supplementary interaction in the comments). This shared viewing is
                    complicated further by the fact that the clips to which subjects react are often
                    adaptations; this means that levels of familiarity with the shared text are
                    layered. When watching the reaction to a movie trailer, for example, a viewer
                    may be looking for both the response to the trailer which she has already seen
                    and, at the same time, the response to a depiction that deviates in some way
                    from a representation in the book both she and the subject have previously
                    read.</p>
                  <p>These videos, like the novels we discussed in class, triangulate the experience
                    of readerly interaction in a fascinating—if somewhat unsettling—way. Our
                    viewings led to a lively discussion about the physical performance of affect,
                    about both Romantic and contemporary fandoms (subcultures organized around
                    shared fascinations with a particular cultural phenomenon), and about why
                    certain characters might be more likely to provoke an intense response of
                    identification or revulsion (for more on Romantic fandom, see Eisner; on fandom
                    more broadly, see Jamison). This discussion also led to a serious consideration
                    of how gender expectations figure into our understanding of companionate reading
                    and performed emotion. My students, most of them women, traced some of their own
                    initial distaste to concerns about the performance of affect as the performance
                    of a certain kind of femininity (and, in particular, to a sense that to cry
                    publicly would mean exposing vulnerability). These concerns seemed to be
                    troubled, if not resolved, by the realization that the work of orchestrating and
                    then broadcasting public crying imbricates vulnerability with authority. </p>
                  <p>At my students’ prompting, we looked at other subgenres of reaction videos,
                    including those that documented responses to sports losses or victories (a
                    subject bursts into tears after a winning World Cup goal, the camera squarely
                    focused on his face to capture a live, real-time reaction) and the wildly
                    popular reaction videos showing viewers of the HBO series <title level="m">Game
                        of Thrones</title> (a bar full of subjects scream in horror and peer through
                    their fingers when viewing a particularly grisly scene); many of these reaction
                    videos featured men exhibiting the same intense physical responses we’d already
                    seen (on <title level="m">Game of Thrones</title> reaction videos, see Hudson).
                    Our discussion of gender became more complex as we built our network of examples
                    and then returned to the novel. (As if to provide additional fodder for this
                    unit, Stephenie Meyer has since published a gender-swapped “reimagining” of
                        <title level="m">Twilight</title>, a reengagement with her own source
                    material that we might think of as a kind of self-reflexive fan fiction.)</p>
                  <p>I want to stress that the obstacle I encountered in teaching my students about
                    the culture of sentiment was not that students too eagerly invested themselves
                    in these characters and their lives. Rather (and, I think, typically), they
                    were, at first, quite sure that these texts were alien to them, to the point of
                    presumed unknowability. To help them explore their own reactions, I didn’t just
                    present them with evidence that these characters <emph>were</emph> in fact
                    relatable (by showing how those characters were <emph>like</emph> characters my
                    students expressed more comfort sympathizing with). Instead, we looked at
                    contemporary texts that tend <emph>also</emph> to seem strange or unknowable,
                    texts that may be familiar by virtue of their recognizable allusions or
                    reference points, but that, for many of my students, still inspired feelings of
                    unease or even disapproval. Indeed, I’m dubious of the idea that using
                    contemporary texts is only useful as a kind of incentive to coax students to
                    read texts about which they would otherwise voice reluctance (a carrot to lead
                    them ever further into the past). While many of my (in this case, mostly young
                    and female) students were still ready to hold the (again, mostly, though not
                    only, young and female) YouTube hosts in contempt, this response started to
                    break down over the course of our discussion, and started to become a curious
                    (but productive) blend of critical engagement and empathy. I know I’m far from
                    alone in making these kinds of connections. In a brilliant essay, “Our Bella,
                    Ourselves,” Sarah Blackwood has written of the resistance she met with when
                    teaching another late-eighteenth century sentimental novel, <title level="m">Charlotte Temple</title> (1791): her students “complain that all Charlotte
                    does is swoon and cry. She isn’t ‘a strong heroine’ they protest.” Blackwood
                    likewise sees the <title level="m">Twilight</title> Saga as a way to invigorate
                    often difficult class discussions: “to revitalize a number of our larger
                    conversations about feminism, especially those related to sex, pregnancy,
                    desire, and autonomy.” This investigation is possible not because her students
                    would rather talk about <title level="m">Twilight</title> than <title level="m">Charlotte Temple</title>, but because her students reject <title level="m">Twilight</title> for the same reasons they reject <title level="m">Charlotte Temple.</title> The juxtaposition helps them (and us) start to
                    think about why.</p>

                  <p>Building on our conversation about reaction videos, I also showed students this
                    caricature of two young women reading together in a vis-à-vis carriage. In doing
                    so, I quite pointedly wrested the image from its historical context. (The
                    caricature is poking fun at fashionability more than it is demonstrating
                    companionate reading.) One serendipitous visual effect is that the young ladies’
                    letters look (at least to me and to my students) startlingly like our modern
                    electronic devices; like passengers on the Subway, they aren’t, as the name of
                    their conveyance would otherwise suggest, “face-to-face” but staring down,
                    intent on their reading. The time warp of the image is immediately suggestive;
                    the figures in the image seem both of their time and alarmingly familiar. That
                    hunch, that stare are a part of our own muscle memory. This familiarizing effect
                    allows the image to raise questions about our own habits of media consumption:
                    Can immersion coexist with shared intimacy? When we stare at screens, do we
                    necessarily shut out those around us? And what of the intimacy we share with
                    those we encounter on the screen (or on the page)? A similar effect is produced
                    by the work of digital artist Kim Dong-Kyu, whose “When You See an Amazing
                    Sight”—featured at the beginning of this essay—wrenches perhaps the most clichéd
                    image of the Romantic sublime into a commentary on our modern tendency to
                    document rather than experience. The commentary, like the discussions I try to
                    have in my classes, raises questions about just how different our contemporary
                    phenomenology might be: was the Romantic sublime ever <emph>purely</emph>
                    experienced? Or are paintings like Friedrich’s (and, we might add, poems like
                    Shelley’s or essays like Burke’s) analogous at all to our Facebook posts? Was
                    the Claude glass an Instagram filter? What difference does the immediacy of
                    (iPhone) photography make to the registration of aesthetic experience? Can we
                    constantly document our lives and still “recollect in tranquility”? (I’m
                    reminded of my beloved high school English teacher’s story of her visit to
                    Tintern Abbey: She gasped upon seeing the abbey on her first trip outside of the
                    US, dropping her camera and breaking it beyond repair. In tears, she comforted
                    herself by repeating, “It’s what Wordsworth would have wanted. It’s what
                    Wordsworth would have wanted.”) As I hope these questions suggest, it’s crucial
                    for me to bring these texts into conversation with each other in order to
                    provoke a discussion of <emph>both</emph> the Romantic texts and the
                    contemporary phenomena. It’s all too easy to fall into what Ted Underwood has
                    called, in his valuable discussion of using pop lyrics in the classroom, “the
                    naïve assumption that popular culture is absorbed directly by the ears, and that
                    only high culture has to be mediated through the analytic intelligence” (12).
                    These discussions only work, in my experience, if my students and I are invested
                    together in examining our own practices along with those of the historical
                    figures we’re studying. </p>
                  <p>While I would contend that these kinds of metacritical discussions could be
                    valuable in a variety of classes, courses in Romantic fiction are uniquely
                    situated to explore the complexity of students’ responses to fictional
                    character. This is because, as Deidre Shauna Lynch has shown, “It is
                    romantic-period characters who first succeed in prompting their readers to
                    conceive of them as beings who take on lives of their own and who thereby escape
                    their social as well as their textual contexts” (8). Lynch makes clear that
                    Romantic fiction mobilized a complex response to literary character that can’t
                    simply be summed up with the term “identification” or “relatability”:<quote>
                        <emph>Identification</emph>, the modern term for what we do with characters
                        . . . . obscures the historical specificity, the relative novelty,
                        of our codes of reading. With the beginnings of the late eighteenth
                        century’s ‘affective revolution’ and the advent of new linkages between
                        novel reading, moral training, and self-culture, character reading was
                        reinvented as an occasion when readers found themselves and plumbed their
                        own interior resources of sensibility by plumbing characters’ hidden depths.
                        (10)</quote> Lynch is certainly right to encourage us to develop more
                    specificity when exploring the historical dimensions of character in our
                    scholarship. At the same time, it’s clear that “identification” and
                    “relatability” <emph>are</emph>, however diluted, part of the legacy of this
                    Romantic revolution in the long history of reading. For that reason alone, it’s
                    worth reconsidering their role in our classrooms.</p>
                  <p>We take a risk when we assume that students are just trying to relate to
                    everything and are eliding differences along the way. So much of what I expose
                    my students to is unknown to them. Why rob them of what isn’t? Relatability, as
                    I see it, isn’t a way for them to dig out; it’s a way for them to get in. We can
                    all relate (sorry!) to Michael Warner’s characterization of his classroom:
                    “Students who come to my literature classes, I find, read in all the ways they
                    aren’t supposed to. They identify with characters” (13). But Warner’s argument
                    is that we can only figure out what we mean by “critical reading” if we allow
                    ourselves to consider it as always bound up in relation to its uncritical other.
                    I share with critics of relatability a frustration with inert critical
                    responses—the sort that shut down or close off analysis rather than encouraging
                    it. But I’m less convinced that “relatable” is more disposed to this kind of
                    danger than any other initial response to literary fiction. In fact, in my
                    experience, relatable (and, crucially, the kinds of probing questions that it
                    necessarily prompts) holds particular potential to compel students to trace
                    their responses back to their textual causes, to think through the intricacy of
                    their connections to Romantic texts. To scrub the term from our classrooms is to
                    foreclose serious discussions of the complex work that goes into (and has long
                    gone into) novel reading. </p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">In Romantic Era Feminism, students engage in deep and broad
                    learning about the 18th and 19th centuries’ intellectual and cultural legacy,
                    and its continuing presence in 20th and 21st century feminism. Among others,
                    Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Hays, William Godwin and John Stuart Mill are studied
                    alongside Malala Yousafzai, Azar Nafisi, Tatyana Fazlalizadeh, Jessica Valenti
                    and The Young Lords Party’s “Position Paper on Women”; “The Saudi Women
                    Revolution Statement” is read with “The Declaration of Independence” and
                    “Declaration of the United Irishmen”; Rush Limbaugh is heard echoing Richard
                    Polwhele, and Daryush Valizadeh, Rousseau. This dialogue between 18th - and 19th
                    -century feminist and anti-feminist texts, and 20th - and 21st -century ones
                    launches students’ exploration into three areas: 1) the cultural and
                    intellectual history of feminism since the Romantic era; 2) the feminist
                    implications 18th- and 19th- century political discourse, and the arguments used
                    then and now either to support or to suppress those implications; 3) the range
                    and diversity of feminist positions within and across generations, and the role
                    of class, race, and historical context in expanding or limiting the literary and
                    political imaginations of feminists in all eras, including our own. Students
                    also study the lives and works of individual writers, and their intellectual
                    influence on one another; the intersections of abolitionist or anti-racist with
                    feminist imagery, discourse, arguments and action; the second and third waves’
                    rediscovery, reinvention and revision of earlier feminist critiques of unequal
                    marriage laws, the sexual double standard, employment discrimination and similar
                    issues; and the utility of diverse literary genres for presenting these topics
                    richly and persuasively. Most importantly, by learning that the Romantics are
                    indeed our contemporaries, and by critically examining the assumptions we still
                    share with them, students become more self-conscious, better informed, and more
                    effective participants in the continuously ongoing cultural construction and
                    critique of gender and human rights discourses. </p>

                  <p>ENLT 384: Romantic Era Feminism teaches eighteenth-, nineteenth-, twentieth- and
                    twenty-first-century texts together to show feminism’s roots in Romantic-era
                    human rights discourse and its growth into our current historical moment. My
                    approach is influenced by the second wave insight that political and personal
                    power structures reinforce one another, so I encourage students to observe these
                    structures closely in all contexts, including their own power insofar as they
                    may be privileged relative to others. Although my course is designed to
                    cultivate understandings of Romantic continuities in contemporary feminist and
                    anti-feminist arguments, its method of pairing Romantic-era texts with
                    twentieth- and twenty-first-century ones would work equally well for courses
                    focused on race and civil rights, separation of church and state, and similar
                    topics whose current terms of debate reflect the declarations, constitutions and
                    manifestos of Romantic revolutionary governments and movements.</p>
                  <p>We study the lives and works of selected Romantic-era writers, and their
                    influence on one another; the continuities and discontinuities of arguments for
                    and against women’s rights from the eighteenth century to the present; the
                    diversity of feminist positions within and across historical periods; how social
                    context and political expediency (as well as class, race and culture) shape,
                    expand or limit the feminist imagination in every era; and how both feminist and
                    anti-feminist authors use a range of genres (fiction, poetry, polemic, essay,
                    manifesto, etc.) to engage readers with their constructions of gender at various
                    levels of understanding and action, that is, empathetically, critically,
                    philosophically, politically. In addition to acquiring such knowledge, I want
                    students to learn the habit of critically analyzing their own political location
                    in history, as well as their personal responses to feminist questions. Assuming
                    that public citizenship begins in private life, I encourage students to observe
                    and reflect on their own lives, so that their political and personal
                    perspectives are thoughtfully integrated and mutually informed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">Course Description</title>: Although eighteenth-century
                    advocates for women did not call themselves “feminists,” their vindications of
                    the rights of woman have informed all subsequent “waves.” Sometimes aligning
                    themselves with parallel movements for democratic government or the abolition of
                    slavery, Romantic-era feminists asserted women’s social, intellectual and
                    spiritual equality even when they did not argue for equal legal rights. We start
                    with Jane Austen’s <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> to locate
                    middle-class Romantic-era Englishwomen in their time and place. We then study
                    Mary Wollstonecraft, whose work and life exemplify persistent tensions between
                    “sense” and “sensibility” in feminist discourse and feminine experience. Shorter
                    works by contemporaries Hannah More, Helen Maria Williams, Mary Hays and others
                    demonstrate the range and variety of British Romantic-era feminist voices. We
                    then listen for their influence in the voices of the next generation, both
                    British and American, including Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Sojourner Truth,
                    Caroline Norton, and Harriet Taylor Mill. William Godwin and John Stuart Mill,
                    among others, affirm the historical continuity of feminist male allies.
                    Throughout the course, we read complementary twentieth- and twenty-first-century
                    texts, recognizing familiar arguments while also discovering new ones that may
                    help to resolve earlier arguments’ flawed premises or inconsistencies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">Texts</title>: The Oxford World Classics <title level="m">Sense
                        and Sensibility</title>, introduced by Margaret Doody, is required, along
                    with Anne Mellor’s edition of<title level="m"> A Vindication of the Rights of
                        Woman and The Wrongs of Woman, or Maria</title>; Pamela Clemit and Gina
                    Luria Walker’s <title level="m">Memoirs of the Author of “A Vindication of the
                        Rights of Woman”</title> by William Godwin; and Eleanor Ty’s <title level="m">The Victim of Prejudice</title> by Mary Hays. <title level="m">Before Victoria: Extraordinary Women of the British Romantic Era</title>,
                    by Elizabeth Campbell Denlinger, is optional but highly recommended because its
                    well-chosen visual resources and engaging short biographies of Mary Robinson and
                    others represent the broad extent of contemporary women’s involvement in arts,
                    literature and politics. I select additional short readings from the Longman,
                    Norton and Broadview anthologies of British and American literature, as well as
                        <title level="m">The Norton Anthology of Literature by Women</title>. For
                    historical documents, such as Olympe de Gouges’ 1791 Declaration of the Rights
                    of Woman and Citizen, Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s 1848 Declaration of Sentiments,
                    and Edith M. Stern’s 1949 “Women Are Household Slaves,” I rely on three
                    collections: <title level="m">The French Revolution and Human Rights: A Brief
                        Documentary History</title>, edited by Lynn Hunt; <title level="m">The
                        American Women’s Movement, 1945-2000: A Brief History with
                    Documents</title>, edited by Nancy MacLean; and <title level="m">Women, the
                        Family and Freedom: The Debate in Documents, Volume One, 1750–1880</title>,
                    edited by Susan Groag Bell and Karen M. Offen. </p>
                  <p>From the wealth of additional editions, anthologies and electronic databases of
                    eighteenth- and nineteenth-century women writers now available, a few I find
                    especially helpful are Moira Ferguson’s <title level="m">First
                        Feminists,</title> a comprehensive collection, knowledgably contextualized.
                    It could serve well as a required textbook for a course like this one, as could
                        <title level="m">Transatlantic Feminisms in the Age of Revolutions</title>,
                    edited by Lisa L. Moore, Joanna Brooks and Caroline Wigginton. Carolyn
                    Christensen Nelson’s <title level="m">Literature of the Women’s Suffrage
                        Campaign in England</title> thoroughly represents mid- to late-Victorian
                    arguments on both sides of the question. Stephen Behrendt’s electronic databases
                    broadly illuminate the poetic range of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Irish
                    and Scottish women writers<title rend="color(262626)">. </title>

                  <p>Clear thinking and insightful writing are born in accurate reading, so the first
                    paper is a close reading exercise. I introduce close reading by focusing one
                    class discussion on a few paragraphs of <title level="m">Sense and
                        Sensibility</title>, asking questions designed to elicit thorough scrutiny
                    of Marianne Dashwood’s first encounter with John Willoughby. This proves
                    worthwhile even for senior English majors because the many students who have
                    seen Emma Thompson’s film adaptation tend to read <title level="m">Sense and
                        Sensibility</title> through a glamorizing cinematic mist that obscures
                    Austen’s irony. It is therefore especially helpful to draw attention to the
                    deflating or foreboding implications of words, images, and pointed repetitions.
                    Students’ heavily OED-informed papers examine similarly rich short passages from
                    the novel, and this work immediately improves students’ accuracy and insight as
                    classroom discussants. It also keeps their subsequent writing closely
                    accountable to texts. </p>
                  <p>To guide students from reading literary texts accurately to reflecting on their
                    own lives analytically, I invite but don’t require them to write personal
                    reflections. Prompts for thinking and writing analytically about both text and
                    self appear in daily study questions, such as “What did ‘sensibility’ mean to
                    Austen’s readers? How does Austen describe and criticize Marianne’s performance
                    of sensibility? What personal values and political statements does this
                    self-presentation style assert or imply? How would you characterize your own
                    style and its statements?” I also invite students to write extra credit personal
                    responses when—as frequently happens—classroom discussion evokes strong emotions
                    or vivid, real-life parallels. But students who prefer not to write personally
                    always have the choice to write literary analysis only.</p>
                  <p>How do I assess personal writing? I don’t assess students’ experiences or
                    emotions. Although occasionally a student’s personal experience is such that it
                    would be inhumanely “professional” not to express direct sympathy, empathy and
                    support, I generally try not to remark directly on experiences or feelings,
                    focusing instead on the accurate observation and analytic thinking I want
                    students to cultivate and practice. Competitive pressure and performance anxiety
                    are incompatible with self-honesty, another good reason to keep comments on
                    personal reflections descriptive and responsive rather than evaluative: “I’m
                    impressed by how thoroughly you analyze this incident, considering more than one
                    motive for your antagonist’s behavior.” Most personal essay prompts require
                    students to do more than write about their own experiences and feelings, though;
                    they must also define an issue and accurately analyze a text in relation to that
                    issue, as well as reflect personally. For example, one prompt asks, “What sexual
                    propriety rules seem important in Austen’s novel? Are there different rules for
                    women and men? How are they enforced and how do they affect both men’s and
                    women’s sexual self-expression? Are the rules in your own milieu similar or
                    different? Do similar constructions of gender support both sets of rules? Have
                    any rules changed in response to changing constructions of gender?” The clarity
                    of a student’s definition of “sexual propriety rules” and the accuracy of her
                    analysis of Austen’s portrayal of those rules can be assessed objectively
                    relative to other students’ work. In narratives of personal experience, though,
                    intellectual errors such as false assumptions or shallow analyses cannot be
                    touched on directly without bruising a vulnerably exposed psyche, and yet such
                    errors must be addressed. Students seem to respond best to “criticism” in the
                    form of friendly questions that suggest alternative assumptions and/or encourage
                    deeper thinking, such as “Have you considered whether their assumptions about
                    gender roles may have influenced the expectations each party brought to this
                    encounter?” </p>
                  <p>Their third paper, a “gender-focused polemic,” may be an essay in gender-focused
                    protest or advocacy on a topic of their choice, or a polemic within feminist or
                    queer discourse about equal rights and gender—that is, a criticism, revision or
                    refinement of someone else’s feminist or queer argument. Moira Ferguson’s
                    introduction to <title level="m">First Feminists</title> includes a discussion
                    of feminist polemic subgenres that helpfully guides students both in analyzing
                    polemics they read and in crafting their own. </p>
                  <p>The last paper, a literary analysis, has three letter-graded stages—pre-writing,
                    draft, and final version. Students must analyze how an eighteenth- or
                    nineteenth-century texts applies a term such as “rights,” “reason,” “authority,”
                    “equality,” and “consent” to the situation of women. In other words, their task
                    is to immerse themselves in the feminist implications of a specific Romantic-era
                    political idea and to observe how those implications are developed in the text.
                    My task is to help them emerge from that immersion with a clearly focused,
                    substantive thesis, logically argued and convincingly developed.</p>
                  <p>In the final oral presentation, students bring one or more Romantic-era
                    writer(s)’ arguments to bear on a current women’s issue, articulating how the
                    eighteenth- or nineteenth-century writer(s)’ insights may shed light on the
                    current problem, and/or how those eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
                    perspectives may be limited by circumstances that have changed or by assumptions
                    we no longer accept. This project tests two things: 1) students’ understanding
                    of the Romantic-era writer(s) they have studied, and 2) their ability to
                    abstract the assumptions and methods of a feminist analysis of one problem, and
                    then to apply or adapt those assumptions and that method to analyzing a
                    different problem, or the same problem in a different social context. For
                    example, one student researched street harassment, a current problem that is
                    also addressed in <title level="m">The Victim of Prejudice</title> and <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title>. Her research led her
                    to Hollaback, among other web and print resources, and her report analyzed
                    Hays’, Wollstonecraft’s, Hollaback’s and Tatyana Fazlalizadeh’s differing
                    explanations and solutions to the problem of street harassment. Another student
                    compared nineteenth-century rhetoric for and against English and American
                    women’s suffrage with current rhetoric for and against Saudi women’s right to
                    drive. </p>
                  <p>After the focused research of these last two projects, the take-home final
                    examination encourages more speculative thinking, such as, “Reflect on theory
                    and action in your own political life: is there any compromise, means or
                    rhetoric that you would not use in your own active citizenship, even if it were
                    likely to advance your cause? Give an example from one of our texts or class
                    discussions. Explain what’s wrong with the example and why your conscience can’t
                    accept its strategy.” Students will know the question alludes most obviously to
                    Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s racist and xenophobic arguments in “Speech before the
                    Woman Suffrage Convention in Washington, D.C., 18 January, 1869,” but they have
                    many other examples, contemporary and historical, from which to choose. My goal
                    is to heighten their ethical self-consciousness as rhetorically sensitive future
                    citizens, activists, and, perhaps, political candidates.<note place="foot"> In
                        framing this and similar questions designed to cultivate students’
                        sensitivity to the ethics of discourse, I am indebted to John Duffy,
                        Associate Professor of English and Frances O’Malley Director, University
                        Writing Program, University of Notre Dame. Both my students and I are
                        grateful for Prof. Duffy’s insights into virtuous dispositions and
                        rhetorical practice. See his forthcoming “Ethical Dispositions: A Discourse
                        for Rhetoric and Composition” in <title level="m">Journal of Advanced

                    role beyond the class, I ask, “Where would you most like to see change in
                    women’s lives? What is needed to make it happen? What can you personally do now?
                    In the future? How will your knowledge of Romantic eraRomantic-era feminism
                    inform your priorities, arguments or strategies?”</p>
                  <p>Finally, I also want to see their concluding synthesis of historical
                    continuities: “How has learning about Mary Wollstonecraft and other Romantic-era
                    feminists informed your understanding of why feminism is what it is today?”
                    Typically, students say that their understanding of this is not just informed
                    but transformed: prior to the course, they did not know the legal and social
                    context in which Romantic-era feminism developed; now, they respect earlier
                    feminists’ work to achieve the rights and opportunities they themselves
                    currently enjoy; going forward, they understand why the movement continues, and
                    some of them hope to shape its future. </p>

                  <head>Defining terms, establishing contexts</head>
                  <p>In the first week we must define terms and establish contexts for the semester’s
                    work, so I start with a general introduction to the Romantic era, including a
                    British literature timeline, representative authors and texts, major historical
                    events, characteristic themes and genres. Although I inform students that the
                    term “Romantic” could itself be a course topic, I ground them in a fairly
                    traditional, Norton anthology understanding. Such relative stability is helpful
                    because our second key term, “feminism,” is for them a much less stable and more
                    controversial term. Although I sometimes write a basic definition on the board,
                    such as “feminism is the belief that women are entitled to the same legal,
                    social, and economic rights as men,” I prefer for students to volunteer their
                    own definitions, to take an active role, and also to alert me about their
                    initial assumptions. I refer them to sources such as <title level="m">The
                        Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</title> for more in-depth background on
                    feminist theory, but our initial, collectively constructed, working definition
                    of feminism proves helpful throughout the course. We hold one another
                    accountable to it, we continue to discuss it, and, if necessary, we revise it. </p>
                  <p>With basic definitions of “Romantic era” and “feminism” on the board, I then pass
                    out the 1776 American Declaration of Independence for close analysis of its
                    explicit assertions and implicit assumptions about power. I especially direct
                    students’ attention to words and concepts that Romantic-era feminists apply to
                    the situation of women, such as “consent,” “nature,” “rights,” “liberty,”
                    “happiness,” and the ultimate authority of reason implied by submitting “facts”
                    to a “candid world” to “prove” one’s case against “tyranny.” We next look
                    briefly at similar language in The Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen
                    (1789), A Declaration of the Rights of Woman and Citizen (1791), and Declaration
                    of the United Irishmen (1798). Teaching multiple contemporary documents
                    illustrates the Romantic revolutions’ transatlantic scope as diverse groups
                    adapted similar principles to their distinctive contexts. To these I like to add
                    the 1948 U.N. Declaration on Human Rights, as well as the 2011 Saudi Women’s
                    Revolution Statement, posted by Mona Kareem, which serves as our first example
                    of twenty-first-century feminist continuities. </p>
                  <p>Before leaving this first class meeting, each student jots down and turns in the
                    current women’s issue she personally thinks most important. Throughout the
                    course, I will lead discussion back to these specific issues, analyzing how our
                    eighteenth-, nineteenth-, twentieth- and twenty-first-century texts comment on,
                    for example, employment discrimination, reproductive rights, sexual violence,
                    divorce, working mothers, unmarried mothers and the other issues that a given
                    class of students has said are important to them. I also give extra credit for
                    sharing brief, regular, in-class updates on the relevant news unfolding in that
                    particular semester, such as Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, or the
                    Nigerian schoolgirls’ kidnapping. I invite students to draw parallels between
                    sexist political rhetoric used to attack Clinton and sexist political rhetoric
                    used to attack Marie Antoinette, Mary Wollstonecraft and others. Similarly, we
                    compare Rousseau’s and Boko Haram’s construction of girls as sexual objects
                    rather than intellectual subjects.</p>
                  <p>On day two, we start discussing <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>,
                    and, yes, every time I prepare to teach this course, I wonder whether I should
                    replace <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> with a novel students are
                    less likely to read on their own. But it remains a good place to start because
                    it accessibly portrays Romantic-era middle-class Englishwomen and their context.
                    The first few chapters introduce primogeniture and its related gender biases,
                    illustrating how profoundly men’s unequal inheritance privilege affects women’s
                    lives. In later chapters, Marianne and the two Elizas dramatize how the sexual
                    double standard enforces unequal social privilege, as well. The negative effects
                    of middle- and upper-class women’s typical educations are shown in Mrs.
                    Dashwood’s and Marianne’s over-cultivated feeling and under-cultivated reason,
                    in Lucy Steele’s narrow-minded self-interest, and in other women’s limited
                    subjects for thought and conversation. </p>
                  <p>The parental tyrannies of Colonel Brandon’s father and Edward Ferrars’ mother
                    parallel the abuses of unchecked monarchy in ways that invite comparison with
                    Helen Maria Williams’ “Letter XVI,” recounting the story of M. Du F. Williams
                    explicitly suggests that the same traditional hierarchical power structures in
                    both state and family deny the rights of life, liberty and happiness in
                    political and personal life. Comparison with Williams shows that Austen shares
                    some of her feminist contemporaries’ views on a woman’s right to happiness, as
                    well as the ultimate authority of a woman’s individual conscience, typically
                    asserted by accepting or refusing marriage. Emphasizing personal agency over
                    political change, Austen suggests that women’s choices have decisive personal
                    power even within their politically powerless sphere. This relatively
                    conservative but penetrating focus on improving individual women’s characters so
                    that they make better choices, rather than changing the social order to increase
                    women’s choices, makes Austen a useful foil to more radical contemporary
                    thinkers, such as Wollstonecraft. Students also see that if they want to call
                    Austen a “feminist” (and they do) then they may have to change our working
                    definition. </p>
                  <p>Austen’s rich psychological realism and narrative craft are also an instructive
                    foil to <title level="m">The Wrongs of Woman, or Maria</title> which we read
                    immediately after <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>, compelling us
                    to discuss the novel as a literary genre and our expectations from it. This is
                    also where I introduce students to the Gothic subgenre, pointing out that the
                    Gothic imprisonments in <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>
                    (especially the first Eliza’s story, but also Marianne’s heartbroken
                    self-seclusion), <title level="m">The Wrongs of Woman</title> (Maria’s
                    confinement in the asylum), and <title level="m">The Victim of Prejudice</title>
                    (Mary’s forced sojourn in Sir Peter Osborne’s London residence) resonate with
                    images of the Bastille, linking the situation of women to <foreign>ancien
                        régime</foreign> oppression.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Course themes</head>
                  <p>Although some ongoing themes are established on the first day by the
                    Declarations’ language and students’ interests, others grow out of later class
                    discussions. All of these thematic threads weave through the course, connecting
                    texts in patterns unique to each semester’s cohort. Here are a few
                    representative themes as different classes have developed them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph>i. Legitimate Lives: “I had a right to exist!”</emph> (<title level="m">The
                        Victim of Prejudice</title> 14). When we read Colonel Brandon’s account of
                    the two Elizas in <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>, we begin to
                    look critically at how legal marriage and paternal acknowledgement give women
                    and children “legitimate” existence. Jemima’s story in <title level="m">The
                        Wrongs of Woman</title> gives more direct voice to the women and children
                    who are socially outcast without paternal acknowledgement, and Mary Hays’
                    heroine still more forcefully asserts her “right to exist” despite both her
                    illegitimacy (which damages her sexual reputation by association with her
                    mother) and her gender (which makes her sexual reputation an obstacle to finding
                    respectable work and excludes her entirely from higher-paying jobs). Noting the
                    persistent presence in our reading of people with human needs but no
                    “legitimate” human claim on others to help them meet those needs, we see how
                    abstractly and artificially “legitimate” life is constructed, and yet how
                    concretely and materially that construction disadvantages those who don’t fit
                    within it. In addition to these novels, Wollstonecraft’s letters to Gilbert
                    Imlay, Godwin’s <title level="m">Memoir</title>, the Young Lords Party’s 1970
                    “Position Paper on Women,” Margaret Cerullo’s 1968 account of an illegal
                    abortion, and the unmarried mothers and unacknowledged children whom students
                    bring into discussion from their own experience all provide scenarios for
                    thoughtfully considering who has “a right to exist.” </p>
                  <p>Students also notice that although illegitimacy is frequently framed as a moral
                    problem, it is also—perhaps more so—a financial question. Like male
                    primogeniture, the sexual double standard’s moral construction of “legitimacy”
                    assigns power over property: that is, those with power to acknowledge, deny or
                    affirm sexual relationships and blood kinship have corresponding power to
                    bestow, deny or demand financial support and inheritance. Some students use the
                    final research presentation to test this observation, reporting back that
                    women’s increased financial independence, not “looser morals,” has increased
                    social acceptance of children born outside of marriage. Others research the
                    history of legal paternity, or the economic consequences of paternal absence. </p>
                  <p>Once our perspective on this question is re-directed from morality to money,
                    someone invariably asks whether a “right to live” also implies a right to the
                    means of staying alive—such as employment, health care? Still more probingly,
                    students have wondered aloud in class whether individual rights discourse might
                    possibly have some limitations. That is, can the language of individual rights
                    resolve conflicts at sites where autonomous individuals are not easily
                    distinguished, such as pregnant women’s bodies, the global environment where
                    some pollute yet all must live, or economic systems that produce and unequally
                    distribute what all people equally need? These and related questions are
                    urgently important to my students, and while such conversations may take us
                    temporarily “off topic,” they grow naturally from studying Romantic-era
                    feminism.</p>
                  <p>ii. <emph>Sexual Revolutions: “Women as well as men ought to have the common
                        appetites and passions of our nature, they are only brutal when unchecked by
                        reason” </emph>(<title level="m">Vindication, </title>Chap. VII 161). When
                    students express disappointment that Wollstonecraft seems not to be the same
                    “strong” feminist in her relationship with Gilbert Imlay that the firm tone of
                        <title level="m">A Vindication</title> has led them to expect, I remind them
                    that “women as well as men . . . have the common . . .
                    passions of our nature,” which may include the same love characterized by
                    emotional dependency and vulnerability that some men also sometimes feel. This
                    leads to more thoughtful and analytic discussion of feminism and
                    heterosexuality. It also leads to closer attention to personal and political
                    continuities, enabling students to more accurately read Wollstonecraft.</p>
                  <p>I also explain how Wollstonecraft’s sexual attachments were politicized after her
                    death, leading nineteenth-century feminists to repudiate her sexual honesty. The
                    Broadview edition’s contemporary reviews of Godwin’s <title level="m">Memoir</title> show students how aggressively Wollstonecraft’s sexual
                    character was attacked to discredit her circle’s political ideas. Just as we
                    know to expect a generally conservative view from Fox News and a comparatively
                    moderate one from <title level="m">The New York Times</title>, I tell students,
                    Romantic-era readers knew what to expect from <title level="m">The Anti-Jacobin
                        </title>and<title level="m"> Analytic </title>reviews, respectively. Tipped
                    off to their politics, students readily identify and articulate how each
                    reviewer’s tone toward Mary’s life follows each journal’s ideological bent. </p>
                  <p>To further explain why, until fairly recently, some feminists in subsequent
                    generations also scorned Wollstonecraft, I introduce the “angel in the house”
                    ideology, focusing on its sexually repressive assumption that “good,” “angelic”
                    (typically also white and upper- or middle-class) women are morally superior to
                    men. Why did some mid-nineteenth-century feminists accept this false
                    construction of gender so uncritically? The gendered moral high ground is a
                    heady rhetorical advantage to imagine that one has, and feminists occasionally
                    still speak from that location.<note place="foot">For example, in an eloquent
                        and insightful editorial on pornography, Germaine Greer recently stated that
                        “As far as male sexual fantasy is concerned there is no too far.” Such
                        phrasing goes beyond specific individuals to inaccurately include all men
                        and exclude all women, echoing the “angel in the house” false construction
                        of women’s moral superiority and men’s moral inferiority; such sexist
                        constructions are unjust to both. Would it be more just and accurate simply
                        to say, “As far as sexual fantasy is concerned, there is no too far?”</note>
                    Politically, it allowed nineteenth-and early twentieth-century feminists to
                    argue for women’s suffrage without too forcefully challenging contemporary
                    gender roles: they could urge the need for “good” women’s superior moral
                    influence on national politics. But to maintain credibility as morally superior
                    “angels,” feminists who chose that political strategy also had to shun
                    contaminating contact with Wollstonecraft, an ideological choice that would
                    require substantive reappraisal when childcare, sexual freedom and reproductive
                    rights became more central to the movement.</p>
                  <p>With this background, students read Godwin’s <title level="m">Memoir</title> and
                    Wollstonecraft’s letters more thoughtfully, observing how ethically
                    Wollstonecraft persists in respecting the commitment she believes she has made
                    to Imlay, and how reasonably she makes requests and sets limits that he chooses
                    not to respect. Instead of faulting her for “weakness” in trying to maintain a
                    relationship with her child’s father, and for becoming depressed when she can’t,
                    students begin to see Imlay’s faults more equally. The point of such discussion
                    is to analyze how the same conventional constructions of masculinity that
                    Wollstonecraft critically analyzes in the <title level="m">Vindication</title>
                    are also shaping Imlay’s behavior toward her, and how the same Romantic hope for
                    a “revolution in female manners” with which she writes the <title level="m">Vindication</title> also gives her hope, for a time, that Imlay may
                    revolutionize his own manners from those of a conventional womanizer into those
                    of a faithful partner who shares emotional power equally. Where at first
                    students saw only contradiction, they begin to see consistency between
                    Wollstonecraft’s political and personal principles. </p>
                  <p>Jessica Valenti’s documentary “The Purity Myth” complements those passages in
                    Wollstonecraft’s life and work where sexual reputation is, literally, a matter
                    of life or death. By deconstructing “purity” and “virginity” in
                    twenty-first-century terms, Valenti continues Wollstonecraft’s, Austen’s, Hays’
                    and others’ demolition of the sexual double standard. I show Valenti’s film when
                    we read <title level="m">Vindication</title> Chapter VII
                    “Modesty—Comprehensively considered and not as a sexual virtue,” and Chapter
                    VIII “Morality undermined by sexual notions of the importance of a good
                    reputation.” Valenti says similar things more accessibly, helping students to
                    hear Wollstonecraft more clearly, as when, for example, anticipating
                    sex-positive third-wave feminism, Wollstonecraft asserts that “it is indelicate,
                    not to say immodest, for women to feign an unnatural coldness of constitution”
                    (161). Observing “purity balls” in juxtaposition with “hook-up” dating, students
                    are struck by the vastly different sexual cultures contemporary Americans
                    occupy, both scientifically and ethically. Some see scientific ignorance as an
                    ethical problem in itself, and use their final presentations to invoke Mary
                    Wollstonecraft in support of current arguments for HPV vaccination or for
                    comprehensive K–12 sexuality education. </p>
                  <p>iii. <emph>Women’s Education: “the heterogeneous studies pursued in this
                        helter-skelter fashion were of the smallest possible utility in later life;
                        each acquirement being of the shallowest and most imperfect kind”</emph>
                    (Cobbe 1632). When students learn firsthand from Frances Cobbe how superficially
                    even upper-class girls were educated in the Romantic era, they better understand
                    both Wollstonecraft’s and Hannah More’s criticisms of the women such education
                    produced. Complementary readings from <title level="m">I Am Malala</title> and
                        <title level="m">Reading Lolita in Tehran</title> make the gender politics
                    of education acutely contemporary, as does Julia Meltzer’s 2011 documentary,
                        <title level="m">The Light in Her Eyes</title>. Every design for women’s
                    education implies a corresponding idea of “woman,” as these authors variously
                    demonstrate, so we analyze it anew in every text. I then invite students to
                    reflect on what their own education so far has implied about the nature, needs
                    and roles of women and men, as well as what that education has assumed about the
                    nature of gender identity itself. I find that all students thrive on
                    opportunities to reflect personally about the gender identities assigned to
                    them, their own gender identities as they choose to perform them, and the gender
                    role expectations others have of them. Such reflection both deconstructs
                    cultural constructions of gender and empowers students to actively construct
                    their own gender identities for themselves. As queer and transgender voices
                    become more prominent in popular culture, students find resonant Romantic-era
                    parallels in “the ladies of Llangollen,” Lady Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby;
                    Lord Byron; and the “Sapphic separatists” researched by Susan Lanser, among
                    others. </p>
                  <p>iv. <emph>Class and race: “‘Who ever acknowledged me to be a fellow-creature?’”;
                        “And ain’t I a woman?”</emph> (Wollstonecraft, <title level="m">The Wrongs
                        of Woman </title>289; Truth 510). Jemima’s story in <title level="m">The
                        Wrongs of Woman</title> illustrates how poverty exacerbates gender
                    oppression for Romantic-era women, and teaching it alongside Johnnie Tilmon’s
                    1972 <title level="m">Ms.</title> article, “Welfare is a Women’s Issue,”
                    introduces racial intersectionality into the conversation. When I teach
                    Sojourner Truth’s well-known speech, I also lead pointed discussion of Stanton’s
                    racism (mentioned above, under “<emph>Assignments</emph>”). In future classes, I
                    will assign students to read Alice Walker on womanism along with Truth. Harriet
                    Jacobs’s <title level="m">Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,</title> or
                    excerpts from it, and poems by Phillis Wheatley also heighten students’
                    awareness of continuities and discontinuities between black and white women’s
                    historical experience. Although teaching abolitionist poems by white women is in
                    some ways the opposite of racial inclusivity, teaching poems by More and others
                    on that theme is nonetheless useful for raising students’ awareness of how false
                    notes can mar good intentions if racist assumptions are not thoroughly
                    deconstructed. Throughout the course, I point out white Romantic-era feminists’
                    appropriation of African women’s real “slavery” and “chains” as metaphors for
                    their own comparatively privileged oppression. But I’m still not satisfied with
                    my course’s representation of non-white and non-middle-class feminists in any
                    century, and so I continue researching new texts and searching for a still more
                    intentionally inclusive, deeply historical anthology of feminist writing. </p>
                  <p>v. <emph>From Rousseau to the manosphere: “. . . woman is made
                        specially to please man . . .”</emph> (Rousseau, <title level="m">Emile</title> 358): If man, born free, should break his unnatural chains,
                    then why is it natural for woman to remain shackled? Our class reads Rousseau’s
                    answer in Book 5 of <title level="m">Emile</title>: “In the union of the sexes
                    each contributes equally to the common aim, but not in the same
                    way. . . . One ought to be active and strong, the other passive and
                    weak. One must necessarily will and be able; it suffices that the other put up
                    little resistance . . . it follows that woman is made specially to
                    please man. . . . This is not the law of love . . . But it
                    is that of nature . . . .” (358). To understand why Wollstonecraft
                    spends so much time refuting Rousseau so thoroughly, students need to appreciate
                    his cultural weight in articulating ideas, such as the authority of nature over
                    cultural traditions, that Wollstonecraft herself then applies to deconstructing
                    his constructions of gender. They also need to grasp how ingeniously he
                    reconstructs gender hierarchy in new, “natural” terms to replace the
                        <foreign>ancien régime</foreign>’s traditional, religious ones.</p>
                  <p>On the Internet, my students have found Rousseau’s construction of “natural”
                    gender roles renovated for the twenty-first century. When they first brought
                    these texts into our classroom, I thought we were reading satire in the style of
                    Stephen Colbert. But Arthur Goldwag assures us that the Red Pill Game, Return of
                    Kings and similar “manosphere” bloggers are not joking. Their sport and hunting
                    metaphors remind students of John Willoughby’s first appearance in <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>, and Sir Peter Osborne’s in <title level="m">The Victim of Prejudice</title>. Their arguments for repealing the
                    nineteenth amendment are similar in substance to its original opponents’, and
                    their rules for women’s conduct seem drawn from the same passages of <title level="m">Emile</title> that Wollstonecraft critiques. Although the
                    manosphere’s characteristically crude or violent rhetoric dismays my students,
                    its power to intimidate them is deflated when they read it in an historical
                    context that exposes how outdated, extreme and marginal it now is. Similarly,
                    when Richard Polwhele labels Wollstonecraft “lascivious” and “licentious,” and
                    when “The Vision of Liberty” characterizes the <title level="m">Vindication</title> as a “scripture, archly fram’d, for propagating
                    w[hores],” the YouTube clip I show of Rush Limbaugh’s comparable commentary on
                    Sandra Fluke strikes students as more anachronistic than shocking (<title level="m">Vindication</title>, Appendix D,185–86, ll. 19, 32; <title level="m">Anti-Jacobin Review</title>, August 1801, Broadview edition 193). </p>
                  <p>Analyzing and discussing rather than swiftly dismissing extreme contemporary
                    examples sensitizes students to similar messages in subtler and more mainstream
                    texts, and when a period literature course intersects with the immediate moment,
                    students soon begin connecting them independently. As a result, I am frequently
                    thrust without warning from the eighteenth century to today’s front page by
                    students whipping out their laptops or smartphones and reading aloud a relevant
                    story, post or sound bite. In such welcome emergencies, unable to prepare, I
                    rely on close reading and critical thinking questions: “How does this discourse
                    construct gender? What are its implications? its assumptions? Where might those
                    assumptions lead if they were applied more broadly? Do you want your society to
                    go there? Why or why not? Does this language echo any of the feminist or
                    anti-feminist Romantic-era discourse we have read? Whose? How, specifically?”
                    From these spontaneous discussions, students learn to analyze and articulate
                    their immediate reactions, gaining confidence both in their responses and in
                    their authority to express them.</p>
                  <p>vi. <emph>Male Allies: “I absolutely disclaim and repudiate all pretence to have
                        acquired any rights whatever by virtue of such marriage” (Mill 1186)</emph>.
                    Despite the powerful efforts of Rousseau and others to lead Romantic revolution
                    away from equal rights for women, its feminist implications were seen and
                    explicated by other men, such as Nicolas de Condorcet and John Stuart Mill. As
                    Lynn Hunt points out in her introduction to “On the Admission of Women to the
                    Rights of Citizenship,” “Condorcet took the question of political rights to all
                    of its logical conclusions” in such statements as, “It is therefore unjust to
                    advance as grounds for continuing to refuse women the enjoyment of their natural
                    rights those reasons that only have some kind of reality because women do not
                    enjoy these rights in the first place” (119, 121). </p>
                  <p>Reading John Stuart Mill’s repudiation of husbands’ unequal rights in Victorian
                    marriage, students note its resonance with Godwin’s criticism of “the evil of
                    marriage as it is practised in European countries,” “an affair of property, and
                    the worst of all properties” (<title level="m">Memoirs</title>, Appendix B 137).
                    To understand what Godwin condemns and Mill repudiates students need to
                    understand the traditional legal and social construction of marriage. Most do
                    not know that marriage laws were ever unequal to men’s advantage with regard to
                    property, child custody, divorce, and domestic violence. Nor do they know the
                    cultural expectations of married women in previous generations. So we read
                    Caroline Norton’s “A Letter to the Queen” alongside Edith Stern’s 1949 “Women
                    Are Household Slaves,” and the 1969 pamphlet, “Women: Do You Know the Facts
                    about Marriage?” (Damrosch and Dettmar 1639–42; MacLean 50–54, 87–88). This
                    helps students understand precisely what elements of traditional marriage
                    earlier feminists criticized, and why. Once women students fully realize what
                    Mill voluntarily gives up, their admiration sometimes exceeds their coherence:
                    “to think a man would actually do that . . .” is a representatively
                    reverent fragment from one recent discussion. The 1970 Young Lords Party’s
                    repudiation of “machismo” is a similarly appreciated revelation. </p>
                  <p>We then read excerpts from the debate in the House of Commons following Mill’s 20
                    May 1867 speech proposing “leav[ing] out the word ‘man,’ in order to insert the
                    word ‘person’ . . . instead thereof,” which would have extended the
                    Second Reform Bill’s voting rights to women. As they read the arguments for and
                    against Mill’s proposal, students recognize familiar twenty-first-century
                    arguments against women’s other rights, and better understand why peaceful
                    change is slow. But they also see that Mill persuaded seventy-three Victorian
                    Englishmen to vote against their own gender privilege in support of women’s
                    suffrage, helping to advance a change that eventually did come. Accurate
                    attention to the continuous historical presence of feminist male allies is both
                    instructive and inspiring to young activists.</p>
                  <p>With these texts, assignments and classroom strategies, ENLT 384: Romantic Era
                    Feminism teaches selected literature from the age of Romantic revolutions to the
                    current moment, revealing feminism’s historical depth and intellectual
                    authority, as well as the persistent conflict between a progressive feminist
                    movement and a reactionary anti-feminist counter-movement, from the eighteenth
                    century into the present. Teaching such historical continuities transforms
                    students’ view of their own position in history and their power to shape the
                    future.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <p>I take my title from a moment this fall when a new colleague welcomed me to
                        the University of Denver Department of English, explaining that I might
                        think of the department’s unofficial mascot as the zonkey, or zebra-donkey
                        hybrid, representing the admixture of critical and creative inquiry. This
                        statement resonates with my own approach to teaching literature, not to
                        mention my penchant for obscure animal metaphors. Without putting too much
                        theoretical or zoological pressure on the descriptive term, in this essay
                        I’ll share one aspect of my approach to zonkey Romanticism, focusing on the
                        inclusion of creative writing assignments in the Romantic literature
                        classroom.</p>
                  <p>The use of creative writing as a teaching tool is, for me, inseparably
                        interlaced with a twinned focus on the Romantic and the contemporary. When
                        I’m explaining my myriad projects to new interlocutors, I often describe
                        myself as an “unromantic Romanticist.” By this I mean that I’m interested in
                        the Romantic as a moment of crisis but I’m uninterested in what I think of
                        as Romantic exceptionalism. This is to say that I find it unproductive to
                        think of Romantic literature as representing a sort of singular moment at
                        which experiment is made possible—a moment that is sometimes thought to
                        reoccur, somehow, during High Modernism. Rather, I am interested in
                        excavating literary and poetic experiment as a historical and
                        transhistorical project or series of projects that cross the boundaries we
                        use to delimit period, coterie, and discourse field. </p>
                  <p>Within the classroom context, this intellectual manifesto translates into a
                        cultural studies approach in which I ask students to read Romantic texts as
                        themselves and then to read their own literary and cultural moment as
                        Romanticists. So, “Early Romantic Literature and the Invention of Poetic
                        Experiment” begins with an in-depth, historicist analysis of <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> and concludes with whatever new,
                        exciting poetry has come out that very month (most recently, Sarah Blake’s
                        lyric biography of Kanye West, which the press sent on to us in advance of
                        the publication date). “Later Romantic Literature: Monsters and Rock Stars”
                        approaches texts such as <title level="m">The Vampyre</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan </title>with an emphasis on the interrelated
                        themes of celebrity and monstrosity, and concludes with a collaboratively
                        student-designed unit on monstrosity in contemporary celebrity culture.
                        Throughout these courses, one technique remains consistent: the inclusion of
                        creative writing assignments that ask students to invert their perspective
                        on the Romantic text and to usher that text into their contemporary moment.
                        And, while I wouldn’t take it upon myself to suggest that everyone allow
                        their students to assign the pilot episode of <title level="m">Keeping Up
                            with the Kardashians</title> in a course focused on Keats, Byron, and
                        the Shelleys, it is my conviction and my experience that a creative writing
                        assignment can infuse any Romantics course with critical concern for the
                        contemporary while supporting common student learning outcomes. It is in the
                        service of this conviction that I offer four theses on teaching zonkey
                        Romanticism.</p>

                  <head>1. CREATIVE WRITING IS HYBRID</head>
                  <p>In the context of zonkey Romanticism, “creative writing” refers to hybrid
                        critical/creative projects involving a series of self-reflexive loops and
                        turns that ask students to read and reread Romantic texts and contexts,
                        their own writing, and, ultimately, their own cultural moment. This sort of
                        hybrid writing assignment is, of course, not unique to my classes. I first
                        encountered hybrid critical/creative assignments as an undergraduate student
                        at Colorado College, where one of my favorite professors, Regula Meyer
                        Evitt, would often ask students to, for example, create their own circle of
                        hell and then use a close-reading of their own writing to generate an
                        in-depth analysis of the logic that governs Dante’s <title level="m">Inferno</title>. Thinking through the benefits of using creative
                        writing in response to texts in the college literature classroom, Peter
                        Wilson has described a “creative-critical spectrum suggested by the
                        following descriptors: creative writing not in response to text, creative
                        writing in response to text, critical-creative re-writing, critical writing
                        in response to text, critical writing not in response to text” (440). Zonkey
                        that I am, I understand the interplay between critical and creative inquiry
                        in less linear terms, all the while subscribing to Wilson’s suggestion that
                        all writing is, to some extent, creative, and that playing with this
                        variable can have profound pedagogical payoffs.</p>
                  <p>For example, last spring, I asked students at Rutgers to follow an assignment
                        in which they close-read one stanza from <title level="m">Don Juan</title>
                        by writing an imitation of the very stanza they had close-read. Students
                        then wrote a 500-word critical coda in which they explained and justified
                        their choices. In effect, I asked students to respond to everything they had
                        discovered in their close reading through creative writing.</p>
                  <p>One student, Elizabeth Giardina, chose to close read and then imitate Stanza
                        43 of Canto VI:<quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>She was not violently lively, but</l>
                           <l>Stole on your spirit like a May day breaking.</l>
                           <l>Her eyes were not too sparkling, yet half-shut,</l>
                           <l>They put beholders in a tender taking.</l>
                           <l>She looked (this simile’s quite new) just cut</l>
                           <l>From marble, like Pygmalion’s statue waking,</l>
                           <l>The mortal and the marble still at strife, </l>
                           <l>And timidly expanding into life.</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> Explicating her responses to this stanza, Elizabeth
                        described her progression from the close reading to the hybrid assignment as
                            follows:<quote> [For the close reading,] I focused especially on the
                            equivocal language, such as litotes like “She was not violently lovely,
                            but . . .” Byron employs to discuss Dudù’s beauty. He mentions
                            in the stanza that her beauty was like a “May day breaking,” further
                            emphasizing her liminal status between opposites—between night and day,
                            perhaps. For my imitation of this stanza in relation to modern culture,
                            I chose to focus on another woman, but one who is known for her politics
                            rather than her beauty. Hillary Clinton is often in the public eye for
                            the beauty blunders she apparently commits. One that came to mind most
                            easily for me was the constant critique of her “cankles,” so I decided
                            they would be my main focus in my stanza. I sought to employ the same
                            equivocal attitude toward her that Byron does toward Dudù, but to have a
                            different intent in mind.</quote> Elizabeth’s resulting imitation sets
                        forth its own poetic satire:<quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>They are not excessively fat, but</l>
                           <l>Jiggle when she turns around a corner;</l>
                           <l>Cankles a fine shade of pistachio nut,</l>
                           <l>Stuffed inside too tight heels and make me mourn her</l>
                           <l>Comfort. ‘Twixt green and tan, her leg hairs uncut:</l>
                           <l>She’s Athena amidst tea and foreigners.</l>
                           <l>Though much of her speech was understood moot,</l>
                           <l>For she dared wear a dress instead of a pantsuit. </l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> Reflecting on her creative process, Elizabeth explained,
                        “[w]hile I was writing the stanza I was aware that I would need to close
                        read it afterward, and so I was especially aware of how I used my language,
                        rhythm, and line breaks in order to illustrate my point.” Indeed,
                        Elizabeth’s close reading of her own creative work involved digging in to
                        the details of her imitation as well as the details of the original stanza.
                        For example, Elizabeth comments on her interpretation of Byron’s underhanded
                        diction (“An ankle is not beautiful if it is somewhere between green and
                        tan; it would look repulsive and unhealthy. But ‘pistachio’ tiptoes around
                        the issue with a pretty word and the idea of a tasty snack”) and reimagines
                        Byron’s allusions for the contemporary context (“the reference to Athena
                        rather than Pygmalion’s statue emphasizes intellectual capability rather
                        than sheer physical appeal”). Written in tandem with more conventional forms
                        of literary analysis and academic writing, Elizabeth’s ode to Hillary’s
                        cankles presents a moment of performance in which the student inhabits the
                        formal space of the Romantic poem and the cultural-critical space of the
                        Romantic poet. </p>

                  <head>2. CREATIVE WRITING IS LIBERATING</head>
                  <p>When I assign hybrid critical/creative papers in my classes, I hasten to
                        remind students that this isn’t a creative writing class and that they won’t
                        be graded based on talent. Even with and perhaps in part due to these
                        disclaimers, the resulting creative work is often excellent. Reflecting on
                        this trend, Wilson points out that, when these types of assignments are used
                        in class, “[c]reative writing is seen . . . as a means to better
                        critical reading, but . . . the relation is reciprocal and
                        critically informed reading can be the context for genuinely talented
                        creative work” (441). I agree that strong creative reading promotes strong
                        creative writing, and would add to this assertion my sense that students
                        find the creative writing assignments to be liberating and/or disarming, an
                        experience that promotes a greater sense of strength and ease as they work
                        through assignments. Writing in a new genre in which they are not expected
                        to have developed “good” habits, students seem eager to take chances and to
                        perform experiments. </p>
                  <p>I base these general claims in part on the investment and enthusiasm I’ve
                        witnessed during student paper presentations and in part based on student
                        responses to creative papers in anonymous course evaluations. In the latter
                        context, students often describe hybrid assignments as “fun” and
                        “enjoyable,” ask for more, or tell me they “loved” the assignment. This
                        sense that hybrid critical/creative assignments are somehow a treat or gift
                        built into the curriculum reflects, I think, the extent to which a creative
                        approach to analyzing literature allows students to relax and enjoy
                        learning. These assignments ask students to create something new for which
                        they have no model, rather than to strive toward the platonic ideal of the
                        perfect English paper. The resulting engaged, non-anxious approach to the
                        creative assignment helps generate clear, insightful student writing, not
                        only for the hybrid assignment itself, but also for later, more conventional
                        assignments. In course evaluations, students report that creative writing
                        helps them tap into their creativity; I’ve noticed that students engage this
                        creativity while completing more conventional writing assignments (e.g.
                        comparative papers and thesis-driven analyses), as well.</p>
                  <p>Additionally, by asking students to take on the role of the Romantic author,
                        this category of assignment invites students to peel back the cloak of
                        canonicity and to claim Romantic perspectives for themselves. Compared to
                        their thesis-driven counterparts, creative assignments are often irreverent,
                        as in one student’s “No Time for the Ancient Mariner,” in which Coleridge’s
                        ancient mariner, transported to the present day, can’t get anyone on the
                        street to stop and listen to his story, or in various reinterpretations of
                        “This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison” in which students use Coleridge’s projected
                        frustration at an absent nostalgia to account for the FOMO they experience
                        whilst navigating between studying and socializing. I humbly submit that
                        it’s OK and maybe even preferable for students to be irreverent (educated,
                        insightful, and interested, of course, but also, sometimes, irreverent) when
                        it comes to Coleridge et al., and often use creative assignments to
                        dismantle the imposing hierarchy of canonicity. Writing about the ways in
                        which creative writing exercises can promote “investment” and “authority”
                        among composition students, Drew and Yost have argued that “these exercises
                        can become central to the work of the composition classroom by helping to
                        undermine the Author/student writer dichotomy” (30). Beyond upsetting this
                        dichotomy, creative responses to Romanticism can help students connect
                        Romantic literature to their lives and, in turn, find ways to connect to the
                        Romantic.</p>

                  <head>3. CREATIVE WRITING INVERTS THE ROMANTIC AND THE CONTEMPORARY</head>
                  <p>Creative writing assignments ask students to invert their perspective, taking
                        on Romantic concerns, forms, and experiments and applying them to their own
                        contemporary experience. This process develops in two dimensions. In some
                        cases, Romantic thinking allows students to reconsider contemporary issues;
                        in other cases, the opportunity to write like a Romantic encourages students
                        to infuse their everyday world with new—that is, old—ideas.</p>
                  <p>One assignment that encourages students to reconsider contemporary issues
                        through a Romantic lens is a monster narrative written in the
                        nineteenth-century tradition but focused on a contemporary issue, topic, or
                        context. In “Later Romantic Literature: Monsters and Rock Stars,” this
                        assignment generated a number of monster narratives dealing with issues of
                        body image and the beauty industry. For example, one story, written by
                        Shayla Lawz, presented a monstrous and ultimately tragic depiction of two
                        young girls mimicking their mother’s fixation on her physical appearance:
                            <quote>Each afternoon as their momma went to run errands, the two girls
                            kept themselves busy by playing dress up. One by one, they would throw
                            the giant polka dot scarves around their necks, and slip their tiny feet
                            into the size nine high heels. Ivylese liked to screech swiftly across
                            the mahogany living room floor as Olivia covered her ears at the sound.
                            She did this until, while playing around one day, she sliced her finger
                            on the sharp metal heel and became frightened at what else they were
                            capable of.</quote> Other student monster narratives addressed plastic
                        surgery, vanity, eating disorders, and self-representation on social media.
                        After studying texts such as <title level="m">Frankenstein </title>and
                            <title level="m">Mathilda </title>that use monstrosity to embody,
                        among so many other things, anxieties about social change, social roles, and
                        women’s place in society, course participants used the nineteenth-century
                        tradition of the monster narrative to express some of their own thoughts
                        about and understandings of societal problems and pressures. If, as Jeffrey
                        Jerome Cohen has argued, we can “understand . . . cultures through
                        the monsters they bear[,]” then perhaps using the logics of the Romantic
                        monster narrative to think through our own culture can help us become better
                        readers of literature and culture, broadly construed (4). I should note here
                        that I’ve recently updated this assignment in response to different
                        pedagogical goals. This fall, in a first-year seminar on “Monster
                        Narratives, 1797–2014,” sixteen first-year college students at the
                        University of Denver will choose a contemporary social, environmental,
                        and/or political issue, research and write an annotated bibliography on
                        their topic, and then construct and analyze their own monster narratives in
                        response to the issue they have chosen and researched. It is my hope that
                        this assignment will encourage students to respond critically and creatively
                        to their world, using the Romantic (and, in this case, the Victorian) as a
                        tool to help them critique and understand the contemporary.</p>
                  <p>As I mentioned above, hybrid critical/creative exercises can also encourage
                        students to infuse their everyday experience with an understanding of and
                        interest in the (neo-)Romantic. For example, in a course on Early Romantic
                        Literature taught at Rutgers, I asked students to imitate a poet of their
                        choosing, and then to submit a critical coda walking me through their
                        imitation. Some students reported that their choice to imitate a Romantic
                        nature poem led them to notice, engage, or appreciate the natural world in a
                        new or different way.</p>
                  <p>One such student, Sam Brusco, ventured out into the New Jersey woods to write
                        an imitation of Wordsworth, which I excerpt here:<quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>It was a still and stagnant winter morn;</l>
                           <l>a day when Nature seemed to lie asleep,</l>
                           <l>no single creature stirred, scarce wind was heard,</l>
                           <l>a day that had an oath of silence sworn.</l>
                           <l>No prior obligations then had I,</l>
                           <l>at rest from travels endless and sublime.</l>
                           <l>I walked among a way yet untrodden, </l>
                           <l>now that I found myself with endless time.</l>
                           <l>The path I chose, untouched by human will</l>
                           <l>without a measured course to mark the way;</l>
                           <l>since Nature organized no maps for me,</l>
                           <l>the path was chosen by what course I made.</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> Sam’s employment of iambic pentameter as well as his
                        deployment of allusions to poems read in class demonstrate the extent to
                        which the student has taken in and synthesized a sense of what it means to
                        find oneself in a Wordsworth poem. However, beyond these formal and topical
                        references, Sam’s critical coda focuses on his interpretation of Wordsworth
                        as a poet-philosopher:</p>
                  <p>What was particularly interesting for my own “experience with nature” that I
                        had hoped would create my own philosophical conclusions was my decision to
                        take a walk in the woods in wintertime . . . some would interpret
                        the landscape as dead, “A scene devoid of life, though it may seem.”
                        However, the observer reasons that because nature exerts so much energy in
                        providing a thriving landscape for the remainder of the year, it ought to
                        have a time to rest, as well, because all other living things are allowed to
                        rest. The landscape then becomes something entirely different: a scene of
                        serenity and tranquility rather than of stagnation and lifelessness.</p>
                  <p>If we find ourselves debating how, whether, and why to use the contemporary
                        to make the Romantic “relatable” for students, then Sam’s and other
                        students’ thoughtful poetic encounters with the natural environment in
                        hybrid critical/creative response to Romanticism demonstrate the extent to
                        which the Romantic is, of course, already relevant—already <emph>related</emph>—to the issues and concerns that dominate
                        our world and the worlds of our students.</p>

                  <head>4. CREATIVE WRITING OFFERS AN ANALYTICAL ALTERNATIVE TO ARGUMENT</head>
                  <p>Explaining his use of creative responses to literature in the high school
                        classroom, Christian Knoeller argues, “[i]n place of a simple opposition
                        between response and formal analysis, imaginative response maps a continuum
                        between the two and demonstrates how they can serve essentially
                        complementary roles when interpreting literary works” (44). In the college
                        classroom, the hybrid critical/creative assignment functions as a moment of
                        rupture bridging, not only reader response and student analysis, but also
                        argumentative analysis and something beyond argument. In my classes, I find
                        it useful to remain mindful of the extent to which an exclusive focus on
                        strength of argument can sometimes limit a student’s exploration of the
                        text(s) at hand. While I consider teaching academic argument to be one of
                        the most important parts of my job as an English professor, I also maintain
                        that students’ interactions with literary history before, beside, or beyond
                        the project of constructing an argument about that history is crucial to
                        learning and should not be undervalued. Assignments that ask students to do
                        something other than make an argument offer the chance to share and to
                        receive feedback regarding the many ways in which students interact with
                        texts. These assignments, in turn, ask students to linger in the space of
                        the text itself and to extend the encounter that is reading. It is my
                        contention that such opportunities to interpret for interpretation’s own
                        sake help students become more conscientious readers, and, in turn, more
                        persuasive when it comes to academic argument.</p>
                  <p>Hybrid critical/creative assignments accomplish these goals differently than,
                        say, non-thesis driven close readings insofar as they ask students to think
                        with and through the Romantic, moving beyond the text and into the questions
                        and issues it raises, all the while resisting or delaying the impulse to
                        compress the text’s effects and affects into a digestible thesis. At the
                        2014 NASSR conference, my mentor, Marjorie Levinson, responded to a question
                        about pedagogy with a simple and perfectly true statement of purpose: “You
                        just want them to feel how good it is to think.” Hybrid critical/creative
                        assignments provide students with a formal opportunity to think, not
                        necessarily in the service of argument, but rather via the experience of
                        generating and understanding creative practice. No wonder students often
                        report that hybrid assignments allow them to access or understand authorship
                        in complex and vibrant ways that skirt those teaching conventions (e.g. the
                        insistence on a “speaker,” whatever that might mean in the Romantic context)
                        that reinforce the author taboo without edging into problematic,
                        biographical reading. In the literary studies classroom, hybrid
                        critical/creative assignments complement praxis with practice. This practice
                        promotes experimental reading, writing, and interpretation.</p>
                  <p>Building on this interplay, one goal I have in mind as I continue to develop
                        the pedagogy of zonkey Romanticism is to explore and think through the ways
                        in which creative writing might inform students’ understanding of theory as
                        well as their theoretical understanding of Romantic texts. Reflecting on a
                        hybrid critical/creative assignment, van Oostrum, Steadman-Jones, and Carson
                        remark that “this task . . . brought alive a range of theoretical
                        issues concerning the difficulty of representation” and posit that “[w]hen
                        students read about these issues in books of literary theory, they often
                        remain cold, abstract, and remote. But when they arise from the process of
                        producing creative writing, they seem much more alive” (565). While an
                        analysis of how creative writing might be used to illustrate and vivify
                        theoretical approaches in the Romantic literature classroom is beyond the
                        scope of this essay, I conclude with this open question as a way to gesture
                        toward how the pedagogical approach presented here might further be
                        developed and applied as a method for asking students to express their
                        understanding, their questions, and their ideas in an open, generative
                        format. </p>
                  <p>Ultimately, I hope that my comments have illustrated some of the ways in
                        which creative writing and hybrid critical/creative assignments can
                        encourage students of Romantic literature to bridge the historical text and
                        the contemporary moment of reading, not just in the service of intervention,
                        but for the sake of capacious and radical interaction, interaction that
                        produces new texts, new ideas, new perspectives, and, indeed, new ways of
                        thinking.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This article discusses the theme and methodology of the course
                    “(Post-)Romantic Childhoods in British Literature” as previously taught at
                    Bielefeld University in Germany. The course covered constructions of childhood
                    in British literature from the Romantic period and their appropriations in
                    Victorian and contemporary fiction by Dickens, McEwan, Lessing, and Boyne.
                    Reflecting upon the teaching goals and outcomes, we draw on two fields of
                    research into contemporary literature: constructivist childhood studies and the
                    critical study of Romantic legacies. After an introduction to our terminology,
                    the cultural context, and its implications for classroom scenarios, we outline
                    the syllabus in detail, adding handouts, activities, and tasks as illustrative

               <head>Legacies of the Romantic Child: Teaching Post-Romantic Constructions of
                    Childhood in Contemporary British Fiction</head>
               <div type="section">
                  <p>The ideal of childhood in contemporary Western cultures is a legacy of
                        Romanticism. Incarnations of the innocent child as once imagined by Blake,
                        Wordsworth, Coleridge and others are perceived as pervasive norms that
                        continue to inform discourses concerning children, including debates on
                        education, social policy, law, and media. This preoccupation with childhood
                        comes to the fore in a great number of British and Irish novels published
                        since the 1980s. This article addresses this recent trend and the
                        opportunities it creates for the teaching of contemporary literature in
                        English Studies degree courses. It presents the structure, methodology, and
                        content of an advanced undergraduate course on the legacies of the Romantic
                        child as previously taught at Bielefeld University in Germany. Reflecting
                        upon the course’s goals and outcomes, we unite two fields of research into
                        contemporary literature: constructivist childhood studies and the critical
                        study of responses to and appropriations of Romanticism, epitomized by the
                        notion of the post-Romantic. After an introduction to our terminology and
                        its implications for classroom scenarios, we will outline the syllabus.
                        Handouts, activities, and tasks will serve as illustrative examples, which
                        colleagues are welcome to adapt for their own teaching. </p>

                        Studies and Post-Romanticism</head>
                  <p>Contemporary Britain provides a gripping cultural and political context for
                        students’ enquiries into constructions of childhood.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> It must be noted that the syllabus included a novel by
                            the Irish author John Boyne, which is, however, not particularly
                            relevant for the novel’s rendering of childhood. Depictions of childhood
                            in a specifically Irish context would undoubtedly constitute a
                            fascinating subject for research and teaching, too (Frank McCourt’s
                            memoir <title level="m">Angela’s Ashes</title> comes to mind) but could
                            not be included here. Colleagues who are interested in Irish
                            childhood(s) may refer to Dunne and Kelly.</note> Despite its
                        long-standing artistic celebration of childhood and ongoing political
                        investments into child welfare, the United Kingdom has frequently been
                        referred to as “a serious contender for the title of worst place in Europe
                        to be a child” (Micklewright and Stewart 23). Having recently received harsh
                        criticism in the assessment of children’s general well-being from the United
                        Nations and UNICEF (Kehily 7), the UK is notorious for its widespread child
                        poverty and its comparatively low age of criminal responsibility alongside
                        its unusually high number of young offenders held in custody (Wyness 73).
                        Moreover, the media coverage of events featuring binary constructions of
                        children as vicious perpetrators and as innocent victims, such as the public
                        condemnation of the two ten-year-old boys who murdered James Bulger in 1993
                        or the torture and death of Victoria Climbié in 2000, continue to fuel moral
                        panics. Phenomena such as the disintegration of traditional family
                        practices, excessive media consumption, juvenile delinquency, and bullying
                        are often construed as indicators of an apparent crisis of contemporary
                        childhood in Britain.</p>
                  <p>Since the 1980s, fiction from the British Isles has played a marked role in
                        negotiating these very issues. Acclaimed novels by such authors as Pat
                        Barker, A.S. Byatt, Roddy Doyle, Kazuo Ishiguro, Ian McEwan, and Ali Smith
                        have tackled the debates surrounding childhood. Many of these works depict
                        child characters’ subjectivities and attempt to convey cognitive development
                        through formal means, which are specifically available to the medium of
                        narrative, such as free indirect discourse and focalization. American,
                        Canadian, and Australian childhood novels by Emma Donoghue, Jonathan Safran
                        Foer, M.J. Hyland, and Lionel Shriver have been equally successful in the
                        British Isles. Besides fiction, autobiographical accounts of childhood have
                        enjoyed immense popularity in recent years. The contemporary childhood novel
                        is, moreover, explicitly marketed as an emerging subgenre, with a group of
                        leading authors in the field repeatedly commenting upon each other’s works
                        (Dinter 54). The course, “(Post-)Romantic Childhoods in British Literature,”
                        aimed to illustrate the remarkable thematic and formal variety in which the
                        novels respond to Romantic concepts of childhood, by reaffirming,
                        transforming, or subverting their precursors.</p>
                  <p>A crucial point of departure for the Romantics was Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s
                        understanding of childhood as a separate, formative period of life
                        characterized by a condition of natural innocence, as outlined in <title level="m">Emile</title> (1762). Since, for Rousseau, civilization
                        immediately corrupts the state of natural goodness, he outlines an
                        educational program that would form and prolong childhood according to this
                        ideal. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, poetry by
                        William Blake, William Wordsworth, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, as well as
                        books for children by Anna Barbauld, Charlotte Smith, Maria Edgeworth, and
                        Charles Lamb, appropriated the subject of childhood and turned it into a
                        prevalent literary concept of the period. In Blake’s <title level="m">Songs
                            of Innocence and of Experience</title>, childhood emerges as an ideal
                        state of purity, authenticity, and spontaneity. Yet Blake always contrasts
                        the pastoral world of innocence displayed in poems such as “Laughing Song,”
                        “Nurse’s Song,” or “Infant’s Joy” with darker realms of experience, and his
                        poetry also speaks to the harsh social conditions for children of his time.
                        The child speaker in “The Chimney Sweeper,” (from <title level="m">Innocence</title>) for instance, laments how “my father sold me while
                        yet my tongue, / Could scarcely cry weep weep weep weep” (Blake 18).
                        Wordsworth’s poetry, too, incorporates pastoral child figures, often setting
                        them amid scenes of loss and death. The young girl in “We Are Seven,” for
                        instance, refuses to confront the facts of death on adult terms. Her
                        persistence first seems naïve, but comes, over the course of the poem, to
                        win out over the reductive, rational response of her interlocutor. In the
                        “Ode: Intimations of Immortality,” <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, and
                        other works, Wordsworth employs childhood in distinctly autobiographical
                        contexts as a basis for explorations of memory and selfhood (cf.
                        introductory overviews by Chaplin; McGavran and Smith Daniel; McGillis).
                        Already these examples of two canonical poets suggest that no such thing as
                        one homogeneous, self-evident and fixed concept of “the Romantic child”
                        exists in the literature of the period. Although we are very much aware of
                        this variety, we employ the term “the Romantic child” as a perceived norm in
                        contemporary fiction. It is above all the celebratory stance, the idea of
                        childhood as a near-sacred stage of inherent yet transient goodness and
                        innocence, which has enjoyed powerful afterlives. </p>
                  <p>In our course, one major goal was that learners become familiar with
                        contemporary fiction’s wide spectrum of responses to this received Romantic
                        norm. A major section of the course addressed these responses in detail by
                        examining three thematically and formally disparate novels: Ian McEwan’s
                            <title level="m">The Cement Garden</title> (1979), Doris Lessing’s
                            <title level="m">The Fifth Child</title> (1988), and John Boyne’s <title level="m">The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas</title> (2006). Discussions of
                        the novels drew on constructivist approaches to childhood. Such approaches
                        first emerged in the 1980s with the rise of the so-called “new sociology of
                        childhood.” Directed against a “widespread tendency to routinize and
                        ‘naturalize’ childhood” in a variety of discourses in which it is “regarded
                        as necessary and inevitable, and thus part of normal life” (Jenks 7), the
                        most central assumption in this field is that childhood is a variable social
                        and cultural construct (Prout and James 8) determined by complex power
                        structures. </p>
                  <p>In literary studies, childhood is still predominately associated with the
                        study of children’s literature, although an increasing amount of research
                        into other literary genres has emerged in recent years under the heading of
                        “children in literature.” Several survey texts constitute helpful resources
                        for teachers and students and were consulted for the design of this course.

                        specific literary and cultural contexts and epochs. <title level="m">The
                            Children’s Culture Reader</title> (1998), edited by Henry Jenkins,
                        comprises central theoretical texts from a variety of disciplines. Karín
                        Lesnik-Oberstein’s volumes <title level="m">Children in Culture</title>
                        (1998) and <title level="m">Children in Culture Revisited</title> (2011)
                        contain a broad range of interdisciplinary contributions. Slightly older,
                        but nevertheless relevant monographs include Peter Coveney’s <title level="m">The Image of Childhood: The Individual and Society: A Study of
                            the Theme in English Literature </title>(1967), Reinhard Kuhn’s <title level="m">Corruption in Paradise: The Child in Western
                            Literature</title> (1982), and Hugh Cunningham’s <title level="m">The

                        and contemporary fiction are Susan Honeyman’s <title level="m">Elusive
                            Childhood: Impossible Representations in Modern Fiction</title> (2005)
                        and Ellen Pifer’s <title level="m">Demon or Doll? Images of the Child in
                            Contemporary Writing and Culture </title>(2000). James Holt McGavran’s
                        collections <title level="m">Literature and the Child: Romantic
                            Continuations, Postmodern Contestations</title> (1999) and <title level="m">Time of Beauty, Time of Fear: The Romantic Legacy in the
                            Literature of Childhood</title> (2012) are two rare examples centering
                        on childhood from a post-Romantic perspective. The largest corpus of
                        secondary literature derives from scholarship on Romantic literature,
                        including, for instance, Judith Plotz’s <title level="m">Romanticism and the
                            Vocation of Childhood</title> (2001) and Ann Wierda Rowland’s <title level="m">Romanticism and Childhood: The Infantilization of British
                            Literary Culture</title> (2012).</p>
                  <p>It should not come as a surprise that this recent interest in constructions
                        of childhood in sociology and literary studies has been paralleled by a wave
                        of research focusing on the multifaceted legacies of and responses to
                        Romanticism. These studies have looked at cultural and literary afterlives
                        of Romanticism throughout Victorianism, Modernism, and Postmodernism.
                        Examples include Edward Larrissy’s volume <title level="m">Romanticism and
                            Postmodernism</title> (1999), Andrew Radford and Mark Sandy’s <title level="m">Romantic Echoes in the Victorian Era</title> (2008), Carmen
                        Casaliggi and Paul March-Russell’s <title level="m">Legacies of Romanticism:
                            Literature, Culture, Aesthetics (</title>2012), and Michael O’Neill’s
                        monograph <title level="m">The All-Sustaining Air: Romantic Legacies and
                            Renewals in British, American, and Irish Poetry since 1900</title>
                        (2007). While the interest in poetic inheritances of Romanticism is
                        certainly not a new phenomenon (cf. earlier publications by Bloom [1976] or
                        Bornstein [1976]), scholarship has broadened its scope as it regards the
                        cultural range of post-Romantic material examined, from poetry to pop music,
                        films, and fiction. Recent studies also increasingly point to the challenge
                        of defining Romanticism as a literary epoch and of conceptualizing the very
                        idea of its continuities or legacies.</p>
                  <p>This research therefore provides a second fruitful point of departure for
                        discussing contemporary fiction’s negotiation of “the Romantic child” in the
                        classroom. A term pervading these studies that may prove helpful is the
                        notion of the “post-Romantic.” This term, which has mostly been used in a
                        historical sense but has hardly been theoretically defined, lends itself
                        well as a structural category to describe the simultaneous affirmations of
                        and resistances to the “norm” of Romantic childhood as found in contemporary
                        novels. Through the prefix “post,” it puts emphasis on the (self-conscious)
                        awareness of historical and conceptual difference as viewed from the
                        perspective of the contemporary. As Michael O’Neill asserts, with regard to
                        twentieth-century poetry, “‘Post-Romantic’ is, in its way, as uncertain and
                        fluid a term as ‘Romantic’; it is a necessary term, however, since, even as
                        poets . . . seek to renew the Romantic for a later age, they are
                        conscious of differences from Romanticism” (10). </p>
                  <p>Reading negotiations of the “naturally” innocent child in post-1980s fiction
                        as post-Romantic thus highlights the self-conscious dimension of responses
                        to Romantic concepts in these texts. The notion of post-Romanticism enables
                        students to develop an awareness of literary epochs as heterogeneous
                        constructions, which emerge <emph>a posteriori</emph> and may change over
                        time. In this context, students may be invited to reflect on the importance
                        of maintaining a self-critical distance towards seemingly given concepts in
                        literary scholarship. The importance of such an awareness is of course a key
                        argument of Jerome McGann’s <title level="m">The Romantic Ideology</title>
                        (1985), which points to the risk encountered by any reader of Romantic—and,
                        indeed, post-Romantic—texts of pursuing an “uncritical absorption in
                        Romanticism’s own self-representations” (1).</p>

                  <head>Teaching (Post-)Romantic Childhoods: The Course</head>
                  <p>Our course on “(Post-)Romantic Childhoods in British Literature” was part of
                        the module “Advanced British Studies” designed for third year undergraduate
                        students at a German university. In order to be admitted to the degree
                        program <title level="m">Anglistik: British and American Studies</title>,
                        which is taught entirely in English, students need to demonstrate advanced
                        skills in English (level C1/C2 of the Common European Framework of Reference
                        for Languages). The participants had practiced the analysis and discussion
                        of literary and historical texts in previous modules and had acquired a
                        basic overview of the literary history of the British Isles. They were thus
                        familiar with the tools and literary categories necessary for the analysis
                        and interpretation of poetry and narrative as well as a critical reception
                        of secondary literature. To a lesser extent, they had already engaged in
                        reading critical theory. Noteworthy in the specific context of post-Romantic
                        childhoods is the fact that most participants studied English literature as
                        part of a degree that would lead to the German postgraduate certificate in
                        secondary school teaching. The course was thus directly linked to the
                        practical dimensions of their future professional lives. Moreover, most
                        students would have encountered essentialist notions of childhood in their
                        pedagogy seminars, notions that our course sought to question. </p>
                  <p>Like most seminars at German universities, the course was taught on a weekly
                        basis for a total of fifteen weeks, with each session consisting of ninety
                        minutes. After the introductory seminar, two weeks were dedicated to
                        theoretical approaches to childhood. A historical overview prepared the
                        group for the engagement with Romantic constructions of childhood in the
                        subsequent three sessions, followed by a brief excursion into the legacy of
                        Romanticism in the Victorian era. The eighth session then moved over to
                        cover contemporary British culture and literature. The remaining seven weeks
                        were dedicated to the three contemporary novels before a final seminar
                        summarized what the students had learned. Three “study questions” were
                        assigned by the tutor in advance of each session (see appendix).</p>
                  <p>The introductory session included a group activity, in which students were
                        asked to define what they believed to constitute “childhood” and
                        “non-childhood” in a chart on a handout (see appendix). What became clear
                        through this exercise was that most students’ conceptions of childhood
                        corresponded to a simplified notion of Romantic childhood; often, however,
                        they were not aware of its origins. Furthermore, students’ definitions of
                        childhood always related to what they claimed to be its binary opposition:
                        adulthood. Students referred to aspects such as sexuality, political
                        participation, paid employment, education, and maturity as distinguishing
                        features of what they regarded as two poles. The chart exercise motivated
                        students to start thinking critically about their assumptions. In the final
                        seminar, they were asked to look at the chart again in order to reflect on
                        the learning outcomes. In addition, an enquiry into the course’s title
                        “(Post-)Romantic Childhoods in British Literature” intended to encourage
                        students to identify some of the leading questions and topics of the course
                        by problematizing the implications of the title’s three major concepts:
                        “Romantic,” “post-Romantic,” and “childhoods.”</p>
                  <p>For the next week, students prepared an excerpt of a seminal theoretical work
                        on childhood: Philippe Ariès’s <title level="m">Centuries of Childhood: A
                            Social History of Family Life</title> (1960). Ariès, a representative of
                        the <foreign>histoire des mentalités</foreign>, is known as the founding
                        father of the constructivist approach. He claimed that the modern conception
                        of childhood as a separate stage in human life with distinct privileges and
                        restrictions arose as a product of a complex set of social transitions
                        active since the Renaissance, such as the formation of the private nuclear
                        family, the institutionalization of education, and newly emerging notions of
                        morality. Despite its massive impact, Ariès’s claims have been harshly
                        critiqued from a variety of angles. Students thus also read Roger Cox’s “The
                        Child in History: Introduction,” a short book chapter which outlines some of
                        the major points of attack. In addition, it proved productive to analyze
                        some of the paintings Ariès refers to in <title level="m">Centuries</title>,
                        including Pieter Brueghel’s <title level="m">The Peasant Dance</title> and
                            <title level="m">Peasant Wedding</title> (both 1568), Hans Holbein’s
                        portrait of Prince Edward (ca. 1538), and the portrait of Barbara Sidney,
                        Countess of Leicester with six of her children painted by Marcus Gheeraerts
                        the Younger (c.1596). The group was asked to describe these pictures, paying
                        attention to aesthetic means, such as composition, colors, and perspective.
                        They noticed that children are constructed as miniature adults, wearing the
                        same clothes and engaging in the same activities as adults. At the same
                        time, they noticed that these paintings also function as prestigious status
                        symbols and cannot be taken as representations of a given reality, which is
                        exactly one of the major points of criticism concerning Ariès’s
                        methodology.</p>
                  <p>The second part of this block moved on to more recent theories. Students
                        prepared an excerpt from Jacqueline Rose’s <title level="m">The Case of
                            Peter Pan: Or the Impossibility of Children’s Fiction</title> (1984) as
                        well as the essay “Childhood Studies: Past, Present and Future” by Martin
                        Woodhead. Woodhead reflects upon transformations in research on childhood,
                        which eventually led to the constructivist paradigms of a disciplinary
                        conglomerate he labels “childhood studies.” We discussed these shifts,
                        related them to their previous reading of Ariès, and critically debated
                        Woodhead’s impetus of “‘child centered’ research” which is “built around
                        children’s agency, their rights and well-being” (25). This agenda partly
                        undermines a constructivist approach as it claims knowledge of “the child”
                        in a process that is, from the start, governed by adults. Rose’s text makes
                        a similar point as it deconstructs children’s fiction as: <quote>a world in
                            which the adult comes first (author, maker, giver) and the child comes
                            after (reader, product, receiver), but where neither of them enter the
                            space in between. To say that the child is inside the book—children’s
                            books are after all as often as not <emph>about</emph> children—is to
                            fall straight into a trap. It is to confuse the adult’s intention to get
                            at the child with the child it portrays. If children’s fiction builds an
                            image of the child inside the book, it does so in order to secure the
                            child who is outside the book, the one who does not come so easily
                            within its grasp. (58, emphasis in original)</quote> As this quotation
                        suggests, Rose problematizes numerous common assumptions about children’s
                        literature. In order to give students an idea of the heated debates Rose
                        triggered amongst scholars, a longer exercise consisted of reading part of
                        Perry Nodelman’s response entitled “The Case of Children’s Fiction: Or The
                        Impossibility of Jacqueline Rose” and relating it to the texts previously
                        read in class.</p>
                  <p>With these theoretical foundations in mind, the fourth seminar gave a broad
                        overview of changing conceptions of childhood in Britain in their social and
                        historical contexts. Harry Hendrick’s “Constructions and Reconstructions of
                        British Childhood: An Interpretative Survey, 1800 to the Present” served as
                        the basis for discussion. Hendrick emphasizes the crucial role of ideology
                        and the desire for control pervading adult perspectives on what constitutes
                        a “proper” childhood (60). He thus introduces the function of constructions
                        of childhood as <emph>norms</emph>, a concept relevant to understanding the
                        lasting power of Romantic ideas of the child in literary texts. Powerpoint
                        slides helped to summarize the central authoritative constructions of
                        childhood listed by Hendrick (including, for example, the “Natural” and the
                        “Romantic child,” the “delinquent child,” the “schooled child,” the “child
                        of the nation,” and the “psychological child”). In a group exercise,
                        students worked with two documents that exemplified Hendrick’s claims: an
                        extract from Rousseau’s <title level="m">Emile</title> (1762) and John
                        Locke’s <title level="m">Some Thoughts Concerning Education</title> (1693).
                        As the authors and origin of the text passages were not given to the
                        students, they had to deduct which of Hendrick’s concepts the respective
                        text advocated and guess the authors themselves.</p>
                  <p>This overview paved the way for two weeks focusing on literature from the
                        Romantic period. For the fifth session, students prepared a section from
                        Aidan Day’s introduction to Romanticism that focuses on “Constructions of
                        the term ‘Romantic’” as well as three of Wordsworth’s shorter lyric poems,
                        “We are Seven,” “Lucy Gray,” and “My Heart Leaps up When I Behold.” The
                        chronology was reversed here and Blake was discussed in the subsequent week,
                        so that a full seminar could be devoted to the <title level="m">Songs of
                            Innocence and of Experience</title>. Day’s chapter served to reactivate
                        students’ prior knowledge of the Romantic period and its key authors,
                        concepts, and literary practices. Day also emphasizes the fact that literary
                        epochs are always conceptualized retrospectively: “the identification and
                        historical description of a named British Romantic movement really began to
                        take shape only in the second half of the [nineteenth] century” (87). This
                        insight may help students more generally to understand how childhood came to
                        be associated prominently with the Romantics. Powerpoint slides helped to
                        briefly outline concepts such as the sublime, the elevation of the poet as
                        prophet, and the poetic focus on subjectivity and authenticity. Some of
                        these issues could be linked to ideas of childhood as encountered earlier in
                        the seminar series, for example in Hendrick’s text. The second half of the
                        seminar was then dedicated to Wordsworth’s poems. The aim was to highlight
                        his use of natural motifs in relation to children, the role of the
                        autobiographical self, and the function of the seeming simplicity of verse
                        structures and other linguistic features that support the idea of childhood
                        as a superior state, which is celebrated by the speaker. The advantage of
                        Wordsworth’s shorter works for the teaching scenario was clearly the
                        accessibility of these texts in terms of vocabulary and structure. <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, the Immortality Ode, and other longer
                        works were briefly introduced by the lecturer and suggested as possible
                        topics for student essays.</p>
                  <p>The next seminar then took a chronological step backwards, looking at Blake’s
                            <title level="m">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</title> in their
                        entirety. At home, the students had researched the pastoral tradition and
                        acquired contextual information on Blake’s illustration and writing
                        practices from Mary Lynn Johnson and John E. Grant’s introduction to the
                            <title level="m">Songs</title> (Blake 811). They were also asked to
                        think about similarities and differences between the introductory poems to
                        the volume’s two sections, which helped to explore the opposing states of
                        innocence and experience. Divided into five groups, the class studied “The
                        Lamb,” “Little Black Boy,” and “The Chimney Sweeper” from the <title level="m">Innocence</title> section, as well as “Holy Thursday” and “The
                        School Boy” from the <title level="m">Experience</title> section. The form
                        and content of Blake’s seemingly simple yet symbolically charged lyrics were
                        analysed, with special attention paid to their uses and their
                        functionalization of childhood. Similarities with and differences to
                        Wordsworth were examined, for example with regard to the function of the
                        lyrical persona, religious motifs, and the hymn-like structure of many of
                        Blake’s “songs.”</p>
                  <p>Having thus covered some canonical Romantic conceptualizations of childhood,
                        while also pointing out differences among poets, the course then took a
                        brief excursion into the Victorian period, taking as a point of focus
                        Chapters I to IV of Charles Dickens’s <title level="m">Oliver Twist
                        </title>(1837–39). The novel was introduced as central to the ambivalent
                        “cult” of childhood in Victorian literature and culture. The Victorians were
                        also the first in England to establish the idea of Romanticism as a literary
                        movement as such—in a way, acting as posthumous creators of the Romantics.
                        Finally, Dickens constitutes an initial canonical example for discussing
                        post-Romantic textual strategies—how authors adopt, but also extend or
                        subvert aspects of Wordsworth’s or Blake’s Romantic childhoods. The session
                        was introduced with a historical contextualization of the themes covered in
                            <title level="m">Oliver Twist</title>. The class gained a more profound
                        idea of the miserable condition of the lower classes in Victorian England,
                        looking at the situation in the workhouses and key government policies, such
                        as the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act. The classroom discussion of the novel
                        was partly informed by an article on childhood in Dickens by Robert Newsom,
                        who delineates but also questions Dickens’s decisive role in perpetuating
                        Romantic ideas of childhood in fiction. The students examined the beginning
                        of <title level="m">Oliver Twist</title> in regard to its melodramatic
                        sentimentalizing of the child character, its use of an authorial narrator
                        and irony, hyperbole, and other tropes. While the class easily recognized
                        continuations from Wordsworth’s and Blake’s works, they also reflected on
                        alterations in comparison to Romantic constructions of the child. These were
                        also related to the different characteristics and techniques of the social
                        novel as opposed to poetry. </p>
                  <p>The subsequent session left the nineteenth century behind and addressed the
                        current state of childhood in Britain. An inquiry into the alleged crisis of
                        childhood from the Thatcher years up to the present day provided the first
                        thematic focus. Students began by reading a copy of the entry “Disappearance
                        of Loss of Childhood” from Allison James and Adrian James’s <title level="m">Key Concepts in Childhood Studies</title>. James and James refer to
                        Neil Postman’s thesis that there has been a disappearance of childhood in
                        contemporary society based on the transition from textual to visual media.
                        Students were asked to scrutinize some of the rather problematic arguments
                        Postman provides and to formulate counter-arguments to his hypothesis. They
                        referred to the opposing thesis of a prolongation of childhood and
                        adolescence in late modernity, the datedness of Postman’s argument in the
                        age of the digital revolution as well as his ignorance regarding children’s
                        media literacies. Students were then asked to debate how Phil Scraton’s more
                        nuanced texts and the newspaper article by Amelia Hill et al. position
                        themselves towards the notion of a crisis of childhood and what historical
                        factors and incidents they refer to. Then the discussion shifted to
                        literature. Of particular interest were Katherina Dodou’s claims that
                        “[w]hat is particular about contemporary fiction is the prevalence of the
                        aim to scrutinize the idea that the child is inherently innocent and that
                        this innocence is precious and worth protecting” and that “the contemporary
                        novel invites an approach to the child that views it as an artifact” (239,
                        249). These claims clearly relate to Romantic notions of childhood as
                        previously discussed in class. Furthermore, Dodou points to a
                        “self-consciousness” of contemporary texts concerning their literary
                        precursors, which provides an overarching theme according to which one could
                        analyze the three contemporary novels. </p>
                  <p>The first of these novels was Ian McEwan’s <title level="m">The Cement
                            Garden</title> (1979). Narrated retrospectively by Jack, the eldest
                        brother, the novella depicts a summer in the lives of four siblings who
                        decide to encase their mother’s corpse in cement in the basement of their
                        house instead of informing the local authorities of her death. Without any
                        parental supervision, the children engage in a series of transgressive
                        activities, which climax in sexual intercourse between Jack and Julie, the
                        eldest sister. Whilst obviously breaking with the ideal of childhood as a
                        state of innocence, the novella equally perpetuates and partially perverts
                        simplified notions of Romantic childhood. This shows in the child
                        characters’ primitivism, their utopian spirit, and the nature vs. nurture
                        debate, captured in the once highly stylized and later overgrown garden.
                        After a brief introduction to McEwan’s life and the prevalence of the theme
                        of childhood in his oeuvre (based on Childs), the first exercise consisted
                        of a close reading of the novella’s first paragraph. The students recognized
                        that the paragraph introduces several of the central conflicts and sets up
                        the particular style of Jack’s narration. Further exercises included an
                        analysis of the novella’s constructions and transformations of spaces and
                        temporalities. Noteworthy aspects are the role of the basement as the sphere
                        of the unconscious and the repressed, the garden as a symbol of patriarchy,
                        and the fairytale-like atmosphere evoked by images of sleep and references
                        to timelessness, which prompted several students to a Freudian reading. The
                        lecturer used the opportunity to point out the significant ramifications
                        Freudian psychoanalysis brought about in the twentieth century by
                        introducing theories of infant sexuality. An analysis of McEwan’s
                        constructions of gender and sexuality followed, including the power struggle
                        between Jack and Julie, the employment of the male gaze, Tom’s cross
                        dressing, and the idea of original sin.</p>
                  <p>The next novel considered was Doris Lessing’s <title level="m">The Fifth
                            Child</title> (1988), published only nine years after <title level="m">The Cement Garden</title>, at the height of Thatcherism in Britain.
                        Often interpreted as a Gothic narrative (Anievas Gamallo 115), the novella
                        focuses on the couple Harriet and David Lovatt whose family idyll shatters
                        when their eponymous fifth child Ben is born. Narrated by a third-person
                        narrator and internally focalized through Harriet (and thus formally
                        distinct from <title level="m">The Cement Garden</title>) Lessing’s novella
                        constructs Ben as a deviant, violent, and opaque child. Ben’s perspective,
                        in contrast, is left out. The aim of the first session was to read Ben as an
                        allegorical figure against the backdrop of Thatcherism, as initiated by one
                        of the study questions. As various scholars have noted, Ben can be viewed as
                        “figure of the ‘enemy within’” (Yelin 104) as “Lessing utilizes the
                        xenophobic paranoia characteristic of Britain in the aftermath of the
                        Falklands War as a departure point for a comprehensive satirical dismantling
                        of the contradictions and paradoxes that render Thatcherism unsustainable
                        and doom it to collapse” (Brock 7). After a broad introduction to the 1980s
                        in Britain, students analyzed the Lovatt family as a microcosm of
                        Thatcherism (Brock 7). </p>
                  <p>The subsequent session drew attention to the issue of childhood as it focused
                        on Ben and his constellation to the other child characters. In a close
                        reading of Ben’s birth (Lessing 59–62), students explored the strategies and
                        metaphorical language the narrator employs to construct Ben as “the other.”
                        At this point the tutor also introduced Freud’s notion of “the uncanny” as a
                        possible approach to read his otherness. Afterwards, students compared the
                        literary construction of Ben to his siblings Helen, Luke, and Paul whose
                        “fair hair and blue eyes and pink cheeks” (27) can be read as a
                        stereotypical reference to Romantic imagery of childhood. The major aim of
                        this exercise was to make students aware of the fact that Lessing
                        self-consciously juxtaposes and complicates different constructions of
                        childhood. Whereas Ben clearly deviates from the norm of the innocent and
                        endearing child, he nevertheless remains the novel’s center of attention; by
                        contrast, the other child characters do not advance beyond their status as
                        rather underdeveloped archetypes. </p>
                  <p>The final two sessions on contemporary fiction dealt with John Boyne’s
                        controversial <title level="m">The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas</title> (2006)
                        and its 2008 film adaptation by Mark Herman. The novel is set in Nazi
                        Germany, a challenging and problematic context for negotiating childhood. It
                        concerns the unlikely friendship between Bruno, the nine-year-old son of an
                        SS officer, and Shmuel, a Jewish boy imprisoned in a death camp. Again
                        narrated by a third-person narrator and internally focalized through Bruno,
                        the novel instrumentalizes and exaggerates concepts of childhood innocence
                        and ignorance as Bruno displays no knowledge whatsoever of the Nazi regime.
                        Two study questions prepared the students for a discussion of the allegation
                        that the novel downplays the cruelty of the Holocaust. In addition, they
                        were asked to come up with two study questions themselves and to post them
                        on the course’s e-learning platform.</p>
                  <p>Bearing the controversies in mind, the first session on Boyne also gave
                        students time to reflect on whom they considered to be the novel’s target
                        audience, based on its narrative techniques, plot, and themes. The novel can
                        be approached as a work of crossover fiction, being marketed for children
                            <emph>and</emph> adult readers. The following seminar then looked in
                        more detail at the sentimental functionalization of Romantic childhood by
                        means of character construction, narrative perspective, and setting. These
                        issues were taken up again when discussing excerpts of the film adaptation
                        of the novel. Here, the students could practice translating their acquired
                        knowledge about childhood from narrative texts to film. Participants
                        examined how the film struggles to approximate the novel’s construction of
                        the child characters’ strikingly limited capacity to “see,” evident, for
                        example, in Bruno’s inability to interpret the symbolic meaning of the
                        swastika.</p>
                  <p>The final week concluded the course by returning to the chart on “childhood”
                        and “non-childhood” compiled in week one, an exercise that enabled students
                        to revise their original preconceptions about childhood. In order to
                        recapitulate the knowledge acquired throughout the course, groups worked on
                        an unmarked end of term quiz, which included one question for each week’s
                        contents. Based on the seminar group’s feedback and the tutor’s own
                        reflections, we can conclude that the course achieved most of its goals. The
                        students appreciated that the subject of childhood serves as a point of
                        departure to explore a great variety of socio-political contexts (e.g., the
                        Victorian workhouse and the New Right in Britain), theoretical approaches
                        (e.g., the history of mentalities and psychoanalysis), and aesthetic and
                        formal concepts (e.g., the sublime and the pastoral). They also found the
                        study questions particularly helpful. A point of criticism was the high
                        workload, particularly the lengthy texts. From the tutor’s point of view, it
                        can be noted that the particular design of this course afforded a great
                        amount of preparation and marking. This was largely due to the size of the
                        group (forty students), which made it difficult to include more
                        learner-centered activities, such as student presentations. Whereas in the
                        class discussions students demonstrated a profound understanding of the
                        constructivist approach, some of the essays still displayed essentialist
                        notions of childhood. This could be seen as a consequence of the demanding,
                        often meta-theoretical, issues addressed in this course. It must also be
                        admitted that the course excluded over one hundred and fifty years of
                        British literary history between the early Victorian period and the present,
                        which could also have been studied in terms of post-Romantic engagements
                        with childhood. However, as we hope to have shown, the topic of
                        post-Romantic childhoods provides further scope for both research and
                        teaching. </p>

                    affective environment through the medium of British Romantic literature. The
                    following discussion offers a pedagogical framework and theoretical

                  <p>In what way does Edward Snowden’s story read like an updated version of

                        the Boston marathon bombers, how would the poem change? How would Ann
                        Radcliffe dramatize the experience of encountering an unattended bag while
                        waiting at the airport? These are only a few of the questions that students
                        considered in their final creative projects for my Hampshire College seminar
                        on “Literature in the Age of Terror.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Thank
                            you to the students enrolled in the Spring 2014 course I taught at
                            Hampshire College: Taylor Carlson, Nikolas Costello, Hillary Lynch,
                            Christian May, Teddy S. Miller, Dominic Poropat, Rae Purdom, Michael
                            Samblas, Renata Anuhea Sebstad, Ben Socolofsky, Sofia (last name
                            withheld), and a student who wishes to remain anonymous. I am also
                            grateful to Kate Singer for commenting on a draft of this essay as well
                            as L. Brown Kennedy and Marc Redfield for their input on the seminar.
                        </note> The assignment asked them to compose a poem or short narrative that
                        addresses our contemporary situation in the voice or characteristic literary
                        style of a Romantic-era writer. Or as I put it in my willfully anachronistic
                        prompt: if one of the British Romantics were alive today, how would he or
                        she craft a literary response to 9/11 and the ensuing War on Terror? </p>
                  <p>Instead of assigning a traditional analytic essay in which students might
                        compare the concerns of British Romantic literature and culture with those
                        of our twenty-first-century moment, I invited the class to write in a
                        creative mode. The approach let them tap into the affective registers of
                        historical consciousness that eludes analytic writing, or so Thomas Pfau’s
                            <title level="m">Romantic Moods</title> leads me to argue. To guide
                        their efforts, I had everyone transpose their present perspectives into the
                        idiom of Romantic literature. Imitating the voice of a Romantic-era writer
                        provided a methodology for estranging one’s affective environment and
                        thereby making it newly available for analysis. The resulting exercise
                        enabled students to produce what Jonathan Flatley terms an “affective map”
                        of the attunement between past and present.</p>
                  <p>The seminar drew on British Romantic literature as a medium for reflecting on
                        our emotional life in the present. Instead of asking what makes the
                        twenty-first-century experience of terror new, I posed a different question:
                        where have we already seen our own range of moods and structures of feeling
                        before? Toward this end, I led the class through a series of texts—among
                        them, Ann Radcliffe’s <title level="m">Mysteries of Udolpho</title> (1794),
                        William Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> (1794), and Jane
                        Austen’s <title level="m">Persuasion</title> (1816)—that are fascinated by
                        how impersonal historical forces condition one’s moods, sentiments, and
                        visceral sensations. These readings served, in turn, as the occasion to put
                        British anxieties about the French “Reign of Terror” and subsequent
                        Napoleonic Wars into dialogue with America’s cultural response to 9/11. My
                        goal was to reframe the age of terror as doubly contemporary, which is to
                        say both characteristic of the present and simultaneous with the late
                        eighteenth and early nineteenth century. </p>
                  <p>To borrow Walter Scott’s comment from the “Dedicatory Epistle” to <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title>, I encouraged students to search for the
                        “extensive neutral ground” between past and present (18). At the same time,
                        my comparative approach relied on the otherness of Romantic-era literature
                        to reorient or even disorient our intuitive understanding of things as they
                        are, to borrow Godwin’s phrase. Oscillating between affinity and alterity,
                        the seminar routed today’s affective attachments through the foreignness of
                        the past while simultaneously foregrounding an abiding archive of
                        intensities that were set into motion by British Romantic literature. My
                        underling premise was that category of affect could enable a pivot (or
                        series of pivots) between the Romantic and the contemporary. Consistent with
                        the notoriously unsettled meaning of the word “affect,” my use of the term
                        indicates a broad array of felt experiences that warp the cognition of time. </p>
                  <p>The following essay describes the pedagogical rationale behind my course’s
                        untimely treatment of “Literature in the Age of Terror.” To begin, I explain
                        my strategies for juxtaposing our contemporary age of terror with its
                        Romantic-era double. From there, I draw on the work of Thomas Pfau and
                        Jonathan Flatley to justify my core methodology: constructing a comparative
                        archive of affective intensities to calibrate the interplay between British
                        Romantic literature and culture and our post-9/11 moment. The essay
                        concludes by assessing the writing that my students completed for their
                        final projects. </p>

                  <head>I. Teaching the Romantic with the contemporary</head>
                  <p>At the outset of the semester, my first task was to persuade the class that
                        it makes sense to study late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century
                        literature alongside the contemporary. To establish a connection between
                        these two seemingly disparate moments, I turned to Marc Redfield’s <title level="m">The Rhetoric of Terror</title>, which argues that <quote>our
                            specifically political use of the words “terror” and “terrorism” emerged
                            at the end of the eighteenth century, forming part of the broad
                            historical phenomenon that literary scholars call romanticism. The
                            capitalized nominative “Terror” has, of course, a historiographical
                            referent: it designates more or less the period between the fall of the
                            Girondins (June 1793) and the fall of Robespierre (July 27, 1794 or 9
                            Thermidor). (72)</quote> To Redfield’s point, the <title level="m">Oxford English Dictionary</title> cites Edmund Burke and Helen Maria
                        Williams as among the first to introduce the word “terrorist” into the
                        English language circa 1795 as a pejorative label for violent political
                        actors (“Terrorist, n. and adj”). While Redfield acknowledges that “we
                        obviously no longer mean quite the same things by ‘terrorist’ that Burke
                        did,” it is nevertheless fair to say that British anxieties about the French
                        Revolution crystalize emerging notions about terror, terrorism, and
                        terrorists (73). </p>
                  <p>Building on this point, I invited students to compare our current
                        geopolitical situation with that of the Romantic authors we were reading.
                        For instance, I called their attention to the time that elapsed between
                        William Wordsworth’s travels in France during the early 1790s and his
                        eventual description of those experiences in the 1805 <title level="m">Prelude</title>. What does Wordsworth’s belated reflection on the
                        French Revolution have to teach us about our own evolving response to the
                        trauma of 9/11, I asked? Likewise, I proposed that the wars in Iraq and
                        Afghanistan offer a twenty-first-century parallel for the Napoleonic Wars
                        that contextualize Jane Austen’s <title level="m">Persuasion</title>. In
                        this light, Austen’s novel provides an opportunity to consider the personal
                        costs of the protracted military conflicts that define our moment. </p>
                  <p>To complement the discussion, I introduced students to scholarship that
                        implicitly or explicitly affirms Romanticism’s bearing on the present. We
                        began the semester by considering Terry Castle’s thought-provoking
                        observations about the continuity between visual representations of 9/11 and
                        the history of art that finds sublimity in scenes of destruction. Through
                        John Barrell’s account of the British obsession with imagining political
                        violence during the mid-1790s, we saw the makings of twenty-first-century
                        arguments both for and against government surveillance and other
                        anti-terrorism measures. Jan Mieszkowski’s analysis of Coleridge’s “Fears in
                        Solitude” prompted a conversation about the patriotic rhetoric that followed
                        9/11 and the Boston marathon bombing. What David Clark describes as Kant’s
                        wariness about celebrating military victory also raises hard questions about
                        the riotous celebrations that took place on American college campuses
                        following the May 2011 assassination of Osama bin Laden. </p>
                  <p>All of these conversations reinforced the point that Romanticism functions as
                        an anachronism in Jerome Christensen’s (or for that matter, Percy Bysshe
                        Shelley’s) sense of the term: namely, a “potent icon of the past’s
                        incapacity to coincide with itself, to seal itself off as a period or epoch
                        or episode with no or necessary consequences for our time. Anachronism is
                        the herald of the future as yet unknown” (3). Christensen’s formulation
                        usefully challenged the class’s tendency to assume that the eighteenth and
                        nineteenth centuries are over and done with. Instead, he suggests that
                        Romanticism cannot be walled off behind the perfected closure of the past.
                        As with all writing, the definitive meaning of British Romantic literature
                        has yet to be written; its history remains in process and open to future
                        reinterpretation.</p>

                  <head>II. Creative imitation assignment</head>
                  <p>In keeping with the seminar’s embrace of anachronism as a strategy for
                        bringing British Romantic literature into the present, while simultaneously
                        filtering contemporary life through the otherness of the past, I gave
                        students a purposefully anachronistic prompt for their final assignment: if
                        one of the British Romantics were alive today, how would he or she craft a
                        literary response to 9/11 and the ensuing War on Terror? The challenge was
                        to imagine how Ann Radcliffe, for example, might react to our own time. The
                        unorthodox prompt invited the class to compose a creative work that
                        addresses the repercussions of 9/11 in the voice or characteristic style of
                        a Romantic-era writer. But why ask students to write in a creative mode
                        instead of composing a traditional, analytic essay? Furthermore, how does
                        literary imitation give students a fresh perspective on the present? What’s
                        to be gained by using Romantic literature to remediate our contemporary
                        situation?</p>
                  <p>My response to the first question expands upon arguments put forward in
                        Thomas Pfau’s <title level="m">Romantic Moods</title>. In light of Pfau’s
                        discussion, I take the view that creative writing makes it possible for
                        students to tap into the affective registers of historical consciousness
                        that cannot quite be put into propositional statements. Drawing on Kant and
                        Heidegger, Pfau theorizes what he terms the mood of history, which
                        “speaks—if only circumstantially—to the deep-structural situatedness of
                        individuals within history as something never actually intelligible to them
                        in fully coherent, timely, and definitive form” (7). In Pfau’s account, mood
                        channels the latent force of historical events that otherwise elude
                        conscious understanding. Rather than look to “what may be logically verified
                        and discursively represented as knowledge,” Pfau contends that history’s
                        power makes itself felt on a visceral level. Indeed, Pfau maintains that an
                        affective understanding of one’s historical condition cannot be properly
                        represented or pinned down (10). To adapt a remark from Favret, mood “offers
                        up symptoms of a history not entirely possessed” (146). Applying Pfau’s
                        discussion to my own pedagogy, I deemphasized assignments that required
                        students to explicitly define their historical situatedness in favor of
                        offering creative writing as a practice that let the class access an
                        otherwise inchoate spirit of our age. </p>
                  <p>If anything, college-age students in 2016 are primed to reflect on the
                        affective tenor of historical experience. After all, they were only in
                        kindergarten or first grade—five or six years old,—when the World Trade
                        Center and Pentagon attacks occurred. Experiencing 9/11 and its aftermath
                        from a child’s perspective gives today’s young people an intuitive
                        understanding of the visceral yet elusive force of historical events that
                        are felt more than understood.</p>
                  <p>But why should my class’s efforts to mobilize the affective dimension of
                        historical consciousness take the form of a literary imitation, as I
                        stipulate in my assignment? Building on Jonathan Flatley’s notion of <title level="m">Affective Mapping</title>, I argue that the work of emulating
                        a historical literary style can estrange one’s affective environment while
                        simultaneously activating the felt relation between past and present.
                        According to Flatley, affective mapping serves as “a technology for the
                        representation to oneself of one’s own historically conditioned and changing
                        affective life” (7). The procedure works through self-estrangement:
                            <quote>By this term [self-estrangement] . . . I mean a self-distancing
                            that allows one to see oneself as if from outside. But I also mean
                            estrangement in the sense of defamiliarization, making one’s emotion
                            life—one’s range of moods, set of structures of feeling, and collection
                            of affective attachments—appear weird, surprising, unusual, and thus
                            capable of a new kind of recognition, interest, and analysis.
                            (80)</quote> Affective mapping entails a depersonalization of the moods,
                        sentiments, and visceral sensations that are commonly taken as the hallmark
                        of selfhood. In order to decouple affect from subjectivity, Flatley invokes
                        the specifically aesthetic device of defamiliarization.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a seminal discussion of this technique, see Viktor
                            Shklovsky’s “Art as Device.”</note> As with Pfau, Flatley contends that
                        literary writing has the capacity to reframe one’s affective makeup as
                        other, or <emph>not</emph> one’s own, and hence render it freshly available. </p>
                  <p>To give Flatley’s discussion a concrete pedagogical application, I asked my
                        classes to imitate a Romantic-era author on the syllabus. On the one hand,
                        doing so made our “now” resemble the otherness of a “then.” On the other
                        hand, the reverse is also true, in that any movement away from our “own”
                        moment and into the Romantic period eventually makes a circuitous return to
                        the moods and affects that define the present as much as the past. Through
                        their writing project, students hereby produced maps or mappings in the
                        sense of calibrating the resonance between Romanticism’s structure of
                        feeling and our contemporary mood. As Flatley aptly observes, “we never
                        experience an affect for the first time; every affect contains within it an
                        archive of its previous objects” (81). My goal was to provide students with
                        a framework for charting the age of terror that inflects both the Romantic
                        and the contemporary.</p>

                  <head>III. The affect of uncertain times</head>
                  <p>The result was a wealth of thought-provoking work examining what Mary Favret
                        describes as the affect of everyday war. Students gravitated to Austen’s
                            <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb
                            Williams</title>, and Radcliffe’s <title level="m">Mysteries of
                            Udolpho</title> as touchstones for mapping the changing contours of
                        daily life in the aftermath of 9/11. Channeling an array of affects that
                        ranged from the banal to the phantasmatic, regret to dread, curiosity to
                        paranoid anxiety, the class used their creative writing to investigate the
                        feeling of being adrift in uncertain times. In the double sense of that last
                        phrase, my students’ projects suggested that the War on Terror has
                        disoriented their sense of time and destabilized their sense of
                        certainty.</p>
                  <p>To understand how students went about capturing the echoes of war in everyday
                        life, consider the work of Hillary Lynch, who rewrote Coleridge’s “Fears in
                        Solitude” as if it were composed during the April 2013 manhunt for the
                        Boston marathon bombers. Aptly retitled “Fears in Collective Solitude,”
                        Lynch’s poetic imitation explores the strange time that Bostonians spent
                        “sheltering in place”: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>They all wait alone, together, breath held.</l>

                           <l>Facing towards the sky, looking for answers. (unpublished
                                    essay)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> Where Coleridge’s original poem contends that the threat
                        of war has a pernicious influence on public discourse, Lynch underscores the
                        similarly far-reaching impact of an actual terror attack, which reverberates
                        out from the scene of carnage to radically disrupt the ordinary routines and
                        daily rhythms of an entire country. According to Lynch, the collective
                        terror of “wait[ing] along, together, breadth held” has a visceral intensity
                        that distantly echoes the physical damage wrought on Boylston Street. What
                        Favret says about Austen’s <title level="m">Persuasion</title> applies
                        equally well to Lynch’s Coleridgean rendition of the Boston bombings: both
                        “reveal the everyday not as a zone of peace in contrast to a distant war,
                        but as the unspectacular register or correspondent of wartime” (154). Dogs
                        go quiet, children fall silent, personified flowers wither; the mundane
                        becomes uncanny. Such is the unspectacular yet palpably affecting reality of
                        a terror attack.</p>
                  <p>The spectacle of war has no less of an effect on the phantasmagoria of our
                        emotional lives, or so student Rae Purdom holds. Specifically, Purdom offers
                        a Radcliffean meditation on the medium of television news, which
                        simultaneously reports distant conflicts and evokes the ghostly presence of
                        a lost love one. Purdom takes her inspiration from the scene in which Emily
                        St. Aubert returns to the library of her recently deceased father. Coming
                        upon her father’s armchair and an open book by one of his favorite authors,
                        “the idea of him rose so distinctly to [Emily’s] mind,” writes Radcliffe,
                        “that she almost fancied she saw him before her” (95). In Purdom’s version,
                        the familiar easy chair faces a television tuned to CNN. As the stream of
                        martial images washes over her, Purdom’s young protagonist, Jessica, recalls
                            <quote>watching <title level="m">Apocalypse Now </title>with her [dead]
                            mother, who would have sat in this armchair and played gently with
                            Jessica’s hair to soothe her and keep her grounded in the safety of
                            home, far from the threat of imminent violence, as the [television]
                            announcer intoned the words, “guerilla warfare,” and Jessica felt the
                            absence of her mother’s hand tousling her hair. (unpublished essay)
                        </quote> In keeping with what Terry Castle describes as that
                        characteristically Radcliffean tendency to “spectralize” the dead or absent
                        as “an image . . . on the screen of consciousness itself,” Purdom uses the
                        medium of the television to frame the ghostly intersection between
                        geopolitical conflict and personal loss (“Spectralization” 237).
                        Specifically, Purdom brings Jessica’s visceral encounter with the felt
                        “absence of her mother’s hand tousling her hair” into alignment with the
                        ambient grief of watching war from a distance.</p>
                  <p>Another distinctive feature of Purdom’s efforts to map the resonance between
                        home life and a war zone is the gesture of conflating Vietnam, 9/11, and the
                        “threat of imminent violence” into one long, interminable conflict. Purdom’s
                        anachronistic thinking is just one example of the class’s broader interest
                        in the affect of broken time. Fellow student Michael Samblas makes the point
                        explicit in noting that like contemporary Americans, the characters of
                        Austen’s <title level="m">Persuasion</title> are caught between regretting
                        the past and dreading the future: <quote>Ever since the September 11
                            attacks, we have been constantly looking back at that momentous event,
                            and allowing it to define our society to this day. We constantly refer
                            to the time we live in as “post 9/11” and observe the anniversary of the
                            event every year. This is in keeping with Austen’s themes of living in
                            the past . . . [Having said that] our obsession with the past
                            seems to stem more from a fear of having to repeat it. Austen’s
                            characters, on the other hand, are actively <emph>trying</emph> to
                            relive these moments that they keep reflecting back on. (unpublished
                            essay)</quote> Just as Anne Elliot’s life stagnates during the almost
                        eight years since she ended her brief engagement with Captain Frederick
                        Wentworth and he went off to war, our “post-9/11” era likewise seems to
                        hover around the recent past, Samblas astutely observes. The hallmark of
                        our—and Anne’s—belated temporal condition is captured in the fear and/or
                        fantasy that the past is about to repeat itself.</p>
                  <p>Renata Anuhea Sebstad’s imitation of Austen raises the same issue. In her
                        short story, Sebstad dramatizes a mother’s anxiety about a son who is
                        stationed at the military base in Fort Hood, Texas. The Austenian element
                        can be found in Sebstad’s choice to begin her story shortly before the first
                        Fort Hood shooting incident of November 2009 and end just prior to the
                        second mass shooting, which took place in April 2014. Much as Austen’s
                        audience knew that Anne Elliot’s concluding “dread of a future war” would
                        soon become a reality, Sebstad invites her reader to anxiously await an
                        event that has not yet taken place within the diegetic universe of the
                        narrative, thereby validating the protagonist’s overwhelming sense of
                        foreboding. Through the modalities of apprehension and unease, both
                        protagonist and reader intuit that the linear advance of time bends back on
                        itself to form an untimely cycle of violence.</p>
                  <p>Ben Socolofsky picks up the thread again in adopting Radcliffe’s distinctive
                        style of haunted consciousness to evoke the spectral afterlife of 9/11.
                        Reimagining St. Aubert as a casualty of the World Trade Center collapse,
                        Socolofsky follows his daughter, Emily, through the subsequent months of
                        mourning. Of particular interest is Socolofsky’s dramatization of Emily’s
                        post-traumatic encounter with the “Tribute in Light” art installation, which
                        periodically projects two columns of light skyward from the former World
                        Trade Center site. Unable to believe her eyes, Emily briefly wonders whether
                        the Twin Towers are about to collapse all over again—a sense of <emph>déjà
                            vu</emph> reinforced by a subsequent encounter with a
                            <foreign>doppelgänger</foreign> of her dead father. Like Sebstad,
                        Socolofsky explores the recursive temporality of life post-9/11 though the
                        eerie affect of its uncanny repetitions. </p>
                  <p>Even as a number of students sought to elaborate on Favret’s claim that the
                        affect of everyday war “eludes the usual models for organizing time such as
                        linearity, punctuality, and periodicity,” others found that their experience
                        of uncertain times did not raise issues of temporality so much as emphasize
                        their sense of uncertainty (11). For one, Teddy S. Miller used <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> as a vehicle for experimenting with the
                        affect of uncertainty. His piece tells the fictional story of Adael Goldman,
                        a character charged with watching over the shrouded body of Osama bin Laden
                        until it is interred at sea. Like Godwin’s protagonist, Caleb Williams,
                        Adael is consumed by both curiosity and paranoia. On receiving strict orders
                        not to look underneath the corpse’s shroud, Adael becomes obsessed with
                        verifying the identity of the body with his own eyes. At the same time,
                        Adael is unnerved by nagging questions about why he has been left alone with
                        the dead man in the first place and whether he might be under some form of
                        surveillance. </p>
                  <p>The tension between curiosity and paranoia comes to a head in the conclusion
                        of Miller’s short story, which describes the thought process behind Adael’s
                        resolution to keep bin Laden’s body covered: <quote>Not once, even when I
                            held the body in my hands did I allow the veil to slip off and reveal
                            the identity of the man beneath. In doing so I sentenced myself to live
                            the rest of my life in uncertainty, with the only thing that could make
                            me believe in truth again lying at the bottom of the sea. (unpublished
                            essay) </quote> Without attempting to reproduce Godwin’s plot, Miller
                        emulates the dynamic of the novel’s original courtroom ending, in which
                        Falkland never confesses his guilt and Caleb’s accusations remain
                        unverified. As Pfau notes about Godwin’s original ending, “nothing ever
                        offers extrinsic and objective confirmation for Caleb’s key hypothesis
                        regarding Falkland’s guilty past” (140). The point applies equally well to
                        Miller’s conclusion, in which the protagonist fails to confirm bin Laden’s
                        ultimate fate and consequently descends into paranoid uncertainty.</p>
                  <p>Dominic Poropat’s imitation of Radcliffe’s <title level="m">Udolpho</title>
                        achieves similar results by using the device of the “explained supernatural”
                        to prolong doubt and elicit anxiety. In Poropat’s hands, Radcliffe’s
                        much-derided trope becomes a recurrent motif of everyday life post-9/11. To
                        make the point, he dramatizes the experience of a young woman, who
                        encounters an unattended bag while waiting at the airport. After the manner
                        of Austen’s <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>, Poropat’s Radcliffean
                        heroine imbues a commonplace object with supernatural powers and dread
                        import. But unlike Austen, however, Poropat does without parody. In the era
                        of “see something, say something” when everything is simultaneously a
                        potential threat and nothing to be concerned about, Poropat intimates that
                        we have little cause to mock the Radcliffean heroine’s tendency to
                        overreact. His short story makes the point that 9/11 has introduced an
                        element of anxious uncertainty into what we see and how we hear. </p>
                  <p>Despite Austen’s sendup of <title level="m">Udolpho</title>, Poropat implies
                        that we have all become Radcliffean subjects whose exaggerated suspicions
                        and unsubstantiated fears are no laughing matter. When Poropat’s protagonist
                        finally summons the courage to open the suspicious bag, it contains “nothing
                        more than a few mundane travel items,” which she hands over to the lost and
                        found. “Thirty minutes later,” Poropat concludes, “she boarded her plane and
                        forgot all about that old, cracked leather bag.” The anticlimactic
                            <foreign>denouement</foreign> works in part because 9/11 seems to have
                        restored the visceral force of Radcliffe’s much-derided techniques for
                        creating suspense. Paradoxical though it may sound, Poropat succeeds at
                        capturing the specifically <emph>historical</emph> potency of <title level="m">Udolpho</title>’s “explained supernatural” circa 1794 by
                        bringing the trope into the twenty-first century. The resulting exploration
                        simultaneously modernizes Radcliffe and backdates our present-day anxieties
                        about the omnipresent yet unspecified threat of terrorism. </p>

                  <head>IV. Conclusion</head>
                  <p>Poropat’s short narrative shares in the class’s collective effort to map the
                        affective dimension of life in uncertain times. Mobilizing an array of
                        affects that ranged from the banal to the phantasmatic, regret to dread,
                        curiosity to paranoid anxiety, students used their creative writing as a
                        vehicle for tapping into a tacit sense that the “War on Terror” has unmoored
                        their sense of time and left them adrift in doubt. To do so, the class
                        embraced anachronism. By addressing the legacy of 9/11 in the voice or
                        literary style of a writer from the syllabus, students navigated the double
                        contemporaneity that makes Romanticism both characteristic of the present
                        and simultaneous with the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. In

               <epigraph>
                  <quote> . . . the romantic . . . looks like something completely contemptible in
                        the light of literary intellectualism and cynicism. The romantic, however,
                        has a way of renewing itself. It can be said of the romantic, just as it can
                        be said of the imagination, that it can never effectively touch the same
                        thing twice in the same way. It is partly because the romantic will not be
                        what has been romantic in the past that it is preposterous to think of
                        confining poetry hereafter to the revelation of reality. The whole effort of
                        the imagination is toward the production of the romantic. — 20th-century

                  <p rend="noCount">The British romantic period, roughly 1790 – 1830, is generally
                        recognized as one of the most important and influential historical periods
                        of Western literary, cultural, and political activity and thought. While
                        “romanticism” can undoubtedly be studied hermetically, i.e. as an
                        international or national period-specific phenomenon, this class seeks to
                        locate, using T. S. Eliot’s language, not so much what is dead and worthy of
                        recuperation in romanticism, as “what is already living.” We seek to
                        uncover, in other words, those aspects of the romantic that are continually
                        in flux and yet continue to shape the current sense of our own aesthetic,
                        political, and cultural possibilities. To do so we pair texts from the
                        romantic period with resonant postromantic, modernist, and postmodernist
                        texts. Not only do we read poems written over the last two hundred and fifty
                        years, but we also watch movies, read essays and political tracts, read
                        short fiction and drama, and listen to a wide range of music. We read with
                        the assurance that these trans-historical and generic texts allow for a
                        reciprocal critique. Defining the romantic this way means not only
                        historicizing its forms, ideas, and impulses, but also feeling them—that is,
                        recognizing ourselves as subjects, individuals who, whether we identify as
                        inside or outside of our dominant cultural, are nonetheless caught up in
                        something larger than ourselves (language, the nation-state, the
                        unconscious, etc.). Perhaps it might also mean projecting a way (or ways)
                        forward . . . (Class fulfills the pre-1800 requirement)</p>

                            responses to the poems (at least 250 words) we were to read for that
                            week. Your comments should be substantive; they should quote passages
                            from and engage closely with the text. And while you are free to focus
                            primarily on one text, this is an inter-textual and trans-historical
                            class, and you should attempt to interpret across genres and periods, as
                            well as to contextualize your responses within the larger themes of the
                            class. (25 % of grade).</item>
                     <item>2 papers – one short (4-6 pages – 25 % of grade), one long (8-12 pages
                            – 40 % of grade). The short paper uses close reading techniques to
                            examine a poem, story, essay, or film, something that we’ve looked at in
                            class. The second paper should be less of a close reading and more of a
                            research paper. You may also choose to do a creative project as your
                            final but it must be approved beforehand and must not only engage with
                            or reflect some aspect of the romantic (formal and thematic), but you
                            must also write a 3- to 6-page analysis of your own work and its
                            relation to its topic or reiterated form.</item>

                  <head>Why the Nineteenth Century?</head>
                  <p rend="noCount"> This will be an upper-division course on the “long nineteenth
                        century.” Our nineteenth century will start in the eighteenth and end in the
                        twentieth. What kind of a nineteenth century is that?</p>

                  <list type="unordered">
                     <item>literature changes over time and changes gradually (not suddenly at
                            the end of a century), and </item>
                     <item>literature changes because it is in close communication with the world
                            in which it is created: as this world changes, so does the writing in
                            it. </item>
                  </list>
                  <p rend="noCount"> But does the world change the writing or does the writing
                        change the world? The nineteenth century presents some of the greatest
                        examples of writing that changed the world and reflected its enormous
                        changes. To understand how this happened, we will look at the writing
                        created between two dramatic historical bookends to the nineteenth century:
                        the French (Bourgeois) Revolution (1789) and the Russian (Bolshevik)
                        Revolution (1917). Why were there TWO revolutions so close to the nineteenth
                        century? Revolution sounds like serious business. Who would ever dare to
                        start one (let alone two)? Revolutions demand radical change. Where do the
                        revolutionaries get the idea of the new society they demand? What if their
                        vision is not to everyone’s liking? Once it starts, when is a revolution
                        over? What does literature have to do with any of this?</p>
                  <p rend="noCount"> We will read, think and write about how texts and societies
                        interact and what nineteenth-century literature and other texts can tell us
                        about the social and political imagination of the period. We will also begin
                        to learn how to read critical texts about literature written by literary
                        scholars and historians.</p>
