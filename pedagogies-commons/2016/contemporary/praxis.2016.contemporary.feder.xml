                <div type="section">
                    <p>I take my title from a moment this fall when a new colleague welcomed me to
                        the University of Denver Department of English, explaining that I might
                        think of the department’s unofficial mascot as the zonkey, or zebra-donkey
                        hybrid, representing the admixture of critical and creative inquiry. This
                        statement resonates with my own approach to teaching literature, not to
                        mention my penchant for obscure animal metaphors. Without putting too much
                        theoretical or zoological pressure on the descriptive term, in this essay
                        I’ll share one aspect of my approach to zonkey Romanticism, focusing on the
                        inclusion of creative writing assignments in the Romantic literature
                        classroom.</p>
                    <p>The use of creative writing as a teaching tool is, for me, inseparably
                        interlaced with a twinned focus on the Romantic and the contemporary. When
                        I’m explaining my myriad projects to new interlocutors, I often describe
                        myself as an “unromantic Romanticist.” By this I mean that I’m interested in
                        the Romantic as a moment of crisis but I’m uninterested in what I think of
                        as Romantic exceptionalism. This is to say that I find it unproductive to
                        think of Romantic literature as representing a sort of singular moment at
                        which experiment is made possible—a moment that is sometimes thought to
                        reoccur, somehow, during High Modernism. Rather, I am interested in
                        excavating literary and poetic experiment as a historical and
                        transhistorical project or series of projects that cross the boundaries we
                        use to delimit period, coterie, and discourse field. </p>
                    <p>Within the classroom context, this intellectual manifesto translates into a
                        cultural studies approach in which I ask students to read Romantic texts as
                        themselves and then to read their own literary and cultural moment as
                        Romanticists. So, “Early Romantic Literature and the Invention of Poetic
                        Experiment” begins with an in-depth, historicist analysis of <title
                            level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> and concludes with whatever new,
                        exciting poetry has come out that very month (most recently, Sarah Blake’s
                        lyric biography of Kanye West, which the press sent on to us in advance of
                        the publication date). “Later Romantic Literature: Monsters and Rock Stars”
                        approaches texts such as <title level="m">The Vampyre</title> and <title
                            level="m">Don Juan </title>with an emphasis on the interrelated
                        themes of celebrity and monstrosity, and concludes with a collaboratively
                        student-designed unit on monstrosity in contemporary celebrity culture.
                        Throughout these courses, one technique remains consistent: the inclusion of
                        creative writing assignments that ask students to invert their perspective
                        on the Romantic text and to usher that text into their contemporary moment.
                        And, while I wouldn’t take it upon myself to suggest that everyone allow
                        their students to assign the pilot episode of <title level="m">Keeping Up
                            with the Kardashians</title> in a course focused on Keats, Byron, and
                        the Shelleys, it is my conviction and my experience that a creative writing
                        assignment can infuse any Romantics course with critical concern for the
                        contemporary while supporting common student learning outcomes. It is in the
                        service of this conviction that I offer four theses on teaching zonkey
                        Romanticism.</p>

                    <head>1. CREATIVE WRITING IS HYBRID</head>
                    <p>In the context of zonkey Romanticism, “creative writing” refers to hybrid
                        critical/creative projects involving a series of self-reflexive loops and
                        turns that ask students to read and reread Romantic texts and contexts,
                        their own writing, and, ultimately, their own cultural moment. This sort of
                        hybrid writing assignment is, of course, not unique to my classes. I first
                        encountered hybrid critical/creative assignments as an undergraduate student
                        at Colorado College, where one of my favorite professors, Regula Meyer
                        Evitt, would often ask students to, for example, create their own circle of
                        hell and then use a close-reading of their own writing to generate an
                        in-depth analysis of the logic that governs Dante’s <title level="m"
                            >Inferno</title>. Thinking through the benefits of using creative
                        writing in response to texts in the college literature classroom, Peter
                        Wilson has described a “creative-critical spectrum suggested by the
                        following descriptors: creative writing not in response to text, creative
                        writing in response to text, critical-creative re-writing, critical writing
                        in response to text, critical writing not in response to text” (440). Zonkey
                        that I am, I understand the interplay between critical and creative inquiry
                        in less linear terms, all the while subscribing to Wilson’s suggestion that
                        all writing is, to some extent, creative, and that playing with this
                        variable can have profound pedagogical payoffs.</p>
                    <p>For example, last spring, I asked students at Rutgers to follow an assignment
                        in which they close-read one stanza from <title level="m">Don Juan</title>
                        by writing an imitation of the very stanza they had close-read. Students
                        then wrote a 500-word critical coda in which they explained and justified
                        their choices. In effect, I asked students to respond to everything they had
                        discovered in their close reading through creative writing.</p>
                    <p>One student, Elizabeth Giardina, chose to close read and then imitate Stanza
                        43 of Canto VI:<quote><lg>
                                <l>She was not violently lively, but</l>
                                <l>Stole on your spirit like a May day breaking.</l>
                                <l>Her eyes were not too sparkling, yet half-shut,</l>
                                <l>They put beholders in a tender taking.</l>
                                <l>She looked (this simile’s quite new) just cut</l>
                                <l>From marble, like Pygmalion’s statue waking,</l>
                                <l>The mortal and the marble still at strife, </l>
                                <l>And timidly expanding into life.</l>
                            </lg></quote> Explicating her responses to this stanza, Elizabeth
                        described her progression from the close reading to the hybrid assignment as
                            follows:<quote> [For the close reading,] I focused especially on the
                            equivocal language, such as litotes like “She was not violently lovely,
                            but .&#160;.&#160;.” Byron employs to discuss Dudù’s beauty. He mentions
                            in the stanza that her beauty was like a “May day breaking,” further
                            emphasizing her liminal status between opposites—between night and day,
                            perhaps. For my imitation of this stanza in relation to modern culture,
                            I chose to focus on another woman, but one who is known for her politics
                            rather than her beauty. Hillary Clinton is often in the public eye for
                            the beauty blunders she apparently commits. One that came to mind most
                            easily for me was the constant critique of her “cankles,” so I decided
                            they would be my main focus in my stanza. I sought to employ the same
                            equivocal attitude toward her that Byron does toward Dudù, but to have a
                            different intent in mind.</quote> Elizabeth’s resulting imitation sets
                        forth its own poetic satire:<quote><lg>
                                <l>They are not excessively fat, but</l>
                                <l>Jiggle when she turns around a corner;</l>
                                <l>Cankles a fine shade of pistachio nut,</l>
                                <l>Stuffed inside too tight heels and make me mourn her</l>
                                <l>Comfort. ‘Twixt green and tan, her leg hairs uncut:</l>
                                <l>She’s Athena amidst tea and foreigners.</l>
                                <l>Though much of her speech was understood moot,</l>
                                <l>For she dared wear a dress instead of a pantsuit. </l>
                            </lg></quote> Reflecting on her creative process, Elizabeth explained,
                        “[w]hile I was writing the stanza I was aware that I would need to close
                        read it afterward, and so I was especially aware of how I used my language,
                        rhythm, and line breaks in order to illustrate my point.” Indeed,
                        Elizabeth’s close reading of her own creative work involved digging in to
                        the details of her imitation as well as the details of the original stanza.
                        For example, Elizabeth comments on her interpretation of Byron’s underhanded
                        diction (“An ankle is not beautiful if it is somewhere between green and
                        tan; it would look repulsive and unhealthy. But ‘pistachio’ tiptoes around
                        the issue with a pretty word and the idea of a tasty snack”) and reimagines
                        Byron’s allusions for the contemporary context (“the reference to Athena
                        rather than Pygmalion’s statue emphasizes intellectual capability rather
                        than sheer physical appeal”). Written in tandem with more conventional forms
                        of literary analysis and academic writing, Elizabeth’s ode to Hillary’s
                        cankles presents a moment of performance in which the student inhabits the
                        formal space of the Romantic poem and the cultural-critical space of the
                        Romantic poet. </p>

                    <head>2. CREATIVE WRITING IS LIBERATING</head>
                    <p>When I assign hybrid critical/creative papers in my classes, I hasten to
                        remind students that this isn’t a creative writing class and that they won’t
                        be graded based on talent. Even with and perhaps in part due to these
                        disclaimers, the resulting creative work is often excellent. Reflecting on
                        this trend, Wilson points out that, when these types of assignments are used
                        in class, “[c]reative writing is seen .&#160;.&#160;. as a means to better
                        critical reading, but .&#160;.&#160;. the relation is reciprocal and
                        critically informed reading can be the context for genuinely talented
                        creative work” (441). I agree that strong creative reading promotes strong
                        creative writing, and would add to this assertion my sense that students
                        find the creative writing assignments to be liberating and/or disarming, an
                        experience that promotes a greater sense of strength and ease as they work
                        through assignments. Writing in a new genre in which they are not expected
                        to have developed “good” habits, students seem eager to take chances and to
                        perform experiments. </p>
                    <p>I base these general claims in part on the investment and enthusiasm I’ve
                        witnessed during student paper presentations and in part based on student
                        responses to creative papers in anonymous course evaluations. In the latter
                        context, students often describe hybrid assignments as “fun” and
                        “enjoyable,” ask for more, or tell me they “loved” the assignment. This
                        sense that hybrid critical/creative assignments are somehow a treat or gift
                        built into the curriculum reflects, I think, the extent to which a creative
                        approach to analyzing literature allows students to relax and enjoy
                        learning. These assignments ask students to create something new for which
                        they have no model, rather than to strive toward the platonic ideal of the
                        perfect English paper. The resulting engaged, non-anxious approach to the
                        creative assignment helps generate clear, insightful student writing, not
                        only for the hybrid assignment itself, but also for later, more conventional
                        assignments. In course evaluations, students report that creative writing
                        helps them tap into their creativity; I’ve noticed that students engage this
                        creativity while completing more conventional writing assignments (e.g.
                        comparative papers and thesis-driven analyses), as well.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, by asking students to take on the role of the Romantic author,
                        this category of assignment invites students to peel back the cloak of
                        canonicity and to claim Romantic perspectives for themselves. Compared to
                        their thesis-driven counterparts, creative assignments are often irreverent,
                        as in one student’s “No Time for the Ancient Mariner,” in which Coleridge’s
                        ancient mariner, transported to the present day, can’t get anyone on the
                        street to stop and listen to his story, or in various reinterpretations of
                        “This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison” in which students use Coleridge’s projected
                        frustration at an absent nostalgia to account for the FOMO they experience
                        whilst navigating between studying and socializing. I humbly submit that
                        it’s OK and maybe even preferable for students to be irreverent (educated,
                        insightful, and interested, of course, but also, sometimes, irreverent) when
                        it comes to Coleridge et al., and often use creative assignments to
                        dismantle the imposing hierarchy of canonicity. Writing about the ways in
                        which creative writing exercises can promote “investment” and “authority”
                        among composition students, Drew and Yost have argued that “these exercises
                        can become central to the work of the composition classroom by helping to
                        undermine the Author/student writer dichotomy” (30). Beyond upsetting this
                        dichotomy, creative responses to Romanticism can help students connect
                        Romantic literature to their lives and, in turn, find ways to connect to the
                        Romantic.</p>

                    <head>3. CREATIVE WRITING INVERTS THE ROMANTIC AND THE CONTEMPORARY</head>
                    <p>Creative writing assignments ask students to invert their perspective, taking
                        on Romantic concerns, forms, and experiments and applying them to their own
                        contemporary experience. This process develops in two dimensions. In some
                        cases, Romantic thinking allows students to reconsider contemporary issues;
                        in other cases, the opportunity to write like a Romantic encourages students
                        to infuse their everyday world with new—that is, old—ideas.</p>
                    <p>One assignment that encourages students to reconsider contemporary issues
                        through a Romantic lens is a monster narrative written in the
                        nineteenth-century tradition but focused on a contemporary issue, topic, or
                        context. In “Later Romantic Literature: Monsters and Rock Stars,” this
                        assignment generated a number of monster narratives dealing with issues of
                        body image and the beauty industry. For example, one story, written by
                        Shayla Lawz, presented a monstrous and ultimately tragic depiction of two
                        young girls mimicking their mother’s fixation on her physical appearance:
                            <quote>Each afternoon as their momma went to run errands, the two girls
                            kept themselves busy by playing dress up. One by one, they would throw
                            the giant polka dot scarves around their necks, and slip their tiny feet
                            into the size nine high heels. Ivylese liked to screech swiftly across
                            the mahogany living room floor as Olivia covered her ears at the sound.
                            She did this until, while playing around one day, she sliced her finger
                            on the sharp metal heel and became frightened at what else they were
                            capable of.</quote> Other student monster narratives addressed plastic
                        surgery, vanity, eating disorders, and self-representation on social media.
                        After studying texts such as <title level="m">Frankenstein </title>and
                            <title level="m">Mathilda </title>that use monstrosity to embody,
                        among so many other things, anxieties about social change, social roles, and
                        women’s place in society, course participants used the nineteenth-century
                        tradition of the monster narrative to express some of their own thoughts
                        about and understandings of societal problems and pressures. If, as Jeffrey
                        Jerome Cohen has argued, we can “understand .&#160;.&#160;. cultures through
                        the monsters they bear[,]” then perhaps using the logics of the Romantic
                        monster narrative to think through our own culture can help us become better
                        readers of literature and culture, broadly construed (4). I should note here
                        that I’ve recently updated this assignment in response to different
                        pedagogical goals. This fall, in a first-year seminar on “Monster
                        Narratives, 1797–2014,” sixteen first-year college students at the
                        University of Denver will choose a contemporary social, environmental,
                        and/or political issue, research and write an annotated bibliography on
                        their topic, and then construct and analyze their own monster narratives in
                        response to the issue they have chosen and researched. It is my hope that
                        this assignment will encourage students to respond critically and creatively
                        to their world, using the Romantic (and, in this case, the Victorian) as a
                        tool to help them critique and understand the contemporary.</p>
                    <p>As I mentioned above, hybrid critical/creative exercises can also encourage
                        students to infuse their everyday experience with an understanding of and
                        interest in the (neo-)Romantic. For example, in a course on Early Romantic
                        Literature taught at Rutgers, I asked students to imitate a poet of their
                        choosing, and then to submit a critical coda walking me through their
                        imitation. Some students reported that their choice to imitate a Romantic
                        nature poem led them to notice, engage, or appreciate the natural world in a
                        new or different way.</p>
                    <p>One such student, Sam Brusco, ventured out into the New Jersey woods to write
                        an imitation of Wordsworth, which I excerpt here:<quote><lg>
                                <l>It was a still and stagnant winter morn;</l>
                                <l>a day when Nature seemed to lie asleep,</l>
                                <l>no single creature stirred, scarce wind was heard,</l>
                                <l>a day that had an oath of silence sworn.</l>
                                <l>No prior obligations then had I,</l>
                                <l>at rest from travels endless and sublime.</l>
                                <l>I walked among a way yet untrodden, </l>
                                <l>now that I found myself with endless time.</l>
                                <l>The path I chose, untouched by human will</l>
                                <l>without a measured course to mark the way;</l>
                                <l>since Nature organized no maps for me,</l>
                                <l>the path was chosen by what course I made.</l>
                            </lg></quote> Sam’s employment of iambic pentameter as well as his
                        deployment of allusions to poems read in class demonstrate the extent to
                        which the student has taken in and synthesized a sense of what it means to
                        find oneself in a Wordsworth poem. However, beyond these formal and topical
                        references, Sam’s critical coda focuses on his interpretation of Wordsworth
                        as a poet-philosopher:</p>
                    <p>What was particularly interesting for my own “experience with nature” that I
                        had hoped would create my own philosophical conclusions was my decision to
                        take a walk in the woods in wintertime .&#160;.&#160;. some would interpret
                        the landscape as dead, “A scene devoid of life, though it may seem.”
                        However, the observer reasons that because nature exerts so much energy in
                        providing a thriving landscape for the remainder of the year, it ought to
                        have a time to rest, as well, because all other living things are allowed to
                        rest. The landscape then becomes something entirely different: a scene of
                        serenity and tranquility rather than of stagnation and lifelessness.</p>
                    <p>If we find ourselves debating how, whether, and why to use the contemporary
                        to make the Romantic “relatable” for students, then Sam’s and other
                        students’ thoughtful poetic encounters with the natural environment in
                        hybrid critical/creative response to Romanticism demonstrate the extent to
                        which the Romantic is, of course, already relevant—already <emph>related</emph>—to the issues and concerns that dominate
                        our world and the worlds of our students.</p>

                    <head>4. CREATIVE WRITING OFFERS AN ANALYTICAL ALTERNATIVE TO ARGUMENT</head>
                    <p>Explaining his use of creative responses to literature in the high school
                        classroom, Christian Knoeller argues, “[i]n place of a simple opposition
                        between response and formal analysis, imaginative response maps a continuum
                        between the two and demonstrates how they can serve essentially
                        complementary roles when interpreting literary works” (44). In the college
                        classroom, the hybrid critical/creative assignment functions as a moment of
                        rupture bridging, not only reader response and student analysis, but also
                        argumentative analysis and something beyond argument. In my classes, I find
                        it useful to remain mindful of the extent to which an exclusive focus on
                        strength of argument can sometimes limit a student’s exploration of the
                        text(s) at hand. While I consider teaching academic argument to be one of
                        the most important parts of my job as an English professor, I also maintain
                        that students’ interactions with literary history before, beside, or beyond
                        the project of constructing an argument about that history is crucial to
                        learning and should not be undervalued. Assignments that ask students to do
                        something other than make an argument offer the chance to share and to
                        receive feedback regarding the many ways in which students interact with
                        texts. These assignments, in turn, ask students to linger in the space of
                        the text itself and to extend the encounter that is reading. It is my
                        contention that such opportunities to interpret for interpretation’s own
                        sake help students become more conscientious readers, and, in turn, more
                        persuasive when it comes to academic argument.</p>
                    <p>Hybrid critical/creative assignments accomplish these goals differently than,
                        say, non-thesis driven close readings insofar as they ask students to think
                        with and through the Romantic, moving beyond the text and into the questions
                        and issues it raises, all the while resisting or delaying the impulse to
                        compress the text’s effects and affects into a digestible thesis. At the
                        2014 NASSR conference, my mentor, Marjorie Levinson, responded to a question
                        about pedagogy with a simple and perfectly true statement of purpose: “You
                        just want them to feel how good it is to think.” Hybrid critical/creative
                        assignments provide students with a formal opportunity to think, not
                        necessarily in the service of argument, but rather via the experience of
                        generating and understanding creative practice. No wonder students often
                        report that hybrid assignments allow them to access or understand authorship
                        in complex and vibrant ways that skirt those teaching conventions (e.g. the
                        insistence on a “speaker,” whatever that might mean in the Romantic context)
                        that reinforce the author taboo without edging into problematic,
                        biographical reading. In the literary studies classroom, hybrid
                        critical/creative assignments complement praxis with practice. This practice
                        promotes experimental reading, writing, and interpretation.</p>
                    <p>Building on this interplay, one goal I have in mind as I continue to develop
                        the pedagogy of zonkey Romanticism is to explore and think through the ways
                        in which creative writing might inform students’ understanding of theory as
                        well as their theoretical understanding of Romantic texts. Reflecting on a
                        hybrid critical/creative assignment, van Oostrum, Steadman-Jones, and Carson
                        remark that “this task .&#160;.&#160;. brought alive a range of theoretical
                        issues concerning the difficulty of representation” and posit that “[w]hen
                        students read about these issues in books of literary theory, they often
                        remain cold, abstract, and remote. But when they arise from the process of
                        producing creative writing, they seem much more alive” (565). While an
                        analysis of how creative writing might be used to illustrate and vivify
                        theoretical approaches in the Romantic literature classroom is beyond the
                        scope of this essay, I conclude with this open question as a way to gesture
                        toward how the pedagogical approach presented here might further be
                        developed and applied as a method for asking students to express their
                        understanding, their questions, and their ideas in an open, generative
                        format. </p>
                    <p>Ultimately, I hope that my comments have illustrated some of the ways in
                        which creative writing and hybrid critical/creative assignments can
                        encourage students of Romantic literature to bridge the historical text and
                        the contemporary moment of reading, not just in the service of intervention,
                        but for the sake of capacious and radical interaction, interaction that
                        produces new texts, new ideas, new perspectives, and, indeed, new ways of
                        thinking.</p>
