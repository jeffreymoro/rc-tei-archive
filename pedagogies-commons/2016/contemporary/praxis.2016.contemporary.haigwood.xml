            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">In Romantic Era Feminism, students engage in deep and broad
                    learning about the 18th and 19th centuries’ intellectual and cultural legacy,
                    and its continuing presence in 20th and 21st century feminism. Among others,
                    Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Hays, William Godwin and John Stuart Mill are studied
                    alongside Malala Yousafzai, Azar Nafisi, Tatyana Fazlalizadeh, Jessica Valenti
                    and The Young Lords Party’s “Position Paper on Women”; “The Saudi Women
                    Revolution Statement” is read with “The Declaration of Independence” and
                    “Declaration of the United Irishmen”; Rush Limbaugh is heard echoing Richard
                    Polwhele, and Daryush Valizadeh, Rousseau. This dialogue between 18th - and 19th
                    -century feminist and anti-feminist texts, and 20th - and 21st -century ones
                    launches students’ exploration into three areas: 1) the cultural and
                    intellectual history of feminism since the Romantic era; 2) the feminist
                    implications 18th- and 19th- century political discourse, and the arguments used
                    then and now either to support or to suppress those implications; 3) the range
                    and diversity of feminist positions within and across generations, and the role
                    of class, race, and historical context in expanding or limiting the literary and
                    political imaginations of feminists in all eras, including our own. Students
                    also study the lives and works of individual writers, and their intellectual
                    influence on one another; the intersections of abolitionist or anti-racist with
                    feminist imagery, discourse, arguments and action; the second and third waves’
                    rediscovery, reinvention and revision of earlier feminist critiques of unequal
                    marriage laws, the sexual double standard, employment discrimination and similar
                    issues; and the utility of diverse literary genres for presenting these topics
                    richly and persuasively. Most importantly, by learning that the Romantics are
                    indeed our contemporaries, and by critically examining the assumptions we still
                    share with them, students become more self-conscious, better informed, and more
                    effective participants in the continuously ongoing cultural construction and
                    critique of gender and human rights discourses. </p>

                <head>Romantic Continuities and Feminist Contemporaries</head>
                <p>ENLT 384: Romantic Era Feminism teaches eighteenth-, nineteenth-, twentieth- and
                    twenty-first-century texts together to show feminism’s roots in Romantic-era
                    human rights discourse and its growth into our current historical moment. My
                    approach is influenced by the second wave insight that political and personal
                    power structures reinforce one another, so I encourage students to observe these
                    structures closely in all contexts, including their own power insofar as they
                    may be privileged relative to others. Although my course is designed to
                    cultivate understandings of Romantic continuities in contemporary feminist and
                    anti-feminist arguments, its method of pairing Romantic-era texts with
                    twentieth- and twenty-first-century ones would work equally well for courses
                    focused on race and civil rights, separation of church and state, and similar
                    topics whose current terms of debate reflect the declarations, constitutions and
                    manifestos of Romantic revolutionary governments and movements.</p>
                <p>We study the lives and works of selected Romantic-era writers, and their
                    influence on one another; the continuities and discontinuities of arguments for
                    and against women’s rights from the eighteenth century to the present; the
                    diversity of feminist positions within and across historical periods; how social
                    context and political expediency (as well as class, race and culture) shape,
                    expand or limit the feminist imagination in every era; and how both feminist and
                    anti-feminist authors use a range of genres (fiction, poetry, polemic, essay,
                    manifesto, etc.) to engage readers with their constructions of gender at various
                    levels of understanding and action, that is, empathetically, critically,
                    philosophically, politically. In addition to acquiring such knowledge, I want
                    students to learn the habit of critically analyzing their own political location
                    in history, as well as their personal responses to feminist questions. Assuming
                    that public citizenship begins in private life, I encourage students to observe
                    and reflect on their own lives, so that their political and personal
                    perspectives are thoughtfully integrated and mutually informed.</p>
                <p><title level="m">Course Description</title>: Although eighteenth-century
                    advocates for women did not call themselves “feminists,” their vindications of
                    the rights of woman have informed all subsequent “waves.” Sometimes aligning
                    themselves with parallel movements for democratic government or the abolition of
                    slavery, Romantic-era feminists asserted women’s social, intellectual and
                    spiritual equality even when they did not argue for equal legal rights. We start
                    with Jane Austen’s <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> to locate
                    middle-class Romantic-era Englishwomen in their time and place. We then study
                    Mary Wollstonecraft, whose work and life exemplify persistent tensions between
                    “sense” and “sensibility” in feminist discourse and feminine experience. Shorter
                    works by contemporaries Hannah More, Helen Maria Williams, Mary Hays and others
                    demonstrate the range and variety of British Romantic-era feminist voices. We
                    then listen for their influence in the voices of the next generation, both
                    British and American, including Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Sojourner Truth,
                    Caroline Norton, and Harriet Taylor Mill. William Godwin and John Stuart Mill,
                    among others, affirm the historical continuity of feminist male allies.
                    Throughout the course, we read complementary twentieth- and twenty-first-century
                    texts, recognizing familiar arguments while also discovering new ones that may
                    help to resolve earlier arguments’ flawed premises or inconsistencies.</p>
                <p><title level="m">Texts</title>: The Oxford World Classics <title level="m">Sense
                        and Sensibility</title>, introduced by Margaret Doody, is required, along
                    with Anne Mellor’s edition of<title level="m"> A Vindication of the Rights of
                        Woman and The Wrongs of Woman, or Maria</title>; Pamela Clemit and Gina
                    Luria Walker’s <title level="m">Memoirs of the Author of “A Vindication of the
                        Rights of Woman”</title> by William Godwin; and Eleanor Ty’s <title
                        level="m">The Victim of Prejudice</title> by Mary Hays. <title level="m"
                        >Before Victoria: Extraordinary Women of the British Romantic Era</title>,
                    by Elizabeth Campbell Denlinger, is optional but highly recommended because its
                    well-chosen visual resources and engaging short biographies of Mary Robinson and
                    others represent the broad extent of contemporary women’s involvement in arts,
                    literature and politics. I select additional short readings from the Longman,
                    Norton and Broadview anthologies of British and American literature, as well as
                        <title level="m">The Norton Anthology of Literature by Women</title>. For
                    historical documents, such as Olympe de Gouges’ 1791 Declaration of the Rights
                    of Woman and Citizen, Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s 1848 Declaration of Sentiments,
                    and Edith M. Stern’s 1949 “Women Are Household Slaves,” I rely on three
                    collections: <title level="m">The French Revolution and Human Rights: A Brief
                        Documentary History</title>, edited by Lynn Hunt; <title level="m">The
                        American Women’s Movement, 1945-2000: A Brief History with
                    Documents</title>, edited by Nancy MacLean; and <title level="m">Women, the
                        Family and Freedom: The Debate in Documents, Volume One, 1750–1880</title>,
                    edited by Susan Groag Bell and Karen M. Offen. </p>
                <p>From the wealth of additional editions, anthologies and electronic databases of
                    eighteenth- and nineteenth-century women writers now available, a few I find
                    especially helpful are Moira Ferguson’s <title level="m">First
                        Feminists,</title> a comprehensive collection, knowledgably contextualized.
                    It could serve well as a required textbook for a course like this one, as could
                        <title level="m">Transatlantic Feminisms in the Age of Revolutions</title>,
                    edited by Lisa L. Moore, Joanna Brooks and Caroline Wigginton. Carolyn
                    Christensen Nelson’s <title level="m">Literature of the Women’s Suffrage
                        Campaign in England</title> thoroughly represents mid- to late-Victorian
                    arguments on both sides of the question. Stephen Behrendt’s electronic databases
                    broadly illuminate the poetic range of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Irish
                    and Scottish women writers<title rend="color(262626)">. </title></p>

                <p>Clear thinking and insightful writing are born in accurate reading, so the first
                    paper is a close reading exercise. I introduce close reading by focusing one
                    class discussion on a few paragraphs of <title level="m">Sense and
                        Sensibility</title>, asking questions designed to elicit thorough scrutiny
                    of Marianne Dashwood’s first encounter with John Willoughby. This proves
                    worthwhile even for senior English majors because the many students who have
                    seen Emma Thompson’s film adaptation tend to read <title level="m">Sense and
                        Sensibility</title> through a glamorizing cinematic mist that obscures
                    Austen’s irony. It is therefore especially helpful to draw attention to the
                    deflating or foreboding implications of words, images, and pointed repetitions.
                    Students’ heavily OED-informed papers examine similarly rich short passages from
                    the novel, and this work immediately improves students’ accuracy and insight as
                    classroom discussants. It also keeps their subsequent writing closely
                    accountable to texts. </p>
                <p>To guide students from reading literary texts accurately to reflecting on their
                    own lives analytically, I invite but don’t require them to write personal
                    reflections. Prompts for thinking and writing analytically about both text and
                    self appear in daily study questions, such as “What did ‘sensibility’ mean to
                    Austen’s readers? How does Austen describe and criticize Marianne’s performance
                    of sensibility? What personal values and political statements does this
                    self-presentation style assert or imply? How would you characterize your own
                    style and its statements?” I also invite students to write extra credit personal
                    responses when—as frequently happens—classroom discussion evokes strong emotions
                    or vivid, real-life parallels. But students who prefer not to write personally
                    always have the choice to write literary analysis only.</p>
                <p>How do I assess personal writing? I don’t assess students’ experiences or
                    emotions. Although occasionally a student’s personal experience is such that it
                    would be inhumanely “professional” not to express direct sympathy, empathy and
                    support, I generally try not to remark directly on experiences or feelings,
                    focusing instead on the accurate observation and analytic thinking I want
                    students to cultivate and practice. Competitive pressure and performance anxiety
                    are incompatible with self-honesty, another good reason to keep comments on
                    personal reflections descriptive and responsive rather than evaluative: “I’m
                    impressed by how thoroughly you analyze this incident, considering more than one
                    motive for your antagonist’s behavior.” Most personal essay prompts require
                    students to do more than write about their own experiences and feelings, though;
                    they must also define an issue and accurately analyze a text in relation to that
                    issue, as well as reflect personally. For example, one prompt asks, “What sexual
                    propriety rules seem important in Austen’s novel? Are there different rules for
                    women and men? How are they enforced and how do they affect both men’s and
                    women’s sexual self-expression? Are the rules in your own milieu similar or
                    different? Do similar constructions of gender support both sets of rules? Have
                    any rules changed in response to changing constructions of gender?” The clarity
                    of a student’s definition of “sexual propriety rules” and the accuracy of her
                    analysis of Austen’s portrayal of those rules can be assessed objectively
                    relative to other students’ work. In narratives of personal experience, though,
                    intellectual errors such as false assumptions or shallow analyses cannot be
                    touched on directly without bruising a vulnerably exposed psyche, and yet such
                    errors must be addressed. Students seem to respond best to “criticism” in the
                    form of friendly questions that suggest alternative assumptions and/or encourage
                    deeper thinking, such as “Have you considered whether their assumptions about
                    gender roles may have influenced the expectations each party brought to this
                    encounter?” </p>
                <p>Their third paper, a “gender-focused polemic,” may be an essay in gender-focused
                    protest or advocacy on a topic of their choice, or a polemic within feminist or
                    queer discourse about equal rights and gender—that is, a criticism, revision or
                    refinement of someone else’s feminist or queer argument. Moira Ferguson’s
                    introduction to <title level="m">First Feminists</title> includes a discussion
                    of feminist polemic subgenres that helpfully guides students both in analyzing
                    polemics they read and in crafting their own. </p>
                <p>The last paper, a literary analysis, has three letter-graded stages—pre-writing,
                    draft, and final version. Students must analyze how an eighteenth- or
                    nineteenth-century texts applies a term such as “rights,” “reason,” “authority,”
                    “equality,” and “consent” to the situation of women. In other words, their task
                    is to immerse themselves in the feminist implications of a specific Romantic-era
                    political idea and to observe how those implications are developed in the text.
                    My task is to help them emerge from that immersion with a clearly focused,
                    substantive thesis, logically argued and convincingly developed.</p>
                <p>In the final oral presentation, students bring one or more Romantic-era
                    writer(s)’ arguments to bear on a current women’s issue, articulating how the
                    eighteenth- or nineteenth-century writer(s)’ insights may shed light on the
                    current problem, and/or how those eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
                    perspectives may be limited by circumstances that have changed or by assumptions
                    we no longer accept. This project tests two things: 1) students’ understanding
                    of the Romantic-era writer(s) they have studied, and 2) their ability to
                    abstract the assumptions and methods of a feminist analysis of one problem, and
                    then to apply or adapt those assumptions and that method to analyzing a
                    different problem, or the same problem in a different social context. For
                    example, one student researched street harassment, a current problem that is
                    also addressed in <title level="m">The Victim of Prejudice</title> and <title
                        level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title>. Her research led her
                    to Hollaback, among other web and print resources, and her report analyzed
                    Hays’, Wollstonecraft’s, Hollaback’s and Tatyana Fazlalizadeh’s differing
                    explanations and solutions to the problem of street harassment. Another student
                    compared nineteenth-century rhetoric for and against English and American
                    women’s suffrage with current rhetoric for and against Saudi women’s right to
                    drive. </p>
                <p>After the focused research of these last two projects, the take-home final
                    examination encourages more speculative thinking, such as, “Reflect on theory
                    and action in your own political life: is there any compromise, means or
                    rhetoric that you would not use in your own active citizenship, even if it were
                    likely to advance your cause? Give an example from one of our texts or class
                    discussions. Explain what’s wrong with the example and why your conscience can’t
                    accept its strategy.” Students will know the question alludes most obviously to
                    Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s racist and xenophobic arguments in “Speech before the
                    Woman Suffrage Convention in Washington, D.C., 18 January, 1869,” but they have
                    many other examples, contemporary and historical, from which to choose. My goal
                    is to heighten their ethical self-consciousness as rhetorically sensitive future
                    citizens, activists, and, perhaps, political candidates.<note place="foot"> In
                        framing this and similar questions designed to cultivate students’
                        sensitivity to the ethics of discourse, I am indebted to John Duffy,
                        Associate Professor of English and Frances O’Malley Director, University
                        Writing Program, University of Notre Dame. Both my students and I are
                        grateful for Prof. Duffy’s insights into virtuous dispositions and
                        rhetorical practice. See his forthcoming “Ethical Dispositions: A Discourse
                        for Rhetoric and Composition” in <title level="m">Journal of Advanced

                    role beyond the class, I ask, “Where would you most like to see change in
                    women’s lives? What is needed to make it happen? What can you personally do now?
                    In the future? How will your knowledge of Romantic eraRomantic-era feminism
                    inform your priorities, arguments or strategies?”</p>
                <p>Finally, I also want to see their concluding synthesis of historical
                    continuities: “How has learning about Mary Wollstonecraft and other Romantic-era
                    feminists informed your understanding of why feminism is what it is today?”
                    Typically, students say that their understanding of this is not just informed
                    but transformed: prior to the course, they did not know the legal and social
                    context in which Romantic-era feminism developed; now, they respect earlier
                    feminists’ work to achieve the rights and opportunities they themselves
                    currently enjoy; going forward, they understand why the movement continues, and
                    some of them hope to shape its future. </p>

                <head>Defining terms, establishing contexts</head>
                <p>In the first week we must define terms and establish contexts for the semester’s
                    work, so I start with a general introduction to the Romantic era, including a
                    British literature timeline, representative authors and texts, major historical
                    events, characteristic themes and genres. Although I inform students that the
                    term “Romantic” could itself be a course topic, I ground them in a fairly
                    traditional, Norton anthology understanding. Such relative stability is helpful
                    because our second key term, “feminism,” is for them a much less stable and more
                    controversial term. Although I sometimes write a basic definition on the board,
                    such as “feminism is the belief that women are entitled to the same legal,
                    social, and economic rights as men,” I prefer for students to volunteer their
                    own definitions, to take an active role, and also to alert me about their
                    initial assumptions. I refer them to sources such as <title level="m">The
                        Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</title> for more in-depth background on
                    feminist theory, but our initial, collectively constructed, working definition
                    of feminism proves helpful throughout the course. We hold one another
                    accountable to it, we continue to discuss it, and, if necessary, we revise it. </p>
                <p>With basic definitions of “Romantic era” and “feminism” on the board, I then pass
                    out the 1776 American Declaration of Independence for close analysis of its
                    explicit assertions and implicit assumptions about power. I especially direct
                    students’ attention to words and concepts that Romantic-era feminists apply to
                    the situation of women, such as “consent,” “nature,” “rights,” “liberty,”
                    “happiness,” and the ultimate authority of reason implied by submitting “facts”
                    to a “candid world” to “prove” one’s case against “tyranny.” We next look
                    briefly at similar language in The Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen
                    (1789), A Declaration of the Rights of Woman and Citizen (1791), and Declaration
                    of the United Irishmen (1798). Teaching multiple contemporary documents
                    illustrates the Romantic revolutions’ transatlantic scope as diverse groups
                    adapted similar principles to their distinctive contexts. To these I like to add
                    the 1948 U.N. Declaration on Human Rights, as well as the 2011 Saudi Women’s
                    Revolution Statement, posted by Mona Kareem, which serves as our first example
                    of twenty-first-century feminist continuities. </p>
                <p>Before leaving this first class meeting, each student jots down and turns in the
                    current women’s issue she personally thinks most important. Throughout the
                    course, I will lead discussion back to these specific issues, analyzing how our
                    eighteenth-, nineteenth-, twentieth- and twenty-first-century texts comment on,
                    for example, employment discrimination, reproductive rights, sexual violence,
                    divorce, working mothers, unmarried mothers and the other issues that a given
                    class of students has said are important to them. I also give extra credit for
                    sharing brief, regular, in-class updates on the relevant news unfolding in that
                    particular semester, such as Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, or the
                    Nigerian schoolgirls’ kidnapping. I invite students to draw parallels between
                    sexist political rhetoric used to attack Clinton and sexist political rhetoric
                    used to attack Marie Antoinette, Mary Wollstonecraft and others. Similarly, we
                    compare Rousseau’s and Boko Haram’s construction of girls as sexual objects
                    rather than intellectual subjects.</p>
                <p>On day two, we start discussing <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>,
                    and, yes, every time I prepare to teach this course, I wonder whether I should
                    replace <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> with a novel students are
                    less likely to read on their own. But it remains a good place to start because
                    it accessibly portrays Romantic-era middle-class Englishwomen and their context.
                    The first few chapters introduce primogeniture and its related gender biases,
                    illustrating how profoundly men’s unequal inheritance privilege affects women’s
                    lives. In later chapters, Marianne and the two Elizas dramatize how the sexual
                    double standard enforces unequal social privilege, as well. The negative effects
                    of middle- and upper-class women’s typical educations are shown in Mrs.
                    Dashwood’s and Marianne’s over-cultivated feeling and under-cultivated reason,
                    in Lucy Steele’s narrow-minded self-interest, and in other women’s limited
                    subjects for thought and conversation. </p>
                <p>The parental tyrannies of Colonel Brandon’s father and Edward Ferrars’ mother
                    parallel the abuses of unchecked monarchy in ways that invite comparison with
                    Helen Maria Williams’ “Letter XVI,” recounting the story of M. Du F. Williams
                    explicitly suggests that the same traditional hierarchical power structures in
                    both state and family deny the rights of life, liberty and happiness in
                    political and personal life. Comparison with Williams shows that Austen shares
                    some of her feminist contemporaries’ views on a woman’s right to happiness, as
                    well as the ultimate authority of a woman’s individual conscience, typically
                    asserted by accepting or refusing marriage. Emphasizing personal agency over
                    political change, Austen suggests that women’s choices have decisive personal
                    power even within their politically powerless sphere. This relatively
                    conservative but penetrating focus on improving individual women’s characters so
                    that they make better choices, rather than changing the social order to increase
                    women’s choices, makes Austen a useful foil to more radical contemporary
                    thinkers, such as Wollstonecraft. Students also see that if they want to call
                    Austen a “feminist” (and they do) then they may have to change our working
                    definition. </p>
                <p>Austen’s rich psychological realism and narrative craft are also an instructive
                    foil to <title level="m">The Wrongs of Woman, or Maria</title> which we read
                    immediately after <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>, compelling us
                    to discuss the novel as a literary genre and our expectations from it. This is
                    also where I introduce students to the Gothic subgenre, pointing out that the
                    Gothic imprisonments in <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>
                    (especially the first Eliza’s story, but also Marianne’s heartbroken
                    self-seclusion), <title level="m">The Wrongs of Woman</title> (Maria’s
                    confinement in the asylum), and <title level="m">The Victim of Prejudice</title>
                    (Mary’s forced sojourn in Sir Peter Osborne’s London residence) resonate with
                    images of the Bastille, linking the situation of women to <foreign>ancien
                        régime</foreign> oppression.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
                <head>Course themes</head>
                <p>Although some ongoing themes are established on the first day by the
                    Declarations’ language and students’ interests, others grow out of later class
                    discussions. All of these thematic threads weave through the course, connecting
                    texts in patterns unique to each semester’s cohort. Here are a few
                    representative themes as different classes have developed them.</p>
                <p><emph>i. Legitimate Lives: “I had a right to exist!”</emph> (<title level="m">The
                        Victim of Prejudice</title> 14). When we read Colonel Brandon’s account of
                    the two Elizas in <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>, we begin to
                    look critically at how legal marriage and paternal acknowledgement give women
                    and children “legitimate” existence. Jemima’s story in <title level="m">The
                        Wrongs of Woman</title> gives more direct voice to the women and children
                    who are socially outcast without paternal acknowledgement, and Mary Hays’
                    heroine still more forcefully asserts her “right to exist” despite both her
                    illegitimacy (which damages her sexual reputation by association with her
                    mother) and her gender (which makes her sexual reputation an obstacle to finding
                    respectable work and excludes her entirely from higher-paying jobs). Noting the
                    persistent presence in our reading of people with human needs but no
                    “legitimate” human claim on others to help them meet those needs, we see how
                    abstractly and artificially “legitimate” life is constructed, and yet how
                    concretely and materially that construction disadvantages those who don’t fit
                    within it. In addition to these novels, Wollstonecraft’s letters to Gilbert
                    Imlay, Godwin’s <title level="m">Memoir</title>, the Young Lords Party’s 1970
                    “Position Paper on Women,” Margaret Cerullo’s 1968 account of an illegal
                    abortion, and the unmarried mothers and unacknowledged children whom students
                    bring into discussion from their own experience all provide scenarios for
                    thoughtfully considering who has “a right to exist.” </p>
                <p>Students also notice that although illegitimacy is frequently framed as a moral
                    problem, it is also—perhaps more so—a financial question. Like male
                    primogeniture, the sexual double standard’s moral construction of “legitimacy”
                    assigns power over property: that is, those with power to acknowledge, deny or
                    affirm sexual relationships and blood kinship have corresponding power to
                    bestow, deny or demand financial support and inheritance. Some students use the
                    final research presentation to test this observation, reporting back that
                    women’s increased financial independence, not “looser morals,” has increased
                    social acceptance of children born outside of marriage. Others research the
                    history of legal paternity, or the economic consequences of paternal absence. </p>
                <p>Once our perspective on this question is re-directed from morality to money,
                    someone invariably asks whether a “right to live” also implies a right to the
                    means of staying alive—such as employment, health care? Still more probingly,
                    students have wondered aloud in class whether individual rights discourse might
                    possibly have some limitations. That is, can the language of individual rights
                    resolve conflicts at sites where autonomous individuals are not easily
                    distinguished, such as pregnant women’s bodies, the global environment where
                    some pollute yet all must live, or economic systems that produce and unequally
                    distribute what all people equally need? These and related questions are
                    urgently important to my students, and while such conversations may take us
                    temporarily “off topic,” they grow naturally from studying Romantic-era
                    feminism.</p>
                <p>ii. <emph>Sexual Revolutions: “Women as well as men ought to have the common
                        appetites and passions of our nature, they are only brutal when unchecked by
                        reason” </emph>(<title level="m">Vindication, </title>Chap. VII 161). When
                    students express disappointment that Wollstonecraft seems not to be the same
                    “strong” feminist in her relationship with Gilbert Imlay that the firm tone of
                        <title level="m">A Vindication</title> has led them to expect, I remind them
                    that “women as well as men .&#160;.&#160;. have the common .&#160;.&#160;.
                    passions of our nature,” which may include the same love characterized by
                    emotional dependency and vulnerability that some men also sometimes feel. This
                    leads to more thoughtful and analytic discussion of feminism and
                    heterosexuality. It also leads to closer attention to personal and political
                    continuities, enabling students to more accurately read Wollstonecraft.</p>
                <p>I also explain how Wollstonecraft’s sexual attachments were politicized after her
                    death, leading nineteenth-century feminists to repudiate her sexual honesty. The
                    Broadview edition’s contemporary reviews of Godwin’s <title level="m"
                        >Memoir</title> show students how aggressively Wollstonecraft’s sexual
                    character was attacked to discredit her circle’s political ideas. Just as we
                    know to expect a generally conservative view from Fox News and a comparatively
                    moderate one from <title level="m">The New York Times</title>, I tell students,
                    Romantic-era readers knew what to expect from <title level="m">The Anti-Jacobin
                        </title>and<title level="m"> Analytic </title>reviews, respectively. Tipped
                    off to their politics, students readily identify and articulate how each
                    reviewer’s tone toward Mary’s life follows each journal’s ideological bent. </p>
                <p>To further explain why, until fairly recently, some feminists in subsequent
                    generations also scorned Wollstonecraft, I introduce the “angel in the house”
                    ideology, focusing on its sexually repressive assumption that “good,” “angelic”
                    (typically also white and upper- or middle-class) women are morally superior to
                    men. Why did some mid-nineteenth-century feminists accept this false
                    construction of gender so uncritically? The gendered moral high ground is a
                    heady rhetorical advantage to imagine that one has, and feminists occasionally
                    still speak from that location.<note place="foot">For example, in an eloquent
                        and insightful editorial on pornography, Germaine Greer recently stated that
                        “As far as male sexual fantasy is concerned there is no too far.” Such
                        phrasing goes beyond specific individuals to inaccurately include all men
                        and exclude all women, echoing the “angel in the house” false construction
                        of women’s moral superiority and men’s moral inferiority; such sexist
                        constructions are unjust to both. Would it be more just and accurate simply
                        to say, “As far as sexual fantasy is concerned, there is no too far?”</note>
                    Politically, it allowed nineteenth-and early twentieth-century feminists to
                    argue for women’s suffrage without too forcefully challenging contemporary
                    gender roles: they could urge the need for “good” women’s superior moral
                    influence on national politics. But to maintain credibility as morally superior
                    “angels,” feminists who chose that political strategy also had to shun
                    contaminating contact with Wollstonecraft, an ideological choice that would
                    require substantive reappraisal when childcare, sexual freedom and reproductive
                    rights became more central to the movement.</p>
                <p>With this background, students read Godwin’s <title level="m">Memoir</title> and
                    Wollstonecraft’s letters more thoughtfully, observing how ethically
                    Wollstonecraft persists in respecting the commitment she believes she has made
                    to Imlay, and how reasonably she makes requests and sets limits that he chooses
                    not to respect. Instead of faulting her for “weakness” in trying to maintain a
                    relationship with her child’s father, and for becoming depressed when she can’t,
                    students begin to see Imlay’s faults more equally. The point of such discussion
                    is to analyze how the same conventional constructions of masculinity that
                    Wollstonecraft critically analyzes in the <title level="m">Vindication</title>
                    are also shaping Imlay’s behavior toward her, and how the same Romantic hope for
                    a “revolution in female manners” with which she writes the <title level="m"
                        >Vindication</title> also gives her hope, for a time, that Imlay may
                    revolutionize his own manners from those of a conventional womanizer into those
                    of a faithful partner who shares emotional power equally. Where at first
                    students saw only contradiction, they begin to see consistency between
                    Wollstonecraft’s political and personal principles. </p>
                <p>Jessica Valenti’s documentary “The Purity Myth” complements those passages in
                    Wollstonecraft’s life and work where sexual reputation is, literally, a matter
                    of life or death. By deconstructing “purity” and “virginity” in
                    twenty-first-century terms, Valenti continues Wollstonecraft’s, Austen’s, Hays’
                    and others’ demolition of the sexual double standard. I show Valenti’s film when
                    we read <title level="m">Vindication</title> Chapter VII
                    “Modesty—Comprehensively considered and not as a sexual virtue,” and Chapter
                    VIII “Morality undermined by sexual notions of the importance of a good
                    reputation.” Valenti says similar things more accessibly, helping students to
                    hear Wollstonecraft more clearly, as when, for example, anticipating
                    sex-positive third-wave feminism, Wollstonecraft asserts that “it is indelicate,
                    not to say immodest, for women to feign an unnatural coldness of constitution”
                    (161). Observing “purity balls” in juxtaposition with “hook-up” dating, students
                    are struck by the vastly different sexual cultures contemporary Americans
                    occupy, both scientifically and ethically. Some see scientific ignorance as an
                    ethical problem in itself, and use their final presentations to invoke Mary
                    Wollstonecraft in support of current arguments for HPV vaccination or for
                    comprehensive K–12 sexuality education. </p>
                <p>iii. <emph>Women’s Education: “the heterogeneous studies pursued in this
                        helter-skelter fashion were of the smallest possible utility in later life;
                        each acquirement being of the shallowest and most imperfect kind”</emph>
                    (Cobbe 1632). When students learn firsthand from Frances Cobbe how superficially
                    even upper-class girls were educated in the Romantic era, they better understand
                    both Wollstonecraft’s and Hannah More’s criticisms of the women such education
                    produced. Complementary readings from <title level="m">I Am Malala</title> and
                        <title level="m">Reading Lolita in Tehran</title> make the gender politics
                    of education acutely contemporary, as does Julia Meltzer’s 2011 documentary,
                        <title level="m">The Light in Her Eyes</title>. Every design for women’s
                    education implies a corresponding idea of “woman,” as these authors variously
                    demonstrate, so we analyze it anew in every text. I then invite students to
                    reflect on what their own education so far has implied about the nature, needs
                    and roles of women and men, as well as what that education has assumed about the
                    nature of gender identity itself. I find that all students thrive on
                    opportunities to reflect personally about the gender identities assigned to
                    them, their own gender identities as they choose to perform them, and the gender
                    role expectations others have of them. Such reflection both deconstructs
                    cultural constructions of gender and empowers students to actively construct
                    their own gender identities for themselves. As queer and transgender voices
                    become more prominent in popular culture, students find resonant Romantic-era
                    parallels in “the ladies of Llangollen,” Lady Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby;
                    Lord Byron; and the “Sapphic separatists” researched by Susan Lanser, among
                    others. </p>
                <p>iv. <emph>Class and race: “‘Who ever acknowledged me to be a fellow-creature?’”;
                        “And ain’t I a woman?”</emph> (Wollstonecraft, <title level="m">The Wrongs
                        of Woman </title>289; Truth 510). Jemima’s story in <title level="m">The
                        Wrongs of Woman</title> illustrates how poverty exacerbates gender
                    oppression for Romantic-era women, and teaching it alongside Johnnie Tilmon’s
                    1972 <title level="m">Ms.</title> article, “Welfare is a Women’s Issue,”
                    introduces racial intersectionality into the conversation. When I teach
                    Sojourner Truth’s well-known speech, I also lead pointed discussion of Stanton’s
                    racism (mentioned above, under “<emph>Assignments</emph>”). In future classes, I
                    will assign students to read Alice Walker on womanism along with Truth. Harriet
                    Jacobs’s <title level="m">Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,</title> or
                    excerpts from it, and poems by Phillis Wheatley also heighten students’
                    awareness of continuities and discontinuities between black and white women’s
                    historical experience. Although teaching abolitionist poems by white women is in
                    some ways the opposite of racial inclusivity, teaching poems by More and others
                    on that theme is nonetheless useful for raising students’ awareness of how false
                    notes can mar good intentions if racist assumptions are not thoroughly
                    deconstructed. Throughout the course, I point out white Romantic-era feminists’
                    appropriation of African women’s real “slavery” and “chains” as metaphors for
                    their own comparatively privileged oppression. But I’m still not satisfied with
                    my course’s representation of non-white and non-middle-class feminists in any
                    century, and so I continue researching new texts and searching for a still more
                    intentionally inclusive, deeply historical anthology of feminist writing. </p>
                <p>v. <emph>From Rousseau to the manosphere: “.&#160;.&#160;. woman is made
                        specially to please man .&#160;.&#160;.”</emph> (Rousseau, <title level="m"
                        >Emile</title> 358): If man, born free, should break his unnatural chains,
                    then why is it natural for woman to remain shackled? Our class reads Rousseau’s
                    answer in Book 5 of <title level="m">Emile</title>: “In the union of the sexes
                    each contributes equally to the common aim, but not in the same
                    way.&#160;.&#160;. . One ought to be active and strong, the other passive and
                    weak. One must necessarily will and be able; it suffices that the other put up
                    little resistance .&#160;.&#160;. it follows that woman is made specially to
                    please man.&#160;.&#160;. . This is not the law of love .&#160;.&#160;. But it
                    is that of nature .&#160;.&#160;. .” (358). To understand why Wollstonecraft
                    spends so much time refuting Rousseau so thoroughly, students need to appreciate
                    his cultural weight in articulating ideas, such as the authority of nature over
                    cultural traditions, that Wollstonecraft herself then applies to deconstructing
                    his constructions of gender. They also need to grasp how ingeniously he
                    reconstructs gender hierarchy in new, “natural” terms to replace the
                        <foreign>ancien régime</foreign>’s traditional, religious ones.</p>
                <p>On the Internet, my students have found Rousseau’s construction of “natural”
                    gender roles renovated for the twenty-first century. When they first brought
                    these texts into our classroom, I thought we were reading satire in the style of
                    Stephen Colbert. But Arthur Goldwag assures us that the Red Pill Game, Return of
                    Kings and similar “manosphere” bloggers are not joking. Their sport and hunting
                    metaphors remind students of John Willoughby’s first appearance in <title
                        level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>, and Sir Peter Osborne’s in <title
                        level="m">The Victim of Prejudice</title>. Their arguments for repealing the
                    nineteenth amendment are similar in substance to its original opponents’, and
                    their rules for women’s conduct seem drawn from the same passages of <title
                        level="m">Emile</title> that Wollstonecraft critiques. Although the
                    manosphere’s characteristically crude or violent rhetoric dismays my students,
                    its power to intimidate them is deflated when they read it in an historical
                    context that exposes how outdated, extreme and marginal it now is. Similarly,
                    when Richard Polwhele labels Wollstonecraft “lascivious” and “licentious,” and
                    when “The Vision of Liberty” characterizes the <title level="m"
                        >Vindication</title> as a “scripture, archly fram’d, for propagating
                    w[hores],” the YouTube clip I show of Rush Limbaugh’s comparable commentary on
                    Sandra Fluke strikes students as more anachronistic than shocking (<title
                        level="m">Vindication</title>, Appendix D,185–86, ll. 19, 32; <title
                        level="m">Anti-Jacobin Review</title>, August 1801, Broadview edition 193). </p>
                <p>Analyzing and discussing rather than swiftly dismissing extreme contemporary
                    examples sensitizes students to similar messages in subtler and more mainstream
                    texts, and when a period literature course intersects with the immediate moment,
                    students soon begin connecting them independently. As a result, I am frequently
                    thrust without warning from the eighteenth century to today’s front page by
                    students whipping out their laptops or smartphones and reading aloud a relevant
                    story, post or sound bite. In such welcome emergencies, unable to prepare, I
                    rely on close reading and critical thinking questions: “How does this discourse
                    construct gender? What are its implications? its assumptions? Where might those
                    assumptions lead if they were applied more broadly? Do you want your society to
                    go there? Why or why not? Does this language echo any of the feminist or
                    anti-feminist Romantic-era discourse we have read? Whose? How, specifically?”
                    From these spontaneous discussions, students learn to analyze and articulate
                    their immediate reactions, gaining confidence both in their responses and in
                    their authority to express them.</p>
                <p>vi. <emph>Male Allies: “I absolutely disclaim and repudiate all pretence to have
                        acquired any rights whatever by virtue of such marriage” (Mill 1186)</emph>.
                    Despite the powerful efforts of Rousseau and others to lead Romantic revolution
                    away from equal rights for women, its feminist implications were seen and
                    explicated by other men, such as Nicolas de Condorcet and John Stuart Mill. As
                    Lynn Hunt points out in her introduction to “On the Admission of Women to the
                    Rights of Citizenship,” “Condorcet took the question of political rights to all
                    of its logical conclusions” in such statements as, “It is therefore unjust to
                    advance as grounds for continuing to refuse women the enjoyment of their natural
                    rights those reasons that only have some kind of reality because women do not
                    enjoy these rights in the first place” (119, 121). </p>
                <p>Reading John Stuart Mill’s repudiation of husbands’ unequal rights in Victorian
                    marriage, students note its resonance with Godwin’s criticism of “the evil of
                    marriage as it is practised in European countries,” “an affair of property, and
                    the worst of all properties” (<title level="m">Memoirs</title>, Appendix B 137).
                    To understand what Godwin condemns and Mill repudiates students need to
                    understand the traditional legal and social construction of marriage. Most do
                    not know that marriage laws were ever unequal to men’s advantage with regard to
                    property, child custody, divorce, and domestic violence. Nor do they know the
                    cultural expectations of married women in previous generations. So we read
                    Caroline Norton’s “A Letter to the Queen” alongside Edith Stern’s 1949 “Women
                    Are Household Slaves,” and the 1969 pamphlet, “Women: Do You Know the Facts
                    about Marriage?” (Damrosch and Dettmar 1639–42; MacLean 50–54, 87–88). This
                    helps students understand precisely what elements of traditional marriage
                    earlier feminists criticized, and why. Once women students fully realize what
                    Mill voluntarily gives up, their admiration sometimes exceeds their coherence:
                    “to think a man would actually do that .&#160;.&#160;.” is a representatively
                    reverent fragment from one recent discussion. The 1970 Young Lords Party’s
                    repudiation of “machismo” is a similarly appreciated revelation. </p>
                <p>We then read excerpts from the debate in the House of Commons following Mill’s 20
                    May 1867 speech proposing “leav[ing] out the word ‘man,’ in order to insert the
                    word ‘person’ .&#160;.&#160;. instead thereof,” which would have extended the
                    Second Reform Bill’s voting rights to women. As they read the arguments for and
                    against Mill’s proposal, students recognize familiar twenty-first-century
                    arguments against women’s other rights, and better understand why peaceful
                    change is slow. But they also see that Mill persuaded seventy-three Victorian
                    Englishmen to vote against their own gender privilege in support of women’s
                    suffrage, helping to advance a change that eventually did come. Accurate
                    attention to the continuous historical presence of feminist male allies is both
                    instructive and inspiring to young activists.</p>
                <p>With these texts, assignments and classroom strategies, ENLT 384: Romantic Era
                    Feminism teaches selected literature from the age of Romantic revolutions to the
                    current moment, revealing feminism’s historical depth and intellectual
                    authority, as well as the persistent conflict between a progressive feminist
                    movement and a reactionary anti-feminist counter-movement, from the eighteenth
                    century into the present. Teaching such historical continuities transforms
                    students’ view of their own position in history and their power to shape the
                    future.</p>
