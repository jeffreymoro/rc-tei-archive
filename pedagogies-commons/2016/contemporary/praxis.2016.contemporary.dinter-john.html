               <p>The ideal of childhood in contemporary Western cultures is a legacy of Romanticism.
                  Incarnations of the innocent child as once imagined by Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge
                  and others are perceived as pervasive norms that continue to inform discourses concerning
                  children, including debates on education, social policy, law, and media. This preoccupation
                  with childhood comes to the fore in a great number of British and Irish novels published
                  since the 1980s. This article addresses this recent trend and the opportunities it
                  creates for the teaching of contemporary literature in English Studies degree courses.
                  It presents the structure, methodology, and content of an advanced undergraduate course
                  on the legacies of the Romantic child as previously taught at Bielefeld University
                  in Germany. Reflecting upon the course’s goals and outcomes, we unite two fields of
                  research into contemporary literature: constructivist childhood studies and the critical
                  study of responses to and appropriations of Romanticism, epitomized by the notion
                  of the post-Romantic. After an introduction to our terminology and its implications
                  for classroom scenarios, we will outline the syllabus. Handouts, activities, and tasks
                  will serve as illustrative examples, which colleagues are welcome to adapt for their
                  own teaching. </p>

                  <p>Contemporary Britain provides a gripping cultural and political context for students’
                     enquiries into constructions of childhood.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>It must be noted that the syllabus included a novel by the Irish author John Boyne,
                              which is, however, not particularly relevant for the novel’s rendering of childhood.
                              Depictions of childhood in a specifically Irish context would undoubtedly constitute
                              a fascinating subject for research and teaching, too (Frank McCourt’s memoir Angela’s
                              Ashes comes to mind) but could not be included here. Colleagues who are interested
                              in Irish childhood(s) may refer to Dunne and Kelly.</span></div>
                     </div> Despite its long-standing artistic celebration of childhood and ongoing political
                     investments into child welfare, the United Kingdom has frequently been referred to
                     as “a serious contender for the title of worst place in Europe to be a child” (Micklewright
                     and Stewart 23). Having recently received harsh criticism in the assessment of children’s
                     general well-being from the United Nations and UNICEF (Kehily 7), the UK is notorious
                     for its widespread child poverty and its comparatively low age of criminal responsibility
                     alongside its unusually high number of young offenders held in custody (Wyness 73).
                     Moreover, the media coverage of events featuring binary constructions of children
                     as vicious perpetrators and as innocent victims, such as the public condemnation of
                     the two ten-year-old boys who murdered James Bulger in 1993 or the torture and death
                     of Victoria Climbié in 2000, continue to fuel moral panics. Phenomena such as the
                     disintegration of traditional family practices, excessive media consumption, juvenile
                     delinquency, and bullying are often construed as indicators of an apparent crisis
                     of contemporary childhood in Britain.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Since the 1980s, fiction from the British Isles has played a marked role in negotiating
                  these very issues. Acclaimed novels by such authors as Pat Barker, A.S. Byatt, Roddy
                  Doyle, Kazuo Ishiguro, Ian McEwan, and Ali Smith have tackled the debates surrounding
                  childhood. Many of these works depict child characters’ subjectivities and attempt
                  to convey cognitive development through formal means, which are specifically available
                  to the medium of narrative, such as free indirect discourse and focalization. American,
                  Canadian, and Australian childhood novels by Emma Donoghue, Jonathan Safran Foer,
                  M.J. Hyland, and Lionel Shriver have been equally successful in the British Isles.
                  Besides fiction, autobiographical accounts of childhood have enjoyed immense popularity
                  in recent years. The contemporary childhood novel is, moreover, explicitly marketed
                  as an emerging subgenre, with a group of leading authors in the field repeatedly commenting
                  upon each other’s works (Dinter 54). The course, “(Post-)Romantic Childhoods in British
                  Literature,” aimed to illustrate the remarkable thematic and formal variety in which
                  the novels respond to Romantic concepts of childhood, by reaffirming, transforming,
                  or subverting their precursors.</p>
               <p>A crucial point of departure for the Romantics was Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s understanding
                  of childhood as a separate, formative period of life characterized by a condition
                  of natural innocence, as outlined in <em>Emile</em> (1762). Since, for Rousseau, civilization immediately corrupts the state of natural
                  goodness, he outlines an educational program that would form and prolong childhood
                  according to this ideal. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, poetry
                  by William Blake, William Wordsworth, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, as well as books
                  for children by Anna Barbauld, Charlotte Smith, Maria Edgeworth, and Charles Lamb,
                  appropriated the subject of childhood and turned it into a prevalent literary concept
                  of the period. In Blake’s <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>, childhood emerges as an ideal state of purity, authenticity, and spontaneity. Yet
                  Blake always contrasts the pastoral world of innocence displayed in poems such as
                  “Laughing Song,” “Nurse’s Song,” or “Infant’s Joy” with darker realms of experience,
                  and his poetry also speaks to the harsh social conditions for children of his time.
                  The child speaker in “The Chimney Sweeper,” (from <em>Innocence</em>) for instance, laments how “my father sold me while yet my tongue, / Could scarcely
                  cry weep weep weep weep” (Blake 18). Wordsworth’s poetry, too, incorporates pastoral
                  child figures, often setting them amid scenes of loss and death. The young girl in
                  “We Are Seven,” for instance, refuses to confront the facts of death on adult terms.
                  Her persistence first seems naïve, but comes, over the course of the poem, to win
                  out over the reductive, rational response of her interlocutor. In the “Ode: Intimations
                  of Immortality,” <em>The Prelude</em>, and other works, Wordsworth employs childhood in distinctly autobiographical contexts
                  as a basis for explorations of memory and selfhood (cf. introductory overviews by
                  Chaplin; McGavran and Smith Daniel; McGillis). Already these examples of two canonical
                  poets suggest that no such thing as one homogeneous, self-evident and fixed concept
                  of “the Romantic child” exists in the literature of the period. Although we are very
                  much aware of this variety, we employ the term “the Romantic child” as a perceived
                  norm in contemporary fiction. It is above all the celebratory stance, the idea of
                  childhood as a near-sacred stage of inherent yet transient goodness and innocence,
                  which has enjoyed powerful afterlives.</p>
               <p>In our course, one major goal was that learners become familiar with contemporary
                  fiction’s wide spectrum of responses to this received Romantic norm. A major section
                  of the course addressed these responses in detail by examining three thematically
                  and formally disparate novels: Ian McEwan’s <em>The Cement Garden</em> (1979), Doris Lessing’s <em>The Fifth Child</em> (1988), and John Boyne’s <em>The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas</em> (2006). Discussions of the novels drew on constructivist approaches to childhood.
                  Such approaches first emerged in the 1980s with the rise of the so-called “new sociology
                  of childhood.” Directed against a “widespread tendency to routinize and ‘naturalize’
                  childhood” in a variety of discourses in which it is “regarded as necessary and inevitable,
                  and thus part of normal life” (Jenks 7), the most central assumption in this field
                  is that childhood is a variable social and cultural construct (Prout and James 8)
                  determined by complex power structures.</p>
               <p>In literary studies, childhood is still predominately associated with the study of
                  children’s literature, although an increasing amount of research into other literary
                  genres has emerged in recent years under the heading of “children in literature.”
                  Several survey texts constitute helpful resources for teachers and students and were
                  consulted for the design of this course. Adrienne E. Gavin’s edited volume <em>The Child in British Literature: Literary Constructions of Childhood, Medieval to
                     Contemporary</em> (2012) includes sixteen chapters dedicated to specific literary and cultural contexts
                  and epochs. <em>The Children’s Culture Reader</em> (1998), edited by Henry Jenkins, comprises central theoretical texts from a variety
                  of disciplines. Karín Lesnik-Oberstein’s volumes <em>Children in Culture</em> (1998) and <em>Children in Culture Revisited</em> (2011) contain a broad range of interdisciplinary contributions. Slightly older,
                  but nevertheless relevant monographs include Peter Coveney’s <em>The Image of Childhood: The Individual and Society: A Study of the Theme in English
                     Literature </em>(1967), Reinhard Kuhn’s <em>Corruption in Paradise: The Child in Western Literature</em> (1982), and Hugh Cunningham’s <em>The Children of the Poor: Representations of Childhood Since the Seventeenth Century</em> (1991). Two monographs dealing specifically with modern and contemporary fiction
                  are Susan Honeyman’s <em>Elusive Childhood: Impossible Representations in Modern Fiction</em> (2005) and Ellen Pifer’s <em>Demon or Doll? Images of the Child in Contemporary Writing and Culture </em>(2000). James Holt McGavran’s collections <em>Literature and the Child: Romantic Continuations, Postmodern Contestations</em> (1999) and <em>Time of Beauty, Time of Fear: The Romantic Legacy in the Literature of Childhood</em> (2012) are two rare examples centering on childhood from a post-Romantic perspective.
                  The largest corpus of secondary literature derives from scholarship on Romantic literature,
                  including, for instance, Judith Plotz’s <em>Romanticism and the Vocation of Childhood</em> (2001) and Ann Wierda Rowland’s <em>Romanticism and Childhood: The Infantilization of British Literary Culture</em> (2012).</p>
               <p>It should not come as a surprise that this recent interest in constructions of childhood
                  in sociology and literary studies has been paralleled by a wave of research focusing
                  on the multifaceted legacies of and responses to Romanticism. These studies have looked
                  at cultural and literary afterlives of Romanticism throughout Victorianism, Modernism,
                  and Postmodernism. Examples include Edward Larrissy’s volume <em>Romanticism and Postmodernism</em> (1999), Andrew Radford and Mark Sandy’s <em>Romantic Echoes in the Victorian Era</em> (2008), Carmen Casaliggi and Paul March-Russell’s <em>Legacies of Romanticism: Literature, Culture, Aesthetics (</em>2012), and Michael O’Neill’s monograph <em>The All-Sustaining Air: Romantic Legacies and Renewals in British, American, and Irish
                     Poetry since 1900</em> (2007). While the interest in poetic inheritances of Romanticism is certainly not
                  a new phenomenon (cf. earlier publications by Bloom [1976] or Bornstein [1976]), scholarship
                  has broadened its scope as it regards the cultural range of post-Romantic material
                  examined, from poetry to pop music, films, and fiction. Recent studies also increasingly
                  point to the challenge of defining Romanticism as a literary epoch and of conceptualizing
                  the very idea of its continuities or legacies.</p>
               <p>This research therefore provides a second fruitful point of departure for discussing
                  contemporary fiction’s negotiation of “the Romantic child” in the classroom. A term
                  pervading these studies that may prove helpful is the notion of the “post-Romantic.”
                  This term, which has mostly been used in a historical sense but has hardly been theoretically
                  defined, lends itself well as a structural category to describe the simultaneous affirmations
                  of and resistances to the “norm” of Romantic childhood as found in contemporary novels.
                  Through the prefix “post,” it puts emphasis on the (self-conscious) awareness of historical
                  and conceptual difference as viewed from the perspective of the contemporary. As Michael
                  O’Neill asserts, with regard to twentieth-century poetry, “‘Post-Romantic’ is, in
                  its way, as uncertain and fluid a term as ‘Romantic’; it is a necessary term, however,
                  since, even as poets . . . seek to renew the Romantic for a later age, they are conscious
                  of differences from Romanticism” (10). </p>
               <p>Reading negotiations of the “naturally” innocent child in post-1980s fiction as post-Romantic
                  thus highlights the self-conscious dimension of responses to Romantic concepts in
                  these texts. The notion of post-Romanticism enables students to develop an awareness
                  of literary epochs as heterogeneous constructions, which emerge <em>a posteriori</em> and may change over time. In this context, students may be invited to reflect on
                  the importance of maintaining a self-critical distance towards seemingly given concepts
                  in literary scholarship. The importance of such an awareness is of course a key argument
                  of Jerome McGann’s <em>The Romantic Ideology</em> (1985), which points to the risk encountered by any reader of Romantic—and, indeed,
                  post-Romantic—texts of pursuing an “uncritical absorption in Romanticism’s own self-representations”
                  (1).</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Teaching (Post-)Romantic Childhoods: The Course</span></h2>
               <p>Our course on “(Post-)Romantic Childhoods in British Literature” was part of the module
                  “Advanced British Studies” designed for third year undergraduate students at a German
                  university. In order to be admitted to the degree program <em>Anglistik: British and American Studies</em>, which is taught entirely in English, students need to demonstrate advanced skills
                  in English (level C1/C2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages).
                  The participants had practiced the analysis and discussion of literary and historical
                  texts in previous modules and had acquired a basic overview of the literary history
                  of the British Isles. They were thus familiar with the tools and literary categories
                  necessary for the analysis and interpretation of poetry and narrative as well as a
                  critical reception of secondary literature. To a lesser extent, they had already engaged
                  in reading critical theory. Noteworthy in the specific context of post-Romantic childhoods
                  is the fact that most participants studied English literature as part of a degree
                  that would lead to the German postgraduate certificate in secondary school teaching.
                  The course was thus directly linked to the practical dimensions of their future professional
                  lives. Moreover, most students would have encountered essentialist notions of childhood
                  in their pedagogy seminars, notions that our course sought to question.</p>
               <p>Like most seminars at German universities, the course was taught on a weekly basis
                  for a total of fifteen weeks, with each session consisting of ninety minutes. After
                  the introductory seminar, two weeks were dedicated to theoretical approaches to childhood.
                  A historical overview prepared the group for the engagement with Romantic constructions
                  of childhood in the subsequent three sessions, followed by a brief excursion into
                  the legacy of Romanticism in the Victorian era. The eighth session then moved over
                  to cover contemporary British culture and literature. The remaining seven weeks were
                  dedicated to the three contemporary novels before a final seminar summarized what
                  the students had learned. Three “study questions” were assigned by the tutor in advance
                  of each session (see appendix).</p>
               <p>The introductory session included a group activity, in which students were asked to
                  define what they believed to constitute “childhood” and “non-childhood” in a chart
                  on a handout (see appendix). What became clear through this exercise was that most
                  students’ conceptions of childhood corresponded to a simplified notion of Romantic
                  childhood; often, however, they were not aware of its origins. Furthermore, students’
                  definitions of childhood always related to what they claimed to be its binary opposition:
                  adulthood. Students referred to aspects such as sexuality, political participation,
                  paid employment, education, and maturity as distinguishing features of what they regarded
                  as two poles. The chart exercise motivated students to start thinking critically about
                  their assumptions. In the final seminar, they were asked to look at the chart again
                  in order to reflect on the learning outcomes. In addition, an enquiry into the course’s
                  title “(Post-)Romantic Childhoods in British Literature” intended to encourage students
                  to identify some of the leading questions and topics of the course by problematizing
                  the implications of the title’s three major concepts: “Romantic,” “post-Romantic,”
                  and “childhoods.”</p>
               <p>For the next week, students prepared an excerpt of a seminal theoretical work on childhood:
                  Philippe Ariès’s <em>Centuries of Childhood: A Social History of Family Life</em> (1960). Ariès, a representative of the <span class="foreign">histoire des mentalités</span>, is known as the founding father of the constructivist approach. He claimed that
                  the modern conception of childhood as a separate stage in human life with distinct
                  privileges and restrictions arose as a product of a complex set of social transitions
                  active since the Renaissance, such as the formation of the private nuclear family,
                  the institutionalization of education, and newly emerging notions of morality. Despite
                  its massive impact, Ariès’s claims have been harshly critiqued from a variety of angles.
                  Students thus also read Roger Cox’s “The Child in History: Introduction,” a short
                  book chapter which outlines some of the major points of attack. In addition, it proved
                  productive to analyze some of the paintings Ariès refers to in <em>Centuries</em>, including Pieter Brueghel’s <em>The Peasant Dance</em> and <em>Peasant Wedding</em> (both 1568), Hans Holbein’s portrait of Prince Edward (ca. 1538), and the portrait
                  of Barbara Sidney, Countess of Leicester with six of her children painted by Marcus
                  Gheeraerts the Younger (c.1596). The group was asked to describe these pictures, paying
                  attention to aesthetic means, such as composition, colors, and perspective. They noticed
                  that children are constructed as miniature adults, wearing the same clothes and engaging
                  in the same activities as adults. At the same time, they noticed that these paintings
                  also function as prestigious status symbols and cannot be taken as representations
                  of a given reality, which is exactly one of the major points of criticism concerning
                  Ariès’s methodology.</p>
               <p>The second part of this block moved on to more recent theories. Students prepared
                  an excerpt from Jacqueline Rose’s <em>The Case of Peter Pan: Or the Impossibility of Children’s Fiction</em> (1984) as well as the essay “Childhood Studies: Past, Present and Future” by Martin
                  Woodhead. Woodhead reflects upon transformations in research on childhood, which eventually
                  led to the constructivist paradigms of a disciplinary conglomerate he labels “childhood
                  studies.” We discussed these shifts, related them to their previous reading of Ariès,
                  and critically debated Woodhead’s impetus of “‘child centered’ research” which is
                  “built around children’s agency, their rights and well-being” (25). This agenda partly
                  undermines a constructivist approach as it claims knowledge of “the child” in a process
                  that is, from the start, governed by adults. Rose’s text makes a similar point as
                  it deconstructs children’s fiction as: <span class="quote">‘a world in which the adult comes first (author, maker, giver) and the child comes
                     after (reader, product, receiver), but where neither of them enter the space in between.
                     To say that the child is inside the book—children’s books are after all as often as
                     not <em>about</em> children—is to fall straight into a trap. It is to confuse the adult’s intention
                     to get at the child with the child it portrays. If children’s fiction builds an image
                     of the child inside the book, it does so in order to secure the child who is outside
                     the book, the one who does not come so easily within its grasp. (58, emphasis in original)’</span> As this quotation suggests, Rose problematizes numerous common assumptions about
                  children’s literature. In order to give students an idea of the heated debates Rose
                  triggered amongst scholars, a longer exercise consisted of reading part of Perry Nodelman’s
                  response entitled “The Case of Children’s Fiction: Or The Impossibility of Jacqueline
                  Rose” and relating it to the texts previously read in class.</p>
               <p>With these theoretical foundations in mind, the fourth seminar gave a broad overview
                  of changing conceptions of childhood in Britain in their social and historical contexts.
                  Harry Hendrick’s “Constructions and Reconstructions of British Childhood: An Interpretative
                  Survey, 1800 to the Present” served as the basis for discussion. Hendrick emphasizes
                  the crucial role of ideology and the desire for control pervading adult perspectives
                  on what constitutes a “proper” childhood (60). He thus introduces the function of
                  constructions of childhood as <em>norms</em>, a concept relevant to understanding the lasting power of Romantic ideas of the child
                  in literary texts. Powerpoint slides helped to summarize the central authoritative
                  constructions of childhood listed by Hendrick (including, for example, the “Natural”
                  and the “Romantic child,” the “delinquent child,” the “schooled child,” the “child
                  of the nation,” and the “psychological child”). In a group exercise, students worked
                  with two documents that exemplified Hendrick’s claims: an extract from Rousseau’s
                  <em>Emile</em> (1762) and John Locke’s <em>Some Thoughts Concerning Education</em> (1693). As the authors and origin of the text passages were not given to the students,
                  they had to deduct which of Hendrick’s concepts the respective text advocated and
                  guess the authors themselves.</p>
               <p>This overview paved the way for two weeks focusing on literature from the Romantic
                  period. For the fifth session, students prepared a section from Aidan Day’s introduction
                  to Romanticism that focuses on “Constructions of the term ‘Romantic’” as well as three
                  of Wordsworth’s shorter lyric poems, “We are Seven,” “Lucy Gray,” and “My Heart Leaps
                  up When I Behold.” The chronology was reversed here and Blake was discussed in the
                  subsequent week, so that a full seminar could be devoted to the <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>. Day’s chapter served to reactivate students’ prior knowledge of the Romantic period
                  and its key authors, concepts, and literary practices. Day also emphasizes the fact
                  that literary epochs are always conceptualized retrospectively: “the identification
                  and historical description of a named British Romantic movement really began to take
                  shape only in the second half of the [nineteenth] century” (87). This insight may
                  help students more generally to understand how childhood came to be associated prominently
                  with the Romantics. Powerpoint slides helped to briefly outline concepts such as the
                  sublime, the elevation of the poet as prophet, and the poetic focus on subjectivity
                  and authenticity. Some of these issues could be linked to ideas of childhood as encountered
                  earlier in the seminar series, for example in Hendrick’s text. The second half of
                  the seminar was then dedicated to Wordsworth’s poems. The aim was to highlight his
                  use of natural motifs in relation to children, the role of the autobiographical self,
                  and the function of the seeming simplicity of verse structures and other linguistic
                  features that support the idea of childhood as a superior state, which is celebrated
                  by the speaker. The advantage of Wordsworth’s shorter works for the teaching scenario
                  was clearly the accessibility of these texts in terms of vocabulary and structure.
                  <em>The Prelude</em>, the Immortality Ode, and other longer works were briefly introduced by the lecturer
                  and suggested as possible topics for student essays.</p>
               <p>The next seminar then took a chronological step backwards, looking at Blake’s <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em> in their entirety. At home, the students had researched the pastoral tradition and
                  acquired contextual information on Blake’s illustration and writing practices from
                  Mary Lynn Johnson and John E. Grant’s introduction to the <em>Songs</em> (Blake 811). They were also asked to think about similarities and differences between
                  the introductory poems to the volume’s two sections, which helped to explore the opposing
                  states of innocence and experience. Divided into five groups, the class studied “The
                  Lamb,” “Little Black Boy,” and “The Chimney Sweeper” from the <em>Innocence</em> section, as well as “Holy Thursday” and “The School Boy” from the <em>Experience</em> section. The form and content of Blake’s seemingly simple yet symbolically charged
                  lyrics were analysed, with special attention paid to their uses and their functionalization
                  of childhood. Similarities with and differences to Wordsworth were examined, for example
                  with regard to the function of the lyrical persona, religious motifs, and the hymn-like
                  structure of many of Blake’s “songs.”</p>
               <p>Having thus covered some canonical Romantic conceptualizations of childhood, while
                  also pointing out differences among poets, the course then took a brief excursion
                  into the Victorian period, taking as a point of focus Chapters I to IV of Charles
                  Dickens’s <em>Oliver Twist </em>(1837–39). The novel was introduced as central to the ambivalent “cult” of childhood
                  in Victorian literature and culture. The Victorians were also the first in England
                  to establish the idea of Romanticism as a literary movement as such—in a way, acting
                  as posthumous creators of the Romantics. Finally, Dickens constitutes an initial canonical
                  example for discussing post-Romantic textual strategies—how authors adopt, but also
                  extend or subvert aspects of Wordsworth’s or Blake’s Romantic childhoods. The session
                  was introduced with a historical contextualization of the themes covered in <em>Oliver Twist</em>. The class gained a more profound idea of the miserable condition of the lower classes
                  in Victorian England, looking at the situation in the workhouses and key government
                  policies, such as the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act. The classroom discussion of the
                  novel was partly informed by an article on childhood in Dickens by Robert Newsom,
                  who delineates but also questions Dickens’s decisive role in perpetuating Romantic
                  ideas of childhood in fiction. The students examined the beginning of <em>Oliver Twist</em> in regard to its melodramatic sentimentalizing of the child character, its use of
                  an authorial narrator and irony, hyperbole, and other tropes. While the class easily
                  recognized continuations from Wordsworth’s and Blake’s works, they also reflected
                  on alterations in comparison to Romantic constructions of the child. These were also
                  related to the different characteristics and techniques of the social novel as opposed
                  to poetry.</p>
               <p>The subsequent session left the nineteenth century behind and addressed the current
                  state of childhood in Britain. An inquiry into the alleged crisis of childhood from
                  the Thatcher years up to the present day provided the first thematic focus. Students
                  began by reading a copy of the entry “Disappearance of Loss of Childhood” from Allison
                  James and Adrian James’s <em>Key Concepts in Childhood Studies</em>. James and James refer to Neil Postman’s thesis that there has been a disappearance
                  of childhood in contemporary society based on the transition from textual to visual
                  media. Students were asked to scrutinize some of the rather problematic arguments
                  Postman provides and to formulate counter-arguments to his hypothesis. They referred
                  to the opposing thesis of a prolongation of childhood and adolescence in late modernity,
                  the datedness of Postman’s argument in the age of the digital revolution as well as
                  his ignorance regarding children’s media literacies. Students were then asked to debate
                  how Phil Scraton’s more nuanced texts and the newspaper article by Amelia Hill et
                  al. position themselves towards the notion of a crisis of childhood and what historical
                  factors and incidents they refer to. Then the discussion shifted to literature. Of
                  particular interest were Katherina Dodou’s claims that “[w]hat is particular about
                  contemporary fiction is the prevalence of the aim to scrutinize the idea that the
                  child is inherently innocent and that this innocence is precious and worth protecting”
                  and that “the contemporary novel invites an approach to the child that views it as
                  an artifact” (239, 249). These claims clearly relate to Romantic notions of childhood
                  as previously discussed in class. Furthermore, Dodou points to a “self-consciousness”
                  of contemporary texts concerning their literary precursors, which provides an overarching
                  theme according to which one could analyze the three contemporary novels.</p>
               <p>The first of these novels was Ian McEwan’s <em>The Cement Garden</em> (1979). Narrated retrospectively by Jack, the eldest brother, the novella depicts
                  a summer in the lives of four siblings who decide to encase their mother’s corpse
                  in cement in the basement of their house instead of informing the local authorities
                  of her death. Without any parental supervision, the children engage in a series of
                  transgressive activities, which climax in sexual intercourse between Jack and Julie,
                  the eldest sister. Whilst obviously breaking with the ideal of childhood as a state
                  of innocence, the novella equally perpetuates and partially perverts simplified notions
                  of Romantic childhood. This shows in the child characters’ primitivism, their utopian
                  spirit, and the nature vs. nurture debate, captured in the once highly stylized and
                  later overgrown garden. After a brief introduction to McEwan’s life and the prevalence
                  of the theme of childhood in his oeuvre (based on Childs), the first exercise consisted
                  of a close reading of the novella’s first paragraph. The students recognized that
                  the paragraph introduces several of the central conflicts and sets up the particular
                  style of Jack’s narration. Further exercises included an analysis of the novella’s
                  constructions and transformations of spaces and temporalities. Noteworthy aspects
                  are the role of the basement as the sphere of the unconscious and the repressed, the
                  garden as a symbol of patriarchy, and the fairytale-like atmosphere evoked by images
                  of sleep and references to timelessness, which prompted several students to a Freudian
                  reading. The lecturer used the opportunity to point out the significant ramifications
                  Freudian psychoanalysis brought about in the twentieth century by introducing theories
                  of infant sexuality. An analysis of McEwan’s constructions of gender and sexuality
                  followed, including the power struggle between Jack and Julie, the employment of the
                  male gaze, Tom’s cross dressing, and the idea of original sin.</p>
               <p>The next novel considered was Doris Lessing’s <em>The Fifth Child</em> (1988), published only nine years after <em>The Cement Garden</em>, at the height of Thatcherism in Britain. Often interpreted as a Gothic narrative
                  (Anievas Gamallo 115), the novella focuses on the couple Harriet and David Lovatt
                  whose family idyll shatters when their eponymous fifth child Ben is born. Narrated
                  by a third-person narrator and internally focalized through Harriet (and thus formally
                  distinct from <em>The Cement Garden</em>) Lessing’s novella constructs Ben as a deviant, violent, and opaque child. Ben’s
                  perspective, in contrast, is left out. The aim of the first session was to read Ben
                  as an allegorical figure against the backdrop of Thatcherism, as initiated by one
                  of the study questions. As various scholars have noted, Ben can be viewed as “figure
                  of the ‘enemy within’” (Yelin 104) as “Lessing utilizes the xenophobic paranoia characteristic
                  of Britain in the aftermath of the Falklands War as a departure point for a comprehensive
                  satirical dismantling of the contradictions and paradoxes that render Thatcherism
                  unsustainable and doom it to collapse” (Brock 7). After a broad introduction to the
                  1980s in Britain, students analyzed the Lovatt family as a microcosm of Thatcherism
                  (Brock 7).</p>
               <p>The subsequent session drew attention to the issue of childhood as it focused on Ben
                  and his constellation to the other child characters. In a close reading of Ben’s birth
                  (Lessing 59–62), students explored the strategies and metaphorical language the narrator
                  employs to construct Ben as “the other.” At this point the tutor also introduced Freud’s
                  notion of “the uncanny” as a possible approach to read his otherness. Afterwards,
                  students compared the literary construction of Ben to his siblings Helen, Luke, and
                  Paul whose “fair hair and blue eyes and pink cheeks” (27) can be read as a stereotypical
                  reference to Romantic imagery of childhood. The major aim of this exercise was to
                  make students aware of the fact that Lessing self-consciously juxtaposes and complicates
                  different constructions of childhood. Whereas Ben clearly deviates from the norm of
                  the innocent and endearing child, he nevertheless remains the novel’s center of attention;
                  by contrast, the other child characters do not advance beyond their status as rather
                  underdeveloped archetypes. </p>
               <p>The final two sessions on contemporary fiction dealt with John Boyne’s controversial
                  <em>The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas</em> (2006) and its 2008 film adaptation by Mark Herman. The novel is set in Nazi Germany,
                  a challenging and problematic context for negotiating childhood. It concerns the unlikely
                  friendship between Bruno, the nine-year-old son of an SS officer, and Shmuel, a Jewish
                  boy imprisoned in a death camp. Again narrated by a third-person narrator and internally
                  focalized through Bruno, the novel instrumentalizes and exaggerates concepts of childhood
                  innocence and ignorance as Bruno displays no knowledge whatsoever of the Nazi regime.
                  Two study questions prepared the students for a discussion of the allegation that
                  the novel downplays the cruelty of the Holocaust. In addition, they were asked to
                  come up with two study questions themselves and to post them on the course’s e-learning
                  platform.</p>
               <p>Bearing the controversies in mind, the first session on Boyne also gave students time
                  to reflect on whom they considered to be the novel’s target audience, based on its
                  narrative techniques, plot, and themes. The novel can be approached as a work of crossover
                  fiction, being marketed for children <em>and</em> adult readers. The following seminar then looked in more detail at the sentimental
                  functionalization of Romantic childhood by means of character construction, narrative
                  perspective, and setting. These issues were taken up again when discussing excerpts
                  of the film adaptation of the novel. Here, the students could practice translating
                  their acquired knowledge about childhood from narrative texts to film. Participants
                  examined how the film struggles to approximate the novel’s construction of the child
                  characters’ strikingly limited capacity to “see,” evident, for example, in Bruno’s
                  inability to interpret the symbolic meaning of the swastika.</p>
               <p>The final week concluded the course by returning to the chart on “childhood” and “non-childhood”
                  compiled in week one, an exercise that enabled students to revise their original preconceptions
                  about childhood. In order to recapitulate the knowledge acquired throughout the course,
                  groups worked on an unmarked end of term quiz, which included one question for each
                  week’s contents. Based on the seminar group’s feedback and the tutor’s own reflections,
                  we can conclude that the course achieved most of its goals. The students appreciated
                  that the subject of childhood serves as a point of departure to explore a great variety
                  of socio-political contexts (e.g., the Victorian workhouse and the New Right in Britain),
                  theoretical approaches (e.g., the history of mentalities and psychoanalysis), and
                  aesthetic and formal concepts (e.g., the sublime and the pastoral). They also found
                  the study questions particularly helpful. A point of criticism was the high workload,
                  particularly the lengthy texts. From the tutor’s point of view, it can be noted that
                  the particular design of this course afforded a great amount of preparation and marking.
                  This was largely due to the size of the group (forty students), which made it difficult
                  to include more learner-centered activities, such as student presentations. Whereas
                  in the class discussions students demonstrated a profound understanding of the constructivist
                  approach, some of the essays still displayed essentialist notions of childhood. This
                  could be seen as a consequence of the demanding, often meta-theoretical, issues addressed
                  in this course. It must also be admitted that the course excluded over one hundred
                  and fifty years of British literary history between the early Victorian period and
                  the present, which could also have been studied in terms of post-Romantic engagements
                  with childhood. However, as we hope to have shown, the topic of post-Romantic childhoods
                  provides further scope for both research and teaching. </p>

               which is, however, not particularly relevant for the novel’s rendering of childhood.
               Depictions of childhood in a specifically Irish context would undoubtedly constitute
               a fascinating subject for research and teaching, too (Frank McCourt’s memoir <em>Angela’s Ashes</em> comes to mind) but could not be included here. Colleagues who are interested in Irish
               childhood(s) may refer to Dunne and Kelly.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
