               <h2><span class="head">Why the Nineteenth Century?</span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">This will be an upper-division course on the “long nineteenth century.” Our nineteenth
                  century will start in the eighteenth and end in the twentieth. What kind of a nineteenth
                  century is that?</p>
               <p class="noCount">This course will assume that </p>
               <dl>
                  <dt></dt>
                  <dd>literature changes over time and changes gradually (not suddenly at the end of a century),
                     and </dd>
                  <dt></dt>
                  <dd>literature changes because it is in close communication with the world in which it
                     is created: as this world changes, so does the writing in it. </dd>
               </dl>
               <p class="noCount">But does the world change the writing or does the writing change the world? The nineteenth
                  century presents some of the greatest examples of writing that changed the world and
                  reflected its enormous changes. To understand how this happened, we will look at the
                  writing created between two dramatic historical bookends to the nineteenth century:
                  the French (Bourgeois) Revolution (1789) and the Russian (Bolshevik) Revolution (1917).
                  Why were there TWO revolutions so close to the nineteenth century? Revolution sounds
                  like serious business. Who would ever dare to start one (let alone two)? Revolutions
                  demand radical change. Where do the revolutionaries get the idea of the new society
                  they demand? What if their vision is not to everyone’s liking? Once it starts, when
                  is a revolution over? What does literature have to do with any of this?</p>
               <p class="noCount">We will read, think and write about how texts and societies interact and what nineteenth-century
                  literature and other texts can tell us about the social and political imagination
                  of the period. We will also begin to learn how to read critical texts about literature
                  written by literary scholars and historians.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Required Texts:</span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">The reading list for this course is fairly serious. Some of the readings are long
                  and demanding, as is appropriate for an upper-level college course for English majors.
                  </p>
               <p class="noCount">There are several <span style="font-weight:bold">books</span> available through the John Jay Bookstore. You may buy your books elsewhere, or read
                  electronic editions of the text.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">These books are required: </span></p>

                  <dd><em>Recommended: </em>Marge Piercy, <em>City of Darkness, City of Light</em>. This book is a fictionalized account of the French Revolution. Piercy treats historical
                     persons who played important parts in the Revolution as literary characters. The book
                     makes it easier to imagine how the Revolution unfolded and how ordinary people decided
                     to participate in such an extraordinary event.</dd>
               </dl>
               <p class="noCount">In addition to the books, there will be a number of readings available on Blackboard.

               <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">You must have your reading in class, either in paper or electronic copy. You need
                     the reading in order to discuss it. Those who don’t have the reading will be counted

               <p class="noCount">The work envisioned for this semester assumes that each student in this class has
                  successfully completed <span style="font-weight:bold">Literature 260. Everyone in this class is presumed to be familiar with the basic concepts
                     and terminology of literary analysis</span>. If you are unsure that you have all the terms covered, you should have a book that
                  covers these. Here’s an example of such a book:</p>
               <p class="noCount">M. H. Abrams, <em>A Glossary of Literary Terms</em>, 9th ed., Thomson-Wadsworth, 2005. ISBN 9781413033908.</p>

                  You should only stay in the class if you are willing to commit to doing the work.
                  The amount and complexity of reading will challenge everyone and the only way to keep
                  the work under control is to do it <em>regularly</em>. Outside of class, you will read and take notes. In class, you will bring your homework,
                  participate in discussion.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><em>Texting, playing games, Facebooking etc. are all signs that you are not engaged in
                     class work. If I see you using your phone in class, you will have to leave and I will
                     count you absent</em>.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><em>Attendance</em> is mandatory and will constitute a part of your grade. You are allowed four absences.
                  If you miss four classes, you will lose 10% of the total grade (A will become B, B
                  will become C, etc.) Save your allowed absences for emergencies. Anyone with four
                  or more absences will not pass the course.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><em>Academic integrity</em> I am assuming that you know that plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty
                  are unacceptable. Any plagiarized assignment will receive an automatic F and the student
                  who submitted it will be reported to the Academic Integrity Officer.</p>
