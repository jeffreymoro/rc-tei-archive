               <p>I take my title from a moment this fall when a new colleague welcomed me to the University
                  of Denver Department of English, explaining that I might think of the department’s
                  unofficial mascot as the zonkey, or zebra-donkey hybrid, representing the admixture
                  of critical and creative inquiry. This statement resonates with my own approach to
                  teaching literature, not to mention my penchant for obscure animal metaphors. Without
                  putting too much theoretical or zoological pressure on the descriptive term, in this
                  essay I’ll share one aspect of my approach to zonkey Romanticism, focusing on the
                  inclusion of creative writing assignments in the Romantic literature classroom.</p>
               <p>The use of creative writing as a teaching tool is, for me, inseparably interlaced
                  with a twinned focus on the Romantic and the contemporary. When I’m explaining my
                  myriad projects to new interlocutors, I often describe myself as an “unromantic Romanticist.”
                  By this I mean that I’m interested in the Romantic as a moment of crisis but I’m uninterested
                  in what I think of as Romantic exceptionalism. This is to say that I find it unproductive
                  to think of Romantic literature as representing a sort of singular moment at which
                  experiment is made possible—a moment that is sometimes thought to reoccur, somehow,
                  during High Modernism. Rather, I am interested in excavating literary and poetic experiment
                  as a historical and transhistorical project or series of projects that cross the boundaries
                  we use to delimit period, coterie, and discourse field. </p>
               <p>Within the classroom context, this intellectual manifesto translates into a cultural
                  studies approach in which I ask students to read Romantic texts as themselves and
                  then to read their own literary and cultural moment as Romanticists. So, “Early Romantic
                  Literature and the Invention of Poetic Experiment” begins with an in-depth, historicist
                  analysis of <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> and concludes with whatever new, exciting poetry has come out that very month (most
                  recently, Sarah Blake’s lyric biography of Kanye West, which the press sent on to
                  us in advance of the publication date). “Later Romantic Literature: Monsters and Rock
                  Stars” approaches texts such as <em>The Vampyre</em> and <em>Don Juan </em>with an emphasis on the interrelated themes of celebrity and monstrosity, and concludes
                  with a collaboratively student-designed unit on monstrosity in contemporary celebrity
                  culture. Throughout these courses, one technique remains consistent: the inclusion
                  of creative writing assignments that ask students to invert their perspective on the
                  Romantic text and to usher that text into their contemporary moment. And, while I
                  wouldn’t take it upon myself to suggest that everyone allow their students to assign
                  the pilot episode of <em>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</em> in a course focused on Keats, Byron, and the Shelleys, it is my conviction and my
                  experience that a creative writing assignment can infuse any Romantics course with
                  critical concern for the contemporary while supporting common student learning outcomes.
                  It is in the service of this conviction that I offer four theses on teaching zonkey
                  Romanticism.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">1. CREATIVE WRITING IS HYBRID</span></h2>
               <p>In the context of zonkey Romanticism, “creative writing” refers to hybrid critical/creative
                  projects involving a series of self-reflexive loops and turns that ask students to
                  read and reread Romantic texts and contexts, their own writing, and, ultimately, their
                  own cultural moment. This sort of hybrid writing assignment is, of course, not unique
                  to my classes. I first encountered hybrid critical/creative assignments as an undergraduate
                  student at Colorado College, where one of my favorite professors, Regula Meyer Evitt,
                  would often ask students to, for example, create their own circle of hell and then
                  use a close-reading of their own writing to generate an in-depth analysis of the logic
                  that governs Dante’s <em>Inferno</em>. Thinking through the benefits of using creative writing in response to texts in
                  the college literature classroom, Peter Wilson has described a “creative-critical
                  spectrum suggested by the following descriptors: creative writing not in response
                  to text, creative writing in response to text, critical-creative re-writing, critical
                  writing in response to text, critical writing not in response to text” (440). Zonkey
                  that I am, I understand the interplay between critical and creative inquiry in less
                  linear terms, all the while subscribing to Wilson’s suggestion that all writing is,
                  to some extent, creative, and that playing with this variable can have profound pedagogical
                  payoffs.</p>
               <p>For example, last spring, I asked students at Rutgers to follow an assignment in which
                  they close-read one stanza from <em>Don Juan</em> by writing an imitation of the very stanza they had close-read. Students then wrote
                  a 500-word critical coda in which they explained and justified their choices. In effect,
                  I asked students to respond to everything they had discovered in their close reading
                  through creative writing.</p>
               <p>One student, Elizabeth Giardina, chose to close read and then imitate Stanza 43 of
                  Canto VI:</p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">She was not violently lively, but</div>
                     <div class="l">Stole on your spirit like a May day breaking.</div>
                     <div class="l">Her eyes were not too sparkling, yet half-shut,</div>
                     <div class="l">They put beholders in a tender taking.</div>
                     <div class="l">She looked (this simile’s quite new) just cut<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
                     <div class="l">From marble, like Pygmalion’s statue waking,</div>
                     <div class="l">The mortal and the marble still at strife, </div>
                     <div class="l">And timidly expanding into life.</div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> Explicating her responses to this stanza, Elizabeth described her progression from
                  the close reading to the hybrid assignment as follows:<span class="quote">‘[For the close reading,] I focused especially on the equivocal language, such as
                     litotes like “She was not violently lovely, but . . .” Byron employs to discuss Dudù’s
                     beauty. He mentions in the stanza that her beauty was like a “May day breaking,” further
                     emphasizing her liminal status between opposites—between night and day, perhaps. For
                     my imitation of this stanza in relation to modern culture, I chose to focus on another
                     woman, but one who is known for her politics rather than her beauty. Hillary Clinton
                     is often in the public eye for the beauty blunders she apparently commits. One that
                     came to mind most easily for me was the constant critique of her “cankles,” so I decided
                     they would be my main focus in my stanza. I sought to employ the same equivocal attitude
                     toward her that Byron does toward Dudù, but to have a different intent in mind.’</span> Elizabeth’s resulting imitation sets forth its own poetic satire:</p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">They are not excessively fat, but</div>
                     <div class="l">Jiggle when she turns around a corner;</div>
                     <div class="l">Cankles a fine shade of pistachio nut,</div>
                     <div class="l">Stuffed inside too tight heels and make me mourn her</div>
                     <div class="l">Comfort. ‘Twixt green and tan, her leg hairs uncut:<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
                     <div class="l">She’s Athena amidst tea and foreigners.</div>
                     <div class="l">Though much of her speech was understood moot,</div>
                     <div class="l">For she dared wear a dress instead of a pantsuit. </div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> Reflecting on her creative process, Elizabeth explained, “[w]hile I was writing the
                  stanza I was aware that I would need to close read it afterward, and so I was especially
                  aware of how I used my language, rhythm, and line breaks in order to illustrate my
                  point.” Indeed, Elizabeth’s close reading of her own creative work involved digging
                  in to the details of her imitation as well as the details of the original stanza.
                  For example, Elizabeth comments on her interpretation of Byron’s underhanded diction
                  (“An ankle is not beautiful if it is somewhere between green and tan; it would look
                  repulsive and unhealthy. But ‘pistachio’ tiptoes around the issue with a pretty word
                  and the idea of a tasty snack”) and reimagines Byron’s allusions for the contemporary
                  context (“the reference to Athena rather than Pygmalion’s statue emphasizes intellectual
                  capability rather than sheer physical appeal”). Written in tandem with more conventional
                  forms of literary analysis and academic writing, Elizabeth’s ode to Hillary’s cankles
                  presents a moment of performance in which the student inhabits the formal space of
                  the Romantic poem and the cultural-critical space of the Romantic poet.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">2. CREATIVE WRITING IS LIBERATING</span></h2>
               <p>When I assign hybrid critical/creative papers in my classes, I hasten to remind students
                  that this isn’t a creative writing class and that they won’t be graded based on talent.
                  Even with and perhaps in part due to these disclaimers, the resulting creative work
                  is often excellent. Reflecting on this trend, Wilson points out that, when these types
                  of assignments are used in class, “[c]reative writing is seen . . . as a means to
                  better critical reading, but . . . the relation is reciprocal and critically informed
                  reading can be the context for genuinely talented creative work” (441). I agree that
                  strong creative reading promotes strong creative writing, and would add to this assertion
                  my sense that students find the creative writing assignments to be liberating and/or
                  disarming, an experience that promotes a greater sense of strength and ease as they
                  work through assignments. Writing in a new genre in which they are not expected to
                  have developed “good” habits, students seem eager to take chances and to perform experiments.
                  </p>
               <p>I base these general claims in part on the investment and enthusiasm I’ve witnessed
                  during student paper presentations and in part based on student responses to creative
                  papers in anonymous course evaluations. In the latter context, students often describe
                  hybrid assignments as “fun” and “enjoyable,” ask for more, or tell me they “loved”
                  the assignment. This sense that hybrid critical/creative assignments are somehow a
                  treat or gift built into the curriculum reflects, I think, the extent to which a creative
                  approach to analyzing literature allows students to relax and enjoy learning. These
                  assignments ask students to create something new for which they have no model, rather
                  than to strive toward the platonic ideal of the perfect English paper. The resulting
                  engaged, non-anxious approach to the creative assignment helps generate clear, insightful
                  student writing, not only for the hybrid assignment itself, but also for later, more
                  conventional assignments. In course evaluations, students report that creative writing
                  helps them tap into their creativity; I’ve noticed that students engage this creativity
                  while completing more conventional writing assignments (e.g. comparative papers and
                  thesis-driven analyses), as well.</p>
               <p>Additionally, by asking students to take on the role of the Romantic author, this
                  category of assignment invites students to peel back the cloak of canonicity and to
                  claim Romantic perspectives for themselves. Compared to their thesis-driven counterparts,
                  creative assignments are often irreverent, as in one student’s “No Time for the Ancient
                  Mariner,” in which Coleridge’s ancient mariner, transported to the present day, can’t
                  get anyone on the street to stop and listen to his story, or in various reinterpretations
                  of “This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison” in which students use Coleridge’s projected frustration
                  at an absent nostalgia to account for the FOMO they experience whilst navigating between
                  studying and socializing. I humbly submit that it’s OK and maybe even preferable for
                  students to be irreverent (educated, insightful, and interested, of course, but also,
                  sometimes, irreverent) when it comes to Coleridge et al., and often use creative assignments
                  to dismantle the imposing hierarchy of canonicity. Writing about the ways in which
                  creative writing exercises can promote “investment” and “authority” among composition
                  students, Drew and Yost have argued that “these exercises can become central to the
                  work of the composition classroom by helping to undermine the Author/student writer
                  dichotomy” (30). Beyond upsetting this dichotomy, creative responses to Romanticism
                  can help students connect Romantic literature to their lives and, in turn, find ways
                  to connect to the Romantic.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">3. CREATIVE WRITING INVERTS THE ROMANTIC AND THE CONTEMPORARY</span></h2>
               <p>Creative writing assignments ask students to invert their perspective, taking on Romantic
                  concerns, forms, and experiments and applying them to their own contemporary experience.
                  This process develops in two dimensions. In some cases, Romantic thinking allows students
                  to reconsider contemporary issues; in other cases, the opportunity to write like a
                  Romantic encourages students to infuse their everyday world with new—that is, old—ideas.</p>
               <p>One assignment that encourages students to reconsider contemporary issues through
                  a Romantic lens is a monster narrative written in the nineteenth-century tradition
                  but focused on a contemporary issue, topic, or context. In “Later Romantic Literature:
                  Monsters and Rock Stars,” this assignment generated a number of monster narratives
                  dealing with issues of body image and the beauty industry. For example, one story,
                  written by Shayla Lawz, presented a monstrous and ultimately tragic depiction of two
                  young girls mimicking their mother’s fixation on her physical appearance: <span class="quote">‘Each afternoon as their momma went to run errands, the two girls kept themselves
                     busy by playing dress up. One by one, they would throw the giant polka dot scarves
                     around their necks, and slip their tiny feet into the size nine high heels. Ivylese
                     liked to screech swiftly across the mahogany living room floor as Olivia covered her
                     ears at the sound. She did this until, while playing around one day, she sliced her
                     finger on the sharp metal heel and became frightened at what else they were capable
                     of.’</span> Other student monster narratives addressed plastic surgery, vanity, eating disorders,
                  and self-representation on social media. After studying texts such as <em>Frankenstein </em>and <em>Mathilda </em>that use monstrosity to embody, among so many other things, anxieties about social
                  change, social roles, and women’s place in society, course participants used the nineteenth-century
                  tradition of the monster narrative to express some of their own thoughts about and
                  understandings of societal problems and pressures. If, as Jeffrey Jerome Cohen has
                  argued, we can “understand . . . cultures through the monsters they bear[,]” then
                  perhaps using the logics of the Romantic monster narrative to think through our own
                  culture can help us become better readers of literature and culture, broadly construed
                  (4). I should note here that I’ve recently updated this assignment in response to
                  different pedagogical goals. This fall, in a first-year seminar on “Monster Narratives,
                  1797–2014,” sixteen first-year college students at the University of Denver will choose
                  a contemporary social, environmental, and/or political issue, research and write an
                  annotated bibliography on their topic, and then construct and analyze their own monster
                  narratives in response to the issue they have chosen and researched. It is my hope
                  that this assignment will encourage students to respond critically and creatively
                  to their world, using the Romantic (and, in this case, the Victorian) as a tool to
                  help them critique and understand the contemporary.</p>
               <p>As I mentioned above, hybrid critical/creative exercises can also encourage students
                  to infuse their everyday experience with an understanding of and interest in the (neo-)Romantic.
                  For example, in a course on Early Romantic Literature taught at Rutgers, I asked students
                  to imitate a poet of their choosing, and then to submit a critical coda walking me
                  through their imitation. Some students reported that their choice to imitate a Romantic
                  nature poem led them to notice, engage, or appreciate the natural world in a new or
                  different way.</p>
               <p>One such student, Sam Brusco, ventured out into the New Jersey woods to write an imitation
                  of Wordsworth, which I excerpt here:</p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">It was a still and stagnant winter morn;</div>
                     <div class="l">a day when Nature seemed to lie asleep,</div>
                     <div class="l">no single creature stirred, scarce wind was heard,</div>
                     <div class="l">a day that had an oath of silence sworn.</div>
                     <div class="l">No prior obligations then had I,<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
                     <div class="l">at rest from travels endless and sublime.</div>
                     <div class="l">I walked among a way yet untrodden, </div>
                     <div class="l">now that I found myself with endless time.</div>
                     <div class="l">The path I chose, untouched by human will</div>
                     <div class="l">without a measured course to mark the way;<span class="lineNumber">10</span></div>
                     <div class="l">since Nature organized no maps for me,</div>
                     <div class="l">the path was chosen by what course I made.</div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> Sam’s employment of iambic pentameter as well as his deployment of allusions to poems
                  read in class demonstrate the extent to which the student has taken in and synthesized
                  a sense of what it means to find oneself in a Wordsworth poem. However, beyond these
                  formal and topical references, Sam’s critical coda focuses on his interpretation of
                  Wordsworth as a poet-philosopher:</p>
               <p>What was particularly interesting for my own “experience with nature” that I had hoped
                  would create my own philosophical conclusions was my decision to take a walk in the
                  woods in wintertime . . . some would interpret the landscape as dead, “A scene devoid
                  of life, though it may seem.” However, the observer reasons that because nature exerts
                  so much energy in providing a thriving landscape for the remainder of the year, it
                  ought to have a time to rest, as well, because all other living things are allowed
                  to rest. The landscape then becomes something entirely different: a scene of serenity
                  and tranquility rather than of stagnation and lifelessness.</p>
               <p>If we find ourselves debating how, whether, and why to use the contemporary to make
                  the Romantic “relatable” for students, then Sam’s and other students’ thoughtful poetic
                  encounters with the natural environment in hybrid critical/creative response to Romanticism
                  demonstrate the extent to which the Romantic is, of course, already relevant—already
                  <em>related</em>—to the issues and concerns that dominate our world and the worlds of our students.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">4. CREATIVE WRITING OFFERS AN ANALYTICAL ALTERNATIVE TO ARGUMENT</span></h2>
               <p>Explaining his use of creative responses to literature in the high school classroom,
                  Christian Knoeller argues, “[i]n place of a simple opposition between response and
                  formal analysis, imaginative response maps a continuum between the two and demonstrates
                  how they can serve essentially complementary roles when interpreting literary works”
                  (44). In the college classroom, the hybrid critical/creative assignment functions
                  as a moment of rupture bridging, not only reader response and student analysis, but
                  also argumentative analysis and something beyond argument. In my classes, I find it
                  useful to remain mindful of the extent to which an exclusive focus on strength of
                  argument can sometimes limit a student’s exploration of the text(s) at hand. While
                  I consider teaching academic argument to be one of the most important parts of my
                  job as an English professor, I also maintain that students’ interactions with literary
                  history before, beside, or beyond the project of constructing an argument about that
                  history is crucial to learning and should not be undervalued. Assignments that ask
                  students to do something other than make an argument offer the chance to share and
                  to receive feedback regarding the many ways in which students interact with texts.
                  These assignments, in turn, ask students to linger in the space of the text itself
                  and to extend the encounter that is reading. It is my contention that such opportunities
                  to interpret for interpretation’s own sake help students become more conscientious
                  readers, and, in turn, more persuasive when it comes to academic argument.</p>
               <p>Hybrid critical/creative assignments accomplish these goals differently than, say,
                  non-thesis driven close readings insofar as they ask students to think with and through
                  the Romantic, moving beyond the text and into the questions and issues it raises,
                  all the while resisting or delaying the impulse to compress the text’s effects and
                  affects into a digestible thesis. At the 2014 NASSR conference, my mentor, Marjorie
                  Levinson, responded to a question about pedagogy with a simple and perfectly true
                  statement of purpose: “You just want them to feel how good it is to think.” Hybrid
                  critical/creative assignments provide students with a formal opportunity to think,
                  not necessarily in the service of argument, but rather via the experience of generating
                  and understanding creative practice. No wonder students often report that hybrid assignments
                  allow them to access or understand authorship in complex and vibrant ways that skirt
                  those teaching conventions (e.g. the insistence on a “speaker,” whatever that might
                  mean in the Romantic context) that reinforce the author taboo without edging into
                  problematic, biographical reading. In the literary studies classroom, hybrid critical/creative
                  assignments complement praxis with practice. This practice promotes experimental reading,
                  writing, and interpretation.</p>
               <p>Building on this interplay, one goal I have in mind as I continue to develop the pedagogy
                  of zonkey Romanticism is to explore and think through the ways in which creative writing
                  might inform students’ understanding of theory as well as their theoretical understanding
                  of Romantic texts. Reflecting on a hybrid critical/creative assignment, van Oostrum,
                  Steadman-Jones, and Carson remark that “this task . . . brought alive a range of theoretical
                  issues concerning the difficulty of representation” and posit that “[w]hen students
                  read about these issues in books of literary theory, they often remain cold, abstract,
                  and remote. But when they arise from the process of producing creative writing, they
                  seem much more alive” (565). While an analysis of how creative writing might be used
                  to illustrate and vivify theoretical approaches in the Romantic literature classroom
                  is beyond the scope of this essay, I conclude with this open question as a way to
                  gesture toward how the pedagogical approach presented here might further be developed
                  and applied as a method for asking students to express their understanding, their
                  questions, and their ideas in an open, generative format. </p>
               <p>Ultimately, I hope that my comments have illustrated some of the ways in which creative
                  writing and hybrid critical/creative assignments can encourage students of Romantic
                  literature to bridge the historical text and the contemporary moment of reading, not
                  just in the service of intervention, but for the sake of capacious and radical interaction,
                  interaction that produces new texts, new ideas, new perspectives, and, indeed, new
                  ways of thinking.</p>
