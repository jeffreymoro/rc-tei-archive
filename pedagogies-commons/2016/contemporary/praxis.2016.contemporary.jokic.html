            <p class="noCount">This essay discusses how a course about 'literature and revolution' invites students
               to make use of depression as an affective explanation for the history of optimism,
               disappointment, reluctant transformation, and fear of the future. Students assess
               their relationship to the ongoing past in which modernity, mobility, self-making,
               and optimism were first offered as political goals for entire societies, and consider
               how a 'long revolution' shapes their relationship to the disappointing present, in
               the literature classroom as a locus, instrument, and effect of radical social transformation.

               <p>This essay discusses how a course on nineteenth-century literature can become a course
                  on persistent preoccupations with available forms of political thought and action.
                  This outcome I would like to count as a kind of success, and this success, in a course
                  I have taught, has been inextricable from a certain set of “pathologies” that developed
                  in the process of reading the course material with the students. In a course about
                  “revolution,” I teach students how to use a history of imagination and writing about
                  the conditions and possibility of significant social change to curb their own political
                  optimism. To become so depressed in this course is good for them, I insist, because
                  this is how nineteenth-century reading material becomes relevant to the present. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The kind of depression I refer to is that which Eve Sedgwick identified as integral
                     for pedagogical and generational transmission, and different from the “common sense”
                     understanding of depression. It is not a dis-ease imposed from the outside on a sufferer
                     aspiring to escape this state so as to differentiate it from the ostensibly normal
                     condition of thought and spirit.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Sedgwick’s rendition of the common sense understanding of depression: a “chronic natural
                              gloominess,” or “exogenous malady, from who knows where, that is liable to descend
                              on its unsuspecting host until heroically routed by medicine and positive mental hygiene.”</span></div>
                     </div> Sedgwick offers “the depressive personality in the educator” and “the depressive position,”
                     elaborations by Silvan Tomkins and Melanie Klein respectively, as accounts of depression
                     more illuminating of the teaching situation because they suggest how the pedagogical
                     relationship is one of precarious growth and pervasive ambivalence about the distribution
                     of the power to know. For Tomkins, Sedgwick points out, “the depressive personality
                     in the educator” accounts for a person in whom “the depressive personality or script”
                     is “a durable feature” of their way of being, “a constitutive feature of their best
                     aptitudes as well as disabilities,” regardless of their experience of depression.
                     In a description that could alarm many an impassioned educator with its peculiar familiarity,
                     Tomkins’s “depressive, like his parent before him, is not altogether a comfortable
                     person to be around.” Still, the discomforts he (or she) creates are instrumental
                     in the forming of the depressive pair. An other is (or multiple others are) “seduced”
                     into a pair by the depressive’s genuine care and interest, only to be found lacking
                     and compelled to “seek restitution, to atone, and to please the other” (Tomkins 225).
                     This is how depressives make other depressives, both students and teachers.</p>
               </div>
               <p>While Tomkins’s is an account of a “particular kind of individual who emerges from
                  the contingency of a particular history,” Klein’s “depressive position” is a universally
                  available developmental phase, a “uniquely spacious rubric,” which “encompasses not
                  only preconditions of severe depression, but also resources for surviving, repairing,
                  and moving far beyond that depression.” It is a labile position of dependence on objects
                  whose solidity one has had to establish for oneself, which could become one’s undoing.
                  Yet the depressive position is an “anxiety-mitigating achievement” (an improvement
                  over the paranoid/schizoid position), marked by the “foundational, authentically difficult
                  understanding that good and bad tend to be inseparable at every level.” </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Both of these are accounts of the work of depression—or, rather, the work on depression—and
                     they seem apt to me as descriptions of the work in a course that encourages students
                     to consider the character of their position as revolutionary subjects. From the perspective
                     of the institution, this course is one of the required “historical perspectives” on
                     literature, of which each English major has to take four. They must all know that
                     there is a relationship between literature and historical change.

                     </div> It is a course on “Literature and Revolution” in the “long” nineteenth century: the
                     unrest seems to spill over the ends of a century, over the borders of European nation
                     states, and over the ends of continents. The interest in revolution, I propose, has
                     to be an interest in the narratives and expectations that made radical change seem,
                     for over a hundred years, necessary and worthwhile to some, terrifying and impossible
                     to others, and certainly never finished. What made the change worthwhile? Wrecking
                     the known world was one thing, but doing it in the name of a better new one nobody
                     had ever seen had to be something quite different. Was the “world” different from
                     “society?” Who was “society” anyway? Who were the “radicals” and how radical were
                     they? Was all that revolution a success? Are we living in it now?</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As a historical event or notion, “revolution” figured very vaguely in the students’
                     imaginations, a fairly sparse catalogue of revolutionary facts and figures. (The vibrancy
                     of their historical imagination of the long nineteenth century in Europe may remain
                     unchanged in the aftermath of the course.) Most of them claimed at the beginning of
                     the course that they had heard of the French Revolution before signing up, and guessed
                     wildly about when it started and how it ended. Only a few had heard of the Russian
                     revolution: the closer the country of their parents’ origin to the former Soviet Union,
                     the more likely they were to know that this revolution happened at all, and (rarely)
                     to point accurately to the century in which it began. Virtually no one in the class
                     had ever heard of the revolutions of 1848, although all of them had heard of the specter
                     of Karl Marx, and most knew of the existence of the “Communist Manifesto.” Very few
                     had thought of Marx as the kind of menace whose motor, especially in depictions of
                     communism in the United States, was his writing.

                  <p>The relevance of the course overall seemed to many students fairly unclear since there
                     was no confusion about the position we could take on revolution: we were neither in
                     it nor about it. The revolution was not for us, not something we would learn to admire,
                     being free to be or do (or study) anything, in the country self-defined by a break
                     from the tradition of government by fiat and repression. Political stability and gradual
                     reform were clearly preferable—<em>that</em> was what we were there for. And where we were matters a great deal: I teach at the
                     City University of New York, a state-funded system established to serve new immigrants,
                     the aspiring optimists among New York City’s servants, and other varieties of the
                     working poor. The undergraduate college where I teach is a federally registered “Hispanic-serving
                     institution” which anticipates in the shape of its remedial curriculum and its attention
                     to English for Academic Purposes that the majority of its students will be fluent
                     (although not necessarily academically proficient) in at least one language that is
                     not the language of college instruction.

                     institutions, to all avenues of social mobility, and to the transformative effects
                     of art. It is these young people, not just Voltaire’s, who would see great things.These
                     English majors are hardly cynical about narratives of liberation and progress, or
                     about the promises of individualism and self-determination as the ends of education.

                     that reading and writing may be their means of personal and professional advancement
                     is for many students a minor revolutionary turn. Often they are academic refugees
                     from fields that promised greater or more tangible rewards (financial security, social
                     mobility), but also failed students intellectually and emotionally. Their first experience
                     of textual interpretation is impossible to ignore precisely because it provides an
                     opportunity to admit into the university classroom their doubts about what such a

                     as “real” revolution. By the time our course began, the unrest had spread from Egypt
                     across several countries in the Middle East and North Africa, and the cultivation
                     of optimism regarding the direction and magnitude of the change gave way to pronouncements
                     of disaster and incompetent management of progress. Initial appraisals had wondered
                     if “revolutionary” transformation could happen over the course of one day (January
                     25, 2010 in Cairo), in a year,

                     still easy to understand why the status quo was untenable, it was clear that what
                     was once “optimistically known as the Arab Spring,” had become a drawn-out, chaotic
                     mess. In face of the damage done in the three years since the Egyptian revolt, it
                     was clear that the “Spring” never stood for a viable “replacement model” for the broken
                     societies; now these societies “find peace is harder than revolution.”

                     </div> In our course about a history of definitions and descriptions of depressing presents
                     and bright futures, a series of readings in the nineteenth century could become a
                     sustained discussion about how (or whether) a “replacement model” justifies the beginning
                     or the reiteration of a “revolution,” about what one can make of others’ attempts
                     to risk life and limb, and how revolution can become a contagious social practice—a
                     way of thinking others’ thoughts and doing their deeds in the name of the bright future
                     of a “society.” The students’ work is to orient themselves in that history by recognizing
                     the contingencies of narratives they tell themselves about themselves—assuming there
                     is a self—and their relationship to others. How does one become responsible for one’s
                     own well-being, and relate to that of others, if, as Marx was to put in a moment of
                     predictable disappointment at the sight of revolutionary momentum turning into a joke,
                     no one can select the circumstances in which to make their own history?</p>
               </div>
               <p>The course suggests that these are questions of interpretation explicitly politicized
                  by what we now read as literature of Romanticism. By “Romanticism” we imagine not
                  just the canonical male poets, but the many writers for whom the turn of the nineteenth
                  century was a period of enormous exhilaration and disappointment, what they recognized
                  as a whole new order of experience, for which they proposed a new kind of relationship
                  to representation—to writing and reading. Students react perhaps most dramatically
                  at the epistolary narratives of Helen Maria Williams, the author of “letters to friends”
                  in England from the eye of the revolutionary storm in France, with surprise and amazement
                  at what to them seems like an unlikely life-narrative for a late eighteenth-century
                  woman. Tracing her “career” from the early exhilaration about acting on the futuristic
                  principles of universal equality, to the onset of paranoid social imagination justifying
                  mass murder, students find Williams disorienting. We know these are not real personal
                  letters, but still, how appealing! How did she know so early that this was the future?
                  Why is it news to us that a woman acted thus on her vision? How does our hindsight
                  compare to her knowing at the time that an epoch was being made? </p>
               <p>Romanticism, in this course on revolution, addresses the significance of textual interpretation
                  for understanding the constantly shifting grounds of pleasure, knowledge, and action.
                  It is a conceptual tool for thinking about how a “literary” text from the turn of
                  the nineteenth century may want to be read as a kind of historical document, but also
                  as a document of recognition, of comprehension from the readers’ remove, from the
                  present in which it is expected to do its work. Under the changing circumstances for
                  the work of representation, what does “Romanticism” offer readers to be curious, if
                  not excited, about? Of Wordsworth’s “The Thorn,” one student writes, <span class="quote">‘The first point that the writer wants us to understand, is that the place where this
                     thorn is located is hard to reach/find. It says “high on a mountain’s highest ridge,
                     where oft the stormy winter gale cuts like a scythe.” From this we gather that we
                     would have to climb a mountain and risk the heavy stormy winds to get to this place,
                     but we have no idea why we would want to reach this place. The constant descriptions
                     of this place without giving us a reason as to why we would want to know this is a
                     good way to keep the reader engaged. It pulls you in. (unpublished essay)’</span> To let oneself be led to a strange place can be pedagogically depressing, in that
                  the teacher may be inviting the students to perform self-annihilating tasks. What
                  is a “good” student to read into Burke’s response to the French Revolution immediately
                  after reading Williams? Are students to learn how to take on his knowing position
                  on what is good for all the decent people? Can a “good” student find unacceptable
                  the arguments of an assigned canonical writer who now seems prescient about how badly
                  prepared everybody was for radical change? The little patience and plenty of discomfort
                  students have upon reading Wordsworth’s “Michael” has to do not just with the poetic
                  form the suffering takes (Too long! Set too far off in the country!), but also with
                  the conditions in which the tragedy in the poem appears to them neither too complex
                  nor particularly moving. They are bored with the narrative about a young man chewed
                  up by the great wide world, his tragedy clearly not theirs. Indeed, they are lost
                  on the newness of the then-greatness of the world, in which change is already inevitable
                  and occasionally eats its own children. They are out to get chewed up better, the
                  post-revolutionary beneficiaries of transparency. That the poet should try to bring
                  up the case is not interesting, not now, and this is not what the poet’s work is.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>But what is a poet’s work? In response to the discussion of the Preface to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, one student wanted the class to watch videos of performances by spoken word artists
                     whose work, the class agreed, could be understood as a kind of legacy of the work
                     begun by Wordsworth and Coleridge, an afterlife of Romanticism. Most of these are
                     videos recorded at regular gatherings in the Bronx, the place, as Marshall Berman
                     pointed out, where much that is solid has been known to melt into air. They draw a
                     crowd of New Yorkers in their late teens and early twenties, mostly people of color
                     for whom these are social and political events. The events’ political momentum derives
                     from the attention they give to language and poetic form—to the speakers’ and listeners’
                     appreciation of rhythm and delivery—as living forces that intervene in the common
                     ways of thinking about the relationship between “individuals” and “society.” The artists—individuals—speak
                     on behalf of other individuals, the young people in the audience, physical and virtual,
                     and any imagined occupying comparable subjective positions and recognizing their personal
                     narratives in the ones performed on stage.<em>

               </div>
               <p>The relevance of these events to our class has to do with their manifestly Romantic
                  (and romantic) commitment to giving living form to the political and poetic premises
                  of the performed texts. The draw of the events for those who attend is the possibility
                  that this use of language is a relevant kind of engagement with the emergency facing
                  all who aspire to change their individual circumstances against the emergent knowledge
                  that structural pressure makes any meaningful change implausible and impossible. The
                  most moving to all in class was a piece called “Strive!”—an injunction to persist
                  in believing in the promises the great society makes to its young and unconnected
                  who find themselves facing ubiquitous obstacles to self-realization. Being at the
                  event, performing and appreciating the performance (in the physical or virtual space),
                  serves to galvanize the resolve of everyone present (voiced by the speakers on behalf
                  of the audience) not to succumb to evident and pervasive pessimism. Alternatively,
                  or additionally, the point is to perform an affirmation of one’s awareness that there
                  is a place from which to assess one’s position, that the work of improvement is underway,
                  that those sharing the space are not losing their sight of it. Going back to the events
                  is a form of productive action—a signal that someone is taking stock of everyone’s
                  commitments to the future, rather than cultivating a singular fantasy about the promises
                  tendered.</p>
               <p>Brought into the college classroom, these events are no longer obscure or “subcultural”
                  in the same way. They are contemporary echoes that make room for reading students’
                  experience of frustration with responses to their impossible demands. A sustained
                  reading of long-nineteenth-century texts about revolution becomes a discussion about
                  the relationship of the students’ present to the history of disappointments and failures
                  of partially shared visions of liberation and justice. It is a huge disappointment
                  and relief to a constituency of mostly first-generation college students, children
                  of the working poor and first-generation immigrants to think that the philosophical,
                  ideological, and political questions of “speculative philosophers,” poets, and reactionaries
                  of the Romantic period look for answers in our own day, and that we may be asking
                  them. The old texts may suggest that history cannot and should not repeat itself,
                  but they also make it possible to think that these are—that the course is set in—revolutionary
                  times.</p>
               <p>So we practice making impossible demands. The course creates a cycle of hope about
                  the prospect of acting freely, on the ideals that make the teaching situation possible.
                  We speak as if we knew what place the classroom took in the larger political process;
                  we say the processes of change are unstoppable and indispensable. We also say our
                  goals are so ambitious that none of us can ever hope to see them realized: the work
                  is unfinished but also unfinishable. Students begin to see themselves as beneficiaries
                  and dupes of the pedagogical relationship, offered the inexorable pleasures of learning
                  about the capacity of their position by a teacher whose work it is to point to the
                  limitations and disappointments of their potential. They loved reading P. B. Shelley’s
                  <em>A Defence of Poetry</em>: did not mind the length, or the style, and certainly were deeply moved by its conviction
                  about the significance to “the world” of language as an art form. When I asked whether
                  they would qualify it as a manifesto or a blueprint for action, a “good” student said,
                  “I knew you would say that!”</p>

                  <p>This is a class about the bind in which we have to believe in action because we have

                     progress, but also promises of displacement, malaise, anxiety, and uncertainty. Participation
                     in such cycles of reading of one another, and the reading of texts, makes room for
                     the possibility that we are in the middle of the process that Raymond Williams was

                              forms and ideas” (10).</span></div>
                     </div> a complex condition of which repetitive “failure” is a constitutive element. Our narratives
                     of failure are not tales of singular and private blockage in a depressive state from
                     which students need to be extricated; in fact, the teacher could never be saved from
                     it herself, let alone save anyone else. It is rather a class on the possibility that
                     exhilaration or failure may not be anyone’s own, but rather a function of what Lauren
                     Berlant has called the “cruel optimism” of (especially contemporary) political imagination,
                     ruled by the “relation of attachment to compromised conditions of possibility” (21).
                     That the possibilities are compromised is depressing news, and students shift around
                     the point at which they think they heard it. The class about revolution lets them
                     say that this was not the first time they found themselves in that strange place.
                     Students who have spoken to me outside of class and come to office hours put their
                     questions about the work in a telling form. They tend to ask me, “What do you do with
                     yourself now?” The question is of course about what they should do with themselves
                     now, and the best I know how to say is that this is all we ever do: know of the depressing
                     future and still demand to see great things.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">The cutoff revolutions could have been different, but I decided to stay with 1789
               as the opening date that figures prominently in many historical accounts of European
               modernity. In an article that will be required reading in the next iteration of the
               course, Michael Keith Baker uses newly digitized and searchable repositories of early
               modern texts to trace the transformations in the meaning and uses of the word “revolution.”
               The article is a model deployment of new methodology: technologically savvy, conservative
               about machine intelligence, and sophisticated in defining search terms. Its analysis
               of the newly legible resources sustains Baker’s larger claim that revolution is a
               “historically constituted category of historical understanding.” This is a claim not
               just about linguistic trends and statistics, but also about how words have been trusted
               to reflect and effect a change in the world. Baker argues that the meaning of the
               word shifted around the political change initiated in France in 1789, a “revolution
               revolutionized” (189). The word referred no longer to the completed events (albeit
               dramatic and transformative) but to an “ongoing political act” (190), an “expression
               of the dynamic transformational process advancing the progress of humankind, not endless
               meaningless variations on the same thing” (206). It was thus also a “script for future
               political or social action” (199), a socialized and normalized requirement for an
               optimistic political imagination for anyone committed to “progress” and “society,”
               whose shared future is shaped by a good grasp and management of the present.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               aspiration to create and preserve unprecedented change, change which redrew maps of
               Europe and assigned decades of political work of Cold War de-identification from the
               revolutionary ideals in the United States, we all sat in awkward silence for a minute
               or so.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">For many, English language proficiency is a form of deference to the language of higher
               education as an engine of social mobility; used competently in the register of professional
               communication, “good English” constitutes a promise of economic prosperity and personal
               advancement. The full name of the college is “John Jay College of Criminal Justice,”
               an educational profile that now serves as a marketable brand of specialty professional
               education and steady tuition income, but also an impediment to John Jay’s transformation
               into a “college of liberal arts” serving more traditional students, better prepared
               academically and capable of paying more for their tuition. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               loud protests from the faculty, students now choose from topical “buckets” (e.g.,
               Individual and Society, or Learning from the Past), in which any number of disciplines
               can compete for students’ attention, to the point of mutual exclusion of history and
               literature, or literature and fine art. As a result, it is possible to graduate from
               college without ever taking a literature or a history class. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">By way of comparison of the new situation on the ground to the pre-revolutionary condition,
               the <em>Times </em>article offers that “the region’s old status quo, dominated by imperious rulers who
               fixed elections, ruled by fiat and quashed dissent, has been fundamentally damaged,
               if not overthrown.” In 2015, the civil wars in Syria and Iraq, and the resulting refugee
               crisis affecting every continent, seem to be the fruit of that “revolution.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">Paul Mason of the <em>Guardian</em>, assessing what made for twenty-first century revolution, ventured that “something
               real and important was unleashed in 2011” that had not “gone away,” despite the clear
               dents in public optimism about the events’ trajectory, the supremely destructive civil
               war in Syria their dystopian apex. “Confident enough” to call the events a revolution
               in 2013, Mason pointed to “a change in consciousness, the intuition that something
               big is possible; that a great change in the world's priorities is within people's
               grasp.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               book, <em>Culture and Society, 1780–1950, </em>but in the Introduction to <em>The Long Revolution </em>explains specifically that it “seems” to him that “we are living through a long revolution,
               which our best descriptions only in part interpret. It is a genuine revolution, transforming
               men and institutions; continually extended and deepened by the actions of millions,
               continually and variously opposed by explicit reaction and by the pressure of habitual
               forms and ideas” (10).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
