                  <li class="item" id="d4309e508">John Boyne refers to his novel as a ‘fable’. What is a fable? Please refer to an academic
                     source to answer this question.</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d4309e509">Various critics have attacked Boyne’s novel for downplaying the cruelty of the Holocaust.
                     Which aspects of the novel did you find particularly problematic? Why so?</li>
               </ol>

               <ol>
                  <li class="item" id="d4309e514">How does Boyne’s depiction of childhood differ from the childhoods represented in
                     <em>The Cement Garden </em>and <em>The Fifth Child</em>? Where do you see continuities and discontinuities?</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d4309e522">If you had to teach a class on representations of the Holocaust, would you choose
                     to discuss John Boyne’s <em>The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas</em>? Why or why not? What age group would you target?</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d4309e527">What are the most important aspects concerning childhood you will remember from this
                     semester? Which questions that we did not touch upon would you have liked to discuss?</li>
