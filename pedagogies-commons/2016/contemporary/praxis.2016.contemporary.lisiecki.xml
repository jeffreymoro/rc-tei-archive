            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">In his latest book Art’s Undoing: In the Wake of a Radical
                    Aestheticism (Fordham University Press, 2013), Forest (Tres) Pyle asserts that
                    certain poetic texts “produce a radical engagement with the very processes by
                    which we conceive of the aesthetic, those processes by which the world is not
                    merely known, but felt—and felt as an effect of representation” (5). This model
                    for a poetics of history draws on a rich web of sources, from Shelley, Benjamin,
                    and de Man to John Coltrane, Todd Haynes, and Cy Twombly, in which
                    constellations of aesthetic experience, not unlike signs and flowers, are
                    self-originating. They “flash up” like flares in a night sky whose apprehension,
                    always possible but never determined, is felt with something of a shiver. In
                    this conversation, Tres and I discuss the poetry, music, painting, cinema, and
                    scholarship that make him shiver, focusing on how this constellation of art,
                    artists, philosophy, and criticism, which spans two centuries, has shaped his
                    approach to understanding and teaching Romanticism. That which makes the
                    Romantic poem particular, Tres says, those characteristics around which we have
                    organized a canon and a name, are precisely what challenge periodization in the
                    first place. If Ian Curtis exhibits a sense of possession that summons up
                    Coleridge, then how are we to reconcile historical specificity with aesthetic
                    continuity? What are the “strange subterranean force[s]” that exert themselves
                    in “adventurous poetic forms, musical examples, cinematic forms, or the visual
                    arts?” Since this conversation, Tres and co-editor Jacques Khalip have assembled
                    a collection of essays that addresses these questions. With essays by Ian
                    Balfour, Sara Guyer, and Gayatri Spivak, among many notable others, <title
                        level="m">Constellations of a Contemporary Romanticism</title> (Fordham
                    University Press, 2016) inquires into the implications of Agamben’s notion of
                    contemporaneity, as an adherence to one’s own time through disjunction and
                    anachronism, for studies of Romanticism. As a constellation itself, the book not
                    only illuminates certain shadows, or future anteriors, of Romanticism as they
                    irrupt in Benjaminian now-time, but it also postulates Romanticism itself as a
                    trope that dramatizes—or “detonates”—such now-time by forcing an experience
                    precisely with that which has been passively deposited into the archives of
                    historical time. It is this sense of Romanticism “with its tentacles extended
                    into the future” that drives our conversation. </p>

                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Chet Lisiecki:</hi> Who taught you about Romanticism and how has this
                    influenced your own pedagogy?</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Tres Pyle:</hi> I remember, as an undergraduate, already being drawn to
                    Keats and Shelley and Romantic poetry in general. Even in high school I remember
                    reading “Ode to the West Wind.” And I grew up on a cattle ranch in west Texas.
                    There the west wind usually brought either dust, or cold, or storms. So I
                    remember reading this exquisite poem and thinking “what a strange ode,” you
                    know, “what a strange thing.” It was as if I were in a radically different
                    ecosystem than the romantic poets. There was always a kind of weird resonance
                    that I felt with them, and I was really drawn to poems such as “Ode to the West
                    Wind” or “The Prelude.” Then in college at UT Austin I had a teacher named
                    Charles Sherry, who’s still teaching now at the University of Arizona, who
                    taught a course on Romanticism. And it felt as if, when we were reading the
                        <title level="m">Defence of Poetry</title>, when we were reading Shelley,
                    that it was speaking a language I already knew and felt. And at the time I
                    didn’t notice that he was a student of de Man’s, had studied with de Man at
                    Cornell, so that there were inflections of a kind of deconstructive and
                    phenomenological reading already happening there. And in some ways it felt like
                    a second skin. I remember reading, as a freshman, the Signet edition of Keats’s
                    poems, which was introduced by Paul de Man, and I remember finding it both
                    incredibly difficult but also exhilarating to think about the poems in this way.
                    So those were my earliest models, but of course I worked with Gayatri Spivak,
                    who we don’t often think of as a Romanticist. But when I was working with her,
                    both as an undergraduate and graduate student, she was still writing essays on
                    Coleridge and Wordsworth and regularly teaching and thinking about Romantic
                    poetics and Kantian philosophical aesthetics as manifest in Romanticism. So I
                    felt like my education in Romanticism started early and never stopped; it just
                    found different avenues and conduits.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Chet:</hi> So what to you constitutes an introduction to Romanticism,
                    and what contemporary cultural artifacts do you draw on when you’re
                    teaching?</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Tres:</hi> Some of the things that have been really important to me in
                    trying to think about a fundamental Romantic interest certainly are the question
                    of aesthetic experience and the Romantic concern with the nature of aesthetic
                    experience, poetics that are devoted to the aesthetic, whether they are
                    ekphrastic poems or poems in which nature itself takes on an aesthetic
                    dimension, an aestheticized dimension. The questions of the sublime and the
                    beautiful are really interesting pedagogically for getting students to think
                    about Romanticism. And for that I’ve always liked to go back to Kant, even if
                    I’m teaching a lower-level Romantic poetry class or introduction to Romanticism.
                    We’ll read “Hymn to Intellectual Beauty” or “Mont Blanc” alongside passages or
                    extracts from Kant’s <title level="m">Critique of Judgment</title> to think
                    about how refined and interesting and distinct the thinking about aesthetics is,
                    from Kant through the Romantics, and to sharpen my students’ own critical and
                    aesthetic attentions. So to do that I try to help them read the poems in such a
                    way that certain poems not only want to represent these aesthetic judgments (the
                    sublime and beautiful), but also become them, become examples of them. </p>
                <p rend="noCount">I often find it helpful to look at contemporary instances of this
                    and, depending on the historical moment, I’ve had students listen to Patti
                    Smith’s <title level="m">Horses</title> as an example of a kind of sublime
                    experience and put that alongside a song by Nick Drake that always strikes me as
                    a kind of popular example of sheer beauty. One of my favorite examples is John
                    Coltrane’s version of “My Favorite Things.” We listen to standard versions of it
                    and then listen to Coltrane’s own versions where he goes off on that soprano sax
                    and you don’t quite know where you’re going, in the sense of the circumferences
                    of our comprehension being shattered by these sounds. I think of this as one way
                    of trying to get students to recognize concretely what that might feel like or
                    look like. So it’s often contemporary pop or jazz or musical examples, and then
                    visual examples as well. I try to bring in contemporary paintings and
                    representations of paintings that seem to either function within a kind of
                    harmoniousness of beauty or push an apprehension that seems to break the
                    boundaries or frames of comprehension.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Chet:</hi> Which artists?</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Tres:</hi> Cy Twombly is someone who I’m interested in, in part because
                    he’s so interested in Romantic poets. He’s a painter who has always interested
                    me in part because of the sheer scale of his work and his ability to work within
                    moments of delicacy and beauty in his canvases, on the one hand, but also with a
                    kind of energy that seems to push beyond, into the realm of the sublime. I feel
                    with Twombly I can move back and forth between those registers. I’m also
                    interested in the poetry of Frank O’Hara in part because he seems the modern
                    poet most engaged with Keats but also engaged with ekphrastic tradition, linking
                    this back to the romantics. So it’s his own interest with the visual, or poetic
                    representations of the visual, that has led me to think about him and his
                    thinking about paintings as well.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Chet:</hi> Do you have any specific assignments or activities for
                    students that help facilitate analysis of a painting by Twombly or a Nick Drake
                    song?</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Tres:</hi> I taught a course called “The Romanticism of Contemporary
                    Culture” in which I presented case study examples, pairing a moment in music and
                    a poet. For instance, one example that I’ve been drawn to is to have students
                    read “Kubla Khan” and try to think about that iconic poem and its willingness to
                    immerse into the strange experience that Coleridge himself seems to be afraid
                    of, terrified by. We think about the connections between this poem and some
                    performances by Ian Curtis from Joy Division—not only the songs, like
                    “Transmission” or “Shadow Play,” but some of the televised versions we have that
                    display the strange sense of possession that he seems to exhibit in these
                    performances, the sense that he’s being overtaken by something. And what I ask
                    students to do is find their own analogue or moment, making it clear that this
                    isn’t a canonical body of the contemporary Romantic sublime or contemporary
                    Romantic beautiful but my own attempt to find these constellations or
                    connections. So the task for them is to find their own and find ways of trying
                    to form those.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Chet:</hi> I wanted to ask you now about a class that you haven’t yet
                    mentioned, your class on the image, which has had a profound effect on my own
                    work on modernist aesthetics and politics. Could you speak some about the
                    genesis of this class, its evolution, how you see it changing the next time you
                    teach it?</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Tres:</hi> <title level="m">The Romantic Image</title> is a book by
                    Frank Kermode, written in 1957, and this was a really important book for me
                    early on. What I found interesting was how the notion of the image disappeared
                    from Romantic studies, substituted by probably more precise notions of figures,
                    rhetorical analysis more closely linguistically attuned than the notion of the
                    image. But I was also interested in some early work by de Man on the image and
                    emblem in Yeats and thinking about how this fascination with the image might in
                    fact connect us back to more contemporary understandings of the circulation of
                    the image in a post-Baudrillardian world where the image seems to circulate
                    without anything that it necessarily represents. This free-floating circulation
                    of the image. So these two things fascinated me. One is this very contemporary
                    interest in the image, this older slightly outmoded notion of the Romantic
                    image, which interestingly for both Kermode and de Man extended into Yeats. So
                    it wasn’t simply the Romantics as such but Romanticism with its tentacles
                    extended into the future, so that now suddenly it challenged the notion of
                    periodization. The image is not something that just belongs to Romanticism; it
                    clearly belonged to modernism. And imagism, as much as it wanted to distinguish
                    itself from Romanticism, I felt still had this Romantic subterranean dimension
                    to it that might then be connecting with our new fascination with the
                    circulation of images. So I wrote an essay on de Man and the image, the central
                    reading of which was “Kubla Khan,” as a way of thinking about images as
                    self-originating, things that just emerge and irrupt, and both the seductions
                    and the perceived dangers of the image functioning with its own agency. And that
                    was the impetus for the course and beginning to think about the image now and
                    then and in the future, how those would tie together Romanticism, modernism, and
                    a contemporary way of understanding why the image is at the core of so much
                    contemporary theoretical discussion.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Chet:</hi> In that vein, following up on the article you wrote on de
                    Man and “Kubla Khan,” how has your own research informed your pedagogy?</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Tres:</hi> You know it’s such a truism to say that our pedagogy is
                    informed by our research and vice versa, this mutual interplay, but I do find
                    that the poems I find myself feeling solicited to address or come back to are
                    those that have these fascinating pedagogical moments or questions that emerge
                    around them, whether it’s voice or tone or the preposterousness of when Shelley
                    says to the west wind, “Be thou me.” Students can sometimes roll their eyes at
                    the extravagance of that apostrophe or the strangeness of “Kubla Khan.” So these
                    moments of interest or resistance become the sites of a way of thinking about
                    revisiting them. I often have found myself writing about poems that raise these
                    interesting questions in the classroom. And then I found in some ways that the
                    examples that I want to use in order to explain or develop this thinking about
                    Romanticism is often for me a way of really pushing at ways of seeing
                    contemporary culture itself .&#160;.&#160;.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><title level="m">At this moment a student came to the door to drop
                        off an honors thesis. Placing the thesis on his desk and pointing at it,
                        Tres continued .&#160;.&#160;.</title></p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Tres:</hi> That’s an honors thesis that she’s turning in on the
                    relationship between Keats’s poetics and Wilfred Owen’s poetry, and the project
                    grew out of this course on Romanticism and contemporary culture. In fact an
                    early version of this was to think about Owen’s early interest in romanticism
                    and how his version of it takes on—even as he increasingly becomes an antiwar
                    poet—it continues a version of Keats’s negative capability and fascination with
                    fragmentation.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Chet:</hi> I’m going to be looking a lot at Wilfred Owen for my next
                    book project, <title level="m">Lyric and Trauma</title>, which will place
                    discussions that scholars like you and Sara Guyer are having about Romanticism,
                    and how it’s continued “living on,” in the context of trauma studies, covering
                    the period from World War I through the Holocaust and focusing on lyric moments
                    in mixed-genre holocaust narratives but also texts like <title level="m">Mrs
                        Dalloway</title>.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Tres:</hi> You know Sara has an article coming out on Gerhard Richter
                    and Romanticism in which she thinks about Richter’s own embrace of Romanticism
                    and what it means now to revisit it. Not to disavow it but to revisit it in that
                    particular political context. She reads the whole series of the Baader-Meinhof
                    stills as well as his other abstract paintings. And it’s funny, you know,
                    because I was first introduced to Richter by Sonic Youth, by <title level="m"
                        >Daydream Nation</title>. The cover is a Gerhard Richter still. It was one
                    of those moments that was so exquisite: Sonic Youth introduced me to Richter and
                    then Richter’s own work has taken on this fascinating dimension of Romantic
                    revisitation.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Chet:</hi> You’ve already answered this question in part, but I still
                    want to ask it in case there is anything you want to add. To what extent does
                    literary theory, and deconstruction in particular, figure in your teaching of
                    Romanticism?</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Tres:</hi> For me the remarkable thing about deconstruction is not that
                    it was a theoretical agenda or program but rather a practice of reading. It was
                    a practice of pushing at the assumptions and implications of reading and trying
                    to read as closely as possible not to determine what texts mean but rather how
                    they mean and how they perform. And I find that it perhaps sounds sort of new
                    critical, but I always found that to be a way, pedagogically, of liberating the
                    classroom as this site of mutual shared investigation of how texts are working.
                    It’s certainly the case that many of the deconstructive theorists who are most
                    important to me read these Romantic poems and read them really closely, and
                    that’s important for my own research and thinking, but it’s really the shared
                    practice of reading that I find most exciting about that. Not as an invitation
                    to theoretical arguments but really as a practice that students can come away
                    with whether they know they’re reading deconstructively or not.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Chet:</hi> On a related note, how do you see the “project” of
                    Romanticism persisting into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries?</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Tres:</hi> <title level="m">Defence of Poetry</title> is such an
                    important text for me. I remember first reading it, not understanding it
                    entirely, but from the beginning it always struck me that it’s a poetics of
                    history. It’s a defense of poetry in some sense but it really is a way of
                    imagining poetry as a kind of non-chronological, historical force that—you know,
                    for Shelley, one feels poetry irrupt, and there are these historical irruptions
                    of poetry and that irruptive force of poetry, which lends to poetry its own
                    agency, the spirit of its own age as a moment of irruption, strikes me as a way
                    of thinking about a poetics of history. I remember reading Benjamin and
                    thinking, these theses on the concept of history, this is Shelley, this is
                    Shelley’s argument, that these moments or events sometimes gestate and wait
                    until the moment in which they can be read. Like stars in the night need
                    appropriate times to be seen and flash up. So I think that that model—the model
                    of Romanticism not as something overlooked or missed or as something that
                    persists as a kind of dominant, but as a strange subterranean force that
                    continues to exert itself often in what I think of as adventurous poetic forms
                    or musical examples or cinematic forms—is a way that it continues to “persist.”
                    Not as Raymond Williams would call the dominant, but not simply as a residual
                    either, in the sense of something in the past, but something that continues to
                    exert an emergent force even if it belongs to the past. </p>
                <p rend="noCount">There’s an example that I often use. Todd Haynes has this great
                    film called <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title>, and the beginning of the
                    film has always struck me as an outtake from “Theses on the Concept of History.”
                    In this scene he imagines this world in which Oscar Wilde has come from one of
                    these constellations in space, landed at a doorstep in Dublin in 1854, and
                    appears as a kind of dandy with a green broach. Oscar Wilde disappears entirely
                    from the film, but the broach itself is discovered by this boy being bullied in
                    a schoolyard fight. He finds the green broach and in this gorgeous moment, his
                    lips are bloodied, he looks in the mirror and transforms the bloody lip into
                    lipstick as he’s looking at himself and smiling, imagining that one day the
                    “whole stinking world” would be his. And it’s this redemption of this moment
                    that irrupts, as the next scene is the irruption of glam rock in the streets of
                    London. As if that possibility, that irruptive possibility of something buried
                    and hidden, can suddenly, in an impossible but beautiful utopian fantasy, take
                    place. And the poetry is there in the streets. And that model, that cinematic
                    representation of Oscar Wilde connects to Benjamin and to Shelley and to Wilde
                    himself as a kind of model of a poetics of history, as a kind of redemptive
                    moment not always available but always possible. And that’s the way I see
                    Romanticism continuing to work in the twenty-first century.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Chet:</hi> Do you see resonances of this understanding of Romanticism,
                    or poetry, in Adorno’s essay “Lyric Poetry and Society?”</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Tres:</hi> I do, and I think that’s a really interesting example. He
                    doesn’t invoke Benjamin, as they’re still having arguments at this moment, but
                    he in some sense does seem to be invoking that kind of moment as something not
                    assigned to a reactionary past but part of something to be a kind of, for him,
                    dialectical moment that is irruptive and resistant.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Chet:</hi> If you were teaching a course on romanticism and the
                    contemporary—and maybe you could think of a couple courses, both a
                    lower-division course and an upper-division or a grad seminar—what do you think
                    would have to be on the syllabus?</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Tres:</hi> I think <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title> would have
                    to be on the syllabus for either as a really exquisite film for thinking about
                    culture in this way. Certainly at the lower-division I’m really interested in
                    the film <title level="m">Dead Man</title> by Jim Jarmusch, in which William
                    Blake is a gunfighter. The way it models history, thinking about poetry and the
                    western, is a fascinating undoing and rethinking of that whole project. When I
                    teach lower-division, I really try to think about these poets and form those
                    constellations. So I would read for instance “Kubla Khan” alongside the Joy
                    Division example I was referring to, and think perhaps both of them in terms of
                    Bataille, particularly <title level="m">Visions of Excess</title> and his notion
                    of expenditure and the privileged instance.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Chet:</hi> I’ve tried to teach Bataille several times at the
                    undergraduate level, and it hasn’t really worked. What do you teach by him, and
                    do you have any tips for this?</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Tres:</hi> I teach “The Notion of Expenditure,” which, again, I teach
                    not to think of as a kind of theory of something but as having a performative
                    element. I teach “The Sacred” and “Sacrifice,” both very brief essays that
                    develop the notion of the privileged instance. And that notion of the privileged
                    instance can dovetail with Wordsworthian notions of spots of time and these
                    lyrical bursts that take place. So I try to think of these irruptive moments as
                    “captured in images” but also that the true history of the past is an image, so
                    what is the nature of that truth as image, and in this way we try to think about
                    these irruptive moments. So once they get over the thought of, “oh my God, what
                    are we reading,” these texts can really be productive. And these are texts that
                    I would teach at undergraduate and graduate levels. </p>
                <p rend="noCount">I think that at the graduate level it’s interesting to teach
                    Badiou and Rancière alongside each other. Rancière in part because of the
                    attempt to reclaim in the aesthetic regime a Romantic notion, one that I find a
                    little too easy and democratic. But it’s interesting to read him alongside
                    Badiou who seems .&#160;.&#160;. desperate isn’t the word, but vigilant in his
                    attempt to rid all forms of philosophical thinking from its dangerous intimacy
                    with Romanticism, particularly the intimacy with poetic language that he sees as
                    forming. So it’s interesting to see this contemporary theoretical debate, which
                    may be the last major debate of the master thinkers in France, still orbiting
                    around problems in romanticism. So that’s something I would do at a graduate
                    level. But I think a lot of the examples work in helping graduate and
                    undergraduate students begin thinking about visual as well as literary
                    representations and how those function. I would read more Roland Barthes in that
                    model because I think in his late work in particular the notion of the punctum
                    or the third meaning continue to resonate with that model of Romantic
                    experience, aesthetics, and judgment.</p>
