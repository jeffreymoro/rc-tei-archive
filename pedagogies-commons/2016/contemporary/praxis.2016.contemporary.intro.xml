            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">This special issue explores the notion that many of the forms,
                    ideas, and practices inaugurated or exemplified in the Romantic period continue
                    to shape and drive our contemporary discourses. Literary critics, cultural and
                    political theorists, and, indeed, our students continue to encounter new
                    permutations—if not the continued presence—of something that might be called the
                    romantic. But how is the (neo-)romantic expressed in contemporary culture? And
                    how might we best prepare students to listen for and hear its repetitions? How
                    might we teach the romantic alongside the contemporary without either reducing
                    one to the other or eliding important historical, cultural, and social contexts?
                    In response to these questions, the nine essays and three interviews that
                    comprise this volume address the repetitions and reverberations of the romantic
                    as it recurs across genre, period, and media boundaries in popular culture,
                    contemporary political situations, changing classroom dynamics, and the
                    constantly shifting domains of literary and pedagogical practice and
                    production.</p>

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>The impetus for this volume came from the 2013 NASSR/Romantic Circles New Course
                    Development Prize, for which we were both finalists. Along with fellow finalists
                    Sara Guyer and Samantha Harvey, we convened a panel to discuss our recent
                    pedagogical experiments, moderated by Kate Singer, without whom
                    this project would not have been possible. Throughout the ensuing conversation,
                    one trend emerged: an interest in and focus on teaching the Romantic alongside
                    the art, media, and social and political phenomena contemporary with our own
                    lives and with our students’ lives.</p>
                <p>At one point in the panel conversation, an attendee asked whether we taught the
                    Romantic with the contemporary despite the potential anti-historicist
                    implications of that move—in other words, did we teach in this way because it
                    worked, or because it was engaging, despite the fact that we somehow knew better
                    as literary historians? As committed historicist readers from a shared
                    intellectual lineage, we countered that, in the classroom as in our research,
                    sometimes one must think trans-historically in order to produce a historicist
                    understanding. In our undergraduate classrooms, the juxtaposition of the
                    Romantic and the contemporary reveals work from both historical periods in the
                    contexts of popular culture, social shifts, and artistic experiments. Put
                    another way, it is possible to wield the contemporary to peel back the cloak of
                    canonicity that sometimes obscures Romantic literary experiments, all the while
                    making students better readers—indeed, Romanticist readers—of their own
                    literary, cultural, and historical moments.</p>
                <p>Beyond its startling implications for our pedagogy, historicizing the
                    neo-Romantic in our own culture has the potential to enrich our thinking as
                    scholars attuned to the Romantic, to its repetitions, and to the ways in which
                    it encodes its own repetitions. While the essays enclosed herein focus on
                    pedagogical approaches, we thus also highlight the extent to which such teaching
                    exercises are also thought experiments with the potential to open up news ways
                    of thinking about the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century texts at the heart of
                    our teaching.</p>
                <p>Being so convinced we put out a call for papers. We also invited Marjorie
                    Levinson, Forest Pyle, and Brian McGrath to be interviewed on the topic, and,
                    wonderfully, they all agreed. Specifically, we asked contributors to write or
                    talk about their day-to-day experiences of teaching the romantic with the
                    contemporary, broadly—and diversely—conceived. Since we can only teach and write
                    from within our own current situations, we each find ourselves enveloped in our
                    lived contemporaneity, whether we like it or not. The question then is not how
                    to close the gap between now and then, nor even how to keep from repeating the
                    trauma of history, but rather, for us as it was for Shelley or Keats, how to
                    situate these temporal gaps or “moments” so as to allow us to repeat
                    differently, with more awareness and attention. </p>
                <p>The writers of the following essays address this question from various creative,
                    pedagogical, and theoretical perspectives. Each identifies and develops in the
                    classroom some aspect of the Romantic—then and now—that reveals productive
                    connections and disconnections, discrete moments, breaks, and continuities. For
                    Daniel Block, whose essay begins our volume, reading our current war on terror
                    through the lens of British Romanticism provides an opportunity for students to
                    “tap into the affective registers of historical consciousness.” Block shows how
                    working creatively with Romantic affect in the classroom can address issues of
                    trauma at multiple levels at once. Sandra Dinter and Stefanie John follow with a
                    meditation on teaching post-Romantic constructions of childhood in contemporary
                    Irish and British fiction. Dinter and John reflect on their experience in
                    teaching the class as well as on the disconnect between the role of British
                    literature in inaugurating the image of the Romantic child and the vulnerable
                    economic/social/political status of so many children living in the U.K. The
                    course, originally taught at the University of Bielefeld in Germany, traces the
                    afterlives of the Romantic child, specifically as refigured in the late
                    twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.</p>
                <p>Next we offer “Fundamental Tensions,” a recorded interview with Marjorie
                    Levinson. Levinson shares her experience of teaching the Romantic with the
                    contemporary as a way to renew our “critical purchase” on the literatures of the
                    Romantic period. In a wide-ranging interview, in which she discusses Stevens,
                    Spinoza, Sartre, and Althusser, Levinson traces the ways in which connected
                    strands of Romantic and post-Romantic thinking continue to motivate and inform
                    her teaching and research. D.B. Ruderman’s essay, “Repetitions of the
                    Romantic,” follows. Ruderman recounts his experience of teaching Romanticism at
                    a regional campus of a large research university in the Midwest. He shows how
                    “working backward toward a structure of feeling,” that is, beginning with
                    contemporary and resonant so-called post-Romantic genres and media (hip-hop,
                    film, essays, etc.) allows for a revitalized understanding of canonical
                    Romanticism. This revitalization is essential for Ruderman insofar as a) he
                    refuses “sealed-off” iterations of the Romantic; and b) he believes that
                    effective teaching in the humanities must involve sensitive attunement to the
                    many micro-cultures of the classroom and its surround. Olivera Jokic’s “Pedagogy
                    of the Depressed: Romanticism and the Long Revolution” takes up this challenge,
                    triangulating optimism, depression, and revolution in a discussion of a class
                    that asks students to bring Romantic works to bear on contemporary questions of
                    political hope. Jokic situates this pedagogical project in the context of
                    teaching “a constituency of mostly first-generation college students, children
                    of the working poor and first-generation immigrants,” thereby asking broader
                    questions regarding whether or how, while teaching Romantic literature, we
                    should teach or temper optimism. </p>
                <p>Next follows an interview with Brian McGrath, who talks with colleague Walt
                    Hunter about teaching contemporary American experimental poets in his
                    Romanticism classes. He does so, he says, in order to complicate students’
                    received and “easy” ideas about Romanticism: its expressivity, for example, or
                    its focus on the individual subject. He also brings together Romantic and
                    contemporary rhetorics and tropes in the classroom, comparing, for example,
                    cloud computing and Wordsworth’s “I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud.” From here,
                    McGrath and Hunter, Romantic and contemporary poetry scholars respectively,
                    trade insights on the deep and reciprocal relationship between contemporary and
                    Romantic poetics. They arrive at an intimation of the Romantic as continuously
                    revitalized and reactivated, especially through what they term the “ambition” of
                    contemporary experimental poetry. Following this enlightening interview and
                    broadening the context for understanding the Romantic literature classroom, Paul
                    Keen’s “Against Utilitarianism: Two Hundred Years of ‘Useful Knowledge’” takes
                    on the crisis in the humanities. Keen finds in Romantic-era defenses of and
                    debates about the value of the arts important precedents for current
                    conversations, and perspectives that might complicate our understanding of
                    knowledge’s ability to “impact.” Taking another macro-context into
                    consideration, Laura Haigwood’s “Romantic Continuities and Feminist
                    Contemporaries” offers a thoughtful blueprint for introducing students to
                    feminism’s roots in Romantic-era human rights discourse and demonstrates how
                    careful discussion of texts such as <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility
                    </title>and <title level="m">The Victim of Prejudice</title> alongside writing
                    assignments ranging from personal reflections to feminist polemics, can help
                    students understand the persistence of and tensions within feminist
                    movements.</p>
                <p>In our final interview, Forest “Tres” Pyle chats with Chet Lisiecki about the
                    emergence of images in Romantic and post-Romantic texts. Pyle discusses using
                    Patti Smith and John Coltrane in the classroom, not only as a way of evoking for
                    the students an aural Kantian sublime, but also as a prelude to asking the
                    students to find their own “constellations or connections” between Romantic-era
                    and contemporary texts. It is clear from this expansive interview that Pyle’s
                    erudition and curiosity inform his teaching and research equally, offering us
                    all a model for an engaged and radical aesthetic.</p>
                <p>The volume concludes with two pieces on praxis. Rachel Feder’s “Zonkey
                    Romanticism” offers four theses on the effects of using creative writing
                    exercises in courses on Romantic literature, and Stephanie Insley Hershinow’s
                    “Romantic Selfhood and the Selfie: Relating to the Novel” offers a nuanced
                    defense of “relatability” in the classroom. By way of example, Hershinow shows
                    how a cultural analysis of YouTube reaction videos can “disrupt students’
                    assumptions about their emotional and psychological distance from Romantic-era
                    fiction.”</p>
                <p>It is our hope that the essays and interviews collected herein will provide food
                    for thought regarding how we define the contours and potentials of the
                    Romanticist classroom circa 2017—a question that has become even more pressing
                    while this volume has been in production. Whether you come to this volume to
                    theorize the pedagogical implications of including artifacts and phenomena from
                    the current (or recent) historical moment(s) in your courses, or whether you
                    come in search of a useful pedagogical tool, assignment, or idea to help you
                    bring the Romantic to bear on a discussion of the contemporary, it is our hope
                    that the work of our contributors will provide frameworks and strategies for
                    thinking through your own Romantic literature classroom—a classroom that is, of
                    course, always already contemporary.</p>
