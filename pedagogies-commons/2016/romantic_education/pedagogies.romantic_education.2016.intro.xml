            This collection combines studies of pedagogical history in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century with discourses about innovations taking place in today’s classrooms. By including essays on both topics, we hope to expose the breadth and richness of educational debates in Romanticism, to shed light on new ways to teach Romantic texts, and, finally, to encourage readers to find links between—and potentially answers to—the pedagogical problems facing educators both today and two hundred years ago.

                <p>In the last twenty years, scholars of Romanticism have approached education as a
                    subject of historical inquiry, as well as a modern conundrum. Some have turned
                    their attention to the rich debates in the Romantic era about education and
                    children’s literature, while others have entered a discussion taking place today
                    among academics, administrators, institutional trustees, and lawmakers about the
                    nature of higher education, in particular the place of the humanities within
                    university and college curricula. At first glance these two debates, separated
                    by nearly two hundred years, seem far removed from one another. When cultural
                    scholars discuss eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century education, we most
                    often mean primary or secondary education, whereas our conversations about
                    contemporary education typically center on undergraduate pedagogy at both the
                    classroom and institutional level. Pedagogy roundtables at NASSR and ASECS, for
                    example, focus on best practices for teaching historical texts to today’s
                    college students.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For example, between their
                        2013 and 2014 annual meetings, the American Society for Eighteenth-Century
                        Studies (ASECS) has included at least fourteen sessions (poster sessions,
                        roundtable discussions, and panel presentations) devoted to classroom
                        teaching, including the annual panels “Innovative Course Design” and “Let’s
                        Get Engaged!,” as well as the annual poster session “Teaching the Eighteenth
                        Century.” At least two of these sessions are also slated for the 2015 annual
                        meeting of ASECS. The North American Society for the Study of Romanticism
                        (NASSR) offers fewer pedagogical panels at their annual meeting but does
                        feature an annual pedagogy contest to promote innovations and best practices
                        in teaching.</note> Yet, many of the same issues that concern us today
                    pervaded late eighteenth-century education: the worry that students are
                    distracted by technology, the complaint that students have become uncivil, or
                    the fear that economic rather than intellectual achievement drives education. In
                    “Children, Adolescents, and Fashionable Urban Society in Eighteenth-Century
                    England,” Peter Borsay argues that the mid-eighteenth century witnessed a sea
                    change in middle-class education as pedagogues increasingly taught practical
                    skills to help children advance economically in the real world (56). Borsay’s
                    research suggests that the movement toward pragmatic skills, though certainly
                    influenced by philosophers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau, was also a reaction to
                    changing ideas about the purpose of education and the socio-economic environment
                    young people would encounter as adults. Such concerns can certainly be felt on
                    college campuses today: as Jim Engell and Arthur Dangerfield have rightfully
                    argued in <title level="m">Saving Higher Education in the Age of Money</title>
                    (2005), decisions at the college level are often made according to financial
                    concerns, with students more likely to choose and administrators more likely to
                    prioritize science, engineering, mathematics, and business programs over
                    departments of art history, English, philosophy, and classics (1-2). </p>
                <p>Such similarities within education, though, exist not simply on the macro level
                    of policy and research but also on the micro level of daily classroom teaching.
                    Educators from Charlotte Smith to Hannah More sought, much as we do today, to
                    make literature relevant to young students deluged with media and worried about
                    money. It is the relationship in approach and concern between the educators of
                    the Romantic era and today that has motivated this edition. This collection
                    combines studies of pedagogical history in the late eighteenth and early
                    nineteenth century with discourses about innovations taking place in today’s
                    classrooms. By including essays on both topics, we hope to expose the breadth
                    and richness of educational debates in Romanticism, to shed light on new ways to
                    teach Romantic texts, and, finally, to encourage readers to find links
                    between—and potentially answers to—the pedagogical problems facing educators
                    both today and two hundred years ago.</p>

                    <head>Innovations in Romantic-Era Education: New Audiences, Old Concerns</head>
                    <p>In the Romantic era, questions about classroom innovations and the potential
                        benefits and dangers of literacy were debated in the popular press,
                        exclaimed from pulpits, and dissected by all manner of writers and
                        theorists. From the 1780s to the 1830s, these disputants struggled to
                        identify what the so-called lower classes—women, children, and poor people
                        in particular—should learn and read. Technological improvements in
                        printmaking meant that the written word was more accessible than ever
                        before, and this accessibility sparked debates over the dangers of literacy
                        and methods to combat the widespread dissemination of texts and ideas.
                        Perhaps no figure exemplifies this anxiety over pedagogical change more than
                        Sarah Trimmer. Trimmer’s <title level="m">Guardian of Education</title>
                        (1802) is as conservative as it is reactionary, never more so than when
                        declaiming its own necessity: <quote>Many people […] will be apt to consider
                            us in the light of ALARMISTS, if we talk of <emph>a conspiracy against
                            </emph>CHRISTIANITY <emph>and all </emph>SOCIAL ORDER, […] one of which
                            is, endeavouring to infect the minds of the rising generation, through
                            the medium of <title level="m">Books of Education</title> and <title
                                level="m">Children’s Books</title>; but that such a conspiracy does
                            actually exist has been proved by undeniable authority, (as we shall
                            shew in the course of our work). (2) </quote> Such authority proves to
                        be Trimmer herself, as a mother, teacher, author, and high church Anglican.
                        Trimmer promises in the <title level="m">Guardian</title> to hunt down
                        radicalism and immorality in children’s books. Unsurprisingly, she finds
                        juvenile literature attacked on all sides: unlike in her own youth,
                        contemporary books are “replete with hidden mischief” (64) and contemporary
                        publishers so eager to turn a profit that they will sell anything, even
                        books that “threaten the utter perversion of all principle” (65). Most
                        alarming, Trimmer deduces a change not only in the content of children’s
                        books but also in their educational principles: <quote>Indeed numbers of
                            modern publications for children are evidently calculated to bring about
                            the same changes of system in the education of the children of this
                            nation, as has been produced by similar means on the Continent, […] and
                            if not checked in their progress, the consequences will be equally fatal
                            to the principle and morality of this nation. (64) </quote> Trimmer’s
                        choice of diction is deliberate, designed to inflame a paranoid
                        socio-political culture already concerned that the French revolution could
                        migrate to British soil. For Trimmer, the dangerous effects of this
                        pedagogical change are pervasive and imminent, and the cultural price of
                        such literature is nothing less than the loss of national character and
                        public peace. </p>
                    <p>William Godwin’s Juvenile Library, the children’s publishing house he
                        established in 1805 (and the subject of the editors’ ongoing <ref
                            target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/godwin_fables/index.html"><title
                                level="m">Romantic Circles Electronic Edition</title></ref>), is
                        another example of contemporary anxiety regarding what types of literature
                        should be available to children. In 1813 an anonymous spy sent a report to
                        the Home Office about Godwin’s subversive activities. His concern was not
                        Godwin’s widely received and oft-republished <title level="m">Enquiry
                            Concerning Political Justice and Its Influence on General Happiness and
                            Principles </title>(1793), nor his public defense of Thomas Hardy, John
                        Thelwall, and John Horne Tooke at their treason trials in 1795, but rather
                        his publication of children’s textbooks. <title level="m">Fables Ancient and
                            Modern </title>(1805), Godwin’s version of Aesop’s tales, may not strike
                        readers today as particularly pernicious, yet this anonymous spy disagrees,
                        envisioning Godwin’s literature as a radical project to undermine the
                        government by harnessing the anger of the working classes. By offering
                        “every work […] that can be required in the early instruction of children,”
                        the report argues, the Juvenile Library advocates “every principle professed
                        by the infidels and republicans of these days.”<note place="foot"
                            resp="editors"> We would like to thank Pamela Clemit, who directed us to

                        infidelity and disloyalty through the remotest provinces of that country,
                        and we know too well how they succeeded” (qtd. in Barnett and Gustafson
                        2).</p>
                    <p>The recommendations of Trimmer’s <title level="m">Guardian</title> and the
                        concerns about Godwin’s “radical” publishing venture speak to the cultural
                        space of education in early-nineteenth-century Britain. Trimmer may be an
                        alarmist, but she was not an anomaly. Education—in particular early
                        school—was widely regarded as the cradle of future social and spiritual
                        beliefs and, by extension, national health and longevity. Romanticists have
                        long recognized the cultural significance of education in the period. From
                        the 1980s to the early 2000s, writers such as Mitzi Myers and Donelle Ruwe
                        established that children’s literature was an untapped yet crucially
                        important area of intellectual inquiry. Scholars ranging from Alan
                        Richardson and James Holt McGavran to, more recently, Jackie Horne and
                        Andrew O’Malley have uncovered new information about the nature of childhood
                        and children’s literature in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
                        Their combined work suggests that education was a crucial testing ground in
                        the Romantic era for formulating socioeconomic, religious, political, and
                        ultimately national values. In the early nineteenth century, education was
                        considered a ground zero for the creation of a civil society in a rapidly
                        expanding and unequal world. </p>
                    <p> Though alarmist, Trimmer’s observations about the deluge of new educational
                        materials were indeed accurate. The Romantic era witnessed broad
                        experimentation with and theorization of education at various levels. As
                        Trimmer rightfully acknowledges, Rousseau’s <title level="m">Émile, ou De
                            l’éducation </title>(1762) profoundly influenced British educational
                        philosophy. Thomas Day and Richard Lovell Edgeworth, famously, sought to
                        raise children according to Rousseau’s model. Maria Edgeworth, Mary
                        Wollstonecraft, Charlotte Smith, William Godwin, Frances Burney, and others
                        engaged with his ideas on an intellectual level, picking those elements that
                        made sense while criticizing those that seemed objectionable.
                        Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman
                        </title>(1792) and Edgeworth’s <title level="m">Belinda </title>(1801), for
                        example, attacked Rousseau’s educational program for women as inadequate and
                        infantilizing, and the Rousseauvian tutor-figure appears unfavorably in
                        Godwin’s <title level="m">Fleetwood, or the New Man of Feeling
                        </title>(1805) and Burney’s <title level="m">Camilla, or a Portrait of Youth
                        </title>(1796). </p>
                    <p>Changes within British education, however, go well beyond Rousseau’s
                        pedagogical philosophy, as Borsay has demonstrated. Though it certainly
                        imported continental children’s books and educational treatises, mid- to
                        late-eighteenth century Britain became a testing ground for homegrown
                        educational innovations driven by inadequacies within the pedagogical
                        options available. Grammar schools had been set up in the Renaissance in
                        order to educate poor children, but according to Alan Richardson’s <title
                            level="m">Literature, Education, and Romanticism </title>(1994), by the
                        mid- to late- eighteenth century they had largely begun to exclude poor
                        children in favor of middle and upper class pupils (81). Public institutions
                        like Eton and Westminster were almost exclusively the purview of wealthy
                        children, and they drew criticism for a savage, corrupting student culture,
                        in particular the fagging system that exposed the vulnerability of the lower
                        classmen to the brutality of the upperclassmen.<note place="foot"
                            resp="editors">For example, young Percy Shelley’s resistance to fagging
                            and other such “Shelley-baits” at Eton is recounted in many biographies,
                            including James Bieri’s <title level="m">Percy Bysshe Shelley: A
                                Biography: Youth's Unextinguished Fire, 1792-1816,</title>
                            (University of Delaware Press, 2004). In <title level="m">The Life of
                                Percy Bysshe Shelley</title> (1858), Thomas Jefferson Hogg
                            identifies Shelley’s refusal to submit to the “aggravated miseries”
                            inflicted upon the youngest and weakest students by the older “tyrants”
                            as an early example of the poet’s opposition to tyranny in all its
                            forms.</note> These institutions, moreover, focused largely on teaching
                        classical languages, a pedagogy whose value was, according to Borsay and
                        Richardson, being questioned (Borsay 56, Richardson 80). Oxford and
                        Cambridge universities, meanwhile, excluded Dissenters and other
                        non-Anglicans. In short, while an educational system—<emph>ad hoc</emph> at
                        best—was in place in Britain in the eighteenth century, it did not meet the
                        needs of women, Dissenters, and working class children and, indeed, served
                        only a wealthy, male minority of the population. </p>
                    <p>The Romantic era thus is characterized by efforts to improve upon
                        pre-existing institutions and curricula, and many such efforts attempted to
                        ameliorate issues debated since the early eighteenth century, such as the
                        inadequate instruction of girls and poor children. Richardson’s research
                        suggests that educational debates became particularly heated in the 1790s
                        and again in the 1820s (65, 214). Education changes correlate with an
                        explosion in publishing—especially children’s book publishing—as well as
                        with the rise of female pedagogues, such as Anna Barbauld, Wollstonecraft,
                        and Trimmer, and with increased socioeconomic, cultural, and political
                        turbulence. They also bookend what has traditionally been seen as the
                        temporal boundaries of the Romantic era, thereby highlighting the centrality
                        of educational reform within this period as a means of assessing and
                        addressing social tensions. </p>
                    <p>One area that has received particular attention by scholars is the growth of
                        women’s education in the eighteenth century. If education for young men was
                        decentralized and non-compulsory, it was even more so for girls, for whom
                        there was no established educational system like the public schools and
                        universities available to young men. The eighteenth century saw the increase
                        in boarding schools for girls, though many girls were educated at home by a
                        parent or governess. Women’s basic education throughout the eighteenth
                        century consisted of arithmetic, reading, writing, and sewing. Better
                        schools and home schooling would provide instruction in dancing, music,
                        comportment, embroidery, and later botany, geography, and modern foreign
                        languages. By the 1780s and 1790s, many women writers were rethinking female
                        education through treatises and children’s literature; most prominent among
                        these were Wollstonecraft, Smith, Hester Chapone, Eleanor Fenn, and More.
                        Some writers sought to cultivate qualities like temperance, rationality, and
                        benevolence as an antidote not only to the attainment of fashionable
                        accomplishments thought to characterize women’s education but also to the
                        metaphorical lobotomizing of women epitomized by Rousseau’s Sophie. As Myers
                        argues in “Impeccable Governesses, Rational Dames, and Moral Mothers,”
                        writers like Wollstonecraft, Fenn, and Smith innovated a pedagogical fiction
                        that would inculcate such qualities through the figure of the female mentor. </p>
                    <p>While Wollstonecraft and others sought to make female education more
                        rigorous, other pedagogues turned to the educational needs of working-class
                        children and adults. The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK)
                        was founded in 1698 and was active in fits and starts throughout the
                        eighteenth century, seeing a brief resurgence in the 1820s (Richardson 214).
                        Its primary purpose was to teach reading and catechism to poor children. The
                        SPCK eventually found itself competing with Charity Schools, Sunday Schools,
                        and Industrial Schools. Although rivals, these charitable institutions
                        provided an alternative to the local “dame” schools that had cropped up
                        across Britain. Without national oversight, dame schools ran the gamut from
                        legitimate private schools to little more than housing services for poor
                        children; furthermore, as Richardson observes, its teachers were often
                        accused of being variously uneducated, overworked, underpaid, and even drunk
                        (87). </p>
                    <p>SPCK and other charity schools were founded on a largely unappealing idea of
                        encouraging poor children to understand and submit to their own subordinate,
                        God-given positions, to be obedient to rules and employers, and to “better”
                        themselves by mimicking middle class morality. These efforts were matched by
                        other endeavors to replace broadsides and chapbooks with improving stories
                        (of which Hannah More’s <title level="m">Cheap Repository Tracts</title> are
                        the most famous). Both SPCK and Sunday schools arose as a means of
                        addressing an increasingly literate British society. The SPCK’s and Sunday
                        Schools’ answer was to confine students’ access to literature to the bible
                        and devotional tracts; likewise Mechanics Institutes, though initially
                        founded by skilled laborers as an antidote to the religious lessons offered
                        in charity schools, eventually ceded control to middle class “sponsors” who
                        limited their reading to certain types of so-called improving books. These
                        limitations reflected middle class desires to control and channel literacy
                        in order to encourage the inculcation of middle class values, including
                        industry, order, temperance, cleanliness, and restraint, to their social
                        inferiors (Richardson 220). As Richardson explains, it was not until the
                        1820s that the message of subordination and religious obedience gave way to
                        a new discourse about education for the poor primarily advanced by James
                        Mill, Jeremy Bentham, Henry Bourgham, Francis Jeffrey, and Charles Knight
                        (214-215). As Richardson argues, this new discourse maintained that
                        “literacy was to be managed rather than restrained” and that a more
                        liberally educated workforce “would prove a more sure path to social
                        stability (and limited reform) than would the combination of passive
                        literacy, Christian morals, and deferential behavior advanced by an earlier
                        generation of educationalists” (215).</p>

                    <p>Modern teachers of the Romantic era might find unexpected sympathy with some
                        of Trimmer’s less hysterical complaints, such as her concern that students
                        are saturated in popular media that degrade their intellects. Any teacher
                        who has complained about losing his or her students to the lure of iPhones
                        or who has sighed over students’ use of emoticons in an email can
                        understand, at least in part, Trimmer’s position. Today, there is a tangible
                        sense that we are at a moment of change within education. As Engell and
                        Dangerfield argue, monetary concerns seem more directly entrenched in the
                        curricular decisions made at universities than in previous generations,
                        especially as administrators, educators, and students seek to determine the
                        role of humanistic study within modern higher education. Two issues that
                        become intertwined in literary and cultural history classrooms are
                        humanities and technology, as instructors seek to innovate pedagogical
                        methods to reach a new generation of students. For Romanticists, the most
                        pressing questions remain as straightforward as their answers are
                        complicated: how can we encourage students to engage with Romantic texts in
                        thoughtful and thought-provoking ways? What values will they derive from
                        studying old texts? How can technology improve our ability to teach these
                        texts and to make them relevant? </p>
                    <p>Towards these ends, this edition has been organized into two separate but
                        conversational sections: <title level="m">Pedagogies in Romanticism
                        </title>and <title level="m">Pedagogies of Romanticism</title>. The first
                        addresses questions of Romantic-era theories and practices by exploring four
                        figures who grappled with questions about how and why one learns: Tom
                        Wedgewood, Wollstonecraft, Smith, and Lord Byron. The second set of essays
                        focuses on the teaching of Romanticism today. While some examine ways of
                        utilizing digital resources, including gaming, in the modern Romantics
                        classroom, others consider more traditional pedagogical methods, such as
                        close reading, in new ways. </p>
                    <p> In part one’s “‘Hints &amp; Speculation on Education’: Tom Wedgwood’s
                        Materialist Pedagogy,” Lisa Ann Robertson considers Wedgwood’s role within
                        the intellectual history of the early Romantic period, including
                        contemporary debates about education and materialist theories of cognition.
                        Wedgwood, she argues, is today a marginalized figure valued more for his
                        associations with William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge than for
                        his own work, yet he “is significant because [he] gathered together several
                        strands of Romantic philosophical thought” to form “a practical plan of
                        education that would bring about a society of geniuses committed to the
                        principles of liberty, equality, communitarian values, and social justice.”
                        Reading Wedgwood’s manuscripts, accounts of his own physical ailments, and
                        plans for an experimental school, as well as texts that influenced him (such
                        as Joseph Priestley’s edition of <title level="m">Hartley’s Theory of Mind
                        </title>(1775) and Erasmus Darwin’s <title level="m">Zoonomia</title>
                        (1794)), Robertson traces Wedgwood’s understanding of the relationships
                        between emotions, thought, and association and situates the heretofore
                        under-recognized influence of his work within the larger context of
                        Romantic-era theories of cognition and education.</p>
                    <p>Suzanne L. Barnett’s “Generic Mutability and the Pedagogy of Realism in
                        Charlotte Smith’s <title level="m">The Romance of Real Life</title> and Mary
                        Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Original Stories from Real Life</title>”
                        positions those two works in larger conversations about gender, genre,
                        authority, and reading’s role in education in the Romantic period. Barnett
                        argues that these women writers’ experiments with the hybrid genres of
                        “romance of real life” and (fictional) “stories from real life” stem from
                        anxieties about the suitability of women for fiction-writing and attempts to
                        marshal the “serious” genre of historiography and the pedagogy of the real
                        into the service of the moral education of both children <emph>and</emph>
                        their mothers. </p>

                        learning and compares Byron’s depiction of “heroic learning” to Romantic-era
                        pedagogy that stressed moral discipline and education as preparation for a
                        life of useful work. In Byron’s time, the idea that reading should prepare
                        the lower classes for utility and virtuous servitude was complicated by
                            <title level="m">Cain</title>’s almost immediate piracy, which,
                        according to its contemporary critics, put a tool of potentially “dangerous
                        disturbance” into the hands of ignorant and unprepared working-class
                        readers. Falke paints Cain’s desire to learn and the play’s treatment of
                        knowledge as not only a locus of conversation about hubris and Byron’s
                        blasphemy but also as a “subtle inquiry into the possibility and limits of
                        knowledge.” </p>
                    <p>The second part of this edition turns from the pedagogical theories of
                        Romantic-period writers to consider how modern educators might most
                        successfully teach Romantic literature and culture to twenty-first-century
                        students. “Universal Truths, Unacknowledged Legislators: Teaching the First
                        Sentence of <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>” offers a targeted
                        yet expansive classroom exercise in which students analyze word-by-word
                        Austen’s famous line: “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single
                        man in possession of a large fortune, must be in want of a wife.” This
                        process “unfolds historical and formal problems of Romanticism,” including
                        Austen’s criticism of gender and class constructions. Chris Washington
                        compares the self-reflexive irony of this first sentence to the rest of the
                        novel and illuminates how students have responded to such a laser-focused
                        classroom assignment and what it teaches them about reading Romantic texts. </p>
                    <p>“Imagining the Internet through the Romantics” chronicles Brian Rejack’s
                        attempts to allow students “to see digital culture from a shifted
                        intellectual perspective” and reflects on “the overlapping domains of
                        teaching and research, new and old media, and the imaginative frameworks
                        that help us place their iterative connections.” Rejack considers how the
                        inherent immateriality of digital culture intersects with the “Romantic
                        ideology” of textual media and how his students’ process of imaginatively
                        “embodying” Romantic texts via new media reflects the relationship between
                        imagination and matter. Using texts as disparate as an AT&amp;T commercial,
                        Leonardo Solaas’s net-art installation<title level="m"> Google
                            Variations</title>, Apple iCloud promotional materials, and Percy
                        Shelley’s “The Cloud,” Rejack describes how he invites his students to
                        recognize “the ways in which they live as historical bodies in and of the
                        world” and asks his readers to consider the evolving roles of digital
                        technology in the classroom. </p>
                    <p>In “Revisiting the Radical Republican Publishers of the Romantic Era in the
                        Digital Era,” Michael Demson considers another intersection of print and
                        digital media: employing digital resources in a course on four republican
                        publishers of the Romantic era (William Blake, Leigh Hunt, William Hone, and
                        William Cobbett). Demson suggests that such a course would have been nearly
                        impossible before resources like <title level="m">Romantic Circles, The
                            William Blake Archive, </title>and <title level="m">The William Hone
                            Biotext</title> that make available previously inaccessible (or at least
                        difficult and costly to access) texts and images to both graduate and
                        undergraduate classrooms. Demson notes that, for example, it is now possible
                        for his students to search for phrases like “rotten borough” across hundreds
                        of publications or to trace the ways an author or periodical cover a
                        particular story over time. Demson describes how a combination of
                        traditional and digital media can combine in the classroom to offer students
                        a richer experience of Romantic-era print culture. </p>
                    <p>In the final essay in this edition, “Playing with Independence: Using
                        Multiplayer Online Narratives to Explore Independent and Interdependent
                        Tensions in Romantic-Period Literature,” Jon Saflofske explores how
                        multiplayer games enable students to explore questions about character and
                        plot in Romantic fiction. The fact that these games are specifically
                        multiplayer and require cooperation between students “simulates
                        opportunities for negotiating the tensions between independence and
                        interdependence,” according to Saklofske, and inspires collaborative
                        creativity (and occasionally productive frustration) that mirrors both the
                        experience of living in the late eighteenth century and also of working
                        together on a creative project. </p>
                    <p>As a collection, these seven essays offer diverse ways of thinking about the
                        intersections of Romanticism and pedagogy: both what Romantic-era figures
                        themselves thought about the processes of learning and teaching and also
                        what we as modern educators might consider as we present these texts and
                        figures to our students. It is our hope that they will contribute to ongoing
                        conversations among scholars and teachers of Romanticism about the history
                        and future of humanities education, and in particular will foster
                        cross-historical conversations. </p>
