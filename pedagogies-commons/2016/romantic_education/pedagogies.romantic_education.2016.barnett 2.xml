          This paper investigates the didactic and pedagogic values of Romantic realism by looking at the ways in which Wollstonecraft and Smith, in particular, experiment with the synthesis of Romance and history and how these experiments form the core of their pedagogical projects undertaken within the growing genre of children’s prose. Wollstonecraft’s and Smith’s productions for young readers address the anxiety about women’s ability to employ historical fact and realism in serious literature and replace women’s “state of perpetual childhood” with the powerful roles of educator and arbitrator. But these authors also help create a hybrid genre that allows them to temper history with the attractiveness of Romance and to elevate fiction by infusing it with realism, thus turning fiction into a medium that can address history, society, and all aspects of “real life” as it acts as a powerful pedagogical tool on young minds.

                <p>Mary Wollstonecraft’s second published work, <title level="m">Original Stories
                        from Real Life; with Conversations, Calculated to Regulate the Affections,
                        and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness</title> (1788), was her first
                    commercial literary success, running into six editions over twelve years and
                    establishing her reputation as an authority on both childhood education and
                    literature for children. However, despite its contemporary success, <title

                            is also interesting to note that when the work <emph>is</emph> cited—as
                            in for example Alan Richardson’s <title level="m">Literature, Education,

                            title is usually elided to simply “<title level="m">Original
                                Stories</title>”, thus de-emphasizing the work’s apparent
                            preoccupation with realism; for the sake of brevity, however, this essay
                            will hereafter use the same abbreviation. </note> has fallen off the
                    radar of recent critical explorations of romantic-era children’s literature and
                    of romantic views of childhood, perhaps mentioned in passing or relegated to a
                    footnote while whole chapters are devoted to the works of Maria Edgeworth,
                    William Wordsworth, Hannah More, or Sarah Trimmer. It is frequently dismissed as
                    an anomalous example of a radical writer producing apparently conservative and
                    apolitical work for children (see: Mary V. Jackson and Geoffrey Summerfield,
                    among others<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Summerfield pulls no punches in
                        expressing his dislike of<title level="m">Original Stories</title> and what
                        he sees as its bland conservatism; his study’s very first mention of
                        Wollstonecraft’s work is to claim that “<title level="m">Original
                            Stories</title> has a strong claim to be the most sinister, ugly,
                        overbearing book for children ever published. It is permeated by a grim,
                        humorless, tyrannical spirit of hectoring and unswerving spiritual and
                        mental rectitude—all in the name of healthy growth: a dream of reason
                        producing, indeed, a veritable monster in the form of Mrs. Mason” (229).
                    </note>) or as a mere illustration within discussions of radical writers for
                    adults who “also” wrote for children. The role that Wollstonecraft’s works for
                    children played in the veritable explosion of literature for children in the
                    last two decades of the eighteenth century has yet to be explored fully.</p>
                <p>However, no attention whatsoever has yet been focused on <title level="m"
                        >Original Stories</title>’ own generic hybridity and the implications that
                    such hybridity has both on the way we read the <title level="m">Stories</title>
                    themselves and on the ways in which we can place that work within
                    Wollstonecraft’s body of work and amongst the parallel productions of her
                    contemporaries. <title level="m">Original Stories</title> is a unique amalgam
                    that owes a part of its makeup to the popular moral tales for children (from the
                    works produced by John Newbery earlier in the century through the newer
                    productions of writers like Trimmer and Anna Barbauld) but also draws on
                    elements of romance (as we shall see, a controversial subject for children’s
                    reading) and the so-called “romance of real life,” a genre identified by Michael
                    Gamer and popularized in part by Wollstonecraft’s contemporaries Charlotte Smith
                    and Maria Edgeworth. Even the most cursory glance at Wollstonecraft’s work’s
                    title hints at its generic heterogeneity. “Original stories” suggests an
                    imaginative source, while the phrase “from real life” seems to make the
                    paradoxical claim that the stories are both empirically true and verifiable
                    while at the same time “original” creations. The next portion of the title
                    informs us that these “stories” contain “conversations,” again implying a
                    quasi-journalistic truth claim, while “calculated,” “regulated,” and “form” all
                    suggest that this is a book with a premeditated mission and pedagogical purpose.
                    Finally “affections,” “mind,” “truth,” and “goodness” all present the qualities
                    and entities that Wollstonecraft’s project aims either to instill or improve and
                    are themes she will return to in later works, including the attempt in <title
                        level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> to carve out a space
                    for the rational female mind capable of housing both “affections” and reason. </p>
                <p><title level="m">Original Stories </title>is not Wollstonecraft’s only work that
                    presents a vexed relationship between different genres, and specifically between
                    the antipodal pulls of realism and romanticism, rationality and imagination:
                    note for example the generic funambulism in <title level="m">Maria: or, The
                        Wrongs of Woman</title> (1798) between romance’s impossibly dramatic
                    characters (represented by the gothic sufferer Maria and her improbable prison
                    romance) and passages of stark realism (as in Jemima’s chillingly realistic
                    narratives of society’s underbelly). Wollstonecraft’s published works encompass
                    the genres of “thoughts,” a “view,” and “letters,” and the self-presentations of
                    the two <title level="m">Vindications</title> as explorations of the realities
                    of contemporary society are offset by the sense of novelistic un-reality
                    proclaimed by the title of the pseudo-autobiographical <title level="m">Mary: a
                        Fiction</title> (1788); clearly Wollstonecraft was no stranger to generic
                    experimentation. But her participation in the genre of “tales” or “romances of
                    real life” (itself a generic hybrid) in her only original work aimed at children
                    suggests a particular set of ideological assumptions regarding the didactic and
                    pedagogic values of realism. The fact that this questioning of genres was of
                    particular interest to the period’s women writers, coupled with the fact that,
                    as Mitzi Meyers demonstrates, women were not only the principal producers of
                    literature for children, but also among the leading educational theorists of the
                    day, suggests that an exploration of precisely what Wollstonecraft intended with
                    her “original,” instructive stories “from real life” aimed at children might
                    help clarify not only Wollstonecraft’s own literary and philosophical projects
                    but also the growing genre in which her <title level="m">Original
                        Stories</title> participates. When we consider that Charlotte Smith’s <title
                        level="m">The Romance of Real Life</title> was published in 1787, at the
                    time Wollstonecraft was writing her <title level="m">Original Stories</title>,
                    and that Wollstonecraft was familiar with Smith’s work due to the former’s
                    position as a reviewer for <title level="m">The Analytical Review</title>,<note
                        place="foot" resp="editors"> Though Wollstonecraft did not review<title
                            level="m">The Romance of Real Life</title>, she did review Smith’s
                            <title level="m">Emmeline</title> (1788), <title level="m"
                            >Ethelinde</title> (1789), <title level="m">Celestina</title> (1791),
                            <title level="m">Desmond</title> (1792), and <title level="m">Marchmont
                        </title>(1796) for <title level="m">The Analytical Review</title> (Fletcher
                        99; 120; 141; 152; 255). Although Wollstonecraft and Smith knew and admired
                        each other’s work, it is unlikely they ever met or corresponded (Stanton 51;
                        Todd <title level="m">Revolutionary</title> xx).</note> the lines of
                    association between <title level="m">Original Stories</title> and the romance of
                    real life genre become clearer. Reading Wollstonecraft’s collection of stories
                    “from real life” as simultaneously a comment on, expansion of, and conversation
                    with Smith’s recent collection of stories “of real life” will help illuminate
                    the generic experimentation of each.</p>
                <p>The identification of the romance of real life as not only a genre distinct from
                    the novel but as a sort of anti-novel in which the excesses of romance are
                    “corrected” by an attempted synthesis with history (that most dignified of
                    discourses) suggests the period’s unease regarding the novel’s status and
                    respectability, especially when it is produced or consumed by women (Gamer,
                    “Romance” 237). The shifting role of women as both writers and readers of novels
                    and the dangers of women’s allegedly innate sensibility are subjects to which
                    Wollstonecraft turns her attention in the second <title level="m">Vindication
                    </title>and in its claims that the “exquisite sensibility” that women are
                    encouraged to cultivate and the novels they are taught to swoon over relegate
                    them to a “state of perpetual childhood” (9). Women authors of the 1780s had to
                    contend not only with the usual questions of respectability that troubled any
                    professional woman writer but also with the perception that the novel was a
                    genre particularly dangerously suited to women’s acute sensibility. This
                    conflict between women writers’ attraction to the novel as a new and accessible
                    discourse (for it required no formal training or knowledge of classical
                    languages) and the sense that, despite the earlier success of Frances Burney and
                    Sarah Fielding, women’s suitability to the genre was questionable, inspired the
                    experimentation with a new genre that merged the entertainment value of the
                    romance or novel with the respectable and edifying genre of history.<note

                <p>Another motivation for women to present their writing as something with direct
                    ties to historical fact is related to Myers’s claims that the popularity of both
                    moral tales and children’s literature with women writers was an attempt to
                    appropriate the realm of education as a domestic (and thus feminine) concern
                    and, concurrently, to gain recognition in the world of letters that was in the
                    1780s and early 1790s still very much a masculine realm. Insisting that the
                    tales they tell— even the apparently “romantic” ones—are drawn from real life
                    imparts to women writers a certain palpable authority and prevents them from
                    becoming mere “novelists.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Cf. Maria

                    </note> If we recognize the proliferation of so-called realistic romances among
                    early romantic women writers as a defensive fusion of romance with private
                    memoirs, domestic biographies, and other allegedly ahistorical discourses in an
                    attempt to attain the authority of truth, we are invited to read any such
                    self-proclaimed real-life tales as an attempt at self-ratification. For example,
                    although Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Stories</title> do not label
                    themselves as “romances” per se, her title’s emphasis on both originality <title
                        level="m">and </title>realistic mimesis suggest this same sort of
                    self-conscious acknowledgement of the apparent difficulties of the female writer
                    to duplicate faithfully the world around her.</p>
                <p>Smith’s preface to <title level="m">The Romance of Real Life</title> provides as
                    clear and revealing a summary as one could seek of these tensions surrounding
                    one writer’s forays into the seemingly incompatible genres of romance and
                    history. In Smith’s case, she finds both genres lacking for her purpose and
                    instead constructs a hybrid discourse that borrows aspects from each genre and
                    is simultaneously both and neither: <quote>A Literary friend, whose opinion I
                        greatly value, suggested to me the possibility of producing a few little
                        volumes, that might prove as attractive as the most romantic fiction, and
                        yet convey all the solid instruction of genuine history. He affirmed, that
                        the voluminous and ill-written work, entitled <title level="m">Les Causes
                            Célébres</title>, might furnish me with very ample materials for so
                        desirable a purpose. He advised me to select such stories from this
                        collection, as, though disfigured by the affectation and bad taste of the
                        compiler, Guyot [<emph>sic</emph>] de Pitaval, might lead us to form awful
                        ideas of the force and danger of the human passions. He wished me to
                        consider myself as under no restriction, but that of adhering to
                        authenticated facts; and by telling each story in my own way, to render it
                        as much as possible an interesting lesson of morality. (129<note

                    first thing that strikes the reader is the female writer’s reliance on the
                    unnamed, male, “Literary friend” (identified by Gamer as William Hayley; 298)
                    whose guidance she seems to solicit or even require. It is this friend who
                    proposes the project, suggests the source text, and advised the author how and
                    in what style she ought to proceed (three of the paragraph’s four sentences
                    begin with the male friend’s proclamations: “He affirmed […] He advised […] He
                    wished”). Such apparent deference on the part of a fledgling female writer (who
                    had produced only one other prose work, a translation of Prèvost’s <title
                        level="m">Manon Lescaut</title>, in the previous year) might be
                    understandable if not for the fact that, although new to prose, Smith was
                    already a well-established literary figure by 1787. <title level="m">Elegiac
                        Sonnets</title><note place="foot" resp="editors"> It is perhaps worth noting
                        that the “elegiac sonnet” is itself a sort of hybrid not unlike the romance
                        of real life, suggesting that Smith’s drive towards generic innovation and
                        experimentation does not begin and end with her 1787 prose work.
                        Furthermore, a case could be made that Smith’s later works for
                            children—<title level="m">Rural Walks</title> (1795), <title level="m"
                            >Rambles Farther </title>(1796), <title level="m">Minor Morals</title>
                        (1798), and <title level="m">Conversations, Introducing Poetry
                        </title>(1804) —are in fact influenced by the same generic experimentation

                            >Original Stories</title> that I here argue that she, in turn, derived
                        from Smith’s early works, but the limited scope of this essay prevents an
                        in-depth discussion of works by Smith that followed <title level="m"
                            >Original Stories</title>. However, since an extensive study of Smith’s
                        work for children has not yet been written, the apparent exchange between
                        these two authors regarding the pedagogical effect of realism certainly
                        suggests one avenue of inquiry. </note> had been an immediate commercial and
                    critical success when it was released in 1784 and by 1787 was already in its
                    fourth English edition, meaning that Smith was by no means a novice to the book
                    trade. So why, one might wonder, does this capable and successful author seem to
                    defer to a male preceptor? Her translator’s preface to <title level="m">Manon
                        Lescaut</title>, in contrast, is authoritative with its claims that she
                    herself found the original novel in Normandy and amused some English friends by
                    masterfully translating passages extempore. She also proudly declares the
                    liberties she has taken with the text, including lengthening the short sentences
                    she finds “so unpleasant to the English ear,” altering the narrative structure,
                    and eliding many “trite” and repetitive passages (5), claims which all suggest
                    an author in command of her source material and comfortable with her authority.
                    However, <title level="m">Manon Lescaut </title>was published anonymously—its
                    title page simply proclaiming itself “A French Story”—and the preface contains
                    no tell-tale pronouns or details; indeed, the public seems to have assumed that
                    the translator was male (Fletcher 84). The fact that <title level="m">The
                        Romance of Real Life</title> was Smith’s first work in prose to feature her
                    name on the title page might have contributed to the fact that the beginning of
                    its preface seems to defer to masculine literary authority.</p>
                <p> However, this apparent obsequiousness is more complicated than it first appears,
                    and as the preface progresses this sense of deference falls away and is replaced
                    by the same confident, authoritative tone that characterizes Smith’s earlier,
                    anonymous preface. The “Literary friend” is never again mentioned, and Smith is
                    openly critical not only of the original (male) author, Gayot de Pitaval
                    (claiming that “the style of the original is frequently obscure; the facts are
                    often anticipated, and often repeated, in almost the same words, in different
                    parts of the story,” among many other complaints) but also of a new edition of
                    the same work by François Richer, claiming that his work is “less interesting”
                    and less accurate than her own. Her announcement that Richer has produced
                    another, inferior French version of “<emph>my</emph> original” (emphasis added)
                    suggests the degree to which she saw herself as “owning” the text she had
                    completely rewritten. The “great pleasure” she has taken in the work, despite
                    its many complexities and roadblocks, is repeatedly emphasized. Even as the
                    difficulties of her task had begun to overwhelm her, she claims, she kept in
                    sight the potential usefulness of her project, and it is this mission that made
                    the experience pleasurable: <quote>Yet it occurred to me, that the reason which
                        made the work difficult and unpleasant for me to write, would render it,
                        when finished, a desirable book to those who may wish to obtain some idea of
                        a celebrated publication, without wading thro’ the obscurities and
                        extraneous matter of M. de Pitaval. (129) </quote> This is a pivotal
                    (forgive the pun) moment in the preface, a moment in which the author emerges
                    from the passive figure that occupied the first paragraph, and an emergence that
                    centers not only on her rejection of the authoritative original she is adapting
                    but also on her ambition that the book have instructional value. While the
                    author’s reliance on her male friend might be the first noteworthy feature of
                    the preface, it is by no means its only one; in fact, when read in light of the
                    remainder of the preface, the first paragraph’s agenda becomes clearer and, I
                    would argue, considerably less straightforward than it first appeared. Although
                    the spectre of the Literary friend’s influence hovers throughout the opening
                    paragraph, the claims that Smith herself is making for both her own agency and
                    for her project’s pedagogical purpose begin to surface with her statement that
                    “by telling each story in [her] own way, [she will] render it as much as
                    possible an interesting lesson of morality.” This discovery of her “own way” in
                    which to remake these frivolous French tales signals her intention of making
                    these stories “both interesting and instructive,” unlike “romantic fiction”
                    (which is “attractive,” but, it is implied, not instructive) and “genuine
                    history” (which contains “solid instruction,” but less attraction). Since
                    neither mode of discourse is entirely satisfactory, she will make her own by
                    “adhering to authenticated facts” while at the same time “telling each story in
                    [her] own way.” This hybrid that she has created—part attractive romantic
                    fiction, part “genuine history”—is presented as an improvement not only over the
                    forty-year old original that was “disfigured by the affectation and bad taste”
                    of its creator (or was, in other words, factually accurate but stylistically
                    flawed), but also the new version by Richer unmixed with romance and therefore
                    “less interesting.” Smith is not claiming that romance and history are mutually
                    exclusive, rather that neither side tells the entire story, or tells the story
                    in a way that makes it attractive and, therefore, useful as a moral instructor.
                    This is the impetus behind her unique title that was to launch a thousand
                    spin-offs, for “the romance of real life” is nowhere close to a faithful
                    translation of the original French title, <title level="m">Les Causes
                        Célébres</title>. Smith is clearly not aiming for an accurate translation of
                    the title, but rather a transformation of it, whereby the two elements that she
                    sees as necessary for a literary work’s instructive value—that the tales be true
                    (because nothing is as educational as experiencing the “real”), but are told as
                    if they were fiction (because nothing is as satisfying as a good read)—combine
                    to form a palatable mixture of fiction and reality. If a work is (or even claims
                    to be) drawn from real life, the lessons that can be gleaned from it are almost
                    as valuable as actually having the same real-life experience. Readers at home
                    can live through the harrowing adventures of Anglade or Louisa d’Antail, and,
                    through the virtue of a sensibility that would relate their feelings of empathy
                    to <emph>real people</emph>
                    <emph>who actually existed</emph>, they might feel deeply for them and learn
                    from the sufferers’ examples as if they were their own experiences. Smith’s
                    brief and modest-seeming preface is in fact a watershed moment for the generic
                    conventions of prose. It is the introduction of realism into romance, of history
                    into fiction, and its central claim that this hybridity is necessary in order to
                    produce a work of prose “both interesting and instructive” (and the implied
                    claim that this is what good prose should aim to do) signal a new way of
                    thinking about the purpose of writing.</p>
                <p> It is perhaps no coincidence that Smith—herself a mother—comes to this
                    revelation at the same time that the English public is becoming obsessed with
                    the child reader. Due in part to the new availability of cheap paper, a
                    subsequent upsurge in publishing activity, and increased literacy rates among
                    all classes, the last decades of the eighteenth century saw an unprecedented
                    interest in producing printed material aimed at children, material that often
                    came loaded with ideology. From Hannah More’s <title level="m">Cheap Repository
                        Tracts </title>that preached duty, obedience, and conformity to prevalent
                    social values to the piously conservative works of Sarah Trimmer, the new
                    literature available to children was obsessed with what sorts of lessons
                    children might glean from the written word. Too much romance or fancy, even in
                    the form of chapbook fairy tales, was seen as dangerous to young unformed minds
                    in a way that should remind us of the period’s anxiety about the effect fiction
                    might have on the similarly immature minds of women (as in Wollstonecraft’s
                    claim that women are being relegated to a “state of perpetual childhood”).
                    Imagination was a dangerous quality to cultivate, since it taught children to
                    imagine worlds other than the one in which they were born into—a world in which,
                    for example, Little Goody Two-Shoes can rise from poverty through schooling,
                    become a governess, and marry a rich nobleman—and introduced them to the notion
                    of choice, the idea that their destinies were in their hands and that any ragged
                    child could, through hard work, virtue, and a bit of luck, become a prince or
                    princess. Thus in class-bound England, especially in the years after the French
                    Revolution, imagination suggested radical democratic ideals and
                    leveling—dangerous concepts in a society in which literacy rates were rising in
                    the lower classes and Paine’s <title level="m">Rights of Man</title> (1791) was
                    a runaway best-seller. In 1802 Trimmer founded the <title level="m">Guardian of
                        Education</title>, a version of the <title level="m">Anti-Jacobin
                        Review</title> specifically aimed at rooting out subversive elements in
                    children’s literature. The world of romance and imagination was seen by many as
                    singularly unfit for childish consumption (just as too much novel-reading would
                    corrupt their silly mothers), and books for children were thought to require a
                    strong moral stance and firm basis in real life, where animals do not talk and
                    poor little girls never become fine ladies.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        This was clearly not the case for everyone—Godwin, Coleridge, Wordsworth,
                        and Lamb provide famous defenses of fairy tales, chapbooks, ballads, and
                        imaginative literature for children—but the market indicates that it was the
                        case for most consumers: More, Trimmer, and Barbauld were huge
                        sellers.</note></p>
                <p> However, as Smith notes in the preface discussed above, “solid instruction”
                    itself is not sufficient to retain the interest of any reader, young or old,
                    without some of the attraction of “romantic fiction.” It is this happy medium
                    that Wollstonecraft tries to deliver with her <title level="m">Original Stories
                        from Real Life</title>, an attempt to synthesize the moral instruction that
                    many, including Wollstonecraft, felt that children need while also providing
                    them with the elements of fiction and story-telling that they desire. Although a
                    lack of definitive proof in the form of reviews or letters makes it impossible
                    to prove that Wollstonecraft read Smith’s <title level="m">Romance of Real
                        Life</title> in the year in which she was composing <title level="m"
                        >Original Stories</title>, the complementary titles alone would suggest
                    that, even if no direct influence exists, the two writers were at least drawing
                    from the same ideological pool. Regardless, it is highly likely that
                    Wollstonecraft <emph>did</emph> indeed read Smith’s work in 1787; in that year
                    Wollstonecraft left her position as a governess in Ireland and headed to London,
                    where she became a member of Joseph Johnson’s circle and immersed herself in
                    literary life, and due to her position with <title level="m">The Analytical
                        Review</title> she had already reviewed Smith’s work as early as July 1788.
                    Even without a definite provenance, however, it is clear that both Smith and
                    Wollstonecraft had in mind similar reexaminations of the generic conventions of
                    prose and ideas regarding the pedagogical import of realism. Their audiences
                    might have differed—Wollstonecraft’s consisting of children (and their parents)
                    in need of moral instruction, and Smith’s the wider reading public—but their
                    motivations and techniques are surprisingly similar. In fact if we bracket the
                    central frame of <title level="m">Original Stories</title>—Mrs. Mason’s
                    storytelling and careful manipulation of situations that allow her charges to
                    experience the stories of others—its similarities to Smith’s <title level="m"
                        >Romance</title> become striking: both works feature a collection of
                    disjointed tales that illustrate well-defined morals and are presented as
                    historically and factually true accounts of real experiences colored with an
                    imaginative cast. </p>
                <p> Wollstonecraft’s preface immediately delineates the text’s purpose and testifies
                    to its necessity: <quote>These conversations and tales are accommodated to the
                        present state of society; which obliges the author to attempt to cure those
                        faults by reason, which ought never to have taken root in the infant mind.
                        Good habits, imperceptibly fixed, are far preferable to the precepts of
                        reason; but, as this task requires more judgment than generally falls to the
                        lot of parents, substitutes may be sought for, and medicines given, when
                        regimen would have answered the purpose much better. (359)<note place="foot"

                    combat the insidious forces implanting themselves, weed-like, into the “infant
                    minds” of the next generation. In a later paragraph Wollstonecraft essentially
                    dismisses contemporary parents, noting that they have their “own passions to
                    combat with, and fastidious pleasures to pursue” and are therefore too busy to
                    tend to their children’s moral education themselves; she proposes that we
                    address our efforts to salvaging the succeeding generation, which might yet be
                    taught the virtue their parents lack.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Joseph
                        Johnson apparently found this passage too incendiary and asked
                        Wollstonecraft to amend it; she refused, writing that “thought your remarks
                        are generally judicious—I cannot<emph>now </emph>concur with you, I mean in
                        respect to the preface, and have not altered it. I hate the usual smooth way

                        the majority—and, believe me, the few judicious parents who may peruse the
                        book, will not feel themselves hurt—and the weak are too vain to mind what
                        is said in a book intended for children […] If parents attended to their
                        children, I would not have written the stories; for, what are books—compared
                        to conversations which affection inforces!” (Todd, <title level="m"
                            >Letters</title> 142-143).</note> The picture she paints of frivolous,
                    inattentive parents—and for “parents” we can safely read “mothers”—is one to
                    which she will return in the second <title level="m">Vindication</title> and its
                    claims that women schooled in sensibility and manners but lacking common sense,
                    practical training, or any knowledge beyond the parlor or nursery leads to a
                    weakened society.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> “The conclusion that I wish
                        to draw, is obvious; make women rational creatures, and free citizens, and
                        they will quickly become good wives, and mothers” (<title level="m"
                            >Vindication</title> 178). It is noteworthy that “Wollstonecraft was
                        meticulously revising the 1788 first edition [of <title level="m">Original
                            Stories</title>]—word by word, line by line—while <title level="m"
                            >Rights of Woman</title> was gestating in her head” (Myers 40).</note>
                    The fourth paragraph of the preface even claims that the text—written in a
                    mature style which, she acknowledges, might be “not quite on a level with the
                    capacity of a child”—might be as useful to the adult who would read it aloud to
                    the child as to that child itself: “The Conversations are intended to assist the
                    teacher as well as the pupil.” This statement—along with the fact that, indeed,
                    the style is hardly childish, and many of the situations mature—suggests that
                    Wollstonecraft’s intended audience might be wider than it first appears; a
                    second glance at the full title discovers that children are nowhere mentioned,
                    and it is not “childish minds” but “the mind” that the title claims to “form.”
                    The fact that the text was published by J. Johnson, a house not yet known in
                    1788 for its juvenile productions, would have contributed to the impression that
                    this was a text for all, offering instruction not only to children but to their
                    parents as well.</p>
                <p> The method Wollstonecraft chooses to promote reason to the next generation takes
                    a form similar to that which we have seen previously. She has already in the
                    preface’s opening sentence claimed that the work to follow will be comprised of
                    “conversations and tales” and notes in its final sentence that “the Tales which
                    were written to illustrate the moral, may recall it, when the mind has gained
                    sufficient strength to discuss the argument from which it was deduced” (360)—in
                    other words, the tales are the instruments with which an attentive reader might
                    arrive at the real-life lesson, much as Smith’s “attractive” fictional style was
                    the means of delivering her real-life lessons. Wollstonecraft’s preface makes
                    another similar claim: <quote>The way to render instruction most useful cannot
                        always be adopted; knowledge should be gradually imparted, and flow more
                        from example than teaching: example directly addresses the senses, the first
                        inlets to the heart; and the improvement of those instruments of the
                        understanding is the object education should have constantly in view, and
                        over which we have most power. (359) </quote> This idea that unadulterated
                    “instruction” is not always the best method of teaching, that sometimes
                    “examples” that address the “senses” and “heart” are more effective vehicles of
                    education and refinement, echoes Smith’s claims for the insufficiency of “solid
                    instruction” alone. Elsewhere in her preface Wollstonecraft notes that the
                    “affections”—highlighted in the work’s subtitle—are the forces that should “warm
                    the heart, and animate the conduct,” suggesting the same interest that Smith
                    demonstrates in the sensory processing of literature. Again, the reader is
                    presented as engaging in the same sort of relationship with the text whereby the
                    experiences he or she reads about will affect their sensibilities in the same
                    way as would actual lived or directly observed experiences. The idea that
                    reading these stories—or having them read out loud—will do as much good for any
                    child as they did for Mary and Caroline is ratified by <title level="m">Original
                        Stories</title>’ last chapter, in which Mrs Mason presents her charges with
                    a book—presumably <emph>the </emph>book, <title level="m">Original
                        Stories</title> itself—recording all of their adventures and conversations
                    and claims that it will act as a substitute for their real-life guide; she then
                    asks that the girls write to her, but only if they record “the genuine
                    sentiments of [their] hearts,” which suggests confidence that that such things
                    can truly be duplicated in a letter. The belief that the written word can
                    faithfully replicate the truest expressions of heart and mind is perhaps not a
                    new one, but what <emph>is</emph> new here is the concept that this direct line
                    between heart and pen can serve a useful purpose, that sensibility might be put
                    into the service of morality.</p>
                <p> The structure of <title level="m">Original Stories</title> demonstrates this
                    concept. Having observed a moral shortcoming in one or both of her charges, Mrs
                    Mason orchestrates a scenario in which she can offer a counter-example; for
                    instance, after seeing the girls kill insects, Mrs Mason makes an elaborate show
                    of walking off the path and into the wet grass to avoid stepping on a line of
                    snails. After offering a brief homily on the topic, she then tells a series of
                    short accounts of other people’s experiences in similar situations, often using
                    only vague descriptions and no proper names; on the issue of cruelty to animals,
                    anonymous accounts of puppy-drowning and guinea-pig-torture ensue. Up until this
                    point, the <title level="m">Stories</title>’ pedagogical project is fairly
                    straightforward: the girls are <emph>told</emph> that what they are doing is
                    wrong, and they are offered examples of how other people erred in the same way
                    in order to shame them into a different behavior. It is the final step in Mrs
                    Mason’s program of moral education that supports the claims Wollstonecraft makes
                    in the preface regarding the necessity of knowledge that flows from example and
                    hinges on sensibility and affection: the girls are plunged into the actual and
                    are taken to view real relics or meet real people whose true stories ratify
                    their tutor’s tales. Standing before crazy Robin’s cave, Mrs Mason relates the
                    story of the man she actually knew, assisted, and even wept with over the body
                    of his murdered dog, serving as an eyewitness to the events she describes. This
                    “real life” example is shown as making an immediate impression on the girls:
                    “Was that the cave? asked Mary. They ran to it. Poor Robin! Did you ever hear of
                    any thing so cruel!” (376). Mrs Mason’s presentation of the actual Robin’s cave
                    produces a reaction in Mary and Caroline far more marked than any of her stories
                    and examples ever had, demonstrating the pedagogical value of the real. Not
                    coincidently, this move from story into reality is also the point in each “real
                    life” example that elements of romance and sensibility are the most marked. The
                    account of Robin standing over the bed containing his dead children is a scene
                    ripped straight from the pages of a sentimental novel and engineered to elicit
                    its audience’s tears: <quote>The poor father, who was now bereft of all his
                        children, hung over their bed in speechless anguish; not a groan or a tear
                        escaped from him, whilst he stood, two or three hours, in the same attitude,
                        looking at the dead bodies of his little darlings. (375)</quote> In these
                    examples, pathos is key, demonstrating Wollstonecraft’s theory that sentiment
                    can inspire genuine moral reformation, both in Mary and Caroline and in the
                    readers of <title level="m">Original Stories</title> (for these are also
                    presented to the readers as tales “<emph>from Real Life</emph>,” just as the
                    introduction presents Mary and Caroline as real little girls with a true
                    history). The rest of the collection continues in much the same vein: a failing
                    in the girls is identified, a lecture laced with religious instruction is given,
                    a “real life” story is told, and some sort of proof, often in the form of the
                    person himself or herself, is produced. Throughout <title level="m">Original
                        Stories</title>, the real person, place, or experience is consistently
                    portrayed as a force that supports the stories people tell. As in Smith’s
                    conception of the romance of real life, historical fact and storytelling are
                    complementary, rather than contradictory, concepts. Whenever Mrs Mason tells a
                    character’s history, real-life details ratify her version, and when those
                    stories are told, they are told in a manner that borrows conventions of romance
                    and sensibility to make the tale even more affecting, sympathetic, and thus
                    instructive. </p>
                <p> One aspect of Wollstonecraft’s work less present in Smith’s is the recurrent
                    preoccupation with religious duty and salvation, a characteristic that has
                    erroneously led many critics to align Wollstonecraft with the many religious
                    writers for children, including the aforementioned More and Trimmer, with whom
                    Wollstonecraft had nothing else in common (and quite a bit at odds). The fact
                    that the lessons Mrs Mason attempts to instill in Mary and Caroline are so often
                    related to questions of Christian virtue suggests another layer of meaning to
                    Wollstonecraft’s pedagogical aims. The idea that a book can be a vehicle for the
                    dissemination of life lessons of course suggests the Protestant belief in the
                    value of individual bible study, and Mrs Mason’s presentation to the girls of a
                    book full of stories meant to “[illustrate] the instruction it contains” is
                    clearly reminiscent of the New Testament. In fact, Mrs Mason herself is
                    frequently and insistently portrayed as a Christ figure whose stories redeem the
                    fallen girls, who are certainly no angels in the opening chapters. Even the
                    “contents” page, with its list of chapter titles like “The Inconveniences of
                    immoderate Indulgence” and “The Danger of Delay” suggests a collection of
                    sermons or biblical parables. Mrs Mason repeatedly stresses that the way to do
                    the most good in the world is by imitating God: <quote><lg>
                        <l>The greatest pleasure life affords [is] that of resembling God, by doing
                            good. (368)</l>
                        <l>You ought, by doing good, to imitate Him. (370)</l>
                        <l>I now daily contemplate His wonderful goodness; and, though at an awful
                            distance, try to imitate Him. (423)</l>
                        <l>We are His children when we try to resemble Him. (431)</l>
                    </lg></quote> William Blake clearly picks up on Mrs Mason’s messianic fervor when he
                    illustrates her in the frontispiece of the third edition with her arms spreading
                    over the heads of her young charges, simultaneously a mother hen sheltering her
                    brood and a Christ figure framed in a cross-like doorway, vines piercing her
                    outstretched palms (fig. 1). While the preface claims that children’s
                    introduction to true religion must come from a recognition of the “Universal
                    Father” whom they will then wish to imitate, we see the girls awed by the
                    all-seeing eye of their guardian and expressing a desire to imitate not God, but
                    Mrs Mason herself, the text’s divine substitute—“I wish to be a woman, said
                    Mary, and to be like Mrs Mason” (389). The idea that the real life of earthly
                    existence is but preparation for a heavenly home—that the “Most High is
                    educating us for eternity” (437)—lends an added urgency to the text’s stated
                    goal to “form the mind to truth <figure n="1">
                        <graphic url="/sites/default/files/imported/pedagogies/commons/romantic_education/images/bar_image1Thumb.jpg"/>

                    </figure> and goodness.” Patricia Demers claims that Evangelical writers like
                    Wollstonecraft’s near-contemporary Mary Martha Butt Sherwood—one of a group
                    Demers dubs “Romantic Evangelicals”—adopt a method of “seeing into the life of
                    things, without contradiction or irony” which is “simultaneously domestic and
                    eschatological” (131). As a result, <quote>Their characters’ zeal in finding and
                        defining an earthly home prompts their almost automatic longing for a
                        heavenly home. Theirs is a consciously double vision, glimpsing the eternal
                        in the natural, the sublime in the quotidian. (131)</quote> This “glimpsing
                    the eternal in the natural” is one of the activities that Wollstonecraft
                    repeatedly portrays Mrs Mason doing, and the idea that the text prepares one for
                    real life, which then in turn prepares one for eternal life, is one that the
                    character often trumpets. While there are some problems with aligning
                    Wollstonecraft too closely to a group of writers with which she has little in
                    common, the implication that Christianity yields a way of looking at real life
                    as a heavenly preamble is important to bear in mind when considering <title
                        level="m">Original Stories</title>, a book which repeatedly presents itself
                    as being concerned with Christian morality. The idea that real life is an
                    important pedagogical tool because its lessons help us not only to become better
                    citizens but also fit “to be angels hereafter,” with “a nobler employment in our
                    Father’s kingdom” (371-2) and that Mrs Mason’s real-life tales and illustrations
                    help Mary and Caroline not only to become better girls, but to become Christians
                    and, eventually, angels is quite a burden to attach to any one text. </p>
                <p>It is this idea of the “sublime in the quotidian” and the potentially salvific
                    powers of woman on which I would like to end by tying together the various
                    strains of ideology surrounding the blending of the genres of “real life” and
                    “romance,” “factual” and “imaginary,” that we have seen occurring in Smith’s and
                    Wollstonecraft’s texts. Even putting aside her many Christological qualities,
                    Mrs Mason is an extraordinary female character to emerge from the 1780s: an
                    independent landlord, munificent mistress, beloved pillar of her community, and
                    unwavering moral guide. Her strict yet maternal presence portrays her as
                    inhabiting what were in Wollstonecraft’s time two seemingly disparate spheres:
                    the mother/woman, and the serious moral agent. Myers argues that, in fact,
                    Wollstonecraft and her generation of writers for children (which would include
                    Smith, who published <title level="m">Rural Walks</title> only seven years after
                    the publication of <title level="m">Original Stories</title>) introduced the
                    idea of “everyday female heroism” and the notion of the “heroic potential
                    available in ordinary female life” (34; 50). Traditionally relegated to home and
                    garden, women writers found new sources of inspiration, and their production of
                    literature for children that reflected those sources spread them to the next
                    generation. From the sense of anxiety regarding women’s ability to address
                    historical fact and real life in serious literature sprang a hybrid genre that
                    allowed them not only to temper history with the attractiveness of romance but
                    also to elevate mere “romantic fiction” by infusing it with realism, turning it
                    into something that can address history, society, and all aspects of “real
                    life,” and, due in part to a changing cultural climate that put women in the
                    position of educators, act as a pedagogical tool. There is a clear correlation
                    between this experimentation with realism in the last decades of the eighteenth
                    century and the development of the national tale in the early nineteenth,
                    another hybrid genre that mixes romance and history, pioneered by women writers
                    like Sydney Owenson (<title level="m">The Wild Irish Girl: A National
                        Tale</title>; 1806) and Jane Porter (<title level="m">The Scottish
                        Chiefs</title>; 1809). By the time Sir Walter Scott “invented” the
                    historical novel with <title level="m">Waverly</title> in 1814, he could draw on
                    a rich tradition of texts in which the romantic and the realistic coalesced, a
                    combination that has at its core the generic experimentations of women like
                    Smith and Wollstonecraft.</p>
