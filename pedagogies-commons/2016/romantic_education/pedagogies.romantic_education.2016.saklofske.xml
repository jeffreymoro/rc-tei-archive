            This paper discusses the outcomes of a multi-year project to engage undergraduate students in active and constructive encounters with Romantic period themes and contexts via web-based, multi-user gamespaces. Interactive, participatory learning environments, akin to humanities “lab” spaces where controlled experimentation and exploration can take place, encourage students to innovate, create, share, and play together. This pedagogical strategy engages students with the complexities, advantages, and difficulties faced by the intersection of independent and interdependent approaches to creativity, communication, and action during the Romantic period, allowing them to become performatively involved in experiential situations (as players/classroom citizens and as builders/authors) that reflect the thematic issues that they are studying.

                    <head>Introduction: Setting the Stage</head>
                    <p>Romantic-period literature frequently asserts individual selves against
                        traditional subjectivities. Various characters, including unacknowledged
                        poetic geniuses, orphans, Byronic misanthropes, humanized gods, godlike
                        everymen, and tragic last men have collectively contributed to the
                        individualistic stereotypes at the heart of the ideal and ideological
                        notions of Romanticism that have followed us into the twenty-first century.
                        This literary litany of self-reflexive lyrics, esoteric compositions, and
                        fictional caricatures associate independence with individualism in ways that
                        eclipse the presence of collaborative, collective and creative
                            <emph>interdependence</emph> during the Romantic era. Moreso than lonely
                        creative voices, collective movements towards new subjectivities and
                        subjective categorizations, driven by a dissenting, interdependent spirit of
                        independence, permeated the revolutionary politics and inventive,
                        collaborative aesthetics of this period in British history. Samuel Taylor
                        Coleridge recognized this in “The Nightingale” (1798), which deconstructs
                        the impossible-to-sustain idea of loneliness, independence and solitude
                        among a community of warbling poets: “But never elsewhere in one place I
                        knew / So many Nightingales: and far and near / In wood and thicket over the
                        wide grove / They answer and provoke each other’s songs” (55-58). </p>
                    <p>This fundamental tension between collectivist and individualist pursuits of
                        independence and the implicit acknowledgement of the necessity and
                        inevitability of larger-scale interdependencies and collaborations is an
                        essential characteristic of the period that needs to be more emphatically
                        conveyed to undergraduate-level students. Indeed, countering a false sense
                        of insular individualism and exposing the ironies of idealizing “freedom”
                        from within a legal, social contract is necessary to fully understand the
                        relationship between literature and politics in this period as well as to
                        comprehend twenty-first century political beliefs and cultural practice.
                        Asking undergraduates to challenge individualistic ideals is essential
                        within arts and humanities programs, which continue to perpetuate a
                        misleading Romantic ideal of the scholar as a competitively independent and
                        exclusive individual genius. In a manner that replicates the state of our
                        individualist professional practice, publication, and promotional
                        evaluation, many university-level literature programs (at both the
                        undergraduate and graduate level) offer classroom and program environments
                        for students that discourage interdependent activities and accomplishments
                        even though most faculty members must adopt collaborative and integrative
                        practices in order to navigate everyday teaching, service, and research
                        situations. To leave students unprepared for the promises and pitfalls of
                        communal scholarly practice and mutual imposition is to leave them
                        unprepared for the collaborative world that awaits them after their degree
                        is earned.</p>

                    <head>MOOspace: Choosing an appropriate arena</head>
                    <p>To encourage the collaboration so necessary in today’s workforce and, more
                        importantly, to help students confront the interdependent cultures,
                        aesthetics, and politics of the Romantic era, I have appealed to the
                        supplementary use of multiplayer online environments, which allow students
                        to inhabit various social contexts rather than just abstractly understand
                        them. These virtual spaces, like literary settings, offer an imaginary arena
                        to showcase human drama. The difference between these environments and the
                        worlds created through literary expression (and some traditional classroom
                        practices) is that the player directly participates in the narrative, and
                        players, unlike readers, can dream together in real-time, in the same space.
                        While books can simulate such environments through representation, novels
                        from this period do not enable readers to become characters in their
                        stories, nor do they promote collaborative interactions between readers in
                        bookspace. Designing specific stories and contexts for students to
                        experience within these multi-user environments encourages co-operative
                        play, inviting them not only to negotiate the tension between independence
                        and collaborative life in the eighteenth century, but also to learn in a
                        different way than they usually do in the humanities. Supplementing a
                        traditional classroom space in which they are largely independent operators
                        with the collaborative humanities laboratory of the multi-user gamespace is
                        a worthwhile educational intervention. While many other collaborative
                        classroom activities could be leveraged to encourage the same results
                        without relying on computer and online technologies, this particular
                        approach offers additional, valuable, and marketable learning experiences to
                        humanities students regarding scripting, problem solving through program
                        design and environment planning, order of operations, and working in a
                        digital environment in general.</p>
                    <p>Digital gamespaces offer unique opportunities for designers and players: the
                        designer is able to write the rules by which the story appears, as well as
                        planning the story arc(s) (what Janet Murray calls procedural authorship
                        (152)). Murray states that “the procedural author creates not just a set of
                        scenes, but a world of narrative possibilities” (153), which is akin to a
                        constructivist facilitation—a useful alternative to traditional teaching
                        methods in which students are handed pre-rendered narrative syllabi and
                        expected to follow along with the expert lecturer. Ian Bogost’s <title
                            level="m">Persuasive Games</title> (2007) extends this idea by
                        recognizing that games employ a procedural rhetoric (i.e. persuasion through
                        the authorship of rules of behavior, through a dynamic model). Players are
                        required to contribute actively to their own progress within specific
                        experiential fields in which choices and consequences have been pre-rendered
                        for them. These affordances contribute to a rhetorical opportunity that can
                        help to facilitate player identification with a designer-author’s intentions
                        and ideas via performative participation.</p>
                    <p>The gamespaces that I have been using to engage undergraduate students with
                        these ideas are hosted within a somewhat outdated environment as far as
                        multiplayer game opportunities go, but which avoids obsolescence by
                        remaining configurable, affordable, and textual. Acadia University’s
                        gamespaces are built within enCore Xpress, an open-source MOO database and
                        graphical user interface.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> A descriptive
                            tutorial for students that discusses the purpose of MOOs and describes
                            how to use Acadia’s version of this environment was created by Jean-Marc
                            Giffin and can be found <ref

                        many readers, a brief history and explanation follows: MUDs (Multi-user
                        Dungeons) appeared in the late 1970s and were the first multi-user online
                        gamespaces. They used a text-based “chat room” interface to involve a number
                        of simultaneous, networked computer users in role-playing situations within
                        described environments that resembled early single-player text-adventure
                        games like <title level="m">Zork</title>. As MUDs evolved, ASCII graphics
                        were added to some versions and their virtual spaces were harnessed by some
                        users for educational ends. MOOs (MUD Object Oriented), the evolutionary
                        cousins of MUDs, were born in the early 1990s and retained the text-based
                        environment of MUDs but used an object-oriented programming language and a
                        persistent object database to extend the flexibility and opportunities
                        offered by MUD environments. Uniquely, users could also construct virtual
                        environments from within those spaces via simple commands that eliminated
                        the need for high-level programming knowledge. <note place="foot"

                        open-source accessibility, web-based aspect, multimedia opportunities, and
                        programmability of the enCore Xpress MOO influenced my decision to utilize
                        it for the purpose of delivering “serious,” multi-user games to my
                        undergraduate Romantic-period literature students as part of their classroom
                        experience.</p>
                    <p>Acadia University’s modified version of enCore Xpress, called Golgonooza
                        (Blake’s city of the imagination), enables the creation and use of
                        multiplayer, goal-oriented, persuasive role-playing games in my
                        undergraduate classrooms. Its focused purpose and more developed toolkit
                        takes it beyond the now defunct <title level="m">Romantic Circles
                            MOO</title> (Villa Diodati), which also used encore Xpress and which has
                        no true pedagogical successor on the RC website. Golgonooza is also distinct
                        from other computer-assisted pedagogical innovations. For example, Roger
                        Whitson’s “William Blake and Media” class engaged students via Twitter,
                        Zotero, and blogging activities, but none of these (individually or
                        collectively) achieves the community and role-playing potential of enCore
                        Xpress’ interactive story-world environment. </p>
                    <p>I have installed two versions of the encore MOO on Acadia’s servers. The
                        first (<ref target="http://moo.acadiau.ca:7000"
                            >http://moo.acadiau.ca:7000</ref>) is based on version 4 of enCore
                        Xpress. This database (named Golgonooza) hosts a hardcoded gamespace based
                        on the environments featured in Mary Robinson’s novel <title level="m">The
                            Natural Daughter</title> (1799). This game was designed by Beth Lyons (a
                        former theatre undergraduate student), Jean-Marc Giffin (a former
                        undergraduate Computer Science student at Acadia), and me. The other MOO
                        installation (named Golgonooza 2.0 and found at <ref
                            target="http://moo.acadiau.ca:7001">http://moo.acadiau.ca:7001</ref>)
                        has been customized to host persuasive arguments in the form of interactive
                        digital gamespaces that are created by students in my year-long,
                        undergraduate Romantic-period literature course. </p>
                    <p>Both Acadia versions of enCore Xpress have been extensively customized
                        through a collaborative effort between myself and Jean-Marc Giffin.
                        Together, we have designed and implemented a few unique affordances that
                        distinguish Golgonooza 2.0 from other installations of enCore Xpress: our
                        modified version of enCore features a game design toolkit that uses a GUI to
                        allow the user to create a system of navigable, interconnected locations and
                        to populate those locations with objects and non-player character bots that
                        can “converse” with the player. Entrances and exits can be customized to
                        facilitate one-way travel, to defy the logic of compass-based navigation, or
                        to be invisible until players receive certain objects or information.
                        Objects, characters and locations can be customized and augmented through
                        textual descriptions, audio, images and video. NPCs (non-player characters)
                        can be static or programmed to wander on random or scripted paths throughout
                        the gameworld. Interactions with NPC’s are managed through conversation tree
                        scripts. Different scripts can be written for different interactions (based
                        on the player’s class or gender), and this scripting can be used to give
                        NPC’s “memories” of previous encounters with the player (Figure 1).</p>

                    <p>Golgonooza’s <title level="m">The Natural Daughter</title> game is not a
                        simple re-presentation of Robinson’s narrative or characters but is meant to
                        question critically the individualistic triumph promoted by the novel’s
                        overly optimistic conclusion and to raise questions about the tensions
                        between realism and idealism in literature of the period. In other words, it
                        builds upon the cultural critique begun but left unfinished in Robinson in
                        order to help students perceive in a more robust and visceral fashion how
                        late eighteenth-century social hierarchies and mores constrained
                        individuals. After reading and discussing Robinson’s novel over a few weeks
                        of class time, groups of two or three students log into the MOO environment
                        using a single user account. The members of each team collaboratively
                        contribute to their single character’s progress in a role-playing game that
                        positions them as a woman in late-eighteenth-century England. Students are
                        told that their goal is to become a “successful young woman.” This goal is
                        intentionally vague, and remains open for interpretation, allowing the
                        student teams to consider “success” in relation to the historical period
                        that is being represented, to the parameters modeled in Robinson’s book
                        (perseverance and ethical consistency against universal adversity), or to
                        twenty-first century notions of “success” (such as self-determination,
                        empowerment, independence, and equal opportunity). By collaboratively
                        controlling a single character’s movement and dialogue, each team of student
                        players are put in situations where they (playing as eighteenth-century
                        women) experience social life at Bath, the difficulties of married (or
                        single) life in rural and urban situations, and London’s opportunities and
                        temptations.</p>
                    <p>Importantly, each player character’s class and social status are randomized
                        variables that can change with each new playthrough. One’s class position
                        initially establishes a specific level (or deficit) of social freedom and
                        flexibility in the gameworld, and a player’s initial reputation (based on
                        such social stereotypes) generates different responses and opportunities (or
                        not) from other, non-player characters and the environment itself.
                        Reputation remains a variable throughout the experience, though, and can be
                        sullied or redeemed by one’s actions and choices while interacting with the
                        game’s selection of fickle characters. Players quickly learn that whatever
                        initial position they have in the gameworld as a result of their social
                        class is precarious and that any interaction within such unstable
                        environments can easily lead to a reduction, maintenance, or augmentation of
                        this reputation. Thus, like Martha, the protagonist in Robinson’s novel,
                        players often find themselves negotiating between individualistic ambitions
                        and selfish desires, as well as between social responsibilities and
                        co-operative sympathies. </p>
                    <p>What makes this experience more than just a participatory replay of the
                        book’s narrative is that players cannot succeed by twenty-first-century
                        standards, and, given that they are not allowed to replicate the success of
                        the novel’s idealistic conclusion, in which Martha’s individualistic
                        determination allows her to persevere through hyperbolic adversity and marry
                        the “right” man, they cannot succeed by Robinson’s Romantic standards
                        either. The “best” ending that a player can achieve is to be married to a
                        husband who provides financial stability but little emotional support. The
                        character becomes stuck in a type of limbo where she is faced with few
                        opportunities, growing ennui, and a husband who dismisses her as if she was
                        another one of his servants. This particular end in the game does not equal
                        freedom, but is the achievement of a sort of life-in-death that recalls the
                        personal Hell experienced by Coleridge’s ancient mariner (though the mariner
                        still possessed the poetic power to affect others and could still tell his
                        tale, whereas the players of this game are much more disabled). Achieving
                        such ends exposes student-players to circumstances that parallel the
                        experiences of women in late-eighteenth-century England: any accomplishment
                        is still circumscribed by the rules and inherent limitations of a largely
                        unsympathetic and restrictive system. Overall, then, this game encourages
                        students to performatively interrogate and problematize the kind of
                        individualistic strategy that Robinson’s protagonist chooses, but it also
                        raises questions about the nature and limits of interdependence in this
                        period. The game world and its rule systems are mechanical, unsympathetic,
                        and frustrating for the idealistic player, and limited choices masquerading
                        as freedom reveal the difficulty of choosing one’s own adventure in a
                        consequential universe.</p>
                    <p>This circumscribed setup allows students to empathize with the cultural
                        milieu in which Martha operates, as well as to consider the broader
                        emotional aims of narrative itself. Given that most commercially available
                        digital games cater to the pleasure of the player (and consumer), students
                        familiar with this storytelling medium will be surprised that this example
                        takes an antagonistic position toward the player’s success. Yet, this
                        frustration is instructive, as it teaches greater awareness of both the
                        cultural limitations within Romantic-era society and of the amelioration
                        afforded by narrative, both then and now. This game enacts Katie Salen’s and
                        Eric Zimmerman’s useful definition of “play” (“free movement within a more
                        rigid structure” (304)) quite literally, demonstrating in its story and in
                        its mechanics that: <list type="ordered">
                            <item> Limited flexibility is not freedom.</item>
                            <item>The player, like a reader, is not authoritative, despite the
                                deceptive appearance of agency and choice within game systems. </item>
                            <item>Digital games can be used for social, political and psychological
                                confrontations as well as for escape. </item>
                        </list> This experience also presents a challenge to and rejection of the
                        often solitary nature of gameplay, scholarship, and the privacy of
                        traditional readership by asking a group of students to be responsible for a
                        single avatar’s progress. Team-based play continually engages players in
                        dialogue, collaboration, and co-operation as they work through individual
                        differences for the good of their single player-character. </p>
                    <p>In the last four years of using this game in my undergraduate Romantic-period
                        literature classroom, I have found that students still have “fun” with this
                        game (and here I rely on Raph Koster’s definition of “fun” as the opposite
                        of boring (42)), but are not satisfied with the experience due to their
                        unrealistic expectations for success generated by Robinson’s novel. This
                        attests to the effectiveness of game-based pedagogy, as the purpose behind
                        the creation and implementation of these game experiences is not to
                        entertain the students, but to facilitate a memorable learning experience by
                        generating a dissonance between expectation and experience in a supportive
                        classroom environment. Postmortem discussions with students have resulted in
                        excellent opportunities to comparatively examine the social function of the
                        novel in the Romantic period. For example, the idealism and sentimentalism
                        that problematize Robinson’s proto-feminist narrative are exposed and
                        questioned though the contrasting pessimism built into the game’s world. The
                        fact that both novel and game explore the relationship between independent
                        motivations and intentions enacted within interdependent environments
                        creates an important thematic link, which fuels classroom discussions. The
                        key here is that student-players encounter and critically examine Robinson’s
                        novel through traditional classroom lectures, discussions and debates, but
                            <emph>also</emph> augment and enrich such experience by performatively
                        negotiating with and metacritically engaging with Robinson’s ideas within a
                        multiplayer gamespace. Making use of simulated experiences and follow-up
                        discussions about those experiences fosters extended learning opportunities
                        that supplement the existing opportunities that come from a critical reading
                        of the novel. Any dissatisfaction and reluctance that might accompany the
                        use of the technology, amplified by the game’s inherent difficulty, creates
                        an overall environment of frustration, an arena in which players are brought
                        closer to an understanding not only of women’s growing dissatisfaction
                        during this period of burgeoning individualism in British history, but also
                        of the philosophical, psychological and social paradoxes that reside at the
                        heart of the period’s uncertain cultural expressions.</p>

                    <head>Endgame: Playing with Fiction</head>
                    <p>Games are not “ethics-free” environments. Like novels, they are virtual
                        spaces in which human beings are exposed to the consequences of action and
                        conflict within larger social, political, and economic systems. Games allow
                        readers to become players, which generates the potential for sympathetic
                        understanding, empathetic engagement, and a chance to experience the ways
                        that an environment is impacted by their choices in the safe, non-fatal
                        frame of a classroom activity. This interactive narrative challenges the
                        period’s fiction and the students’ perceptions of that fiction within
                        equally fictional environments. It engages students in thoughtful play that
                        lifts the painted veil from romantic mediations via a game-based
                            <foreign>mise en abyme</foreign> that exposes the limits of fictionally
                        constructed expectation and places the player in a persistent tension
                        between independent and interdependent action that is not achieved through
                        reading alone. In contrast to the idea that digital games promote
                        thoughtless reflex and complicity within pre-rendered systems, it is
                        possible to use such environments to generate an essential lucidity and
                        experiential unease that catalyzes <emph>thought-full</emph> awareness and
                        critical reflections. Questioning the limits and opportunities of fictions
                        and mediating structures from within such fictions and structures is the
                        ultimate aim of such play. </p>
                    <p>It could be argued that one does not need to appeal to technology to achieve
                        such pedagogical ends. Traditional group work, staged debates, role-playing
                        exercises and even custom-developed tabletop games could all be harnessed to
                        produce a similar effect. This is certainly true, but my overall point is
                        that the <title level="m">Natural Daughter</title> MOO game has generated
                        useful in-class discussions regarding general ideas, such as comparing the
                        technological aspects of book-based and computer-based storytelling and the
                        position and power of readers versus players. More specifically, though,
                        this experience never fails to catalyze engaging discussions that apply
                        Romantic-period contexts to students’ understanding of themselves and their
                        contemporary experiences. In addition to a heated debate about the way that
                        eighteenth-century novels and twenty-first-century digital games have both
                        been accused of individually isolating and socially networking their
                        audiences, I have also witnessed a lengthy classroom discussion regarding
                        the parallels between the way that inventive and innovative experimentation
                        in the Romantic period diversified the creative landscape but led to
                        tensions between imagination and nostalgia, and the ways that revolutionary
                        transitions in our current media landscape interrupt our habits and generate
                        similar reactions. However, the most important learning opportunity that
                        emerges from utilizing such digital gamespaces in the Romantics classroom
                        appears when student players are asked to become builders within the MOO
                        environment.</p>

                    <head>Programmers: Extending collaborative creativity from players to
                        builders</head>
                    <p>In my year-long undergraduate Romantics course, the use of the MOO platform
                        is extended towards a completely different end in the second term: it
                        becomes an environment in which students complete a group assignment that
                        asks them to collaboratively build a persuasive, rhetorically argumentative
                        gamespace related to specific course readings. To turn students from readers
                        (consumers) to players (participants) to builders (creators) is to empower
                        them and to promote an understanding of the ways that media can shape
                        understanding and action. This project is a twenty-first-century extension
                        of the revolutionary kinds of media-based awareness and agency that creators
                        and consumers were experiencing in the Romantic period.</p>
                    <p>To make room for this project in the syllabus, I replace two essay
                        assignments (out of the six that I normally assign) with a digital game
                        development project in which students collaboratively design and build
                        non-linear, interactive narrative gamespaces within the MOO using a simple
                        but robust GUI (Graphical User Interface) developer toolkit. This is
                        beneficial because it introduces students to programming structures through
                        the customization of branching story opportunities and the population of a
                        virtual environment with scripted NPC conversation “bots,” and objects, but
                        does not require them to learn a programming language to accomplish this. By
                        simplifying the tools available to students through the use of a GUI, I can
                        expose them to modding and customizing practices that involve branching
                        narrative scripts without bottlenecking their potential to deliver a rich,
                        collaborative result (see figures 2 and 3).</p>

                    <p>The normal vehicle for student work and evaluation in undergraduate
                        humanities courses is—of course—the rhetorical essay. While this is a
                        tried-and-true method of critical expression, and one that I continue to use
                        in my Romantics classes, the essay is only one form of argumentative
                        communication, and students—unfortunately—learn to take the form for granted
                        at the same time as they become more proficient at adapting their ideas to
                        its formal constraints. Moreover, the essay format offers a time-limited
                        value, as many students will enter a workplace that requires them to
                        communicate in multimedia formats. Our increasingly diverse media landscape,
                        amplified by the accessibility of digital technologies, has established an
                        urgent educational need for multiple and integrated media literacies,
                        transmedia awareness, and a working, hands-on knowledge of comparative media
                        and cultural studies ideas and practices. Although consuming and thinking
                        about class material is important, the productive and creative energies
                        generated in response to such material should not have to be exclusively
                        limited to traditional paradigms. Although the novelty of inserting a game
                        development process into an upper-level undergraduate course disconcerts
                        many students who feel that they have already mastered the algorithms at the
                        heart of undergraduate assignments, it is in essence a refreshing
                        opportunity for students to reconsider exactly what an essay does and how it
                        accomplishes its persuasive argumentation in comparison to a playable space
                        in which players need to be directed toward an acceptance of the same ideas
                        as essay readers.</p>
                    <p> At the beginning of January, students receive the project briefing and the
                        required development timeline (see figure 4).</p>
                    <figure n="4">

                    </figure>
                    <p>Early on, students are reminded that “Your players will not be playing a game
                        based on a poem, play, or novel, but will progress through an experiential
                        architecture that performatively exposes them to an argument relating to
                        that literary work.” In other words, these games possess the same
                        argumentative function as a traditional essay, but students need to import
                        and adapt familiar forms and functions of rhetorical communication to a
                        radically different environment. While part of rhetorical writing is to
                        encourage one’s reader to keep reading, and while the act of reading implies
                        at least a willingness to engage with the author’s ideas, the reading
                        process is not as participatory (or as potentially powerful) as a player’s
                        progress: whereas readers (in most cases) simply watch the author build a
                        rhetorically sound argumentative structure and populate it with proof,
                        players are asked to build the structure and gather the proof themselves, as
                        directed by the game designer. Such participatory preconditions offer an
                        advantage to game designers who are trying to encourage certain actions,
                        behaviors, or beliefs in their players. As a result, games have the
                        potential to be an extremely effective rhetorical medium: staging a
                        convincing argument by leading a player through an active and concrete
                        construction process, rather than—as is often done in essay
                        writing—abstractly narrating such construction to a largely passive but
                        still critical observer. </p>
                    <p>The grading rubric for this assignment calls attention to tensions and
                        reconciliations between independent and interdependent work, expanding the
                        thematic explorations from the gameplay that students experienced in the
                        first term by putting students in situations where they must accommodate
                        their individual differences to a collaborative working environment.
                        Individual student assessment is based on a combination of individual
                        contributions and group grades. This approach is specifically designed so
                        that students must depend equally on their own abilities and their group’s
                        performance (preventing an over-reliance on either). Productively, it allows
                        students who might feel restrained by their group’s performance to augment
                        such shortcomings by asserting their individual abilities, and conversely
                        allows students who might lack such individual genius to assert their
                        competency in group-related activities. In this way, collaboration,
                        co-operation, and selfless reliance are fundamentally encouraged by this
                        project: no one student could possibly complete the requirements on their
                        own, so groups are responsible for self-organization and the delegation and
                        management of roles and responsibilities (with guidance and mentorship from
                        me during the process). Over the four years of incorporating this into my
                        curriculum, I have discovered that letting go of individual control is very
                        difficult for some of these students, as many have never been exposed to
                        substantial collaborative, graded work at the university level. Actively
                        confronting complexities together through building and making things (rather
                        than just reacting to already-built things) while avoiding reductive and
                        idealistic activities performatively reinforces the model of creative and
                        critical networking at the heart of Romantic-period invention.</p>
                    <p>This assignment in which players become part of a community of builders who
                        collaboratively work towards the same goal involves individualistic
                        capabilities in a co-operative sphere, performatively engaging students in a
                        synthesis of independent thinking and interdependent practice. In this way,
                        students are more directly exposed to the opportunities and difficulties
                        that arose during Romantic period collaborations fuelled by independent
                        energies, such as the invention of the <title level="m">Lyrical
                            Ballads</title> or the creation of the French <title level="m"
                            >Declaration of The Rights of Man and of the Citizen.</title> Such an
                        experience does not just provide students with a chance to learn about the
                        connection between independence and interdependence during this historical
                        period; it <emph>involves</emph> them in experiential situations (as
                        players/classroom citizens and as builders/authors) that allow them to more
                        directly understand the intersections between collaborative challenges and
                        individual inspirations experienced by Romantic period writers.</p>

                    <head>Extensions: Golgonooza will never be finished</head>
                    <p>In the first year that I introduced gameplay to the class, student groups
                        could choose to focus on creating a critical interpretative argument
                        relating to Byron’s “Manfred,” Jane Austen’s <title level="m">Northanger
                            Abbey</title>, or Coleridge’s “Kubla Khan” or “The Rime of the Ancient
                        Mariner.” Notably, the “Kubla Khan” group used their gamespace to question
                        Coleridge’s imaginative theories and visions through unsettling situations
                        and unpredictable NPCs while still allowing the player to indulge in them.
                        Their game expanded on and also offered a critical perception of “Kubla
                        Khan”’s thematic possibilities, its drug-fuelled origins, and its
                        fragmentary nature. While certain groups and individuals performed more
                        strongly and effectively in this assignment’s first iteration, all students
                        were able to bring individual strengths to bear on their collaborative
                        creations, resulting in richly realized environments, characters, and
                        narratives.</p>
                    <p>In an effort to create an opportunity for idea exchanges between groups (not
                        just within them), the second year of this assignment’s implementation
                        focused on a single author. I asked students to select one of Keats’s 1819
                        odes and to create a persuasive gamespace that allowed the player
                        performatively to engage with a critical argument made by the design group
                        about their chosen ode. Additionally (unlike the previous year’s
                        selections), the odes that students chose for their projects were not part
                        of the course curriculum and were not taught or discussed in class, thus
                        offering the students a greater level of independence in the interpretative
                        process. </p>
                    <p>During the 2012-2013 academic year and inspired by the conference version of
                        this paper presented at NASSR 2011, I further refined the assignment beyond
                        a focus on individual literary works, asking student groups to establish an
                        argument in gamespace that asserted a conclusive thesis about the thematic
                        tensions between independence and interdependence in Romantic-period
                        writing, choosing literary examples from the course syllabus. Unifying all
                        of the student groups under this thematic banner allowed for a post-mortem
                        that related more specifically to the larger course themes and also allowed
                        students to draw from on their own experience during the assignment’s
                        creation and completion to inform their in-game argument. </p>
                    <p>Last year, I drew from class discussions that questioned the absence of
                        specifically targeted “duties” and responsibilities within the National
                        Assembly of France’s 1789 <title level="m">Declaration of the Rights of Man
                            and of the Citizen</title> by asking students to create a game-based
                        argument that explored the tension between rights and duties during the
                        Romantic period. This year, I have asked students to extend the debate
                        between Thomas Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, William Godwin, and Edmund Burke
                        relating to the distinction between people and principles. After this year’s
                        work is complete, the Golgonooza 2.0 MOO will host five years’ worth of
                        student projects. Unlike essay assignments that generally trace a single
                        line of communication between professor and student in a very specific and
                        limited temporal frame, all of the student work in the MOO remains archived
                        and publically accessible.</p>

                    <p>Some students vehemently oppose the nature of this assignment, as well as the
                        requirement that they work in groups (thus subjecting their course grades to
                        the influence of variable group dynamics). During the first year’s
                        assignment one student, who consistently refused to work as a member of a
                        team, complained to my Department Chair that this non-traditional assignment
                        was threatening to disrupt his accrued GPA and was not why he was taking
                        English literature courses. During the second year of the assignment,
                        another student decided to disappear for the duration of the project, but
                        continued to log into the gamespace toolkit and re-design (or vandalize) his
                        teammates’ efforts with ideas that he had not discussed with his group. This
                        vandalism became so disruptive that I removed him from the team, and he
                        dropped the course soon after. These extreme reactions are exceptions, but
                        are also a reminder that issues relating to collaboration in creative and
                        social contexts during the Romantic period remain relevant to young,
                        creative minds in the twenty-first century. The MOO and the assignments
                        constructed around the use of such a gamespace allow students to become
                        performatively involved in the thematic issues that they are studying. Their
                        varying reactions (excitement, curiosity, resistance, and discomfort) to new
                        experiences near the end of an undergraduate career resist the abstraction
                        and depersonalization at the heart of much academic work while at the same
                        time allowing them to experience collaboration before confronting it in a
                        professional setting post graduation. </p>
                    <p>Student feedback has convinced me of the overall value and necessity of this
                        sort of experience for the Romanticism classroom. Without fail, all
                        participants (even those who enjoy game-based narratives) chronicle an
                        initial discomfort related to the unfamiliar nature of the assignment and
                        technology that is slowly replaced by engagement with their group and
                        project. Since university learning should be safe yet uncomfortable (as
                        student comfort indicates that education is merely reinforcing their
                        accepted and habitual subject position rather than challenging it), it
                        appears that working in groups is a necessary, supportive, and helpful
                        antidote to students’ individual discomfort. While some students—such as
                        those mentioned in the above paragraph—consistently have problems with
                        giving up total control of the assignment to others, most students express a
                        significant amount of satisfaction with the process, the product, and the
                        way that this world-building exercise resonates with Romantic-period
                        preoccupations and projects. One student commented that the unique nature of
                        this project “shook up the university slump” she felt that she had been in
                        during the final years of her program and was thankful that it allowed her
                        to express herself “in a different way.” This cleansing of blunted
                        perceptions via unsettling and unfamiliar situations that call for
                        revolutionary and imaginative processes exposes students to the ways and
                        means that a number of Romantic period “builders” creatively reacted to the
                        tumultuous here and now of England in the late eighteenth century.</p>

                    <head>Technological Obsolescence: Game Over?</head>
                    <p>Many instructors who are reluctant to integrate digital apparatuses into
                        their pedagogical toolkit cite the short-lived nature of hardware, software,
                        and compatibility. Investing a considerable amount of time in the
                        development of a tool or exercise, only to discover that it is incompatible
                        with many students’ machines within a few years of implementation,
                        understandably discourages enthusiastic innovation. However, this risk is
                        worth taking, as using writing to reflect on writing can easily become an
                        insular and uncritical process. As Jerome McGann suggests in <title
                            level="m">Radiant Textuality: Literature After the World Wide
                            Web</title> (2004), “We no longer have to use books to study other books
                        or texts” (168). The enCore Xpress platform was selected for flexibility and
                        longevity, given its web-based delivery and its relative stability as a
                        database, and our modified versions have successfully been migrated across
                        servers at Acadia during infrastructure reconfigurations. Nonetheless, the
                        MOO is no Grecian Urn—the “chat” frame of the webpage that the MOO generates
                        relies on Java, which is becoming less common and thus less supported (and
                        usually blocked by default) by most web browsers. As a result, students have
                        had increasing technical difficulties using the MOO platform on their laptop
                        computers over the past two years. Most of the time these issues can be
                        solved by adding exceptions for certain websites within the Java
                        configuration program and within particular browsers. </p>
                    <p> While rapid obsolescence is a constant problem for digital tools and
                        resources, there are potential ways to work around this problem. We are
                        currently looking into ways either to convert the MOO's Java-based frame into
                        HTML, or—in the worst case scenario—to create a Virtual Machine “wrapper”
                        (that is, to allow students to easily boot and run an older version of Linux
                        with better compatibility with Java on their computers as a virtual
                        machine). However, it is likely that the MOO will soon need to be retired and
                        replaced. The crucial thing is not to abandon the ideas and methods that the
                        technology enables. Unlike the now-defunct <title level="m">Villa
                            Diodati</title> MOO that has fallen into inaccessible ruins, with only
                        its vast and trunkless introductory page standing as a reminder that there
                        was ever something there, Golgonooza will never truly be a ghost town: it
                        will continue to be an activated complex, an organic archive of the fruits
                        of exceptional student motivation and imagination and a valuable record of a
                        learning process that will continue to grow until more effective
                        alternatives emerge. One possible extension of this idea beyond the computer
                        screen and classroom walls that I am currently exploring is open source
                        game-based narrative platforms for mobile devices that work by tethering
                        game content to actual geographies in an augmented reality layer. When such
                        alternatives become feasible, and as computer hardware, software and
                        networks continue to evolve, I will continue to ensure that both versions of
                        the Golgonooza MOO remain archived and accessible to the broader scholarly
                        community. </p>

                    <head>Revolutionary returns: Teaching nightingales to harmonize and
                        socialize</head>
                    <p>Attempting to engage students with the complexities, advantages, and
                        difficulties faced by the intersection of independent and interdependent
                        approaches to creativity, communication, and action during the Romantic
                        period is not an easy task. Showing and telling methods are easy, but they
                        leave learners disconnected from the ideas that are presented to them.
                        Exposing them to historical contexts and thematic intricacies via
                        interactive, participatory learning environments offers a uniquely involved
                        opportunity—akin to a humanities “lab” space where controlled
                        experimentation and exploration can take place. Making use of this
                        technology for the specific assignments mentioned above has an additional
                        benefit: students learn to innovate, create, share, and play together and
                        are thus professionalized for a collaborative career. Involving them in
                        team-based work that respects individual differences demonstrates an
                        integrative approach to such apparent opposition without watering down the
                        difficulty associated with both poles. These examples of
                        technologically-enabled pedagogy ask students to be less “romantic” about
                        the Romantic period and to recognise the interplay and tension between
                        individual genius/independence and collaborative practice/interdependency at
                        the heart of the lives and texts of the period’s authors.</p>
                    <p>Finally, to get students to reflect on the nature of the academic essay and
                        argument by exposing them to an unfamiliar variation of this process is an
                        invaluable lesson to learn in the latter years of an undergraduate
                        education, when many of the paradigms of higher education have become
                        habitual and naturalised. In doing so, students are able to reconsider the
                        essay’s form and function, perceive its limitations and advantages, and
                        better understand their authorial, critical roles in relation to the
                        abilities of their readers. If my goal as an educator is to mentor students
                        toward a thoughtful, perceptive, and critical lucidity regarding literary
                        expression, communication, creativity, cultural production, and critical
                        dialogue, then—whether or not students emerge from this experience hating
                        the assignments (in which case an appreciation for the strengths of the
                        essay form is renewed) or loving this alternative to essay argumentation (in
                        which case an awareness of the limitations of the essay form is
                        revealed)—the careful use of these gamespaces in the university-level
                        classroom allows me to reach these goals, confront the challenges associated
                        with effective teaching and specific course material, and “win” the
                        pedagogical game by encouraging individual student players to level-up and
                        become lucid, collaborative builders in the spirit of the Romantic period
                        authors that they study. </p>
