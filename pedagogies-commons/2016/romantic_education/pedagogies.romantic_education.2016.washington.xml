            The following essay replays a close-reading, word-by-word in-class exercise of <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>'s opening sentence: "It is a truth universally acknowledged that single men in possession of good fortunate must be in want of a wife." In our close reading students and I explore how, in Austen's hands, her famed use of free indirect discourse and irony deflate transcendental assumptions about gender and class. With this deflationary gesture, Austen’s turning of these tropes allows us to see, in turn, how her work connects to the biopolitical imperative to extend the lifespan of the human species that Foucault sees emerging in the eighteenth century. On our reading, though, irony, as developed by Austen, provides a powerful tool for questioning such an imperative in our own time of planetary peril.

                <p>Jane Austen’s <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> (1813) begins with
                    what sounds like a fairly straightforward aphorism: “It is a truth universally
                    acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want
                    of a wife” (Austen 1). This essay discusses how a word-by-word, in-class close
                    reading of this first sentence unfolds historical and formal problems of
                    Romanticism. In our close reading, students and I attend to the opposition of
                    the universal to the particular in the sentence by thinking about how Austen
                    theorizes irony.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Two recent editions offer a
                        variety of different approaches and resources to teaching Austen. See
                        Bridget Draxler’s, Misty Krueger’s, and Susan Allen Ford’s collection and
                        another Romantic Circles Pedagogy Commons volume, “Teaching Jane Austen,”
                        edited by Devoney Looser and Emily C. Friedman. Daniel R. Mangiavellano’s
                        essay features a different, illuminating classroom reading of the first
                        sentence, as well as several other scenes in the novel, as well as
                        illustrating how these exercises aid students in developing their own
                        writing. </note> Analyzing this opposition through Austen’s formal
                    experimentation, in turn, allows us to see, and question, the gender and class
                    distinctions and constructions of the era. This close reading exercise thus
                    functions as a hermeneutic for our further discussion of the whole novel and of
                    the Romantic period.</p>
                <p>As all readers of Austen know, the sentence invites our scrutiny since it
                    welcomes us into the novel by setting up irony as the dominant mode of what will
                    follow even as it quickly displaces us outside the sentence’s sweeping
                    universalism when the following sentences immediately deposit us into a
                    fully-imagined world: <quote><lg>

                                his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in
                                the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the
                                rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</l>
                            <l rendition="#indent1"> "My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one
                                day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"</l>
                            <l> Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</l>

                            <l> Mr. Bennet made no answer.</l>
                            <l rendition="#indent1"> "Do you not want to know who has taken it?"
                                cried his wife impatiently.</l>
                            <l rendition="#indent1"> "<emph>You</emph> want to tell me, and I have

                            <l> This was invitation enough.</l>
                            <l rendition="#indent1"> "Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says
                                that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the
                                north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four
                                to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed
                                with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before
                                Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the
                                end of next week." (1)</l>
                        </lg></quote> We move, from one moment to the next, away from the
                    above-it-all, God’s-eye-view, aphoristic generalization of the first sentence to
                    a particular, and highly particularized, neighborhood with certain families
                    claiming the first sentence’s abstract single men for their daughters. That the
                    first sentence appears to offer something of a thesis statement regarding what
                    will unfold in the novel is suddenly rendered questionable in regards to its
                    actual thetic status when the second sentence expands outward and downward, as
                    we are both literally “entering a neighbourhood” and entering into the concerns
                    of “surrounding families”—here, the Netherfielders’ wish to marry off their
                    daughters. Rather than truly contextualizing the major thematic of the book,
                    then, the first sentence instead seems to act as a challenge to the book because
                    of its floating, almost detached, nature, as if it is asking whether or not the
                    book can truly prove this pronouncement’s veracity. Given this strange
                    divergence between the first sentence and the rest of the novel, the
                    sentence—more so than, say, the ones that follow it—demands parsing. Moreover,
                    the sentence complicates not only how to read the novel but how to read in
                    general, since understanding how and what the sentence means will in turn direct
                    how we understand how to read the novel. In other words, this sentence is not
                    simply challenging because of what it means for the novel but for the ways in
                    which it defies readers’ expectations and hence questions how fiction, and thus
                    reading in general, works. Ultimately, this type of self-reflexive questioning
                    is, as we see in class, an exemplary instance of Romantic irony that helps
                    elucidate how Romantic formalism generates questions about the way, to borrow
                    from Trollope, we live now. </p>
                <p>This famous sentence has been much discussed in Jane Austen scholarship, an
                    indication not only of the forceful first impression its aphoristic energy
                    leaves on the reader but also its interpretive permeability and potentiality. In
                    a collection on teaching Jane Austen’s <title level="m">Pride and
                        Prejudice</title>, Kenneth L. Moler discusses examining in his classes the
                    sentence’s allusions to Enlightenment thinkers George Berkeley, David Hume, and
                    Adam Smith, an exercise meant to provide historical and intellectual context for
                    the students.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Moler: “By the time a class is
                        ready to start on the topic of literary allusion in <title level="m">Pride
                            and Prejudice</title>, we have had a good deal to say about the famous
                        opening sentence and its incisive irony. I show that ‘it is a truth
                        universally acknowledged,’ with slight variations is a formula often used in
                        eighteenth-century philosophical discourses, to introduce the first premise
                        of an argument. I quote passages from Berkeley, Hume, and Adam Smith in
                        which the same or similar forms of words are used. (When general rules…are
                        universally acknowledged…we frequently appeal to them as to the standards of
                        judgment, as Smith writes….). It is then possible to see that, amusing as
                        the passage is to us as twentieth-century readers, its effect of ironic
                        deflation would be even funnier to an audience that would associate the
                        first phrase with works like Berkeley’s <title level="m">Principles of Human
                            Knowledge</title> or Hume’s <title level="m">Treatise of Human
                            Nature</title> (89). For more on Austen’s connection to Enlightenment
                        thinkers, see Peter Knox-Shaw’s <title level="m">Jane Austen and the
                            Enlightenment</title> (2009).</note> Similarly, Felicia Bonaparte reads
                    Austen as drawing on Hume’s empiricist skepticism in the novel’s underlying
                    epistemology. In Bonaparte’s view, objective reality does exist for Austen, even
                    though it is never completely knowable since the possibility of wrongly
                    interpreting the world also exists. Proof of this, according to Bonaparte, is
                    that “the very circumstance that one text can yield two utterly different
                    readings plainly indicates that Austen knows how uncertain meanings can be”
                    (153). Edward O’Neill’s nimble article, “‘Found Wanting?’: Second Impressions of
                    a Famous First Sentence,” argues that the sentence turns on the twined meanings
                    of “want” as both “lack” and “desire” and the way that this entwinement threads
                    the plot of the novel by entangling the characters in both meanings at once (a
                    point taken up below). For William Galperin, the paradox of this sentence hinges
                    on the “world of possibility” hinted at by the probable certainty the sentence
                    foregrounds: if the truth must be acknowledged it means that “both men
                        <emph>and</emph> women […are…] the objects <emph>and agents</emph> of
                    cultural imperatives” and hence such truths are malleable to cultural
                    contestation and revision (125-126). William Deresiewicz, meanwhile, points out
                    that it is the only one of Austen’s novels that opens with an aphorism, or
                    rather, as he also points out, a mock aphorism, “for it is immediately intimated
                    that this ‘truth universally acknowledged’ is in fact nothing more than one of
                    the fixed opinions of the ‘neighborhood’ of ‘surrounding families’ amidst which
                    the novel’s action is to take place.” As he puts it later in the same article,
                    “what is presented in these first scenes is more than anything the story of a
                    community: of communal expectations, communal conventions, communal activities”
                    (503). For Galperin and Deresiewicz, in other words, the sentence decidedly
                    establishes cultural and communal meaning rather than the universality the word
                    choice and aphoristic nature of the sentence would seem to imply. Indeed, in the
                    course of teaching this sentence, as we’ll see below, I’ve discovered that the
                    either/or proposition of communally-forged agreement and universally-endowed
                    edict emerges from close reading analysis. </p>
                <p>However, for all the various readings of this sentence on offer, Claudia Brodsky
                    claims that “no critic, to my knowledge, has raised the immediate and pragmatic
                    question of what the sentence actually means” (621). While I by no means wish to
                    claim that this essay settles what the sentence means, it may partially address
                    this vexing problem, even as its main goal is to position the reading aporias of
                    this sentence as a propaedeutic to further pedagogical engagement and scholarly
                    reflection. In other words, what follows in this essay—a record of a classroom
                    collaborative explication—is by no means intended as definitive. Rather, I hope
                    it contributes to unsettling our notions about how the sentence creates meaning
                    while gesturing towards how the sentence functions as part of the whole novel
                    and, indeed, how it adds insight into understanding Romanticism broadly
                    understood. </p>
                <p>Brodsky also points out that <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> locates
                    within the Romantic period a paradoxical nexus: the so-called transition from
                    the romance genre and eighteenth-century sentimental fiction to a historical
                    realist fiction focused on particulars even as it is undergirded by the same
                    universal ahistorical tenets it purports to gainsay. According to Brodsky,
                    realist fiction, despite its protestations to the contrary, nevertheless relies
                    on a historical pretension that disguises its ahistorical elements by pretending
                    they do not exist, a feature which grants the fiction verisimilitude to stand as
                    a chronicle of people and events living in a particular place and time. In
                    teaching Romanticism, we grapple with a literature that reflects radical
                    reformations of how life is mimetically represented and empirically understood.
                    It follows then that just as literary representations of life change in the
                    period, so do, correspondingly, interpretive reading strategies. Therefore our
                    explication of the text seeks to act as a meta-commentary-in-action on how
                    Romantic-era irony, as exemplified in <title level="m">Pride and
                        Prejudice</title>’s first sentence, historically revises the way we read and
                    document the world and the people in it.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Readings of Austen’s irony are many. D. W. Harding’s influential reading of
                        Austen claims all of her works are ironic in that “her books are, as she
                        meant them to be, read and enjoyed by precisely the sort of people whom she
                        disliked; she is a literary classic of the society which attitudes like
                        hers, held widely enough, would undermine.” The first major study of
                        Austen’s handling of irony is Marvin Murdick’s, who claims that “Austen uses
                        irony to defend herself, to distance herself from taking any concrete
                        position on social, cultural, and political issues.” Robert Phiddian has a
                        more recent reading of irony in both Austen and the <title level="m">Harry
                            Potter </title>novels. </note> For students, the takeaway is that
                    fictional tropes like Romantic irony are not simply useful in discussing
                    literature but extend outward to the world around us. Consequently, I use this
                    assignment to push the notion that studying Romanticism is not just something we
                    do in a classroom setting but is one of the complex ways we understand and
                    negotiate the discursive cultural spheres that are our lives. </p>
                <p>In thinking about how teaching the sentence tells us something larger about
                    Romanticism’s discursive cultural capital and revolutionary roots, it might be
                    useful to think of the sentence as staging a face-off between Hegelian and
                    Marxist historicism. Marx, at least according to him, famously turned Hegel on
                    his head, inverting his upwardly ascendant historicism away from
                    world-historical <foreign>Geist</foreign> to the social world of capitalist
                    production and the workers who turn the levers and gears of industrialization.
                    “Doing” history, in Marx’s conception, requires pointing our analytical lenses
                    to the microscopic and microcosmic realities of individuals in a materialist
                    world composed of institutions we’ve created rather than steering toward the
                    macroscopic historical <foreign>telos</foreign> of Hegel. William Wordsworth and
                    Samuel Taylor Coleridge, inspired by the French Revolution’s promises of
                    political democratization and individual liberation, had, in their earlier
                        <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (1798), made a similar suggestion:
                    history takes place not at the level of universal abstraction but at the level
                    of individual lives, even if they are lives typically ignored by
                    historiographers in favor of the powerful. Because we as a class have discussed
                    these ideas before we ever get to our analysis of Austen’s first sentence, it
                    allows me to offer, as an initial proposition, that Austen’s first sentence
                    shows how Romanticism challenges top-down historicism with a bottom-up approach
                    that, while hardly Marxist or even proto-Marxist, will align more clearly with
                    Marxist history as well as, in her own time, Wordsworthian poetic praxis. The
                    study of this sentence can thus be seen to engage in a bit of hyperbole, as a
                    synecdochal representation of the idea that, with Austen and Romanticism, we
                    have in fact become modern if we define modernity as an episteme of both
                    individual and communal self-consciousness and self-awareness. </p>
                <p>As I mentioned above, the first sentence defies readers’ expectations, a move
                    that seems only appropriate given that the novel itself is about misreading
                    people—and in the crucial scene where Elizabeth receives Darcy’s letter, about
                    reading, misreading, and rereading a text—which means that <title level="m"
                        >Pride and Prejudice</title>’s first sentence’s ironic posturing actually
                    teaches us the explicatory skills we need to read the book. This lesson occurs
                    in part because the weird distance that the sentence creates between itself and
                    the rest of the novel, even as it is an essential part of that novel, is a type
                    of irony wherein whatever the first sentence claims to be doing looks
                    retroactively suspicious. It is as if the first sentence remains atop its own
                    battlements besieged by, and defending itself from, the army of sentences
                    challenging it from the ground below. As such, the very act of reading the
                    novel, in turn, mirrors how irony works. Irony institutes a critical
                    self-consciousness of how we assert ourselves rhetorically and the novel is
                    about—among many other things—how we have to use irony in order to pass into the
                    sincerity of truth, beyond our first impressions (Austen’s original title for
                    the novel) and into a legible understanding we can adequately defend. Between
                    the first sentence and the second, the novel teaches us how to read it, just as
                    Elizabeth, by moving beyond her own ironic self-distancing and first
                    impressions, learns to read people and texts accurately (Darcy’s letter, Darcy
                    himself, Wickham). The exercise I describe below therefore aids in wrapping our
                    minds around the elusive nature of Romantic irony and the reading strategies it
                    affords our analytical abilities.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For accounts

                <p>This explicatory exercise has worked for me in several different classes,
                    although some of them are not explicitly classes on Romanticism. I have used it
                    in two different types of Writing about Literature courses at Loyola University
                    New Orleans. The Writing about Literature course was intended primarily for
                    sophomore-level students, but junior- and senior-level students often enrolled
                    as well due to the general university requirements that mandated all students
                    must take one Writing about Literature course. In these courses the <title
                        level="m">Pride and Prejudice </title>example functioned mainly as a close
                    reading exercise. </p>
                <p>On the other hand, when I used this exercise in a class fully devoted to
                    Romanticism, more than simply helping us think about how Romantic irony works,
                    it also instanced how Romantic legacies continue to shape our world. The
                    Romantic period is, obviously, a time of radical literary experimentation
                    ranging from Charlotte Smith’s origination of the Gothic sonnet (1784) to
                    Blake’s thoroughgoing weirdness in his marriage of poetry and art (and heaven
                    and hell) to Wordsworth’s and Coleridge’s groundbreaking literary experiment,
                        <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, to Byron’s creation of a
                    novel-in-verse mock-heroic epic, <title level="m">Don Juan</title> (1819-1824).
                    Free indirect discourse, a key innovative feature of Austen’s style, places
                    Austen on this list of Romantic literary radicalization.<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors">D.A. Miller offers a thorough exploration of Austen’s style
                        that argues free indirect discourse allows Austen to hide herself from her
                        novels. Regarding Austen’s style and the first sentence he notes: “whoever
                        wishes to illustrate Austen Style regularly gravitates toward the maxim,
                        assuming that the perfection of this Style is highest, most visible and
                        delectable, in bite-size form. Yet no sooner do we examine this practice of
                        exemplification at any of its numerous sites…than we notice that it
                        apparently suffers from a <emph>dearth of good examples</emph>. How else to
                        explain why, so often, there seems to be only one such example: the first
                        sentence of <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>…” (40).</note> As
                    is well known, free indirect discourse combines third-person and first-person
                    narrative technique so that the omniscient narrator sometimes seems to be
                    speaking for the characters while the characters themselves sometimes appear to
                    adopt the narrator’s voice to speak as an “I.” This narrative chiasmus makes the
                    first sentence all the more confounding. To return to the earlier martial
                    metaphor, from its battlement, the first sentence surveys the novel it sits
                    atop. However, given the way free indirect discourse crosshatches first- and
                    third-person voices, the idea of division, of battle lines drawn up, ready to
                    face off, suddenly seems both facile and newly complicated, as two voices issue
                    forth from one mouth (to mix several metaphors). The interstices of this
                    chiasmus, this narrative and stylistic chimera, produce Austen’s irony because
                    the impersonal voice of the first sentence gains its fully robust ironic energy
                    only in contrast to, and in tandem with, the very personal voices present in the
                    novel. Austen’s irony is thereby stylistically undergirded by the same thematic
                    conflict between the universal and the particular that the first sentence—in
                    part through the emergence of the irony that emerges from this stylistic
                    paradox—suggests the novel will labor to resolve. </p>
                <p>In all of these courses, to begin the exercise I ask students to explicate, for
                    ten minutes overall, each word in Austen’s sentence. Because I stress writing as
                    a learned skill that requires actually engaging in a variety of different types
                    of writing—brainstorming, discovery, note-taking, sketching, rough drafting—they
                    do not simply list random thoughts but write about each word in explicatory
                    paragraph style which requires thinking through nuanced connotations and
                    denotations. This in-class activity fosters our subsequent group discussion by
                    creating concrete definitional and conceptual examples with which to work.
                    Typically, I assign this exercise midway through the semester (somewhere between
                    weeks seven and nine) so that, by that point, students and I will have discussed
                    what “explication” means and how to write one. Indeed, students have already
                    written one paper (three and a half to four pages) exclusively devoted to
                    explicating one passage from a previous text. The <title level="m">Pride and
                        Prejudice</title> exercise, then, is designed to supplement and expand on
                    earlier explication discussions and assignments and to do so by providing an
                    actual example of close reading in action.</p>
                <p>I sometimes use the following literary example to illustrate what I wish students
                    to focus on in close reading. In Dorothy L. Sayers’ <title level="m">Busman’s
                        Honeymoon</title> (1937), Lord Peter Wimsey, aristocratic sleuth and
                    “new-wedded lord,” finds a corpse in the cellar of his rural honeymoon home.
                    During the course of their investigation of the murder, Wimsey details his
                    detective methodology to his wife, Harriet Vane: <quote>"You can have no idea,"
                        said Peter, irrelevantly, "how refreshing it is to talk to somebody who has
                        a grasp of method. The police are excellent fellows, but the only principle
                        of detection they have really grasped is that wretched phrase, <foreign>Cui
                            bono</foreign>? They <emph>will</emph> hare off after motive, which is a
                        matter for psychologists. Juries are just the same. If they can see a motive
                        they tend to convict, however often the judge may tell them that there's no
                        need to prove motive, and that motive by itself will never make a case.
                        You've got to show how the thing was done, and then, if you like, bring in
                        motive to back up your proof. If a thing could only have been done one way,
                        and if only one person could have done it that way, then you've got your
                        criminal, motive or no motive. There's How, When, Where, Why and Who—and
                        when you've got How, you've got Who. Thus spake Zarathustra." (232)</quote>
                    I find adopting this methodology helpful in discussing Jane Austen, but in
                    modified form: when you’ve got “How,” you’ve got “What.” Or, to rephrase it:
                    when you know <emph>how</emph> a text works then you know <emph>what</emph> it
                    means. In questing for textual meanings, we seek not just the destinations, a
                    bunch of Xs that mark the spots, but the various journeys that get us to those
                    meanings. Just as you cannot convict a criminal without a <foreign>corpus
                        delicti</foreign>, you cannot assert a persuasive account of what a text
                    means without a logical chain of textual evidence that demonstrates how the
                    crime—in this metaphor the sentence is the murder—was committed. Or so I tell my
                    students. (Wimsey’s assertion of course contradicts mine as he says you can
                    convict without this empirical evidence—but, then again, that’s precisely what
                    I’m trying to get students not to do.) </p>
                <p>In this way I use the exercise to showcase what I call “being a reader.” As I’m
                    sure many teachers are aware, students often think there is a solution to a
                    text, some type of roadmap they need to be given in order to follow and arrive
                    at the final destination of the text’s “true” meaning, a definitive path to a
                    true definition. “Being a reader,” I stress, entails approaching the study of
                    Romanticism and literature in general as an interpretive, productive endeavor
                    (in fact this is an important lesson deriving from Percy Bysshe Shelley’s <title
                        level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title>, discussed below). I try to show,
                    through empirical and democratic writing and conversational exercises like this
                    one, how literary tropes and texts <emph>work</emph> to produce meanings as
                    opposed to many students’ initial inclination to cursorily gloss, or paraphrase,
                    a text’s meaning. Setting myself up as a reader, or interpreter, of literature,
                    just like they are, helps students to see not only the difference between
                    understanding a text’s meaning and interpreting a text <emph>for</emph> multiple
                    meanings, but also the value of interpretation, key to entering into formal
                    literary discourse. At the same time, as in the prosecutorial metaphor above,
                    there are multiple readings of a text that one can produce, but each reading
                    must be backed up with a persuasive chain of textual evidence in order to
                    convince anyone. Here, however, the prosecutorial metaphor falls apart since,
                    presumably, there can only be a guilty or not guilty verdict in a criminal
                    trial—and this verdict is either correct or incorrect—whereas there can be
                    several convincing and competing interpretations of a given text. So rather than
                    claim absolute matter-of-fact status for our interpretation, this exercise
                    illustrates the multiplicity of meanings in <title level="m">Pride and
                        Prejudice</title>’s opening sentence, allowing students to hear different
                    interpretations and progress the class forward from my telling them about
                    interpretive reading strategies to showing them interpretation in action. </p>
                <p>The short writing assignment we begin with primes our class discussion. After
                    they have finished writing, we then proceed word by word, to explore the
                    nuances, implications, and even the digressions that arise during this
                    procession through the sentence. Accordingly, the rest of this essay will follow
                    a similar pattern for several paragraphs, addressing each word in turn before
                    pivoting to a broader thematic analysis of the sentence’s interconnectivity
                    while making some preliminary suggestions as to how this reading speaks to the
                    novel as a whole. And although this pedagogical exercise’s emphasis on close
                    reading might seem to agree with Raymond Williams’s remark that “it is a truth
                    universally acknowledged, that Jane Austen chose to ignore the decisive
                    historical events of her time,” students and I disagree (113). Peeling back
                    layers, as it does, our reading addresses, slowly, with each piece of oxidized
                    skin, the gender and economic implications of the novel, implications we spend
                    even more time addressing in later class discussions than I describe here.<note

                </p>
                <p>The first word, “it,” usually proves easy enough for students, who define it as a
                    neuter pronoun in need of a referent. This is fair enough out of context, but,
                    “it” quickly becomes more complicated as the full context of the sentence
                    unravels. That is to say, depending on how one understands the first and second
                    clause of the sentence, “it” can vary as to not only <emph>what</emph> it refers
                    to, but also in <emph>how</emph> it refers to it—a point that we will “unfold”
                    or “unroll” (from the Latin <foreign>explicare</foreign>), as I tell my
                    students, as the discussion progresses.  </p>
                <p>As President Bill Clinton famously claimed, much depends on what the definition
                    of “is” is. “Is” is, most obviously, the most ubiquitous verb in the English
                    language and the one that for students proves the most intractable to concrete
                    definition. The superficially simple question, “What does ‘is’ mean?” genuinely
                    baffles. For students, the verb’s meaning seems self-evident. Hence, they
                    typically offer variations on “it just means ‘here’ or it just means ‘present.’”
                    But whenever I conduct this exercise, I always, frustratingly enough for the
                    students, refuse such answers, pushing them to drill down further. Such a
                    process leads to unexpected insights. As one exasperated student, a
                    soon-to-retire police officer, eloquently and quite commonsensically put it
                    after an intensely confusing back-and-forth, “‘is’ just means that you is.”
                    “Well,” I said in response, “but what does it mean to ‘is’? This table here
                    ‘is,’ right? But what does it mean? What is ‘is-ing’? What are you doing if you
                    are ‘is-ing’? I am is-ing right now? What happened? What is happening? Or let’s
                    put it this way, what is the is-ness of ‘is’?” These counter-questions, which we
                    always go through in each class, usually result, through some circumlocutory
                    means, in the definition “to be.” <lg>
                        <l>“Which means,” I ask, “exactly what? What does it mean ‘to be’”?</l>
                        <l>“It's the future tense of ‘is,’” someone says.</l>
                        <l>“Right. Well, a bit more accurately, it’s the infinitive of “is.” But
                            what does ‘to be’ mean? To say ‘is’ means ‘to be’ only substitutes one
                            tense of the word for another. </l>
                        <l> We could just as easily say that ‘is’ means ‘you are and you were.’”
                        </l>
                    </lg> Such a line of questioning eventually reaches a provisional
                        <foreign>terminus ad quem</foreign> when a student offers that ‘is’ means
                    ‘to exist.’” </p>
                <p>So far, so good. We’ve worked our way to a definition and usually done so, if the
                    police officer’s comment above is any indication, with both considerable
                    good-humor and productive frustration. And yet…we are not finished with the verb
                    “is” quite yet. After all, what else, beyond its ontological meaning, can the
                    verb “to be” do? It can, of course, work as a copula, linking words in an A=B
                    relationship. Additionally, as we think through it, ‘is’ can be a passive verb,
                    depriving a sentence of agent and action. But is this how it functions in the
                    first sentence of <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>? Is there a
                    subject? An actor or agent? </p>
                <p> At this point we forestall the answers to those questions and this allows us to
                    begin opening up the complexities of the sentence to larger thematic scrutiny.
                    If “is” means “exist” in the sentence, and also acts as a linking verb
                    connecting the pronoun “it” with its referent “truth,” then the first part of
                    the sentence translates as “a truth exists.” This translation would seem to lend
                    to the “truth” an ontological status beyond cultural and social constructivism
                    because it is indicative of something indubitable, something indisputable,
                    something incontestable and yet numinous—a pure transcendental truth. At this
                    point students and I find that we are back in the realm of universals and
                    particulars, although, really, we have never left it. </p>
                <p>On the other hand, this reading of “truth” as transcendental is itself challenged
                    by the “is-ness” of is in that the passive construction here couples it to not
                    just “truth” but to “<emph>a truth</emph>” that itself depends on being
                    “universally acknowledged.” The article “a,” which we were initially tempted to
                    traverse, deflates the universalism of the hypostasized truth we contemplated
                    moments before. This instance of “a” felling the expansive infinity embedded in
                    the word “truth” proves illuminating, as the puny confronts the cosmically
                    giant, “a”’s David to the truth’s Goliath. Like the shocking outcome of the
                    Israelites’ encounter with the Philistines, “a” versus “truth” indexes an
                    unexpected result as “a”’s deflationism effectuates an emerging interpretive
                    divergence. With one puny stone a-sling, a particular truth fells a universal
                    truth, we might say.</p>
                <p>Students’ definition of “universally” bears out this divergence. Whereas in the
                    above explication of “is” a reified truth appears, the phrase “universally
                    acknowledged,” as students quickly realize, suggests that someone or something,
                    either a human or non-human agent, must be doing the acknowledging. One
                    definition they offer is through inference by way of textual elision. Isn’t it
                    curious, after all, that the acknowledgement of this truth, despite its claimed
                    universality, is not ascribed to anyone either grammatically or thematically?
                    However, my students argue, “a truth universally acknowledged,” since it is
                    acknowledged, <emph>must </emph>be acknowledged by <emph>someone</emph>. Hence,
                    there is not necessarily anything transcendental about it but rather something
                    stubbornly human. And if this truth is a mere commonplace contra what we
                    speculated that “universality” meant, then the truth becomes, or rather is, only
                    a truism, a maxim, or a bon mot made up by a given community of humans (in this
                    case, of course, it would be the Netherfield coterie). </p>
                <p>  And yet, and yet, as Byron might say, and as students do say, “universally”
                    can, and perhaps simply does, undeniably imply a cosmic transcendentality, the
                    initial interpretation to which “is” defined as “exists” led us. For
                    “universally,” as students have pointed out above, can mean “cosmic and
                    transcendental”—a kind of platonic universal truth—but since this truth is
                    “acknowledged” and since “acknowledged” can <emph>also</emph> imply that
                        <emph>someone</emph> must be doing the acknowledging, then humans may simply
                    acknowledge this truth in the sense that they <emph>accept</emph> that it does
                    exist. Rather than the above solution, in which “acknowledged” means the
                    Netherfield residents generated said truth via communal intersubjective
                    agreement, the world of this scenario is filled with characters who point upward
                    to the heavens, like Plato in Raphael’s <title level="m">School of
                        Athens</title>, sure of, and accepting of the fact, that answers descend
                    from the <foreign>mysterium tremendum</foreign>. </p>
                <p>In the classroom we now find ourselves in a position aptly described by Claudia
                    Johnson, who writes that “Austen has contrived <title level="m">Pride and
                        Prejudice</title> in such a way that virtually every argument about it can
                    be undercut with a built-in countervailing argument, a qualifying ‘on the other
                    hand’ which forestalls conclusiveness” (77). The novel’s other-handedness means
                    that “the intricately counterbalanced construction of <title level="m">Pride and
                        Prejudice</title> obliges us to regroup and reassess characters and issues,
                    to broaden our judgments and to accept contradiction” (77). Likewise, our class
                    has discovered three (for now) contradictory interpretations: <lg>
                        <l>a) It is a transcendental truth universally acknowledged as cosmic law,
                            that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a
                            wife.</l>
                        <l>b) It is a transcendental truth universally acknowledged by a given
                            community, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in
                            want of a wife.</l>
                        <l>c) It is a communally constructed truth universally acknowledged by a
                            given community, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must
                            be in want of a wife.</l>
                    </lg> Arriving at this textual conundrum places us squarely in a classical but
                    contemporarily relevant philosophical dilemma: is truth found (the
                    transcendental thesis) or made (the social constructivist thesis)?
                    Interpretations (a) and (b) cohere with the transcendental thesis and would seem
                    to indicate that single men’s wife-wanting is cosmically induced, beyond their
                    control and choice, which flattens certain patriarchal ideological problems that
                    the “single man” part of the sentence raises. After all, an innate categorical
                    drive to find a wife would refuse the idea of free, conscious will in the matter
                    and would seem to convert patriarchal power to something deterministically
                    induced by forces from elsewhere. Thus country gentry life would not be
                    structured by patriarchal privilege but rather divine fiat: rich men want wives
                    because they are programmed at some natural level to want wives. In contrast,
                    the social constructivist thesis (c) indicates that rich, single men who want
                    wives do so because the society in which they live creates matrimonial
                    expectations that such men will wish to marry. It may even create expectations
                    that women will want to be courted by such men and marry them. This social
                    constructivist thesis suggests that deep gender power divisions—created by
                    people and social forces—motivate and mobilize men’s actions in their
                    relationships with the unmarried females they court. Our various options, then,
                    point us directly at exactly what is at stake in interpreting whether the
                    sentence means events in the novel play out this way because of natural law or
                    because of tacitly, or not-so-tacitly, agreed-upon covenants in the world of the
                    country-house romance. These interpretations speak to the ideological concerns
                    of Regency England, what Marilyn Butler refers to as the “war of ideas.” As I
                    put it broadly and somewhat simply to students, this post-Revolutionary time of
                    indulgent complacency, with a hedonist regent running in place as a ruler,
                    nevertheless staged battles between political conservatisim and progressive
                    radicalism in the social marketplace of ideas. We might, at this point, I tell
                    students, initially understand the latter possibility—that communal norms
                    structure society rather than transcendental laws divined from God—as the
                    radical political position. We might also, I add, chalk up Austen’s irony as a
                    social hermeneutic tool that advances this radical position. </p>
                <p>At this juncture I usually ask students if we can find any textual evidence or
                    interpretive imperative in the rest of the second clause of the sentence that
                    will persuasively bolster one reading over the other. Helpfully, my students
                    have had a fairly keen, though not fully developed, awareness of
                    class-consciousness pegged to gender roles, which emerges when we come to
                    “single man.” <note place="foot" resp="editors">Two places to begin in terms of
                        class criticism on Austen are Marilyn Butler and Alistair Duckworth. Both
                        view Austen as essentially politically conservative, protecting the norms of
                        marriage in Regency society. Later critics like Fraiman and Johnson, who
                        combine an analysis of gender politics with social class, see her as
                        politically progressive. </note> At first glance, given the contextual
                    provision supplied by the marriage proviso, this adjective-noun combination
                    appears to be comparatively noncontroversial in meaning. And yet, each time I’ve
                    led students in this discussion, pinning down what a “single man in possession
                    of a good fortune” means poses marvelous explicatory hurdles. For what does
                    “single” mean after all? Does it mean singular? Individual? Sole? Alone?
                    Eligible? Exemplary? Much debate ensues regarding this word, none of it
                    definitive. However, it is notable that the word’s prodigious denotations
                    reintroduce the bipartite crossroads of particularity and universality—either
                        <emph>this </emph>single man or <emph>all </emph>single men everywhere—that
                    paused our explication above. This particular-universal distinction continues,
                    as we discover, with the modifiers surrounding “single.” We find “man” pretty
                    self-evident (though perhaps we should not). But whatever “single” means here,
                    “good” leads down several rabbit holes (should we take the blue or red pill?)
                    that return us, also, to the platonic philosophical themes evoked by
                    “universally.” Several definitions are readily available to us: “nice”;
                    “significant”; “sufficient”; “beneficial”; “morally correct.” Less obviously,
                    students find that “good” might mean “prosperity” or even “luck.” Hence, we
                    arrive at “a single man who is fortunate” rather than a single man possessing
                    wealth. But whether or not the single man merely has good fortune or has
                    significant wealth, students identify the sentence’s emphasis on the man—and
                    either his bachelorhood or his exemplarity—as raising real concerns about gender
                    subordination as tied to class privilege (or lack thereof, as the case may be).
                    On this reading, the sentence’s straightforwardly single-man insistence suggests
                    a raft of slippery issues: namely, that the novel believes rich men are the
                    rightful arbitrators of what women want. </p>
                <p>Although we do not discuss the rest of the novel during this class period, if we
                    did we would discover, of course, that Elizabeth Bennet, rather than a wealthy
                    man (Darcy, say), is the novel’s primary focus. Our acontextual reading of this
                    sentence affirms how our expectations are ironically contended with and shortly
                    overturned as the narrative voice subtly shifts from third-person impersonality
                    (and universality?) to a point-of-view at ground level before, as Alex Woloch
                    argues, it shifts again when Elizabeth assumes narrative control in chapter

                        quickness’ finds its corollary in her ‘quick pace’ and her ‘impatient
                        activity.’ The dilation of the description—as it drifts into the present
                        tense through a series of participles (‘crossing,’ ‘jumping,’ ‘springing,’
                        ‘finding herself’)—is unique up to this moment in the text. In fact, this
                        passage stands out within the narrative as a whole. It is a purely unplotted
                        moment in this densely plotted novel, a free space in the narrative—or
                        rather the only ‘plot’ that it serves to advance is precisely the
                        asymmetrical construction of Elizabeth as the center of narrative interest.
                        The passage shows how a thought in <title level="m">Pride and
                            Prejudice</title>, a tendency of consciousness, can become gradually
                        externalized” (80). </note> Woloch shows how the Bennet sisters, in
                    literally arriving at a crossroads, also arrive at a narrative, stylistic, and
                    thematic crossroads, with Elizabeth claiming control of several action gerunds,
                    a verbal transition that asserts her agency: <quote>In Meryton they parted; the
                        two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and
                        Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick
                        pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient
                        activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary
                        ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.
                        (23)</quote> Following Woloch’s insight, we can see how this passage focuses
                    in even more tightly on one particular character, as if it puts Elizabeth,
                    cinematically speaking, in close-up whereas she had been seen only in medium
                    shots up to this point. Above we asked whether the first sentence had an actor
                    or an agent. Is it possible the actor is Elizabeth? Thinking in terms of free
                    indirect discourse, this fabulously unlikely-looking idea has some currency,
                    since this ironic opening sentence is just the sort of bon mot Elizabeth,
                        <foreign>agent provocateur,</foreign> might toss off in order to then
                    turnabout and challenge or disprove it. If Elizabeth, who often has her
                    first-person assertions voiced by the third-person narrator throughout the novel
                    (a claim which is admittedly debatable), were in fact the missing agent of this
                    first sentence, then this textual elision would validate our earlier assertions
                    about the connection between irony and free indirect discourse. It would also
                    highlight, yet again, how the universal—in the form of the omniscient
                    narrator—struggles with the particular in the form of Elizabeth. </p>
                <p> One way students and I parse this universal/particular interpretive puzzle is to
                    continue to interrogate, by means of addition, the sentence’s further class
                    implications beyond the “single man.” In Jose Saramago’s <title level="m">The
                        History of the Siege of Lisbon</title> (1998), the proofreader Raimondo
                    Silva, assigned in the novel to correct a book of the same name, inserts the
                    word “not” in a crucial sentence, thereby altering the historical record of the
                    invasion of Portugual by preventing, on the page, the Crusaders from aiding
                    Alfonso I in reconquering the city and converting it back to Christianity—a
                    seismic event in Portuguese history. Although our exercise does not carry the
                    same seismic tremors, we follow Saramago’s proofreader in his textual surgery of
                    insertion and alteration to further explore the class concerns the sentence
                    leaves unresolved. Do single men not in possession of a good fortune want wives?
                    Or is this a society in which only rich men can be in want of a wife? Here we
                    insert “not”: <quote>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that single men not
                        in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. </quote> And then
                    we insert another “not”: <quote>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that
                        single men not in possession of a good fortune must not be in want of a
                        wife. </quote> Inserting “not” helps zero in further on how moneyed
                    interests would appear to command control of the society we are about to enter
                    via this sentence.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Deresiewicz employs a
                        similar strategy. "It is a truth universally acknowledged": that is, it is a
                        belief ensconced in "the minds of the surrounding families." The novel takes
                        as its point of departure, not customs or conventions, but cognitive
                        processes. In particular, it begins by setting out the kind of cognitive
                        process that crucially characterizes the community's thinking, the deductive
                        logic of the syllogism. As we might reformulate it:<lg>
                            <l>All single men in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a
                                wife.</l>
                            <l>Mr.Bingley is a single man in possession of a good fortune</l>
                            <l>Mr. Bingley must be in want of a wife.</l>
                        </lg>Our "universal truth," "well fixed" as it is in the minds of the
                        surrounding families, serves as the major premise, the starting-point of
                        deduction. "The feelings or views" of the single man in question empirical
                        evidence that may be thought to bear on the issue have no place in the
                        process and are therefore discounted. And because they are discounted, there
                        is no possibility that they will modify the major premise. Without the
                        countercheck of induction, of fresh observation and reconsideration,
                        conjecture crowns itself as certainty ("must be"), and beliefs once accepted
                        harden into "universal truths" (504-505).</note> Whereas above we discussed
                    the vagaries of a rich man and a lucky man wanting a wife, with our Saramagian
                    additions we broaden the patriarchal possibilities outward to encompass all men
                    and not just those felicitous few who have economic wealth or serendipitous
                    fortuity. Adding “not” to the sentence is deceptive because while it looks like
                    an addition, it is really just a way to translate the sentence. Without the
                    context of the whole novel—and wealth-conscious characters therein—the
                    indeterminacy of “single,” “good,” and “fortune” leave us vacillating about the
                    sentence’s meaning. In its refusal to specify, the sentence <emph>can</emph>
                    mean that single men who are not wealthy must be in want of wives. Similarly, it
                        <emph>can</emph> mean that if single men who are wealthy want wives then,
                    contrastingly, single men who are not wealthy may not want wives. Both
                    not-addition scenarios share a commonality: regardless of the audience’s
                    composition men remain the only actors strutting across this stage as if it were
                    an Elizabethan playhouse. Bolstering this reading, as several students note, the
                    “single man” (however one construes him) is given adjectival access as well as
                    the verb “possessing” and the “good fortune” attendant on that verbiage, while
                    the glimpse of women we see in the passage is an adjectivally flattened,
                    verbally unadorned—and here we see this larger theme again—universal
                    descriptor-as-function rather than an individualized, and particularized, agent.
                    The conversion of women to wives squares the circle on class and gender: all men
                    can want or not want wives whereas all women are simply the objects of wanting.
                    By advancing this position through the irony explored above, Austen lays a trap
                    for her readers: Elizabeth Bennet, in thought and action, seems to resist just
                    such a position throughout the rest of the novel. And, as we read the novel,
                    determining whether or not Elizabeth successfully manages to resist being merely
                    an object of a man’s matrimonial desires will in turn determine where we come
                    down on whether the novel simultaneously advances a radical politics or
                    recuperates the internal order of a patriarchal society underpinned by rich men
                    wanting and getting the wives that they want. Meanwhile, though, while we are
                    simultaneously left having advanced a great deal in our understanding of the
                    sentence, both grammatically and thematically, we are no closer, really, to
                    solving definitively the principle dilemma regarding transcendental
                    men-and-women truths versus historical and social representations of
                    men-and-women truths than when we began. </p>
                <p>However, students have come to several realizations and conclusions. The
                    universals of the cosmos, and the particulars of rural cultural existence,
                    translate into a classical cultural debate that students express in contemporary
                    popular parlance as the difference, and perhaps even the historical transition,
                    between “needs” and “wants.” My students’ explications of “want” mirrors that of
                    Edward O’Neill, who sees it as either “lack” or “desire” (77). He writes,
                    “Either a single man lacks a wife by definition, or might be supposed to “want”
                    in the sense of desiring one—a more genuine, and more exciting, conjecture”
                    (79). An illustrative example of “want”-as-lack occurs in the film <title
                        level="m">Shakespeare in Love</title> (1998), when Richard Burbage cries
                    out, “Mistress Roselyn! My sleeve wants for a button!” In this case, the sleeve
                    needs a button to close—it lacks what it needs to properly function. Desiring,
                    alternately, requires a cognitive, if not emotional, or even physiological,
                    response, with a fixed goal as its hopefully attainable endpoint. What is
                    desired isn’t lacking in the sense of something needed—like in the button
                    example—but rather something simply consciously sought after for, well, whatever
                    reason whether that be sexual or social gratification, monetary fulfillment,
                    power mongering, or what have you. But for O’Neill, the irony of the sentence,
                    and perforce the novel, is that the novel’s prime concern is with wives who
                    “want”—either by lack or desire—single men in possession of a good fortune. This
                    reading reverses the apparently androcentric propulsive plot the sentence has
                    set the stage for (i.e. the male actors strutting the boards above). </p>
                <p>Taking up O’Neill’s gynocentric reading pressures the preposition, “in,” that
                    props up the word “want.” The preposition, as we discuss, can, and maybe
                    conclusively does, cancel the debate between lack and desire. Whether “in”
                    equals lack or desire, if the preposition translates to “in an existential state
                    of being in want,” then this refers us back to the idea of cosmic law—what
                    governs human life in every community everywhere. But if “in” translates
                    differently, as something along the lines of “within a mental space of willing
                    choice,” then “in” ascribes decision to human beings, granting them the autonomy
                    the existential above option rules out. Wanting a wife is not just a natural
                    phenomena hardwired into male brains; it’s a result of a given community’s
                    normative beliefs and values. Taking “want” in this fashion sides with the
                    particularities of history, understanding social mores as definers of life’s
                    love matches. Such a reading can support the above suggestion that this line
                    comes from Elizabeth: it ignores individual choice, what many would argue
                    Elizabeth possesses, as she marries, technically speaking, above her station but
                    only once she <emph>decides</emph> to do so with the man whom she has begun
                    to—though this is of course debatable—reform. Thus, like we theorized above, the
                    sentence is a provocative proposition, one Elizabeth throws down like a gauntlet
                    so that she may challenge it in the coming pages. This reading, though strange
                    and unlikely-sounding, is nevertheless in keeping with the nature of Elizabeth’s
                    (and Austen’s) irony and wit. </p>
                <p>“But this would mean…” one student said haltingly, a bit amazed, “that ‘in’ is
                    the most important word in the sentence.” “In” then. To our total surprise “in”
                    turns out to be the textual crux of the passage since it determines how we
                    understand “want,” which, in its divergent lacks and desires, manages how we
                    interpret just exactly what the single man—and by her absence, Elizabeth—is
                    doing. Close reading, as we see, requires attending even to the most irrelevant
                    looking and mechanically functioning words of a text for these words might prove
                    to be more important than whatever initially jumps out at us (“truth,”
                    “universally,” and “acknowledged”). </p>
                <p>Having arrived at this critical juncture, students, hopefully, can derive a few
                    bits of insight about the “close” and the “reading” of close reading. In fact,
                    we actually perform a contracted close reading of “close reading.” What do these
                    words mean when put to work together? By modifying “reading,” “close” transforms
                    “reading” into something more than the mundane (which of course is not mundane
                    at all) activity of reading words on a page. Instead it presses us down into
                    that page. With close reading we are suddenly down in between the letters on the
                    page, brushing our fingertips against the curlicues of s’s and the low-hanging
                    arms of g’s, exploring at the most minute level not only definitions and
                    semantics, but also the phonemic and morphemic aspects of words. That the
                    miniscule proposition “in” possesses enough strength to prop up the entire
                    sentence and govern its meaning demonstrates just how close one has to get.
                    Moreover, we see at this juncture that even the most seemingly insignificant
                    words can direct interpretive possibilities if attended to particularly. As such
                    “reading,” in its turn, modifies “close” by creating a dialectic synthesis—a
                    specific type of analytical activity—that moves us from grammar to thematics,
                    semantics to styles. By reading close we look for how things like word order and
                    word choice (to take but two examples) create theme and style (to take two more)
                    without ever appearing to consciously do so. After all, words are of course
                    subject to many different orders and choices. Reading close teases out from
                    these orders and choices the whats and hows of meaning at what looks like a
                    larger, higher-order level—theme and style seem like “big” things after all—even
                    as they emerge only from smaller, subatomic levels which, given their actual
                    importance, are just as large, when one thinks about it, as the things they
                    produce. “Close” reading, “reading” close, are both instances, we might say, of
                    particulars and universals revealing themselves as irreducibly scrambled. But
                    this scrambling is, in its turn, all the more reason why close reading is
                    necessary. Such notions are, no doubt, well known to literary scholars, but for
                    students being inaugurated into textual analysis, especially early in the
                    semester, encountering these close reading conceptualizations prove to be
                    eye-opening and foundational to future literary investigation. </p>
                <p>Our class discussion ends with the realization—or at least the communal
                    agreement!—that close reading is a specific critical ability, one useful in
                    discovering the complicated meanings implicitly and explicitly present in every
                    text. Of equal yield from our discussion are the meta-implications of the
                    sentence’s irony, which, on our reading, foregrounds both a theory of knowledge
                    production and references a well-known debate in the history of ideas and
                    philosophy, that between universals and particulars.</p>
                <p>Pedagogically and epistemologically speaking, then, this exercise lands us at a
                    typical Romantic philosophical flashpoint: is there a transcendental truth, some
                    force beyond the human world that foundationally grounds that world? Our reading
                    opens up that possibility that there are only the truths we make rather than any
                    we can find by seeking truth. In fact, we had acknowledged, as it were, that no
                    truths are ever non-contingent even those as seemingly intransigent as class and
                    gender normativities that ground our being in a reality we have created. Percy
                    Bysshe Shelley famously closes <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title>
                    (1821) by claiming that poets are “the unacknowledged legislators of the world.”
                    Shelley’s expansive definition of poetry hails back toward the Greek notion of
                        <foreign>poiesis</foreign>, that is, a creative maker, an interpreter of the
                    world who produces, by means of those interpretations, new truths. A final
                    lesson I try to stress with this close reading exercise—one that connects to
                    what I call “being a reader”—is that our multidirectional yet interconnected
                    interpretations of this crucial sentence position us as poets in Shelley’s
                    sense: critical readers who, through our interpretations, create, even as we
                    discover, meaning and meanings about the world in which we live through the lens
                    of a novel set in a world two hundred years removed from our own. That idea
                    might smack of the universalism our exercise has just, effectively speaking,
                    denied any purchase; however, what this claim about <foreign>poiesis</foreign>
                    really does is reappropriate Shelley’s universalist thesis by wedding it to the
                    particularities of present-day irony that emerge from the novels of Jane Austen
                    in the Romantic period. “Unveiling” this reading strategy—to use one of
                    Shelley’s favorite metaphors in <title level="m">Defence</title>—amounts to more
                    than just a reading strategy and gets at the heart of what teaching Romanticism
                    teaches us. My more ambitious, upward-and-outward hope for this classroom close
                    reading is that it provides students tools that will pay off as we continue to
                    think about how this period of literary and cultural history shapes us and our
                    present condition. Indeed, Romanticism is often characterized as I have done so
                    here: as a time of self-reflexivity and the directly connected constitution of
                    the fully individuated, modern subject. And Romantic irony has long been
                    recognized as a key mechanism, borne in literary experimentation (a kind of
                    Frankensteinian creature stitched together by various texts) to the emergence of
                    this subject. But if one were to recontextualize what I’m suggesting here in
                    slightly different, more current scholarly terms, we could also see Austen’s
                    irony as tracking with what Michel Foucault calls the birth of biopolitics, the
                    human awareness of ourselves as a species and the concurrent commitment “to make
                    [that species] live,” as Foucault puts it (<title level="m">History</title> 1:
                        133-160).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See also: <title level="m"
                            >Security, Territory, and Population</title> 6. </note>Thought of in
                    this way, the first sentence of Austen’s novel allows us to see, through the
                    interplay of the universal and the particular, how larger universalist
                    categorizations like species begin to intersect with the personalized subject.
                    Since students are indeed aware of the times of planetary peril in which we live
                    (despite what depressing poll numbers might assert), illuminating this
                    cross-section—of them as individuals and as members of a group engaged in
                    collective life—seems not only useful but maybe even necessary. As one example,
                    Romanticist Timothy Morton argues that the concept of Romantic irony is crucial
                    to changing our thinking about climate change because it provides us the needed
                    distance to look at ourselves and examine our attitudes and actions (Morton 19,
                    172-173). Given that rich patriarchal societies are most responsible for climate
                    change, our exploration of the gender and class implications proliferating from
                    this sentence intersects here as well. And while it is perhaps silly if not
                    self-indulgent to place so much weight on one sentence and one lesson, as a
                    popular phrase from modern feminism instructs us, “the personal is the
                    political.” Consequently, if the biggest challenge we face as a species is the
                    climate crisis, then it may well be the case that extending “the personal” to
                    embrace “the species” is the crucial step to “the political” now. Thoughts like
                    these are beyond the stated scope of this exercise, but it may well be that, in
                    some unknowable personal future for a given student, that this exercise will
                    help them ponder their own historical embodiments and individuation and maybe
                    even, correspondingly, to ponder political solutions to the problems our species
                    continues to not only face but cause. </p>
