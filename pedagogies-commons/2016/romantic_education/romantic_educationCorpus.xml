            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount"> This paper investigates the didactic and pedagogic values of
                    Romantic realism by looking at the ways in which Wollstonecraft and Smith, in
                    particular, experiment with the synthesis of Romance and history and how these
                    experiments form the core of their pedagogical projects undertaken within the
                    growing genre of children’s prose. Wollstonecraft’s and Smith’s productions for
                    young readers address the anxiety about women’s ability to employ historical
                    fact and realism in serious literature and replace women’s “state of perpetual
                    childhood” with the powerful roles of educator and arbitrator. But these authors
                    also help create a hybrid genre that allows them to temper history with the
                    attractiveness of Romance and to elevate fiction by infusing it with realism,
                    thus turning fiction into a medium that can address history, society, and all
                    aspects of “real life” as it acts as a powerful pedagogical tool on young minds.

               <p>Mary Wollstonecraft’s second published work, <title level="m">Original Stories
                        from Real Life; with Conversations, Calculated to Regulate the Affections,
                        and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness</title> (1788), was her first
                    commercial literary success, running into six editions over twelve years and
                    establishing her reputation as an authority on both childhood education and
                    literature for children. However, despite its contemporary success, <title level="m">Original Stories</title>
                  <note place="foot" resp="editors">It is
                        also interesting to note that when the work <emph>is</emph> cited—as in for
                        example Alan Richardson’s <title level="m">Literature, Education, and
                            Romanticism: Reading as Social Practice, 1780-1832</title> (1994),
                        perhaps the most extensive treatment of the subject thus far—the title is
                        usually elided to simply “<title level="m">Original Stories</title>”, thus
                        de-emphasizing the work’s apparent preoccupation with realism; for the sake
                        of brevity, however, this essay will hereafter use the same abbreviation.
                    </note> has fallen off the radar of recent critical explorations of romantic-era
                    children’s literature and of romantic views of childhood, perhaps mentioned in
                    passing or relegated to a footnote while whole chapters are devoted to the works
                    of Maria Edgeworth, William Wordsworth, Hannah More, or Sarah Trimmer. It is
                    frequently dismissed as an anomalous example of a radical writer producing
                    apparently conservative and apolitical work for children (see: Mary V. Jackson
                    and Geoffrey Summerfield, among others<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                        his study’s very first mention of Wollstonecraft’s work is to claim that
                            “<title level="m">Original Stories</title> has a strong claim to be the
                        most sinister, ugly, overbearing book for children ever published. It is
                        permeated by a grim, humorless, tyrannical spirit of hectoring and
                        unswerving spiritual and mental rectitude—all in the name of healthy growth:
                        a dream of reason producing, indeed, a veritable monster in the form of Mrs.
                        Mason” (229). </note>) or as a mere illustration within discussions of
                    radical writers for adults who “also” wrote for children. The role that
                    Wollstonecraft’s works for children played in the veritable explosion of
                    literature for children in the last two decades of the eighteenth century has
                    yet to be explored fully.</p>
               <p>However, no attention whatsoever has yet been focused on <title level="m">Original Stories</title>’ own generic hybridity and the implications that
                    such hybridity has both on the way we read the <title level="m">Stories</title>
                    themselves and on the ways in which we can place that work within
                    Wollstonecraft’s body of work and amongst the parallel productions of her
                    contemporaries. <title level="m">Original Stories</title> is a unique amalgam
                    that owes a part of its makeup to the popular moral tales for children (from the
                    works produced by John Newbery earlier in the century through the newer
                    productions of writers like Trimmer and Anna Barbauld) but also draws on
                    elements of romance (as we shall see, a controversial subject for children’s
                    reading) and the so-called “romance of real life,” a genre identified by Michael
                    Gamer and popularized in part by Wollstonecraft’s contemporaries Charlotte Smith
                    and Maria Edgeworth. Even the most cursory glance at Wollstonecraft’s work’s
                    title hints at its generic heterogeneity. “Original stories” suggests an
                    imaginative source, while the phrase “from real life” seems to make the
                    paradoxical claim that the stories are both empirically true and verifiable
                    while at the same time “original” creations. The next portion of the title
                    informs us that these “stories” contain “conversations,” again implying a
                    quasi-journalistic truth claim, while “calculated,” “regulated,” and “form” all
                    suggest that this is a book with a premeditated mission and pedagogical purpose.
                    Finally “affections,” “mind,” “truth,” and “goodness” all present the qualities
                    and entities that Wollstonecraft’s project aims either to instill or improve and
                    are themes she will return to in later works, including the attempt in <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> to carve out a space
                    for the rational female mind capable of housing both “affections” and reason. </p>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">Original Stories </title>is not Wollstonecraft’s only work that
                    presents a vexed relationship between different genres, and specifically between
                    the antipodal pulls of realism and romanticism, rationality and imagination:
                    note for example the generic funambulism in <title level="m">Maria: or, The
                        Wrongs of Woman</title> (1798) between romance’s impossibly dramatic
                    characters (represented by the gothic sufferer Maria and her improbable prison
                    romance) and passages of stark realism (as in Jemima’s chillingly realistic
                    narratives of society’s underbelly). Wollstonecraft’s published works encompass
                    the genres of “thoughts,” a “view,” and “letters,” and the self-presentations of
                    the two <title level="m">Vindications</title> as explorations of the realities
                    of contemporary society are offset by the sense of novelistic un-reality
                    proclaimed by the title of the pseudo-autobiographical <title level="m">Mary: a
                        Fiction</title> (1788); clearly Wollstonecraft was no stranger to generic
                    experimentation. But her participation in the genre of “tales” or “romances of
                    real life” (itself a generic hybrid) in her only original work aimed at children
                    suggests a particular set of ideological assumptions regarding the didactic and
                    pedagogic values of realism. The fact that this questioning of genres was of
                    particular interest to the period’s women writers, coupled with the fact that,
                    as Mitzi Meyers demonstrates, women were not only the principal producers of
                    literature for children, but also among the leading educational theorists of the
                    day, suggests that an exploration of precisely what Wollstonecraft intended with
                    her “original,” instructive stories “from real life” aimed at children might
                    help clarify not only Wollstonecraft’s own literary and philosophical projects
                    but also the growing genre in which her <title level="m">Original
                        Stories</title> participates. When we consider that Charlotte Smith’s <title level="m">The Romance of Real Life</title> was published in 1787, at the
                    time Wollstonecraft was writing her <title level="m">Original Stories</title>,
                    and that Wollstonecraft was familiar with Smith’s work due to the former’s
                    position as a reviewer for <title level="m">The Analytical Review</title>,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Though Wollstonecraft did not review<title level="m">The Romance of Real Life</title>, she did review Smith’s
                            <title level="m">Emmeline</title> (1788), <title level="m">Ethelinde</title> (1789), <title level="m">Celestina</title> (1791),

                        99; 120; 141; 152; 255). Although Wollstonecraft and Smith knew and admired
                        each other’s work, it is unlikely they ever met or corresponded (Stanton 51;
                        Todd <title level="m">Revolutionary</title> xx).</note> the lines of
                    association between <title level="m">Original Stories</title> and the romance of
                    real life genre become clearer. Reading Wollstonecraft’s collection of stories
                    “from real life” as simultaneously a comment on, expansion of, and conversation
                    with Smith’s recent collection of stories “of real life” will help illuminate
                    the generic experimentation of each.</p>
               <p>The identification of the romance of real life as not only a genre distinct from
                    the novel but as a sort of anti-novel in which the excesses of romance are
                    “corrected” by an attempted synthesis with history (that most dignified of
                    discourses) suggests the period’s unease regarding the novel’s status and
                    respectability, especially when it is produced or consumed by women (Gamer,
                    “Romance” 237). The shifting role of women as both writers and readers of novels
                    and the dangers of women’s allegedly innate sensibility are subjects to which
                    Wollstonecraft turns her attention in the second <title level="m">Vindication
                    </title>and in its claims that the “exquisite sensibility” that women are
                    encouraged to cultivate and the novels they are taught to swoon over relegate
                    them to a “state of perpetual childhood” (9). Women authors of the 1780s had to
                    contend not only with the usual questions of respectability that troubled any
                    professional woman writer but also with the perception that the novel was a
                    genre particularly dangerously suited to women’s acute sensibility. This
                    conflict between women writers’ attraction to the novel as a new and accessible
                    discourse (for it required no formal training or knowledge of classical
                    languages) and the sense that, despite the earlier success of Frances Burney and
                    Sarah Fielding, women’s suitability to the genre was questionable, inspired the
                    experimentation with a new genre that merged the entertainment value of the
                    romance or novel with the respectable and edifying genre of history.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> William Godwin’s “Of History and Romance”
                        (1797), though written a decade after the period discussed here, seems to
                        have been influenced by this sense of conflict and debate between history
                        and novels that surrounded his future wife’s early career.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Another motivation for women to present their writing as something with direct
                    ties to historical fact is related to Myers’s claims that the popularity of both
                    moral tales and children’s literature with women writers was an attempt to
                    appropriate the realm of education as a domestic (and thus feminine) concern
                    and, concurrently, to gain recognition in the world of letters that was in the
                    1780s and early 1790s still very much a masculine realm. Insisting that the
                    tales they tell— even the apparently “romantic” ones—are drawn from real life
                    imparts to women writers a certain palpable authority and prevents them from
                    becoming mere “novelists.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Cf. Maria
                        Edgeworth’s reluctance to call her own works “novels” (Gamer, “Romance”
                        235). </note> If we recognize the proliferation of so-called realistic
                    romances among early romantic women writers as a defensive fusion of romance
                    with private memoirs, domestic biographies, and other allegedly ahistorical
                    discourses in an attempt to attain the authority of truth, we are invited to
                    read any such self-proclaimed real-life tales as an attempt at
                    self-ratification. For example, although Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Stories</title> do not label themselves as “romances” per se, her title’s
                    emphasis on both originality <title level="m">and </title>realistic mimesis
                    suggest this same sort of self-conscious acknowledgement of the apparent
                    difficulties of the female writer to duplicate faithfully the world around
                    her.</p>
               <p>Smith’s preface to <title level="m">The Romance of Real Life</title> provides as
                    clear and revealing a summary as one could seek of these tensions surrounding
                    one writer’s forays into the seemingly incompatible genres of romance and
                    history. In Smith’s case, she finds both genres lacking for her purpose and
                    instead constructs a hybrid discourse that borrows aspects from each genre and
                    is simultaneously both and neither: <quote>A Literary friend, whose opinion I
                        greatly value, suggested to me the possibility of producing a few little
                        volumes, that might prove as attractive as the most romantic fiction, and
                        yet convey all the solid instruction of genuine history. He affirmed, that
                        the voluminous and ill-written work, entitled <title level="m">Les Causes
                            Célébres</title>, might furnish me with very ample materials for so
                        desirable a purpose. He advised me to select such stories from this
                        collection, as, though disfigured by the affectation and bad taste of the
                        compiler, Guyot [<emph>sic</emph>] de Pitaval, might lead us to form awful
                        ideas of the force and danger of the human passions. He wished me to
                        consider myself as under no restriction, but that of adhering to
                        authenticated facts; and by telling each story in my own way, to render it
                        as much as possible an interesting lesson of morality. (129<note place="foot" resp="editors"> All citations of Smith are from the
                            Pickering &amp; Chatto edition (2005). </note>)</quote> Perhaps the
                    first thing that strikes the reader is the female writer’s reliance on the
                    unnamed, male, “Literary friend” (identified by Gamer as William Hayley; 298)
                    whose guidance she seems to solicit or even require. It is this friend who
                    proposes the project, suggests the source text, and advised the author how and
                    in what style she ought to proceed (three of the paragraph’s four sentences
                    begin with the male friend’s proclamations: “He affirmed […] He advised […] He
                    wished”). Such apparent deference on the part of a fledgling female writer (who
                    had produced only one other prose work, a translation of Prèvost’s <title level="m">Manon Lescaut</title>, in the previous year) might be
                    understandable if not for the fact that, although new to prose, Smith was
                    already a well-established literary figure by 1787. <title level="m">Elegiac
                        Sonnets</title>
                  <note place="foot" resp="editors"> It is perhaps worth noting
                        that the “elegiac sonnet” is itself a sort of hybrid not unlike the romance
                        of real life, suggesting that Smith’s drive towards generic innovation and
                        experimentation does not begin and end with her 1787 prose work.
                        Furthermore, a case could be made that Smith’s later works for
                            children—<title level="m">Rural Walks</title> (1795), <title level="m">Rambles Farther </title>(1796), <title level="m">Minor Morals</title>
                        (1798), and <title level="m">Conversations, Introducing Poetry
                        </title>(1804) —are in fact influenced by the same generic experimentation
                        and sense of “romantic realism” in Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Original Stories</title> that I here argue that she, in turn, derived
                        from Smith’s early works, but the limited scope of this essay prevents an
                        in-depth discussion of works by Smith that followed <title level="m">Original Stories</title>. However, since an extensive study of Smith’s
                        work for children has not yet been written, the apparent exchange between
                        these two authors regarding the pedagogical effect of realism certainly
                        suggests one avenue of inquiry. </note> had been an immediate commercial and
                    critical success when it was released in 1784 and by 1787 was already in its
                    fourth English edition, meaning that Smith was by no means a novice to the book
                    trade. So why, one might wonder, does this capable and successful author seem to
                    defer to a male preceptor? Her translator’s preface to <title level="m">Manon
                        Lescaut</title>, in contrast, is authoritative with its claims that she
                    herself found the original novel in Normandy and amused some English friends by
                    masterfully translating passages extempore. She also proudly declares the
                    liberties she has taken with the text, including lengthening the short sentences
                    she finds “so unpleasant to the English ear,” altering the narrative structure,
                    and eliding many “trite” and repetitive passages (5), claims which all suggest
                    an author in command of her source material and comfortable with her authority.
                    However, <title level="m">Manon Lescaut </title>was published anonymously—its
                    title page simply proclaiming itself “A French Story”—and the preface contains
                    no tell-tale pronouns or details; indeed, the public seems to have assumed that
                    the translator was male (Fletcher 84). The fact that <title level="m">The
                        Romance of Real Life</title> was Smith’s first work in prose to feature her
                    name on the title page might have contributed to the fact that the beginning of
                    its preface seems to defer to masculine literary authority.</p>
               <p> However, this apparent obsequiousness is more complicated than it first appears,
                    and as the preface progresses this sense of deference falls away and is replaced
                    by the same confident, authoritative tone that characterizes Smith’s earlier,
                    anonymous preface. The “Literary friend” is never again mentioned, and Smith is
                    openly critical not only of the original (male) author, Gayot de Pitaval
                    (claiming that “the style of the original is frequently obscure; the facts are
                    often anticipated, and often repeated, in almost the same words, in different
                    parts of the story,” among many other complaints) but also of a new edition of
                    the same work by François Richer, claiming that his work is “less interesting”
                    and less accurate than her own. Her announcement that Richer has produced
                    another, inferior French version of “<emph>my</emph> original” (emphasis added)
                    suggests the degree to which she saw herself as “owning” the text she had
                    completely rewritten. The “great pleasure” she has taken in the work, despite
                    its many complexities and roadblocks, is repeatedly emphasized. Even as the
                    difficulties of her task had begun to overwhelm her, she claims, she kept in
                    sight the potential usefulness of her project, and it is this mission that made
                    the experience pleasurable: <quote>Yet it occurred to me, that the reason which

                        a celebrated publication, without wading thro’ the obscurities and

                    (forgive the pun) moment in the preface, a moment in which the author emerges
                    from the passive figure that occupied the first paragraph, and an emergence that
                    centers not only on her rejection of the authoritative original she is adapting
                    but also on her ambition that the book have instructional value. While the
                    author’s reliance on her male friend might be the first noteworthy feature of
                    the preface, it is by no means its only one; in fact, when read in light of the
                    remainder of the preface, the first paragraph’s agenda becomes clearer and, I
                    would argue, considerably less straightforward than it first appeared. Although
                    the spectre of the Literary friend’s influence hovers throughout the opening
                    paragraph, the claims that Smith herself is making for both her own agency and
                    for her project’s pedagogical purpose begin to surface with her statement that
                    “by telling each story in [her] own way, [she will] render it as much as
                    possible an interesting lesson of morality.” This discovery of her “own way” in
                    which to remake these frivolous French tales signals her intention of making
                    these stories “both interesting and instructive,” unlike “romantic fiction”
                    (which is “attractive,” but, it is implied, not instructive) and “genuine
                    history” (which contains “solid instruction,” but less attraction). Since
                    neither mode of discourse is entirely satisfactory, she will make her own by
                    “adhering to authenticated facts” while at the same time “telling each story in
                    [her] own way.” This hybrid that she has created—part attractive romantic
                    fiction, part “genuine history”—is presented as an improvement not only over the
                    forty-year old original that was “disfigured by the affectation and bad taste”
                    of its creator (or was, in other words, factually accurate but stylistically
                    flawed), but also the new version by Richer unmixed with romance and therefore
                    “less interesting.” Smith is not claiming that romance and history are mutually
                    exclusive, rather that neither side tells the entire story, or tells the story
                    in a way that makes it attractive and, therefore, useful as a moral instructor.
                    This is the impetus behind her unique title that was to launch a thousand
                    spin-offs, for “the romance of real life” is nowhere close to a faithful
                    translation of the original French title, <title level="m">Les Causes
                        Célébres</title>. Smith is clearly not aiming for an accurate translation of
                    the title, but rather a transformation of it, whereby the two elements that she
                    sees as necessary for a literary work’s instructive value—that the tales be true
                    (because nothing is as educational as experiencing the “real”), but are told as
                    if they were fiction (because nothing is as satisfying as a good read)—combine
                    to form a palatable mixture of fiction and reality. If a work is (or even claims
                    to be) drawn from real life, the lessons that can be gleaned from it are almost
                    as valuable as actually having the same real-life experience. Readers at home
                    can live through the harrowing adventures of Anglade or Louisa d’Antail, and,
                    through the virtue of a sensibility that would relate their feelings of empathy
                    to <emph>real people</emph>
                  <emph>who actually existed</emph>, they might feel deeply for them and learn
                    from the sufferers’ examples as if they were their own experiences. Smith’s
                    brief and modest-seeming preface is in fact a watershed moment for the generic
                    conventions of prose. It is the introduction of realism into romance, of history
                    into fiction, and its central claim that this hybridity is necessary in order to
                    produce a work of prose “both interesting and instructive” (and the implied
                    claim that this is what good prose should aim to do) signal a new way of
                    thinking about the purpose of writing.</p>
               <p> It is perhaps no coincidence that Smith—herself a mother—comes to this
                    revelation at the same time that the English public is becoming obsessed with
                    the child reader. Due in part to the new availability of cheap paper, a
                    subsequent upsurge in publishing activity, and increased literacy rates among
                    all classes, the last decades of the eighteenth century saw an unprecedented
                    interest in producing printed material aimed at children, material that often
                    came loaded with ideology. From Hannah More’s <title level="m">Cheap Repository
                        Tracts </title>that preached duty, obedience, and conformity to prevalent
                    social values to the piously conservative works of Sarah Trimmer, the new
                    literature available to children was obsessed with what sorts of lessons
                    children might glean from the written word. Too much romance or fancy, even in
                    the form of chapbook fairy tales, was seen as dangerous to young unformed minds
                    in a way that should remind us of the period’s anxiety about the effect fiction
                    might have on the similarly immature minds of women (as in Wollstonecraft’s
                    claim that women are being relegated to a “state of perpetual childhood”).
                    Imagination was a dangerous quality to cultivate, since it taught children to
                    imagine worlds other than the one in which they were born into—a world in which,
                    for example, Little Goody Two-Shoes can rise from poverty through schooling,
                    become a governess, and marry a rich nobleman—and introduced them to the notion
                    of choice, the idea that their destinies were in their hands and that any ragged
                    child could, through hard work, virtue, and a bit of luck, become a prince or
                    princess. Thus in class-bound England, especially in the years after the French
                    Revolution, imagination suggested radical democratic ideals and
                    leveling—dangerous concepts in a society in which literacy rates were rising in
                    the lower classes and Paine’s <title level="m">Rights of Man</title> (1791) was
                    a runaway best-seller. In 1802 Trimmer founded the <title level="m">Guardian of
                        Education</title>, a version of the <title level="m">Anti-Jacobin
                        Review</title> specifically aimed at rooting out subversive elements in
                    children’s literature. The world of romance and imagination was seen by many as
                    singularly unfit for childish consumption (just as too much novel-reading would
                    corrupt their silly mothers), and books for children were thought to require a
                    strong moral stance and firm basis in real life, where animals do not talk and
                    poor little girls never become fine ladies.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        This was clearly not the case for everyone—Godwin, Coleridge, Wordsworth,
                        and Lamb provide famous defenses of fairy tales, chapbooks, ballads, and
                        imaginative literature for children—but the market indicates that it was the
                        case for most consumers: More, Trimmer, and Barbauld were huge
                        sellers.</note>
               </p>
               <p> However, as Smith notes in the preface discussed above, “solid instruction”
                    itself is not sufficient to retain the interest of any reader, young or old,
                    without some of the attraction of “romantic fiction.” It is this happy medium
                    that Wollstonecraft tries to deliver with her <title level="m">Original Stories
                        from Real Life</title>, an attempt to synthesize the moral instruction that
                    many, including Wollstonecraft, felt that children need while also providing
                    them with the elements of fiction and story-telling that they desire. Although a
                    lack of definitive proof in the form of reviews or letters makes it impossible
                    to prove that Wollstonecraft read Smith’s <title level="m">Romance of Real
                        Life</title> in the year in which she was composing <title level="m">Original Stories</title>, the complementary titles alone would suggest
                    that, even if no direct influence exists, the two writers were at least drawing
                    from the same ideological pool. Regardless, it is highly likely that
                    Wollstonecraft <emph>did</emph> indeed read Smith’s work in 1787; in that year
                    Wollstonecraft left her position as a governess in Ireland and headed to London,
                    where she became a member of Joseph Johnson’s circle and immersed herself in
                    literary life, and due to her position with <title level="m">The Analytical
                        Review</title> she had already reviewed Smith’s work as early as July 1788.
                    Even without a definite provenance, however, it is clear that both Smith and
                    Wollstonecraft had in mind similar reexaminations of the generic conventions of
                    prose and ideas regarding the pedagogical import of realism. Their audiences
                    might have differed—Wollstonecraft’s consisting of children (and their parents)
                    in need of moral instruction, and Smith’s the wider reading public—but their
                    motivations and techniques are surprisingly similar. In fact if we bracket the
                    central frame of <title level="m">Original Stories</title>—Mrs. Mason’s
                    storytelling and careful manipulation of situations that allow her charges to
                    experience the stories of others—its similarities to Smith’s <title level="m">Romance</title> become striking: both works feature a collection of
                    disjointed tales that illustrate well-defined morals and are presented as
                    historically and factually true accounts of real experiences colored with an
                    imaginative cast. </p>
               <p> Wollstonecraft’s preface immediately delineates the text’s purpose and testifies
                    to its necessity: <quote>These conversations and tales are accommodated to the
                        present state of society; which obliges the author to attempt to cure those
                        faults by reason, which ought never to have taken root in the infant mind.
                        Good habits, imperceptibly fixed, are far preferable to the precepts of
                        reason; but, as this task requires more judgment than generally falls to the
                        lot of parents, substitutes may be sought for, and medicines given, when
                        regimen would have answered the purpose much better. (359)<note place="foot" resp="editors"> All quotations from<title level="m">Original

                  </quote> Wollstonecraft clearly presents hers as a
                    modern project, addressed to “the present state of society” and necessary to
                    combat the insidious forces implanting themselves, weed-like, into the “infant
                    minds” of the next generation. In a later paragraph Wollstonecraft essentially
                    dismisses contemporary parents, noting that they have their “own passions to
                    combat with, and fastidious pleasures to pursue” and are therefore too busy to
                    tend to their children’s moral education themselves; she proposes that we
                    address our efforts to salvaging the succeeding generation, which might yet be
                    taught the virtue their parents lack.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Joseph
                        Johnson apparently found this passage too incendiary and asked
                        Wollstonecraft to amend it; she refused, writing that “thought your remarks
                        are generally judicious—I cannot<emph>now </emph>concur with you, I mean in
                        respect to the preface, and have not altered it. I hate the usual smooth way
                        of exhibiting proud humility. A general rule <emph>only </emph>extends to
                        the majority—and, believe me, the few judicious parents who may peruse the
                        book, will not feel themselves hurt—and the weak are too vain to mind what
                        is said in a book intended for children […] If parents attended to their
                        children, I would not have written the stories; for, what are books—compared
                        to conversations which affection inforces!” (Todd, <title level="m">Letters</title> 142-143).</note> The picture she paints of frivolous,
                    inattentive parents—and for “parents” we can safely read “mothers”—is one to
                    which she will return in the second <title level="m">Vindication</title> and its
                    claims that women schooled in sensibility and manners but lacking common sense,
                    practical training, or any knowledge beyond the parlor or nursery leads to a
                    weakened society.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> “The conclusion that I wish
                        to draw, is obvious; make women rational creatures, and free citizens, and
                        they will quickly become good wives, and mothers” (<title level="m">Vindication</title> 178). It is noteworthy that “Wollstonecraft was
                        meticulously revising the 1788 first edition [of <title level="m">Original
                            Stories</title>]—word by word, line by line—while <title level="m">Rights of Woman</title> was gestating in her head” (Myers 40).</note>
                    The fourth paragraph of the preface even claims that the text—written in a
                    mature style which, she acknowledges, might be “not quite on a level with the
                    capacity of a child”—might be as useful to the adult who would read it aloud to
                    the child as to that child itself: “The Conversations are intended to assist the
                    teacher as well as the pupil.” This statement—along with the fact that, indeed,
                    the style is hardly childish, and many of the situations mature—suggests that
                    Wollstonecraft’s intended audience might be wider than it first appears; a
                    second glance at the full title discovers that children are nowhere mentioned,
                    and it is not “childish minds” but “the mind” that the title claims to “form.”
                    The fact that the text was published by J. Johnson, a house not yet known in
                    1788 for its juvenile productions, would have contributed to the impression that
                    this was a text for all, offering instruction not only to children but to their
                    parents as well.</p>
               <p> The method Wollstonecraft chooses to promote reason to the next generation takes
                    a form similar to that which we have seen previously. She has already in the
                    preface’s opening sentence claimed that the work to follow will be comprised of
                    “conversations and tales” and notes in its final sentence that “the Tales which
                    were written to illustrate the moral, may recall it, when the mind has gained
                    sufficient strength to discuss the argument from which it was deduced” (360)—in
                    other words, the tales are the instruments with which an attentive reader might
                    arrive at the real-life lesson, much as Smith’s “attractive” fictional style was
                    the means of delivering her real-life lessons. Wollstonecraft’s preface makes
                    another similar claim: <quote>The way to render instruction most useful cannot
                        always be adopted; knowledge should be gradually imparted, and flow more
                        from example than teaching: example directly addresses the senses, the first
                        inlets to the heart; and the improvement of those instruments of the
                        understanding is the object education should have constantly in view, and
                        over which we have most power. (359) </quote> This idea that unadulterated
                    “instruction” is not always the best method of teaching, that sometimes
                    “examples” that address the “senses” and “heart” are more effective vehicles of
                    education and refinement, echoes Smith’s claims for the insufficiency of “solid
                    instruction” alone. Elsewhere in her preface Wollstonecraft notes that the
                    “affections”—highlighted in the work’s subtitle—are the forces that should “warm
                    the heart, and animate the conduct,” suggesting the same interest that Smith
                    demonstrates in the sensory processing of literature. Again, the reader is
                    presented as engaging in the same sort of relationship with the text whereby the
                    experiences he or she reads about will affect their sensibilities in the same
                    way as would actual lived or directly observed experiences. The idea that
                    reading these stories—or having them read out loud—will do as much good for any
                    child as they did for Mary and Caroline is ratified by <title level="m">Original
                        Stories</title>’ last chapter, in which Mrs Mason presents her charges with
                    a book—presumably <emph>the </emph>book, <title level="m">Original
                        Stories</title> itself—recording all of their adventures and conversations
                    and claims that it will act as a substitute for their real-life guide; she then
                    asks that the girls write to her, but only if they record “the genuine
                    sentiments of [their] hearts,” which suggests confidence that that such things
                    can truly be duplicated in a letter. The belief that the written word can
                    faithfully replicate the truest expressions of heart and mind is perhaps not a
                    new one, but what <emph>is</emph> new here is the concept that this direct line
                    between heart and pen can serve a useful purpose, that sensibility might be put
                    into the service of morality.</p>
               <p> The structure of <title level="m">Original Stories</title> demonstrates this
                    concept. Having observed a moral shortcoming in one or both of her charges, Mrs
                    Mason orchestrates a scenario in which she can offer a counter-example; for
                    instance, after seeing the girls kill insects, Mrs Mason makes an elaborate show
                    of walking off the path and into the wet grass to avoid stepping on a line of
                    snails. After offering a brief homily on the topic, she then tells a series of
                    short accounts of other people’s experiences in similar situations, often using
                    only vague descriptions and no proper names; on the issue of cruelty to animals,
                    anonymous accounts of puppy-drowning and guinea-pig-torture ensue. Up until this
                    point, the <title level="m">Stories</title>’ pedagogical project is fairly
                    straightforward: the girls are <emph>told</emph> that what they are doing is
                    wrong, and they are offered examples of how other people erred in the same way
                    in order to shame them into a different behavior. It is the final step in Mrs
                    Mason’s program of moral education that supports the claims Wollstonecraft makes
                    in the preface regarding the necessity of knowledge that flows from example and
                    hinges on sensibility and affection: the girls are plunged into the actual and
                    are taken to view real relics or meet real people whose true stories ratify
                    their tutor’s tales. Standing before crazy Robin’s cave, Mrs Mason relates the
                    story of the man she actually knew, assisted, and even wept with over the body
                    of his murdered dog, serving as an eyewitness to the events she describes. This
                    “real life” example is shown as making an immediate impression on the girls:
                    “Was that the cave? asked Mary. They ran to it. Poor Robin! Did you ever hear of
                    any thing so cruel!” (376). Mrs Mason’s presentation of the actual Robin’s cave
                    produces a reaction in Mary and Caroline far more marked than any of her stories
                    and examples ever had, demonstrating the pedagogical value of the real. Not
                    coincidently, this move from story into reality is also the point in each “real
                    life” example that elements of romance and sensibility are the most marked. The
                    account of Robin standing over the bed containing his dead children is a scene
                    ripped straight from the pages of a sentimental novel and engineered to elicit
                    its audience’s tears: <quote>The poor father, who was now bereft of all his
                        children, hung over their bed in speechless anguish; not a groan or a tear
                        escaped from him, whilst he stood, two or three hours, in the same attitude,
                        looking at the dead bodies of his little darlings. (375)</quote> In these
                    examples, pathos is key, demonstrating Wollstonecraft’s theory that sentiment
                    can inspire genuine moral reformation, both in Mary and Caroline and in the
                    readers of <title level="m">Original Stories</title> (for these are also
                    presented to the readers as tales “<emph>from Real Life</emph>,” just as the
                    introduction presents Mary and Caroline as real little girls with a true
                    history). The rest of the collection continues in much the same vein: a failing
                    in the girls is identified, a lecture laced with religious instruction is given,
                    a “real life” story is told, and some sort of proof, often in the form of the
                    person himself or herself, is produced. Throughout <title level="m">Original
                        Stories</title>, the real person, place, or experience is consistently
                    portrayed as a force that supports the stories people tell. As in Smith’s
                    conception of the romance of real life, historical fact and storytelling are
                    complementary, rather than contradictory, concepts. Whenever Mrs Mason tells a
                    character’s history, real-life details ratify her version, and when those
                    stories are told, they are told in a manner that borrows conventions of romance
                    and sensibility to make the tale even more affecting, sympathetic, and thus
                    instructive. </p>
               <p> One aspect of Wollstonecraft’s work less present in Smith’s is the recurrent
                    preoccupation with religious duty and salvation, a characteristic that has
                    erroneously led many critics to align Wollstonecraft with the many religious
                    writers for children, including the aforementioned More and Trimmer, with whom
                    Wollstonecraft had nothing else in common (and quite a bit at odds). The fact
                    that the lessons Mrs Mason attempts to instill in Mary and Caroline are so often
                    related to questions of Christian virtue suggests another layer of meaning to
                    Wollstonecraft’s pedagogical aims. The idea that a book can be a vehicle for the
                    dissemination of life lessons of course suggests the Protestant belief in the
                    value of individual bible study, and Mrs Mason’s presentation to the girls of a
                    book full of stories meant to “[illustrate] the instruction it contains” is
                    clearly reminiscent of the New Testament. In fact, Mrs Mason herself is
                    frequently and insistently portrayed as a Christ figure whose stories redeem the
                    fallen girls, who are certainly no angels in the opening chapters. Even the
                    “contents” page, with its list of chapter titles like “The Inconveniences of
                    immoderate Indulgence” and “The Danger of Delay” suggests a collection of
                    sermons or biblical parables. Mrs Mason repeatedly stresses that the way to do
                    the most good in the world is by imitating God: <quote>
                     <lg>
                        <l>The greatest pleasure life affords [is] that of resembling God, by
                                doing good. (368)</l>
                        <l>You ought, by doing good, to imitate Him. (370)</l>
                        <l>I now daily contemplate His wonderful goodness; and, though at an
                                awful distance, try to imitate Him. (423)</l>
                        <l>We are His children when we try to resemble Him. (431)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> William Blake clearly picks up on Mrs Mason’s messianic fervor
                    when he illustrates her in the frontispiece of the third edition with her arms
                    spreading over the heads of her young charges, simultaneously a mother hen
                    sheltering her brood and a Christ figure framed in a cross-like doorway, vines
                    piercing her outstretched palms (fig. 1). While the preface claims that
                    children’s introduction to true religion must come from a recognition of the
                    “Universal Father” whom they will then wish to imitate, we see the girls awed by
                    the all-seeing eye of their guardian and expressing a desire to imitate not God,
                    but Mrs Mason herself, the text’s divine substitute—“I wish to be a woman, said
                    Mary, and to be like Mrs Mason” (389). The idea that the real life of earthly
                    existence is but preparation for a heavenly home—that the “Most High is
                    educating us for eternity” (437)—lends an added urgency to the text’s stated
                    goal to “form the mind to truth and goodness.” Patricia Demers claims that Evangelical writers like
                    Wollstonecraft’s near-contemporary Mary Martha Butt Sherwood—one of a group
                    Demers dubs “Romantic Evangelicals”—adopt a method of “seeing into the life of
                    things, without contradiction or irony” which is “simultaneously domestic and
                    eschatological” (131).</p>

               <p>  As a result, <quote>Their characters’ zeal in finding and
                        defining an earthly home prompts their almost automatic longing for a
                        heavenly home. Theirs is a consciously double vision, glimpsing the eternal
                        in the natural, the sublime in the quotidian. (131)</quote> This “glimpsing
                    the eternal in the natural” is one of the activities that Wollstonecraft
                    repeatedly portrays Mrs Mason doing, and the idea that the text prepares one for
                    real life, which then in turn prepares one for eternal life, is one that the
                    character often trumpets. While there are some problems with aligning
                    Wollstonecraft too closely to a group of writers with which she has little in
                    common, the implication that Christianity yields a way of looking at real life
                    as a heavenly preamble is important to bear in mind when considering <title level="m">Original Stories</title>, a book which repeatedly presents itself
                    as being concerned with Christian morality. The idea that real life is an
                    important pedagogical tool because its lessons help us not only to become better
                    citizens but also fit “to be angels hereafter,” with “a nobler employment in our
                    Father’s kingdom” (371-2) and that Mrs Mason’s real-life tales and illustrations
                    help Mary and Caroline not only to become better girls, but to become Christians
                    and, eventually, angels is quite a burden to attach to any one text. </p>
               <p>It is this idea of the “sublime in the quotidian” and the potentially salvific
                    powers of woman on which I would like to end by tying together the various
                    strains of ideology surrounding the blending of the genres of “real life” and
                    “romance,” “factual” and “imaginary,” that we have seen occurring in Smith’s and
                    Wollstonecraft’s texts. Even putting aside her many Christological qualities,
                    Mrs Mason is an extraordinary female character to emerge from the 1780s: an
                    independent landlord, munificent mistress, beloved pillar of her community, and
                    unwavering moral guide. Her strict yet maternal presence portrays her as
                    inhabiting what were in Wollstonecraft’s time two seemingly disparate spheres:
                    the mother/woman, and the serious moral agent. Myers argues that, in fact,
                    Wollstonecraft and her generation of writers for children (which would include
                    Smith, who published <title level="m">Rural Walks</title> only seven years after
                    the publication of <title level="m">Original Stories</title>) introduced the
                    idea of “everyday female heroism” and the notion of the “heroic potential
                    available in ordinary female life” (34; 50). Traditionally relegated to home and
                    garden, women writers found new sources of inspiration, and their production of
                    literature for children that reflected those sources spread them to the next
                    generation. From the sense of anxiety regarding women’s ability to address
                    historical fact and real life in serious literature sprang a hybrid genre that
                    allowed them not only to temper history with the attractiveness of romance but
                    also to elevate mere “romantic fiction” by infusing it with realism, turning it
                    into something that can address history, society, and all aspects of “real
                    life,” and, due in part to a changing cultural climate that put women in the
                    position of educators, act as a pedagogical tool. There is a clear correlation
                    between this experimentation with realism in the last decades of the eighteenth
                    century and the development of the national tale in the early nineteenth,
                    another hybrid genre that mixes romance and history, pioneered by women writers
                    like Sydney Owenson (<title level="m">The Wild Irish Girl: A National
                        Tale</title>; 1806) and Jane Porter (<title level="m">The Scottish
                        Chiefs</title>; 1809). By the time Sir Walter Scott “invented” the
                    historical novel with <title level="m">Waverly</title> in 1814, he could draw on
                    a rich tradition of texts in which the romantic and the realistic coalesced, a
                    combination that has at its core the generic experimentations of women like
                    Smith and Wollstonecraft.</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">The design of this course is to introduce students to the
                    influence that Digital Humanities is having on our organization of the study of
                    Romanticism. To that end, the course shifts from the traditional survey of major
                    authors, to a survey of Romantic-era publishers, whose publications have only
                    recently become widely available through digitization. While there are
                    opportunities for the close reading of major Romantic texts authored by these
                    publishers, emphasis is placed in the assignments on distant reading of
                    periodicals. Moreover, the course prompts student to reflect on the diverse
                    politics of publication, both in the Romantic era, when independent individuals
                    acquired printing presses and began to advocate for freedom of the press, as
                    well as in the present day, with its diverse concerns over freedom of
                    information, copyrights, privacy, and so on. </p>

               <p>Digital resources are transforming the study of Romanticism, and Romantic
                    pedagogy must keep pace with these changes. Archived materials that have long
                    been inaccessible to students, such as newspapers, diaries, correspondences, are
                    now readily available online; databases of high resolution images scanned are
                    now free; new analytical tools including word searches and image comparisons
                    (see the “Compare” button on the <ref target="http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/public/about/tour/tour.html">Blake
                        Archive</ref> for an example) are proliferating with each passing year,
                    prompting new approaches. In response to these developments, my graduate-level,
                    four-week, online, research seminar on Romanticism takes full advantage of
                    innovations in Digital Humanities that enable and accelerate archival research.
                    A student today can use <title level="a">The Times Digital Archive 1785-2008
                    </title>to quickly identify the first reference to a skylark in the newspaper
                    during the Romantic period (April 20, 1786, 413, pg. 3), how many times it
                    appeared that year in the paper (twice), and whether or not references to
                    skylarks fell off or proliferated in subsequent years (they nearly doubled every
                    following year). This student can then read the articles in which those
                    references appear to achieve a sense of the contemporary attitudes toward that
                    celebrated avian. This sort of brief research assignment was not possible ten
                    years ago, and it has the potential to revolutionize the way students
                    contextualize Romantic literature. My course challenges students to break the
                    habits of reading that traditional anthologies promote and ultimately to expand
                    their sense of who the culturally significant figures in the Romantic era were.
                    More specifically, the aim of this course is to draw attention to the careers of
                    those people who were producers and directors of culture but who have been long
                    neglected because their creations were beyond reproduction in traditional print
                    anthologies. </p>
               <p>I designed my course, <title level="m">Revisiting the Radical Republican
                        Publishers of the Romantic Era in the Digital Era</title>, as an online,
                    summer-intensive workshop for graduate students who have completed introductory
                    graduate coursework as well as courses in English literature. Rather than being
                    an introductory survey of Romantic literature, it can serve as an introduction
                    to the period in a manner that does not include the traditional canon of
                    readings or criticism. My aim is to push students to explore new websites such
                    as: <lg>

                    tendency to decontextualize and thereby depoliticize Romanticism by asking
                    students to use digital resources to explore the tumultuous culture of radical
                    publishers, principally in the 1810s and early 1820s, and to discover how those
                    publishers interacted with the poets and fiction writers.</p>

                  <head>Course Overview</head>
                  <p>“Why crush a starving bookseller?” Percy Shelley furiously wrote Leigh Hunt
                        after Peterloo, because in doing so, he explained, “tyrants […] strike in
                        his person at all of their political enemies” and “divert the attention of
                        the people from obtaining a Reform in their oppressive Government” (<title level="m">Letters </title>73-4). In the wake of the government massacre
                        of reform-seekers in Manchester,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For
                            overviews, see Donald Read for Peterloo and Iain McCalman for radical
                            print culture.</note> the Home Office, in 1819, intensified its campaign
                        of prosecutions to shut down the domestic reform movement and focused their
                        efforts on those who sought to publicize their radical agenda. Despite this
                        crackdown, republican publishers including John Cahuac, Richard Carlile,
                        William Cobbett, Thomas Dolby, William Hone, and Leigh Hunt, fought back.
                        Veterans of government prosecutions, they rallied together to educate the
                        public about the imperative of reform and published their political agenda
                        in diverse forms: nursery rhymes, satirical essays, news reports, lyrical
                        poetry, open letters, lists of corrupt jurors, and caricatures of nearly
                        everyone in the government, including King George IV. They were convinced
                        that if enough people were educated about the need for reform, actual reform
                        would be inevitable. This radical campaign, however, did not survive for
                        long because publishers were divided, imprisoned, transported, or coerced
                        into silence. Because much of the print culture produced was prolific and
                        too costly to republish in an accessible format, it has remained neglected
                        in archives—until these materials were recently digitized.</p>
                  <p>The volatility and passion of the republican publishers in the Romantic
                        period exemplify the vibrancy of radical culture of the era, and this
                        political culture exerted a profound influence on contemporary literary
                        productions. I use Percy Shelley’s <title level="m">The Mask of
                            Anarchy</title> to demonstrate how various aspects of radical culture in
                        1819—politics, philosophy, and rhetoric—permeate the Romantic poetry of that
                        and subsequent years. By exploring the print culture of the era, as Michael
                        Scrivener has done in <title level="m">Radical Shelley</title> (1982), the
                        craft of its major poets becomes more apparent. To reach a broader audience
                        for his 1819 lyrical satire, for example, Shelley deployed ideas, phrases,
                        and particular figures drawn from contemporary sources including Hone’s
                        pamphlets and Hunt’s <title level="m">Examiner</title>. Through such
                        examples, I raise theoretical questions about Romantic poetics,
                        concentrating on originality, genius, invention, combination, and craft by
                        asking students to compare caricatures in <title level="m">The
                            Examiner</title>, <title level="m">Black Dwarf</title>, and the <title level="m">Political Register</title> of such figures as Lords
                        Castlereagh and Sidmouth in relation to Shelley’s caricatures in <title level="m">The Mask of Anarchy</title>. This activity tracks how
                        rhetorical strategies move between popular print culture and high
                        literature. With the new digital resources available to students, it now is
                        possible to explore these questions of poetics in very material ways, by
                        textual comparisons made feasible by digital resources rather than
                        theoretical speculation.</p>
                  <p>It is presently more feasible to explore the practical concerns involved in
                        publication in the late Romantic period. Using <title level="m">The Mask of
                            Anarchy</title> as an example, we discuss Shelley’s request that Leigh
                        Hunt publish in London, although Shelley was in Italy at the time, and
                        Hunt’s decision to suppress the ballad because of threats of government
                        prosecution. Students read the news, follow which publishers were fined,
                        arrested, imprisoned or transported, and thereby gather a sense of the
                        dangers of publication. By studying Romantic publishers, students begin to
                        see past the Romantic disdain for commerce and pragmatism to some of their
                        underlying concerns about their audiences, self-image, government
                        censorship, and financial autonomy, among other considerations.</p>
                  <p>While the major poets of the period drew from contemporary print culture and
                        negotiated with their publishers, a study of the era’s publishers open up
                        deeper issues still. Blake expresses the significance of the link between
                        authorship and publishing in a letter from 1808, having acquired by this
                        time his own press: “I call myself now Independent. I can be Poet Painter
                        &amp; Musician as the Inspiration comes” (“Letter To George Cumberland, 1
                        September 1880,” <ref target="http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/copyinfo.xq?mode=eei_vgroup&amp;group=letters">
                        <title level="m">The William Blake Archives</title>
                     </ref>). Blake’s
                        press gave him freedom, a Romantic concept that regularly conflated the
                        political with the artistic. This course introduces students to the careers
                        and life projects of four English republican publishers of the late
                        eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries who, like the major poets of the
                        period, meditated on political and artistic freedom and were forerunners in
                        the struggle for the freedom of the press: William Blake, Leigh Hunt,
                        William Hone, and William Cobbett. Other significant figures are considered,
                        such as Hannah Moore, Charlotte Smith, the Wordsworths, the Shelleys and
                        Byron, and John Clare, but the aim here is to spotlight a representative
                        group of publishers of the era who fought for a free press. Their
                        convictions prompted them to write, and when their productions were deemed
                        too dangerous for established publishers, all four began personally to
                        publish their writings, often at great personal hazard. It is a tragedy,
                        then, that while historians, literary critics, and teachers have
                        acknowledged the influence of radical publishers in the Romantic era, the
                        careers and publications of these figures have been largely neglected or
                        only mentioned in passing.</p>
                  <p>My summer intensive online course introduces students to Romanticism, print
                        culture studies, and the emergent field of Digital Humanities; a variety of
                        daily tasks are therefore required. Each day, students are check an online
                        for course announcements and instructions, complete required readings (many
                        of which are online), review assignments and conduct database research,
                        write a blog entry, participate in our online seminar discussion threads,
                        and contribute to our shared webliography (identifying and reviewing new
                        digital resources). All of these activities along with my lectures return to
                        three core questions. <lg>
                        <l>1. What is the relationship between journalism and literature? </l>
                        <l>2. How did self-publishing affect the literary and non-literary
                                productions of those Romantics who worked closely with a publisher
                                or, better still, published their own works?</l>
                        <l>3. How is the postmodern digital era reconfiguring our understanding
                                of the Romantic era (its canon, its poetics, its enduring
                                relevance)?</l>
                     </lg> These questions serve as prompts for the students’ blog posts
                        (suggested three hundred words per day), in which they respond to readings
                        and make connections (20% of the course grade, 5% per week). They guide our
                        online discussions (30% of the course grade, 5% per week for participation,
                        10% for impromptu research-question responses), serve as the weekly exam
                        question prompt (30% of course grade, dropping the lowest of four), and are
                        starting points for their final papers (a three thousand-word research paper
                        that makes use of digital archives, databases, and other online resources is
                        20% of the course grade). In addition to the daily required readings, I
                        suggest that students work online from two to four hours daily; however,
                        once they are engaged with online research and discussion, they tend to
                        spend much more time online than this guideline proposes. It is not unusual
                        for threads of student discussions to carry on for days, even when we have
                        moved on to subsequent units.</p>
                  <p>There are four units to the course: (a) “William Blake: The Recluse with a
                        Printing Press;” (b) “Leigh Hunt: <title level="m">The Examiner</title>, the
                        Cockney School Romantics, and Peterloo;” (c) “William Hone: The Treason
                        Trials, Peterloo, and Pamphleteering;” and (d) “William Cobbett: The <title level="m">Political Register</title> and <title level="m">Rural
                            Rides</title> after Peterloo.” In each unit, students read a biography,
                        explore the publisher’s career, analyze both literary and non-literary
                        texts, discuss a variety of theoretical questions, and take an essay exam.

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Unit One: William Blake: The Recluse with a Printing Press</head>
                  <p> The first unit of the course introduces students to William Blake, to print
                        culture studies, and to Digital Humanities. Students read G. E. Bentley,
                        Jr.’s <title level="m">The Stanger from Paradise: A Biography of William
                            Blake </title>(2003), selections from Northrop Frye,<title level="m">
                            The William Blake Archives</title>, and <title level="m">The Georgian
                            Index </title>of early British newspapers. I introduce students to
                        Blake’s mythology, to radical culture of the Romantic era, to Digital
                        Humanities, and to key aspects of Blake’s thought, including his creed of
                        radicalism and roots in Dissenting Enthusiasm. </p>
                  <p> Students explore Blake’s self-published works, analyze the relationship of
                        image to text, and compare different manuscripts of the same text. They
                        discuss Blake’s “Enthusiasm” and the influence it has in his productions
                        (specifically, his parents’ rejection of public worship in preference for
                        private prayer and introspection), and the more generic connections between
                        literature and religion (specifically, in questions relating to inspiration,
                        epiphany, and the aura of scripture). My lectures (which I post as text
                        documents, usually between six- to twelve-hundred words in length) focus on
                            <title level="m">The First Book of Urizen</title> and take students
                        beyond the Blake that typically appears in anthologies, and I encourage my
                        students to explore later works as well.</p>
                  <p> At the end of each unit, students are given a two-hour open-book, take-home
                        exam in which they answer the following question: “Considering that Blake
                        had near complete control over his artistic productions—from their
                        conception, through their composition and publication, to their
                        distribution—how did Blake’s self-publication affect his artistic
                        productions?” Students are required to focus on a specific passage from a
                        text and to work with <title level="m">The William Blake Archive</title>.
                    </p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Unit Two: Leigh Hunt: <title level="m">The Examiner</title>, the Cockney
                        School Romantics, and Peterloo</head>
                  <p> The second unit introduces students to Leigh Hunt and the Cockney School.
                        Students read Anthony Holden’s <title level="m">The Wit in the Dungeon: The
                            Remarkable Life of Leigh Hunt: Poet, Revolutionary, and the Last of the
                            Romantics</title> (2005) and browse issues of Hunt’s <title level="m">The Examiner.</title> Rather than reading whole issues, they find an
                        event or story and follow Hunt’s coverage of it over several issues. My
                        example is Hunt’s coverage of Peterloo in the fall issues of 1819. During
                        this week, students also read selections from Jeffrey Cox’s <title level="m">Poetry and Politics in the Cockney School: Keats, Shelley, Hunt and
                            Their Circle</title> (1998), several poems by Keats, including
                        “Dedication to Leigh Hunt, Esq.,” “Written On the Day That Mr. Leigh Hunt
                        Left Prison,” and poems by Percy Shelley, including <title level="m">Adonaïs</title>.</p>
                  <p> Student discussion topics range widely as they draw comparisons between
                        Blake’s and Hunt’s biographies and their activities as publishers. We
                        discuss literary circles and the central role that publishers often play and
                        survey contemporary literary reviews and the politics that inform them,
                        particularly in relation to Shelley’s response to reviewers of Keats in
                            <title level="m">Adonaïs</title>. I ask students to think in broader
                        terms about the relationship between newspapers and poetry. Hunt was often
                        accused of spur-of-the-moment overproduction at the cost of quality (a
                        typical criticism of newsprint prose), yet spontaneity was lauded by most
                        Romantics as an essential trait of poetic genius. Though not traditionally
                        conserved as a genre of literature, to what extent can we say that <title level="m">The Examiner</title> is literary? As several of the critics we
                        have read point out, Keats owed much to the paper—if Hunt had not published
                        his poetry, it is hard to imagine how Keats would have reached reviewers
                        around the nation. My question, however, is a large one: Is the sum of each
                        issue greater than the whole? Or, in other words, what are some of the
                        effects of reading poetry next to drama reviews next to bankruptcy notices,
                        etc.? I urge students to work with specific examples. These questions tend
                        to produce much speculation, so it is helpful to intervene in the discussion
                        with guiding quotes from Wordsworth’s prefaces to <title level="m">Lyrical
                            Ballads</title> and/or from Shelley’s <title level="m">A Defence of
                            Poetry</title>. </p>
                  <p> In the second unit I also introduce students to Peterloo as a defining event
                        in the Romantic period. Students read selections from James Chandler’s
                            <title level="m">England in 1819 </title>(1999) and reports in various
                        newspapers, including Hunt’s reporting. I ask students whether Hunt’s
                        reports of Peterloo are reliable or inflammatory, seditious propaganda, or
                        Romantic. The exam question at the end of this unit is: “If Hunt fostered a
                        coterie of radical authors and a culture of political defiance, how did this
                        culture permeate the literary and/or non-literary productions from the
                        Cockney School?”</p>

                        William Hone’s political pamphlets and the caricatures of George Cruikshank.

                        beginning in the 1790s and carried through to the 1830s. In <title level="m">The Political House that Jack Built</title> (1819), a pamphlet that
                        articulates a core conviction of radicals of the era, Hone lays out his
                        faith in the power of an independent press. Unlike Cruikshank, Hone rages
                        with indignation: “This is THE THING, that in spite of new Acts, / And
                        attempts to restrain it, by Soldiers or Tax, / Will <emph>poison</emph> the
                        Vermin, / That plunder the Wealth, / That lay in the House, / That Jack
                        built” (published on <title level="a">Romantic Circles</title> in
                        conjunction with <title level="m">The William Hone BioText</title>).</p>
                  <p> To prepare students for the third exam, we explore <title level="m">The
                            William Hone Biotext</title> in order to analyze how word and text
                        interact in the era’s political pamphlets and to assess the political
                        rhetoric of Shelley’s 1819 poetry. This week ends with a broad discussion of
                        radical and Romantic attitudes toward money and economic ambition. The third
                        unit exam asks students to explore a comparative analysis of different
                        rhetorical strategies or modes that radicals and Romantics adopted in the
                        battle for the freedom of the press after Peterloo. They focus on specific
                        passages and/or images from Hone’s publications, the writings of the Cockney
                        School, and/or John Cahuac, and their responses should include digital texts
                        from <title level="m">The William Hone Biotext</title>. </p>

                            Register</title> and <title level="m">Rural Rides</title> after
                        Peterloo</head>
                  <p>In the fourth unit of the course, students explore William Cobbett’s
                        writings. Whereas Bentley was dense and slow-going, Richard Ingrams’s <title level="m">The Life and Adventures of William Cobbett</title> (2006) is
                        lively and a quick read. Students browse issues of <title level="m">Political Register</title>, read selections from his <title level="m">Rural Rides</title> online, and evaluate Kevin Gilmartin’s assessment
                        of Cobbett in “Reading Cobbett’s Contradictions” (1996). At this point, I
                        begin to help students define their final paper project and our discussion
                        questions tend to be comparative and reflective in kind. I ask students, for
                        example, to compare Cobbett’s early years to those of other radical
                        publishers whose biographies we have read. This allows us to appreciate how
                        Cobbett, whose career runs across the entirety of the Romantic period, had
                        little interaction with literary figures and is usually not thought of as a
                        Romantic at all. Nevertheless, we can draw interesting connections with his
                        contemporaries: Cobbett’s critiques of the English prison system, of the
                        need for public education, of rapid urbanization and the expansion of global
                        commerce, as well as his celebrations of the independent cottage as the
                        English ideal (John Bull appears throughout his writings), of the freedom of
                        the press, and of greater governmental transparency are not dissimilar to
                        the convictions expressed by his contemporaries. </p>

                  <head>Course Conclusion</head>
                  <p>As the course concludes, I ask students for reflections. One of the great
                        advocates for the freedom of the press, Cobbett repeatedly returns in his
                        papers to the struggle not only for a free press but also for a press
                        independent of Government control: <quote>If ever there was in the world a
                            thing completely perverted from its original design and tendency, it is
                            the press of England; which, instead of enlightening, does, as far as it
                            has any power, keep the people in ignorance which, instead of cherishing
                            notions of liberty, tends to the making of the people slaves; and which,
                            instead of being their guardian, is the most efficient instrument in the
                            hands of all those who oppress, or wish to oppress, them. (Qtd. in Jones
                            1-3) </quote> I take this further with a final thought on the course:
                            <quote>The activity of publishing runs counter to Romanticism’s
                            celebration of solitude, introspection, and the reclusive poet;
                            publication, a very practical activity, assumes an interested public and
                            demands a market, requires broadcast expression rather than private
                            reflection or meditation, and rarely can be accomplished without a
                            circle or network of suppliers and distributors. In other words and
                            perhaps more simply put, its concern for being timely run counter to
                            aspirations for transcendence. Even Blake, whose most dear publications
                            were limited to a very select audience, wrestled with contradictions
                            between his artistic vision and his work as a publisher. For this
                            reason, the study of Romantic publishers allows us to see through the
                            ideology of Romantic poetics and to appreciate better those that made
                            possible, often at great personal hazard, Romantic
                        literature.</quote>

                  <head>Conclusion</head>
                  <p>New digital resources offer students the ability to research and analyze
                        print culture of the Romantic period in ways that were not previously
                        possible outside of archives. Today students have an unprecedented level of
                        access to self-publication; they may blog, maintain a website, read and post
                        reviews, comment on news stories, and participate in forum discussions
                        online. Throughout my course, I ask students to reflect on possible
                        analogies between the rise of the popular press in England during the
                        Romantic era and the rise of the Internet in our present digital era. What
                        is perennially at stake is our freedom of speech and of the press, that what
                        we learn from the radical publishers of the Romantic era is that there is a
                        political if not ethical (as radicals often conflate the two) mandate to use
                        the Internet to enable and enfranchise others through the open dissemination
                        of information. </p>
                  <p>Understanding the publication history of the Romantic literature is integral
                        to understanding the literature itself; the title of Percy Shelley’s early
                        sonnet, “On Launching some Bottles filled with Knowledge into the Bristol
                        Channel,” reveals one of many ways the poet found to disseminate his work,
                        and Leigh Hunt and Mary Shelley fought to publish Percy Shelley’s poetry
                        after his death despite pressures to suppress it. This struggle to publish
                        was an essential aspect not only of Percy Shelley’s career but also is
                        apparent throughout Romantic literature. His troubled relationship with
                        publication is already figured in his poetry, much as Blake’s hard-won
                        artistic independence, won through securing his own printing press, is
                        figured in his later works. </p>

               <p rend="noCount"> Byron´s engagement with Romantic discourses of education in his
                    closet drama <title level="m">Cain</title> has been overshadowed by critical
                    discussions of the work´s theology. This essay repositions <title level="m">Cain</title> within period debates about the goals and possibilities of
                    pursuing knowledge. Falke suggests that although <title level="m">Cain</title>
                    appears to endorse the epistemology implied in many discussions of elite
                    education, it ultimately undermines the dichotomies of knowledge vs. action and
                    mind vs. body upon which these discussions relied. </p>

               <p>In the words of Byron’s contemporaries, his character Cain is a “hideous
                    blasphemy,” an “off-scouring of […] Voltaire” and a “heinous offense to society”
                    “embalm[ed] in verse” (“Three Orthodox” 219-220). But, he is also what we might
                    call a pioneer of knowledge. Cain is a solitary hero of Romantic learning—a type
                    variously imagined by Shelley in <title level="m">Alastor</title> and <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, by Wordsworth in <title level="m">The
                        Excursion</title>, and by Byron again in <title level="m">Manfred</title>.
                    As a learner, he is individualistic, adventuresome, and like many pioneers,
                    wayward. In Byron’s version of the myth from Genesis, Lucifer claims to possess
                    the supernatural knowledge that Cain craves, and Cain follows the trouble-making
                    angel on a tour of the universe. He encounters pre-Adamantine beings. He sees
                    worlds “full of life” and thick with potential Edens (II: ii, 168, 183).
                    Nevertheless, Cain wants to know more. In his desire to know more, he
                    exasperates even the devil, who finally chides, “Dust! Limit thy ambition” (II:
                    ii 406). </p>
               <p>Much has been written about <title level="m">Cain’</title>s (1821) disputation of
                    theological orthodoxy. Criticism by Byron’s contemporaries centered attention on
                    the play’s theological concerns, and critics remain interested in the theology
                    of the play. In her biography of Byron, Fiona MacCarthy summarizes the play’s
                    reception as “the greatest outcry yet against the poet and his work, with
                    accusations of willful, dangerous iconoclasm that reverberated for the remainder
                    of the nineteenth century” (414). Byron’s publisher, John Murray, dismissed the
                    fuss as “a humbug row” (qtd. in MacCarthy 414), but the poet’s supposed
                    iconoclasm set the terms of the play’s immediate critical reception to such a
                    degree that even critics who found it theologically limp felt it necessary to
                    say so in public. For example, Francis Jeffrey concludes his consideration of
                    Cain’s theodicy with the inconclusive remark that Byron had “neither thrown any
                    new light upon [the origin of evil], nor darkened the previous knowledge which
                    we possessed” (235). The questions surrounding the play’s implicit theology have
                    continued to give rise to interesting scholarship, positioning it in relation to
                    Byron’s own shifting religious concerns and in relation to the broader questions
                    about the representation of theological matter in art. Alan Rawes finds in
                        <title level="m">Cain</title> evidence of “Byron’s Romantic Calvinism,”
                    arguing that in the play, “yet another individual quest after freedom […]
                    activates and enacts a predestined damnation” (137). Trevor Hart engages the
                    text anew as a means for performing theological meditation through art. Wolf
                    Hirst contests the nineteenth-century impression of the play by arguing that
                    because of its irony and structure, the play is “closer to a conventional
                    justification of God’s ways to men than to the iconoclastic attacks voiced by
                    its protagonists” (152). </p>
               <p>In the flurry of concern over the play’s theological implications, its engagement
                    with the discourse on education, another dominant and highly contentious topic
                    of the day, has been overlooked. But the play returns repeatedly to the theme of
                    the pursuit of knowledge, a pursuit that <title level="m">Cain</title> argues
                    should be boundless. Speaking of the tree of knowledge, Cain says “It was the
                    tree of life: Knowledge is good, / And truth is good; and how can both be evil?”
                    (I: i, 36-38). For him the desire to learn is innate, a physical need bound
                    inextricably with life itself. He tells Lucifer, “Thou canst not / Speak aught
                    of knowledge which I would not know. / And do not thirst to know” (I: i,
                    247-249).</p>

                  <head>Placing <title level="m">Cain</title> in Romantic Period Discourses of
                        Learning</head>
                  <p>Byron’s <title level="m">Cain</title> does not fit tidily into any of the
                        period’s discourses about learning because it appears to fit into so many of
                        them. The character dramatizes many of the assumptions inherent in
                        upper-class education during the Romantic period. First, the knowledge that
                        Cain most desires is, like that pursued at the universities and the most
                        traditional public academies, metaphysical in nature. He wants to “learn to
                        anticipate [his] immortality” (I; i, 137) through the study of topics that
                        transcend mere usefulness. Lucifer characterizes the knowledge he offers
                        Cain as being metaphysical in contrast to other angels’ empirical knowledge.
                        God’s angels, he says, know “nought beyond their shallow senses” in spite of
                        their immortality (II, i, 9). Secondly, the knowledge Cain hungers for is
                        only desired by and only appropriate for select individuals, “Souls who dare
                        use their immortality” in Lucifer’s words. Implicitly, the acquisition of
                        knowledge does not confer privilege on Cain; his desire to learn
                        demonstrates an innate superiority over the rest of his family. Finally, as
                        a learner, Cain repudiates his body and the toil it can perform, deeming
                        them inconsequential when compared to the power of his mind. He “feel[s] the
                        weight […] Of daily toil and constant thought” (I; I, 174-75). Toil and
                        thought, for him, are incompatible. He complains that his physical self
                        seems “nothing” in comparison with what he sees, but that the “thoughts that
                        arise” in him seem as if they “could master all things”(I: i, 167-68). The
                        dichotomies here—between empirical and metaphysical knowledge, between the
                        privileged learner and the ignorant mass from which he has escaped, between
                        mental and physical exertion—echo the conceptions of education being
                        deployed in debates about England’s elite public schools and the increasing
                        numbers of dissenting academies and mechanics’ institutes.</p>
                  <p>Assumptions about upper-class learners were being solidified through
                        discourses about the publically endowed grammar schools and universities
                        (Richardson 46-47, Aries 313) as well as through heroic learners in
                        literature. In 1820, Henry Brougham, a Whig MP remembered for liberal
                        reforms related to the slave trade and education, proposed a bill that would
                        allow trustees “to use grammar school trusts for the instruction of the poor
                        in reading, writing, and arithmetic” (Sanderson 28). Headmasters and dons
                        recoiled from the idea and defended the exclusivity of their student body by
                        maintaining the exclusivity of the subjects they taught. This conflation
                        between subjects studied and learners seems almost seamless. Students elite
                        enough to study at Shrewsbury and Tonbridge manifested their elitism by
                        mastering classical languages and literature. Endowed school students were
                        to become refined metaphysicians, proudly carrying forward the traditions of
                        Renaissance humanism. This curriculum was clearly unfit, they thought, for
                        the lower classes. As the governors of Harrow were already arguing by 1810,
                        “the school is a school for classical leaning; […] however wise the
                        intentions of the founder might have been, the school is not now adapted
                        generally for persons of low condition, but better suited to those of a
                        higher class” (“Harrow” 81). Moreover, through this schooling, endowed
                        school students were supposedly rendered incapable of living working-class
                        lives. As Leigh Hunt phrases it, “scholarship […] unfits a man for activity”
                        (37). </p>
                  <p>But, even as this defense of leisure-class traditions was going on, literacy
                        and schooling were becoming more widely available to the rest of the English
                        population. The spread of education in the early nineteenth century has
                        become a familiar story, but recalling it enforces how pervasive the pursuit
                        of knowledge must have seemed. The Sunday School Movement had begun in
                        earnest in the 1780s. By 1819, two years before<title level="m">
                            Cain</title> was published, Parliamentary reports record over 5,000
                        schools in operation. Andrew Bell’s and Joseph Lancaster’s monitorial
                        systems of education had led to the creation of another 1,520 schools
                        between 1800 and 1819. Adding these schools to the over 4,000 endowed
                        schools and the almost 14,000 other “unendowed” schools, we end up with a
                        country awash in pedantry. In 1819, England had no desire for the
                        million-plus pupils enrolled in these schools to become heroic learners.</p>
                  <p>They were not pursuing metaphysical truth, they were not exploring their
                        individual uniqueness, and they were not encouraged to think their learning
                        would not go with physical work. Whereas Cain hopes his intellectual
                        activity will free him from labor, the children reached by unendowed schools
                        of the period were taught that their education prepared them for labor.
                        Reading the Parliamentary Papers that precede the passage of the 1870
                        Education Act, we find Sir Charles Adderly reflecting as follows on the
                        education offered the poor earlier in the century: “Education was not so
                        much the imparting of knowledge as the training that would fit a child for
                        the work to which his station would probably call him” (National Education
                        Union 114). Speaking before the House of Commons in 1819, the Earl of
                        Harrowby similarly advocates educating the poor to make them “useful members
                        of society” (Great Britain Parliament 1515).</p>
                  <p>In contrast to Byron’s characterization of an individualistic heroic learner,
                        the manuals that provide guidance for teaching the lower classes
                        characterize learners as socio-political contributors who could either
                        enhance public stability by creating wealth or damage public stability
                        through criminality and rioting. As educational historian Michael Sanderson
                        writes, by the 1830s education was seen as “an agent of social control”
                        (12). Discussions of educating “the poor” (usually not George or Henry)
                        prioritized “useful science” over metaphysics (Wilderspin ix). The founding
                        of the aptly named Society for Useful Knowledge in 1826 suggests the
                        educational impetus behind most middle class reform. For children from
                        working-class families, instruction began with basic literacy, writing, and
                        math although some Sunday School advocates, such as Hannah More, famously
                        excluded writing from the curriculum. More common than lists of subject
                        areas were lists of virtues that poor children were supposed to attain
                        through the discipline of schools. Designed to promote “industry, sobriety,
                        honesty, benevolence, and mutual kindness” (vi), schools did not encourage
                        long trips with the devil. Samuel Wilderspin, whose manual I have just
                        quoted, was not a conservative voice in the debates surrounding education
                        when his 1823 <title level="m">Remarks on the Importance of Educating the
                            Poor</title> was published. The inventor of the playground, he was more
                        permissive than most. His sense that working-class learners needed moral
                        containment more than intellectual adventure was typical.</p>
                  <p>Byron’s <title level="m">Cain </title>collides with these ideas. It violently
                        flouts the possibility that learning leads to moral discipline, useful work,
                        or the other oft-cited goal of Romantic-period education, happiness. In her
                        description of “Educational Prose” for the recent <title level="m">Encyclopedia of Romantic Literature</title> (2012), Catherine Ross
                        notes that for all of their disagreements, the writers of educational prose
                        during the romantic period espoused or implied “the belief that the proper
                        ends of education are ‘happiness’ and ‘usefulness,’” that “both of these
                        conditions, while variously defined, are dependent upon virtue,” and finally
                        that “virtue can be taught” (390). An example of this alignment among
                        knowledge, happiness, and virtue may be seen in William Godwin’s claim that
                        “the true object of education, like that of every other moral process, is
                        the generation of happiness” (qtd. in Silver 72). Byron addresses each of
                        these possible goals for learning, but denies them all. Cain tells Lucifer
                        that he seeks knowledge as “The road to happiness” (II: ii 229-230). Lucifer
                        initially upholds the pairing of knowledge and happiness as a logical
                        proposition, saying “If truth be so [happiness], / Then though hast it” (II:
                        ii, 231-232), but Cain has declared himself unhappy just a few lines before
                        (II; ii, 217-218), and Lucifer foretells a “doubled wretchedness” to come
                        (II; ii, 222). The liberal, humanist discourse of education so dominant
                        among the romantic period’s educational reformers may have yoked knowledge
                        and happiness together, but here they are unhinged. Good and evil are
                        disengaged from knowledge in this same scene: “[I]gnorance from evil doth
                        not save / From evil” (II: ii, 236-7). </p>
                  <p>These contrasts between Byron’s presentation of knowledge and what we see in
                        Romantic period pedagogy for the working classes are significant because the
                        separate assumptions about what kind of education is good for different
                        classes have persisted. We see it in the disjunctions between the teleology
                        of liberal arts classes and that of vocational classes. There is a long and
                        intricate genealogy that I cannot untwine in the length of this essay. On
                        Byron’s side of the family we find Matthew Arnold with his mellifluous
                        learners gleaning sweetness and light from the best that has been thought
                        and written. Arnold asserts that it is part of our innate desire to perfect
                        ourselves through the pursuit of knowledge. We find also John Henry Newman,
                        whose 1865 <title level="m">Idea of a University</title> articulates so
                        eloquently why we should pursue knowledge with the same unconscious
                        consistency with which we pursue our physical health. There is a comparable
                        genealogy through our other line of educational heritage. On the opposite
                        side of the family, we find W. E. Forster, for whom England’s 1870 Education
                        Act was named, telling The House of Commons that “the speedy provision of
                        elementary education” is essential for “our industrial prosperity […] [I]f
                        we leave our work-folk any longer unskilled […] they will become overmatched
                        in the competition of the world” (18). For Forster, education must be
                        practical because it must serve the projected growth of a national economy.
                        England’s future “work-folk” get to learn to read between the ages of five
                        and twelve, but what they need to do after twelve is make money.
                        Contemporary educational policy makers in the United States seem to be
                        descended from this side of the family. When United States Secretary of
                        Education Arne Duncan offered his 2014 report to the House Appropriations
                        Committee, he extended the discourse of Forster, and Brougham, and the
                        Sunday Schools, figuring education not in heroic but in economic terms.
                        “Falling behind educationally now,” he warned, “will hurt our country
                        economically for generations.” </p>

                  <head>Byron and Working-Class Readers</head>
                  <p>Although the play appears to suggest that the pursuit of knowledge is
                        incompatible with a life of labor,<title level="m"> Cain</title>, like other
                        works by Byron, was circulated enthusiastically among networks of
                        working-class readers where it would have been interpreted with great
                        freedom, just as Shakespeare and scripture were (Rose 15-16). After Murray
                        famously failed to secure the text against piracy, it was absorbed into
                        radical political and theological discourses. Byron’s name was linked to Tom
                        Paine and Richard Carlile. Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that the
                        contemporary critic who talks most about knowledge in relation to Byron’s
                            <title level="m">Cain</title> discusses his anxiety about the
                        dissemination of the play<emph> as</emph> knowledge, rather than the play’s
                        treatment of knowledge as a concept. In his 1822 essay for the <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title>, Reginald Heber worries that “by
                        circumstances which Lord Byron himself could not foresee, - those
                        speculations which he designed for the educated ranks alone, are thrown open
                        to the gaze of the persons most likely to be influenced by them, and
                        disseminated, with remorseless activity, among the young, the ignorant, and
                        the poor” (238). Writing for the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title>,
                        Jeffrey frets that <title level="m">Cain</title> will trouble “hundreds of
                        minds that might never otherwise have been exposed to such dangerous
                        disturbance” (233). Jeffrey appears to assume, with Heber, that “the poor”
                        who are likely to purchase the illicitly published <title level="m">Cain</title> will also be “the ignorant,” that they will never have
                        thought about the origins of evil without the help of a noble author.
                        Similarly, the anonymous reviewer for the <title level="m">Eclectic</title>
                        posits that the “difficulties” of the first family’s story will be “new to a
                        large proportion of [Byron’s] readers” and that “the young and inexperienced
                        are ill able to grapple” with these questions (219). This reviewer
                        distinguishes between working-class readers, whom he assumes will passively
                        accept Lucifer’s and Cain’s logic, and leisure-class readers capable of
                        weighing these characters’ ideas against reasoning they have already
                        performed. </p>
                  <p>Jeffrey’s review came out in the <title level="j">Edinburgh</title> in April;
                        the <title level="j">Eclectic</title> ran theirs in May. In June, Leigh Hunt
                        published a letter about <title level="m">Cain</title> “To the Readers of
                        the <emph>Examiner,</emph>” and although he does not say much about the
                        play’s presentation of knowledge, he does make an implicit claim about the
                        equality of intellectual potential among readers of all classes by crediting
                        the play’s imagined reader with an equal capacity to contemplate the
                        questions Byron raises. He acknowledges that the play privileges Lucifer’s
                        and Cain’s critiques of divine wisdom, but says that this lopsidedness is
                        Byron’s “hint” for readers to “work out the conclusion for themselves”
                        (225). He later credits readers with the ability “to draw the united
                        conclusions of his heart and understanding.” Hunt makes no distinction
                        between “inexperienced” readers who may have purchased the 6d. version and
                        readers of the <title level="j">Edinburgh</title> and <title level="j">Quarterly </title>who more likely purchased the 15 s. 5 d. first
                        edition (St. Clair 588). </p>
                  <p>In his discussion of <title level="m">Byron and the Victorians</title>
                        (2004), Andrew Elfenbein points out that “working-class literacy introduced
                        a [...] possibility for reading Byron” that was “more subversive” than the
                        appropriation of his work into debates about the beneficence of God or the
                        propriety of certain sexual behaviors because it was more difficult to
                        contain (85, 87). It swelled and surged outside of the purview of the
                        cultural elite. One enthusiastic Byronist suggests the breadth of Byron’s
                        influence in an 1825 letter to Carlile’s <title level="j">The
                            Republican</title> where he writes that that Byron had “influenced
                        millions in the cause of liberty” (162). This was precisely the influence
                        that orthodox critics of <title level="m">Cain</title> feared. Lucifer’s
                        arguments associate him with “the spirit of free thought and stern
                        endurance, unbrokenly contending against the bondage which makes nature
                        miserable” (Heber 243). Although Byron’s popularity among working-class
                        readers, in general, is well-documented, since we have no records of the
                        sales of pirated copies of <title level="m">Cain</title> and no
                        working-class recollections of reading <title level="m">Cain</title> in
                        particular, it is impossible to judge what role the play may have had in
                        this popularity.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For discussion of Byron’s

                        which Byron advocates for a pursuit of knowledge freed from communally
                        imposed boundaries would have resonated with working-class autodidacts’
                        energy and longing for freedom. </p>
                  <p>In his comprehensive study of 142 working-class autobiographies from the
                        nineteenth century, David Vincent discusses the astounding commitment some
                        men and women had to learning. A few examples will suggest the extent of the
                        sacrifice of time and resources these individuals made in order to pursue
                        knowledge. Yorkshire weaver William Heaton recalls that on the Sabbath, he
                        would “wander forth” at around four in the morning with a group of
                        like-minded naturalists in order to collect and study bird’s eggs or
                        fossils. They would return at sundown “often having never tasted food all
                        the day.” Nevertheless, they found resources to create a shared library
                        (qtd. in Vincent 173). Some of his fellow weavers managed to “place books
                        before them [on the loom] to read whilst at work,” but he confined himself
                        to “ruminat[ing]” on his reading during work and recording his thoughts “in
                        a memorandum book […] kept by the side of [his] loom for the purpose” (125).
                        Thomas Cooper, recalling his apprenticeship as a shoemaker, records how
                        strategically he had to plan his reading in order to attain the breadth of
                        education he desired: <quote>Historical reading, or the grammar of some
                            language, or translation, was my first employment on week-day mornings,
                            whether I rose at three or four, until seven o’clock, when I sat down to
                            the stall. A book or a periodical in my hand while I breakfasted, gave
                            me another half-hour’s reading, I had another half-hour, and sometimes
                            an hour’s reading or study of language at from one to two o’clock, the
                            time of dinner – usually eating my food with a spoon, after I had cut it
                            in pieces, and having my eyes on a book all the time. (qtd. in Vincent
                            124).</quote> During his remaining six hours at work, he recited <title level="m">Hamlet </title>“or the poetry of some modern or living author”
                        (124), quite possibly Byron. In 1818, when he was thirteen years old, he
                        learned to love poetry by reading <title level="m">Childe Harold</title> and
                            <title level="m">Manfred</title> (qtd. in Collins 5). In the “Sonnet to
                        Chillon” Byron expresses a sentiment that must have resounded with the
                        workers reciting <title level="m">Hamlet</title> at their cobbler’s stalls
                        and parsing verbs before their breakfast: <quote>

                     </quote> Imaginative freedom from one’s surroundings—Byron’s liberty whose
                        “habitation is the heart”—was only one kind of freedom that working-class
                        readers sought. Vincent lists the freedom from non-rational beliefs and from
                        non-rational behaviors (especially drunkenness) as common goals as well. He
                        mentions the freedom to pursue scientific learning, philosophy, and literary
                        occupations, which included writing for political and occupational
                        organizations (166-177). And perhaps most importantly for considering <title level="m">Cain</title> in light of working-class discourses of learning
                        is the prospect of freedom from “the world view of the educated” (174). It
                        is in his advocacy for individual questioning that Byron most appealed to
                        working-class readers. Cain reports that labour itself does not interfere
                        with learning: <quote>

                        a way that many working-class learners must have sympathized with. The rest
                        of his family has “but / One answer to all questions,
                            “’Twas <emph>his</emph> will, / And <emph>he</emph> is good’” (I; i,
                        74-76). </p>
                  <p>Working-class autobiographers often expressed frustration with precisely this
                        alignment of community members’ lack of curiosity and religion’s one
                        serve-all answer. For example, when Christopher Thomson began to read beyond
                        the small collection of books that his local Methodist congregation had
                        collected, he confronted his community’s opposition to unsanctioned learning
                        as an ultimatum. He recalls being told that “if I did not at once, and
                        unconditionally, renounce all books, except such as they should approve of,
                        I was for ever lost!” Therefore, he “renounced [his] connection with all
                        bodies which would prescribe the free range of thought in matters of such
                        vital importance” (Thomson 66, qtd. in Vincent 179). John Bezer’s discontent
                        with his local school was less combative. Yet, it reveals that he faced
                        barriers to learning similar to those faced by Thomson. Bezer reports that
                        he “yearned for” his time at school, but the picture of Sunday School
                        education that he portrays makes it clear that the school met a social more
                        than an intellectual need. He regrets that “school did not even learn me to
                        read; six hours a week, certainly not <emph>one</emph> hour of useful
                        knowledge; plenty of cant, and what my teachers used to
                            call <emph>explaining</emph> difficult texts in the Bible, but little,
                        very little else” (Bezer Ch. 2). </p>
                  <p>In <title level="m">Cain</title>, Act I portrays the protagonist struggling
                        against complacency and religion in terms that recall the struggles of
                        growing romantic period counter-culture of working-class autodidacts. In Act
                        III, we see that Cain’s search for knowledge excludes him from his community
                        because his limited learning has only strengthened the curiosity that others
                        cannot understand. His wife Adah remarks his change after Cain returns from
                        his lesson with Lucifer: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l> Cain! that proud Spirit, who withdrew thee hence,</l>
                           <l> Hath saddened thine still deeper. I had hoped</l>
                           <l> The promised wonders which thou hast beheld,</l>
                           <l> Visions, thou say’st of past and present worlds,</l>

                           <l> Of a contented knowledge; but I see</l>
                           <l> Thy guide hath done thee evil (III; i, 45-51)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> By contemplating the insignificance of his race and the confinement
                        of his mortal subject position, Cain has isolated himself further from Adah
                        and the rest of the family. Within his intellectually complacent community,
                        Cain’s isolation is made more profound by the threatening prospects of
                        nihilism and damnation. He has no means of answering the questions he is
                        just learning to ask. “Gazing on eternity,” he says: <quote>

                  <p> The lonely hero is already ringed-round and isolated by his unconscionable
                        longing for knowledge, and he becomes more isolated as he realizes that his
                        experiences are at once incommunicable and unnecessary to communicate.
                        Communication in his family has always been more luxury than necessity.
                        Except for him they lived external lives. They involve themselves in sense
                        like the angels. These external lives were held in common—everyone ate,
                        worshiped, and worked together. Now, he has wandered off. He has lived his
                        pursuit of knowledge alone, and the tale of his journey proves unspeakable.
                        Abel asks his brother where he has been. “I know not” replies Cain. “Nor
                        what thou has seen?” inquires Abel. In response, Cain lists things he has
                        seen: “The dead - / The Immortal - the Unbounded - the Omnipotent - / The
                        overpowering mysteries of space” (III; i, 177-180). But, he despairs, these
                        sights have rendered him “Unfit for mortal converse” (III; i, 184). Cain can
                        list the categories of beings that he has now experienced seeing, but these
                        “overpowering mysteries” cannot be communicated to one who has not
                        experienced them for himself. Temporal-spatial description (Where have you
                        been?) and categorical identification (What kinds of things have you seen?)
                        can locate personal experience within a known and shared world, but they
                        cannot indicate anything meaningful about an experience from outside the
                        world that Abel and Cain inhabit together. If the isolation resulting from
                        the incommunicability of his new knowledge were not enough, Cain is further
                        isolated by his exile at the play’s end. During his exile he does not need
                        to communicate to people. His mark announces his past and his uniqueness for
                        him. Whereas communication had been, because of its superfluous nature, a
                        luxury held in common with his family, it is now, because of its
                        superfluity, a curse. </p>
                  <p> In an era when new knowledge was being produced rapidly, Byron creates a
                        character who is timeless in his mythical origins, but also particularly
                        well-suited for dramatizing the pursuit of knowledge in the 1820s. The
                        dislocation of a quest for knowledge into classless, mythic territory also
                        allows <title level="m">Cain</title> to function within a growing
                        working-class discourse of self-directed learners as well as in the
                        privileged discourse of the quarterlies. The magnitude of Cain’s desire to
                        know inspires a discourse about his hubris and Byron’s blasphemy, but
                        underneath the scandalous theology lies a subtle inquiry into the
                        possibility and limits of knowledge.</p>

                  <p> However silent contemporary voices may be about the play’s treatment of
                        knowledge, the subject dominates <title level="m">Cain</title> both
                        structurally and linguistically, and as the play progresses the burden of
                        inquiry becomes not only God’s injustice in offering and then forbidding
                        moral knowledge, but also the possibility of attaining knowledge at all.
                        Throughout the first two acts, the desire to know more provides Cain’s chief
                        motivation. In the third and final act, when Cain realizes that he has
                        killed his brother, he describes this most dramatic of the play’s events to
                        himself as primarily cerebral where the “thought” of death, which
                        “Empoison’d” his life has now been replaced by knowledge (III: I, 371-379).
                        Refocusing the conflict of the Cain and Abel story on the search for
                        knowledge, instead of an originary act of violence, is largely Byron’s
                        innovation. The biblical account, brief enough to quote in full, mentions

                        is pictured as aggressive, “lurking at the door,” and Byron might have found
                        in this (and clearly also in his reading of Milton) inspiration for making
                        Lucifer a dominant character as a kind of personification of this lurking
                        power. However, the Bible offers no hint that Cain has sinned by demanding
                        knowledge. The emphasis seems to be placed on action, to “do well,” rather
                        than on thought. </p>
                  <p>The only mention of knowledge that occurs in Genesis Chapter Four comes after
                        the murder itself. The Lord asks Cain “Where is your brother Abel?” and Cain
                        replies, “I do not know; am I my brother’s keeper?” (Gen. 4:9). For the sake
                        of the play, Byron treats Cain’s protestation of ignorance as plausible. He
                        did not know where his brother had gone because Abel was the first in the
                        world to die. The question of responsibility for his brother is also treated
                        as genuine, even as a realization of what Cain does not know. “Where is my
                        brother?” he seems to wonder. Or in other words, “What is the nature of
                        mortality?” “Am I my brother’s keeper?” follows from this question as an
                        inquiry into the responsibility toward others that the condition of
                        mortality might imply. By interpreting Cain’s questions as genuine rather
                        than evasive, Byron transforms Cain from an object of contempt to a figure
                        of identification. By rendering the realization of his ignorance a cause,
                        rather than an effect of Cain’s murderous act, he opens the play to more
                        direct connections with the larger Edenic narrative.</p>
                  <p>The structural emphasis that Byron places on Cain’s search for knowledge
                        frustrated both Heber and Jeffrey because it slows the pace of the narrative
                        and eliminates any sense that the murder follows predictably from Cain’s
                        nature and situation. Heber notes that “Two acts and half the third are
                        passed without advancing a single step towards the conclusion” (241-242).
                        Jeffrey laments that the debate of why God had placed the tree of the
                        knowledge of good and evil in the garden is no “incidental deformity” in an
                        otherwise sound dramatic structure. Rather, it “forms […] the great staple
                        of the piece” (234). If Abel’s death is intended to form the climax of the
                        play as it forms the climax of the biblical story, then Byron has failed
                        adequately to develop this plotline. Judging from the play’s plot
                        development, Heber asserts, Abel could just as well have “been made to drop
                        down in an apoplexy, and Cain to die of grief over his body” (242). Byron
                        represents Abel’s death as motiveless. There is no logic that can contain a
                        murder. He directs our attention to the act’s incomprehensibility, and thus
                        ties the murder to the conflict of Act II, but recognizing this depends on
                        seeing knowledge rather than envy as the primary site of Cain’s internal
                        struggle. </p>
                  <p>Envy implies need. Byron writes in a letter to Moore that such a motive makes
                        the biblical Cain “contemptible.” In his eagerness to free his rebellious
                        and questioning Cain from his contemptuous biblical precedent, Byron devotes
                        seventeen lines of the play (II: ii, 337-354) to differentiating Cain’s
                        fondness for his brother from the biblical Cain’s envy. Lucifer tempts Cain
                        to feel envy for his brother. “Thy father loves him well,” he says, “so does
                        thy God” (II: ii 340). “And so do I” replies the unruffled Cain (II:ii 341).
                        “He is the second born of flesh, / And his mother’s favourite” presses
                        Lucifer, but Cain still resists. Even in the moment where Cain kills Abel,
                        his anger is against God and not his brother. He has determined to overthrow
                        Abel’s altar so that it will not “stand in the sun, to shame creation!”
                        (III: I, 304, 309-311). Byron clarifies to Moore the manner in which he
                        hoped to reshape Cain’s intentions: <quote>the object of the Demon is
                                to <emph>depress</emph> him still further in his own estimation than
                            he was before, by showing him infinite things and his own abasement,
                            till he falls into the frame of mind that leads to the catastrophe, from
                            mere <emph>internal</emph> irritation, <emph>not</emph> premeditation,
                            or envy of Abel (which would have made him contemptible), but from the
                            rage and fury against the inadequacy of his state to his conceptions,
                            and which discharges itself rather against Life, and the author of Life,
                            than the mere living. (<title level="m">Life,</title> <title level="m">Letters and Journals</title> 541) </quote> The demon that Byron
                        describes in the letter is Lucifer, external to Cain the learner, but is
                        also tied to the demon of knowledge that Lucifer describes as lying latent
                        in both Cain and Eve. Byron’s Lucifer declaims having tempted Eve to
                        knowledge. Nor does he initiate the conversation about knowledge with Cain.
                        The desire to know is rather represented as innate in both mother and son.
                        It is “a demon” that the serpent awoke in speaking to Eve (I: i, 228-229).
                        Lucifer has only to mention knowledge in passing, as part of a casual
                        sarcastic sneer, for the desire to flare up in Cain. Lucifer says there was
                        nothing for spirits “to envy in the narrow bounds / Of Paradise […] but I
                        speak to thee of what though know’st not / With all thy tree of knowledge”
                        (I: i, 241-245). Cain jumps in before the line is metrically complete: “But
                        though canst not/ Speak aught of knowledge which I would not know” (I. i,
                        246-247). </p>
                  <p>In addition to modifying the structure of the plot and the protagonist’s
                        motivation to highlight questions of knowledge, Byron also highlights
                        knowledge linguistically. Cognates of the word “to know” dominate the play,
                        recurring over one hundred times. “Knowledge” sometimes so crowds the
                        dialogue that the word itself becomes oppressive. <quote>

                     </quote> Five lines in a row mention knowledge, and the sound of the lines
                        encourages readers to take note of the repetition. The pairing of “now know”
                        and “know not” turns the lines into such a sonic bog that it is difficult
                        not to be slowed down. Byron repeats the pairing of “know” and “not”
                        throughout the play. Of the dead Abel, Cain says, “what thou now art / I
                        know not!” (III: i, 530-531). In making his offering before God, he says the
                        he “know[s] not” if it be “good or ill” (III: I, 274-276). Enoch “know’st
                        not” that he is naked (III: I, 23), and Cain “know[s] not” if God smiles
                        (II: ii, 350). The constant positing of the absence of knowledge makes Cain
                        seem like an ideal learner in the Platonic tradition. He knows what he does
                        not know. But it also hints at an impossibility of acquiring knowledge. Cain
                        denies having knowledge about himself, denies having knowledge about God,
                        and denies having knowledge of the pure materiality to which his brother is
                        reduced at the play’s end. In short, he denies the possibility of attaining
                        knowledge even as he repeatedly tries to seek it. </p>
                  <p>The language in these “know-not” pairings reinforces the play’s more general
                        questioning of rational knowledge. As Leonard Goldberg puts it, “Cain, whose
                        acts effectively deny that mind can, should or need have anything to do with
                        its objects, catastrophically defies rationality as the way toward
                        autonomous life” (207-208). But, even more radically, the play provides no
                        indication that rationality could provide a way to autonomous life for
                        anyone. Jerome McGann argues that Byron’s Lucifer is himself limited in what
                        he knows. Because he is pure spirit, he can neither sympathize with Cain,
                        nor offer Cain the knowledge of mortality and embodied ethical
                        responsibility that he seeks (260). Being unable to enact death, Lucifer
                        cannot know it. Cain attains this knowledge by performing Abel’s murder.
                        Such knowledge cannot be achieved by witnessing another’s death or looking
                        at “dead things” (II; ii, 191). It requires action for its attainment.
                        Similarly, by not performing acts of love toward anyone, Lucifer excludes
                        himself from any knowledge of love. According to him, the contemplation of
                        love leads to the destruction of love’s potential objects. In one passage,
                        Lucifer describes both the impossibility of knowing love by observing
                        someone else and the impossibility performing love as an abstract
                        contemplation. “[T]hou canst not see if <emph>I</emph> love / Or no” “except
                        some vast and general purpose, / To which particular things melt like snow”
                        (II; ii 313-315). In <title level="m">Cain’</title>s textual world, learners
                        are doomed to seek knowledge through contemplation but find it through
                        action.</p>

                  <head>Knowledge in Action</head>
                  <p>The long discussion of knowledge, the action-less first two scenes and the
                        increasing focus on the incompatibility of contemplation and action prepare
                        the way for the violence of Act III, not by creating a structure that
                        assimilates the murder and makes it an object of understanding, but by
                        diminishing the expectation that knowledge can account for any action.
                        Following the murder, Abel and Cain’s exchange confirms the separation of
                        knowledge and action. Abel, alluding to Christ’s final words, asks God to
                        forgive Cain on the basis that he “knew not what he did” (III; i, 319), but
                        the nature of this knowing or not knowing deserves investigation. Cain says
                        after Abel’s death that he is now “awake” (III; i, 378). This, and Abel’s
                        use of the past tense “knew” indicate a change in Cain’s state of knowledge;
                        he “knew not” what death was until he enacted it. In the association of
                        knowledge with action, <title level="m">Cain </title>forms the darker
                        counterpart to a similar argument in <title level="m">Don Juan</title>—that
                        education cannot come through Donna Inez’s abstractions got by rote but only
                        through experience. </p>
                  <p>The murder in Act III can be read several ways in terms of its treatment of
                        knowledge and the failure of knowledge to promote either happiness or
                        virtue. The play may be seen as confirming leisure-class anxieties about the
                        connections between working-class access to education and violence. After
                        all, it is only after Cain’s education that he kills his brother. As much as
                        Lucifer counsels Cain to not let his reason “be over-sway’d” (II: ii, 460),
                        Cain does not return to his family a more reasonable man in the commonplace
                        use of the term “reasonable.” When he and Abel are offering their
                        sacrifices, he points to the injustice of shedding innocent blood. Only
                        twelve lines later, he unjustly sheds the blood of his brother. And yet,
                        Cain’s angry expostulations do make sense according to a purely abstract
                        logic. God loves lives, he concludes, since Abel’s sacrifice met God’s
                        pleasure. “Take thy life unto thy God,” he says upon striking him, “Since he
                        loves lives” (III: i, 316-317). Byron portrays here, it might be argued,
                        what pure logic leads to, when it is exercised outside of the guidance of
                        church (suggested by the ritual religious practice of sacrifice) and state
                        (suggested by Adam, the paternal authority Cain resists throughout the
                        play). Neither the present, priest-like Abel, nor the absent father coerces
                        Cain into making a sacrifice. The only expression of authority in the scene
                        is the fire sent to consume Abel’s sacrifice and the whirlwind sent to
                        scatter Cain’s. Cain’s anger is kindled primarily at God for a rejection
                        that he does not understand. His violence results from the displacement of
                        this anger onto his brother, who might be read as standing in for both
                        church and state through his connections to both the sacrifice and Adam.
                        Read this way, Cain resembles a worker, enraged by his divine lot and
                        empowered by justifying logic, displacing his anger onto the nearest emblem
                        of authority. However, the problem here does not really seem to be logic
                        having escaped cultural bounds, but logic failing as an epistemic
                        system.</p>
                  <p>Scholars have approached Cain’s transition into knowledge following the
                        murder and his preceding epistemic failure in at least two ways. For Leonard
                        Goldberg, the incompatibility of Cain’s rational “knowledge” of what God
                        wants and Abel’s claim that Cain “knew not” what he was doing arises from a
                        failure of language. Cain refuses “to accept that others have meaningful
                        words to say to him,” and refuses to admit there is more than “one story to
                        account for the rejection of his offering” (220). Goldberg opens his article
                        with the assertion that Cain resists the need of the mind to strive after
                        objects instead of just ideas (207), and this assertion could be read as
                        implying that Cain’s enactment of murder shows the tragic climax of Cain’s
                        treating his brother like the consequence of an argument that he needs to
                        deny. This implication is not inconsistent with Goldberg’s reading of Act
                        III, but I think he is right to focus on the scene as a crisis of
                        communication between people rather than a crisis of phenomenological access
                        to knowledge of the objective world. The language of the murder scene shifts
                        from the language of knowledge that dominates the play, to a language of
                        life and love: <quote>

                     </quote> The stage directions here are the second most extensive ones in the
                        entire play, and they are followed by one of the few moments of physical
                        contact between characters. “[G]ive me thy hand” says Abel (III; i, 320).
                        Shifting to physical activity after two acts of only argument, Byron shows
                        the point at which language and logic fail. The boggy alliteration of “know
                        not” is here replaced with “loves lives.” The constant intrusion of the
                        negative into sentences about knowledge yields place to “more” – a
                        comparison of plentitudes. “More” love for God, “more” blood on the altar
                        (III; i, 315, 311). When the epiphany about death that Cain has sought
                        throughout the play finally, ironically, arrives, it arrives through action
                        and explodes the tidy dichotomies of language (know, know-not) with
                        plentitude. The good and evil that Lucifer had described as “essence” at the
                        end of Act II are suddenly revealed to be connected to desires reaching to
                        objects outside the self and materials whose essential connection to life
                        can be neither seen nor explained.</p>
                  <p>The scene highlights the consequences of Cain’s failure to strive for the
                        life-giving knowledge of another person through love and physical
                        engagement, but it also draws our attention to the gap between materiality
                        and abstractions that has persisted in Byron’s language throughout the play.
                        In the second interpretation of this play as an exploration of knowledge,
                        Jerome McGann sees Cain as torn between “material and spiritual Principles”
                        (259). This material-spiritual conflict is also highlighted in the murder
                        scene, as the protagonist suddenly awakens to the physicality of his own
                        body. “My hand,” Cain says “after a moment of stupefaction” (322). Cain
                        tries one more time after Abel’s death to re-align his world with the way
                        his reason tells him it should be. He begins with the fatalist claim “that
                        which I am, I am; I did not seek / For life, nor did I make myself” implying
                        that Abel’s death is logically the fault of the Creator and he only the
                        mechanism (III; i, 509-510). But his love for his brother drives him into
                        agency. He expresses the same willingness to sacrifice himself that Abel had
                        made for the sake of God, still not submitting himself to God, but to the
                        love of his brother: <quote>

                           <l>[C]ould I</l>
                           <l>With my own death redeem him from the dust – </l>
                           <l>And why not so? let him return to day,</l>
                           <l>And I lie ghastly! So shall be restored</l>

                        </lg>
                     </quote> Logically, this proposition functions perfectly. If God loves Abel
                        and he is omnipotent, then he will restore Abel to life. But, this syllogism
                        fails to account for the shattered materiality of Abel’s body. The knowledge
                        Cain finally achieves is the awareness that knowledge itself is the product
                        embodied action as well as purely cerebral thought. As violent as the play’s
                        ending is, it does not imply that the action through which a learner attains
                        this epiphany about knowledge must be violent or immoral. Abel attains this
                        knowledge though the act of dying.</p>
                  <p> Cain’s questioning remains heroic, but I agree with Leonard Michaels that
                        Byron is ultimately critical of his character. Michaels argues that it is
                        not Cain’s search for knowledge that Byron critiques but his “simple refusal
                        to identify with the human condition,” a refusal that Michaels dubs
                        “quintessentially aristocratic” (74-75). While Byron seems, at first, to
                        redeploy aristocratic assumptions about education upheld by public schools
                        and universities, the play destabilizes these assumptions as it progresses.
                        In particular, Byron undermines the dichotomy between knowledge and action
                        that was frequently assumed in distinguishing the “practical education” fit
                        for workers from the “classical education” fit for leisure-class pupils. I
                        would like to conclude that Byron advocates for the kind of free, desperate,
                        heroic pursuit of knowledge exemplified by romantic period autodidacts, that
                        his tiller of fields is, murder aside, in solidarity with the tillers,
                        weavers, and shipwrights that loved to read him. But, if <title level="m">Cain </title>can be said to advocate for anything, it does so through
                        layers of negation and irony.</p>
                  <p> The play engages contemporary discourses of knowledge more through critique
                        than advocacy. Cain critiques the boundaries placed on inquiry, and Byron
                        leads us to sympathize with him by painting the play’s other characters
                        (Adah somewhat excepted) as flat and unsympathetic. And in the play’s
                        implied critique of Cain, Byron problematizes the assumptions that underlie
                        the kind of education he received at Harrow. To offer any resolution to the
                        problem of attaining knowledge that forms the structural center of the play
                        would undermine the nihilism that provides the play’s only pathos.
                        Additionally, such a resolution would imply that the mortal knowledge Cain
                        and Abel gain through murder and death could be contained in one of Cain’s
                        logical syllogisms. Instead, Byron leaves us facing the opposition between
                        the logical metaphysics for which Cain feels his immortal birth has fitted
                        him and the logic-defying corporeality that leads to death. Byron strikes at
                        this opposition like one striking the skin of a drum. The sound caused,
                        re-sounds, its echo manifested in our search for knowledge that we cannot
                        harness in use.</p>

               <p rend="noCount"> This collection combines studies of pedagogical history in the
                    late eighteenth and early nineteenth century with discourses about innovations
                    taking place in today’s classrooms. By including essays on both topics, we hope
                    to expose the breadth and richness of educational debates in Romanticism, to
                    shed light on new ways to teach Romantic texts, and, finally, to encourage
                    readers to find links between—and potentially answers to—the pedagogical
                    problems facing educators both today and two hundred years ago. </p>

               <p>In the last twenty years, scholars of Romanticism have approached education as a
                    subject of historical inquiry, as well as a modern conundrum. Some have turned
                    their attention to the rich debates in the Romantic era about education and
                    children’s literature, while others have entered a discussion taking place today
                    among academics, administrators, institutional trustees, and lawmakers about the
                    nature of higher education, in particular the place of the humanities within
                    university and college curricula. At first glance these two debates, separated
                    by nearly two hundred years, seem far removed from one another. When cultural
                    scholars discuss eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century education, we most
                    often mean primary or secondary education, whereas our conversations about
                    contemporary education typically center on undergraduate pedagogy at both the
                    classroom and institutional level. Pedagogy roundtables at NASSR and ASECS, for
                    example, focus on best practices for teaching historical texts to today’s
                    college students.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For example, between their
                        2013 and 2014 annual meetings, the American Society for Eighteenth-Century
                        Studies (ASECS) has included at least fourteen sessions (poster sessions,
                        roundtable discussions, and panel presentations) devoted to classroom
                        teaching, including the annual panels “Innovative Course Design” and “Let’s
                        Get Engaged!,” as well as the annual poster session “Teaching the Eighteenth
                        Century.” At least two of these sessions are also slated for the 2015 annual
                        meeting of ASECS. The North American Society for the Study of Romanticism
                        (NASSR) offers fewer pedagogical panels at their annual meeting but does
                        feature an annual pedagogy contest to promote innovations and best practices
                        in teaching.</note> Yet, many of the same issues that concern us today
                    pervaded late eighteenth-century education: the worry that students are
                    distracted by technology, the complaint that students have become uncivil, or
                    the fear that economic rather than intellectual achievement drives education. In
                    “Children, Adolescents, and Fashionable Urban Society in Eighteenth-Century
                    England,” Peter Borsay argues that the mid-eighteenth century witnessed a sea
                    change in middle-class education as pedagogues increasingly taught practical
                    skills to help children advance economically in the real world (56). Borsay’s
                    research suggests that the movement toward pragmatic skills, though certainly
                    influenced by philosophers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau, was also a reaction to
                    changing ideas about the purpose of education and the socio-economic environment
                    young people would encounter as adults. Such concerns can certainly be felt on
                    college campuses today: as Jim Engell and Arthur Dangerfield have rightfully
                    argued in <title level="m">Saving Higher Education in the Age of Money</title>
                    (2005), decisions at the college level are often made according to financial
                    concerns, with students more likely to choose and administrators more likely to
                    prioritize science, engineering, mathematics, and business programs over
                    departments of art history, English, philosophy, and classics (1-2). </p>
               <p>Such similarities within education, though, exist not simply on the macro level
                    of policy and research but also on the micro level of daily classroom teaching.
                    Educators from Charlotte Smith to Hannah More sought, much as we do today, to
                    make literature relevant to young students deluged with media and worried about
                    money. It is the relationship in approach and concern between the educators of
                    the Romantic era and today that has motivated this edition. This collection
                    combines studies of pedagogical history in the late eighteenth and early
                    nineteenth century with discourses about innovations taking place in today’s
                    classrooms. By including essays on both topics, we hope to expose the breadth
                    and richness of educational debates in Romanticism, to shed light on new ways to
                    teach Romantic texts, and, finally, to encourage readers to find links
                    between—and potentially answers to—the pedagogical problems facing educators
                    both today and two hundred years ago.</p>

                  <head>Innovations in Romantic-Era Education: New Audiences, Old Concerns</head>
                  <p>In the Romantic era, questions about classroom innovations and the potential
                        benefits and dangers of literacy were debated in the popular press,
                        exclaimed from pulpits, and dissected by all manner of writers and
                        theorists. From the 1780s to the 1830s, these disputants struggled to
                        identify what the so-called lower classes—women, children, and poor people
                        in particular—should learn and read. Technological improvements in
                        printmaking meant that the written word was more accessible than ever
                        before, and this accessibility sparked debates over the dangers of literacy
                        and methods to combat the widespread dissemination of texts and ideas.
                        Perhaps no figure exemplifies this anxiety over pedagogical change more than
                        Sarah Trimmer. Trimmer’s <title level="m">Guardian of Education</title>
                        (1802) is as conservative as it is reactionary, never more so than when
                        declaiming its own necessity: <quote>Many people […] will be apt to consider
                            us in the light of ALARMISTS, if we talk of <emph>a conspiracy against
                            </emph>CHRISTIANITY <emph>and all </emph>SOCIAL ORDER, […] one of which
                            is, endeavouring to infect the minds of the rising generation, through
                            the medium of <title level="m">Books of Education</title> and <title level="m">Children’s Books</title>; but that such a conspiracy does
                            actually exist has been proved by undeniable authority, (as we shall
                            shew in the course of our work). (2) </quote> Such authority proves to
                        be Trimmer herself, as a mother, teacher, author, and high church Anglican.
                        Trimmer promises in the <title level="m">Guardian</title> to hunt down
                        radicalism and immorality in children’s books. Unsurprisingly, she finds
                        juvenile literature attacked on all sides: unlike in her own youth,
                        contemporary books are “replete with hidden mischief” (64) and contemporary
                        publishers so eager to turn a profit that they will sell anything, even
                        books that “threaten the utter perversion of all principle” (65). Most
                        alarming, Trimmer deduces a change not only in the content of children’s
                        books but also in their educational principles: <quote>Indeed numbers of
                            modern publications for children are evidently calculated to bring about
                            the same changes of system in the education of the children of this
                            nation, as has been produced by similar means on the Continent, […] and
                            if not checked in their progress, the consequences will be equally fatal
                            to the principle and morality of this nation. (64) </quote> Trimmer’s
                        choice of diction is deliberate, designed to inflame a paranoid
                        socio-political culture already concerned that the French revolution could
                        migrate to British soil. For Trimmer, the dangerous effects of this
                        pedagogical change are pervasive and imminent, and the cultural price of
                        such literature is nothing less than the loss of national character and
                        public peace. </p>
                  <p>William Godwin’s Juvenile Library, the children’s publishing house he
                        established in 1805 (and the subject of the editors’ ongoing <title level="m">Romantic Circles Electronic Edition</title>), is
                        another example of contemporary anxiety regarding what types of literature
                        should be available to children. In 1813 an anonymous spy sent a report to
                        the Home Office about Godwin’s subversive activities. His concern was not
                        Godwin’s widely received and oft-republished <title level="m">Enquiry
                            Concerning Political Justice and Its Influence on General Happiness and

                        Thelwall, and John Horne Tooke at their treason trials in 1795, but rather
                        his publication of children’s textbooks. <title level="m">Fables Ancient and
                            Modern </title>(1805), Godwin’s version of Aesop’s tales, may not strike
                        readers today as particularly pernicious, yet this anonymous spy disagrees,
                        envisioning Godwin’s literature as a radical project to undermine the
                        government by harnessing the anger of the working classes. By offering
                        “every work […] that can be required in the early instruction of children,”
                        the report argues, the Juvenile Library advocates “every principle professed
                        by the infidels and republicans of these days.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> We would like to thank Pamela Clemit, who directed us to

                        The result, the spy warns, may be a civil war: “By such means did Voltaire
                        and his brethren for twenty years before the Revolution in France spread
                        infidelity and disloyalty through the remotest provinces of that country,
                        and we know too well how they succeeded” (qtd. in Barnett and Gustafson
                        2).</p>
                  <p>The recommendations of Trimmer’s <title level="m">Guardian</title> and the
                        concerns about Godwin’s “radical” publishing venture speak to the cultural
                        space of education in early-nineteenth-century Britain. Trimmer may be an
                        alarmist, but she was not an anomaly. Education—in particular early
                        school—was widely regarded as the cradle of future social and spiritual
                        beliefs and, by extension, national health and longevity. Romanticists have
                        long recognized the cultural significance of education in the period. From
                        the 1980s to the early 2000s, writers such as Mitzi Myers and Donelle Ruwe
                        established that children’s literature was an untapped yet crucially
                        important area of intellectual inquiry. Scholars ranging from Alan
                        Richardson and James Holt McGavran to, more recently, Jackie Horne and
                        Andrew O’Malley have uncovered new information about the nature of childhood
                        and children’s literature in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
                        Their combined work suggests that education was a crucial testing ground in
                        the Romantic era for formulating socioeconomic, religious, political, and
                        ultimately national values. In the early nineteenth century, education was
                        considered a ground zero for the creation of a civil society in a rapidly
                        expanding and unequal world. </p>
                  <p> Though alarmist, Trimmer’s observations about the deluge of new educational
                        materials were indeed accurate. The Romantic era witnessed broad
                        experimentation with and theorization of education at various levels. As
                        Trimmer rightfully acknowledges, Rousseau’s <title level="m">Émile, ou De
                            l’éducation </title>(1762) profoundly influenced British educational
                        philosophy. Thomas Day and Richard Lovell Edgeworth, famously, sought to
                        raise children according to Rousseau’s model. Maria Edgeworth, Mary
                        Wollstonecraft, Charlotte Smith, William Godwin, Frances Burney, and others
                        engaged with his ideas on an intellectual level, picking those elements that
                        made sense while criticizing those that seemed objectionable.
                        Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman
                        </title>(1792) and Edgeworth’s <title level="m">Belinda </title>(1801), for
                        example, attacked Rousseau’s educational program for women as inadequate and
                        infantilizing, and the Rousseauvian tutor-figure appears unfavorably in
                        Godwin’s <title level="m">Fleetwood, or the New Man of Feeling
                        </title>(1805) and Burney’s <title level="m">Camilla, or a Portrait of Youth
                        </title>(1796). </p>
                  <p>Changes within British education, however, go well beyond Rousseau’s
                        pedagogical philosophy, as Borsay has demonstrated. Though it certainly
                        imported continental children’s books and educational treatises, mid- to
                        late-eighteenth century Britain became a testing ground for homegrown
                        educational innovations driven by inadequacies within the pedagogical
                        options available. Grammar schools had been set up in the Renaissance in
                        order to educate poor children, but according to Alan Richardson’s <title level="m">Literature, Education, and Romanticism </title>(1994), by the
                        mid- to late- eighteenth century they had largely begun to exclude poor
                        children in favor of middle and upper class pupils (81). Public institutions
                        like Eton and Westminster were almost exclusively the purview of wealthy
                        children, and they drew criticism for a savage, corrupting student culture,
                        in particular the fagging system that exposed the vulnerability of the lower
                        classmen to the brutality of the upperclassmen.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For example, young Percy Shelley’s resistance to fagging
                            and other such “Shelley-baits” at Eton is recounted in many biographies,
                            including James Bieri’s <title level="m">Percy Bysshe Shelley: A
                                Biography: Youth's Unextinguished Fire, 1792-1816,</title>
                            (University of Delaware Press, 2004). In <title level="m">The Life of
                                Percy Bysshe Shelley</title> (1858), Thomas Jefferson Hogg
                            identifies Shelley’s refusal to submit to the “aggravated miseries”
                            inflicted upon the youngest and weakest students by the older “tyrants”
                            as an early example of the poet’s opposition to tyranny in all its
                            forms.</note> These institutions, moreover, focused largely on teaching
                        classical languages, a pedagogy whose value was, according to Borsay and
                        Richardson, being questioned (Borsay 56, Richardson 80). Oxford and
                        Cambridge universities, meanwhile, excluded Dissenters and other
                        non-Anglicans. In short, while an educational system—<emph>ad hoc</emph> at
                        best—was in place in Britain in the eighteenth century, it did not meet the
                        needs of women, Dissenters, and working class children and, indeed, served
                        only a wealthy, male minority of the population. </p>
                  <p>The Romantic era thus is characterized by efforts to improve upon
                        pre-existing institutions and curricula, and many such efforts attempted to
                        ameliorate issues debated since the early eighteenth century, such as the
                        inadequate instruction of girls and poor children. Richardson’s research
                        suggests that educational debates became particularly heated in the 1790s
                        and again in the 1820s (65, 214). Education changes correlate with an
                        explosion in publishing—especially children’s book publishing—as well as
                        with the rise of female pedagogues, such as Anna Barbauld, Wollstonecraft,
                        and Trimmer, and with increased socioeconomic, cultural, and political
                        turbulence. They also bookend what has traditionally been seen as the
                        temporal boundaries of the Romantic era, thereby highlighting the centrality
                        of educational reform within this period as a means of assessing and
                        addressing social tensions. </p>
                  <p>One area that has received particular attention by scholars is the growth of
                        women’s education in the eighteenth century. If education for young men was
                        decentralized and non-compulsory, it was even more so for girls, for whom
                        there was no established educational system like the public schools and
                        universities available to young men. The eighteenth century saw the increase
                        in boarding schools for girls, though many girls were educated at home by a
                        parent or governess. Women’s basic education throughout the eighteenth
                        century consisted of arithmetic, reading, writing, and sewing. Better
                        schools and home schooling would provide instruction in dancing, music,
                        comportment, embroidery, and later botany, geography, and modern foreign
                        languages. By the 1780s and 1790s, many women writers were rethinking female
                        education through treatises and children’s literature; most prominent among
                        these were Wollstonecraft, Smith, Hester Chapone, Eleanor Fenn, and More.
                        Some writers sought to cultivate qualities like temperance, rationality, and
                        benevolence as an antidote not only to the attainment of fashionable
                        accomplishments thought to characterize women’s education but also to the
                        metaphorical lobotomizing of women epitomized by Rousseau’s Sophie. As Myers
                        argues in “Impeccable Governesses, Rational Dames, and Moral Mothers,”
                        writers like Wollstonecraft, Fenn, and Smith innovated a pedagogical fiction
                        that would inculcate such qualities through the figure of the female mentor. </p>
                  <p>While Wollstonecraft and others sought to make female education more
                        rigorous, other pedagogues turned to the educational needs of working-class
                        children and adults. The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK)
                        was founded in 1698 and was active in fits and starts throughout the
                        eighteenth century, seeing a brief resurgence in the 1820s (Richardson 214).
                        Its primary purpose was to teach reading and catechism to poor children. The
                        SPCK eventually found itself competing with Charity Schools, Sunday Schools,
                        and Industrial Schools. Although rivals, these charitable institutions
                        provided an alternative to the local “dame” schools that had cropped up
                        across Britain. Without national oversight, dame schools ran the gamut from
                        legitimate private schools to little more than housing services for poor
                        children; furthermore, as Richardson observes, its teachers were often
                        accused of being variously uneducated, overworked, underpaid, and even drunk
                        (87). </p>
                  <p>SPCK and other charity schools were founded on a largely unappealing idea of
                        encouraging poor children to understand and submit to their own subordinate,
                        God-given positions, to be obedient to rules and employers, and to “better”
                        themselves by mimicking middle class morality. These efforts were matched by
                        other endeavors to replace broadsides and chapbooks with improving stories
                        (of which Hannah More’s <title level="m">Cheap Repository Tracts</title> are
                        the most famous). Both SPCK and Sunday schools arose as a means of
                        addressing an increasingly literate British society. The SPCK’s and Sunday
                        Schools’ answer was to confine students’ access to literature to the bible
                        and devotional tracts; likewise Mechanics Institutes, though initially
                        founded by skilled laborers as an antidote to the religious lessons offered
                        in charity schools, eventually ceded control to middle class “sponsors” who
                        limited their reading to certain types of so-called improving books. These
                        limitations reflected middle class desires to control and channel literacy
                        in order to encourage the inculcation of middle class values, including
                        industry, order, temperance, cleanliness, and restraint, to their social
                        inferiors (Richardson 220). As Richardson explains, it was not until the
                        1820s that the message of subordination and religious obedience gave way to
                        a new discourse about education for the poor primarily advanced by James
                        Mill, Jeremy Bentham, Henry Bourgham, Francis Jeffrey, and Charles Knight
                        (214-215). As Richardson argues, this new discourse maintained that
                        “literacy was to be managed rather than restrained” and that a more
                        liberally educated workforce “would prove a more sure path to social
                        stability (and limited reform) than would the combination of passive
                        literacy, Christian morals, and deferential behavior advanced by an earlier
                        generation of educationalists” (215).</p>

                  <p>Modern teachers of the Romantic era might find unexpected sympathy with some
                        of Trimmer’s less hysterical complaints, such as her concern that students
                        are saturated in popular media that degrade their intellects. Any teacher
                        who has complained about losing his or her students to the lure of iPhones
                        or who has sighed over students’ use of emoticons in an email can
                        understand, at least in part, Trimmer’s position. Today, there is a tangible
                        sense that we are at a moment of change within education. As Engell and
                        Dangerfield argue, monetary concerns seem more directly entrenched in the
                        curricular decisions made at universities than in previous generations,
                        especially as administrators, educators, and students seek to determine the
                        role of humanistic study within modern higher education. Two issues that
                        become intertwined in literary and cultural history classrooms are
                        humanities and technology, as instructors seek to innovate pedagogical
                        methods to reach a new generation of students. For Romanticists, the most
                        pressing questions remain as straightforward as their answers are
                        complicated: how can we encourage students to engage with Romantic texts in
                        thoughtful and thought-provoking ways? What values will they derive from
                        studying old texts? How can technology improve our ability to teach these
                        texts and to make them relevant? </p>
                  <p>Towards these ends, this edition has been organized into two separate but
                        conversational sections: <title level="m">Pedagogies in Romanticism
                        </title>and <title level="m">Pedagogies of Romanticism</title>. The first
                        addresses questions of Romantic-era theories and practices by exploring four
                        figures who grappled with questions about how and why one learns: Tom
                        Wedgewood, Wollstonecraft, Smith, and Lord Byron. The second set of essays
                        focuses on the teaching of Romanticism today. While some examine ways of
                        utilizing digital resources, including gaming, in the modern Romantics
                        classroom, others consider more traditional pedagogical methods, such as
                        close reading, in new ways. </p>
                  <p> In part one’s “‘Hints &amp; Speculation on Education’: Tom Wedgwood’s
                        Materialist Pedagogy,” Lisa Ann Robertson considers Wedgwood’s role within
                        the intellectual history of the early Romantic period, including
                        contemporary debates about education and materialist theories of cognition.
                        Wedgwood, she argues, is today a marginalized figure valued more for his
                        associations with William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge than for
                        his own work, yet he “is significant because [he] gathered together several
                        strands of Romantic philosophical thought” to form “a practical plan of
                        education that would bring about a society of geniuses committed to the
                        principles of liberty, equality, communitarian values, and social justice.”
                        Reading Wedgwood’s manuscripts, accounts of his own physical ailments, and
                        plans for an experimental school, as well as texts that influenced him (such
                        as Joseph Priestley’s edition of <title level="m">Hartley’s Theory of Mind
                        </title>(1775) and Erasmus Darwin’s <title level="m">Zoonomia</title>
                        (1794)), Robertson traces Wedgwood’s understanding of the relationships
                        between emotions, thought, and association and situates the heretofore
                        under-recognized influence of his work within the larger context of
                        Romantic-era theories of cognition and education.</p>
                  <p>Suzanne L. Barnett’s “Generic Mutability and the Pedagogy of Realism in
                        Charlotte Smith’s <title level="m">The Romance of Real Life</title> and Mary
                        Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Original Stories from Real Life</title>”
                        positions those two works in larger conversations about gender, genre,
                        authority, and reading’s role in education in the Romantic period. Barnett
                        argues that these women writers’ experiments with the hybrid genres of
                        “romance of real life” and (fictional) “stories from real life” stem from
                        anxieties about the suitability of women for fiction-writing and attempts to
                        marshal the “serious” genre of historiography and the pedagogy of the real
                        into the service of the moral education of both children <emph>and</emph>
                        their mothers. </p>
                  <p>In “Byron’s <title level="m">Cain</title> and Romantic Education,” Cassandra
                        Falke places <title level="m">Cain</title> within Romantic discourses of
                        learning and compares Byron’s depiction of “heroic learning” to Romantic-era
                        pedagogy that stressed moral discipline and education as preparation for a
                        life of useful work. In Byron’s time, the idea that reading should prepare
                        the lower classes for utility and virtuous servitude was complicated by
                            <title level="m">Cain</title>’s almost immediate piracy, which,
                        according to its contemporary critics, put a tool of potentially “dangerous
                        disturbance” into the hands of ignorant and unprepared working-class
                        readers. Falke paints Cain’s desire to learn and the play’s treatment of
                        knowledge as not only a locus of conversation about hubris and Byron’s
                        blasphemy but also as a “subtle inquiry into the possibility and limits of
                        knowledge.” </p>
                  <p>The second part of this edition turns from the pedagogical theories of
                        Romantic-period writers to consider how modern educators might most
                        successfully teach Romantic literature and culture to twenty-first-century
                        students. “Universal Truths, Unacknowledged Legislators: Teaching the First
                        Sentence of <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>” offers a targeted
                        yet expansive classroom exercise in which students analyze word-by-word
                        Austen’s famous line: “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single
                        man in possession of a large fortune, must be in want of a wife.” This
                        process “unfolds historical and formal problems of Romanticism,” including
                        Austen’s criticism of gender and class constructions. Chris Washington
                        compares the self-reflexive irony of this first sentence to the rest of the
                        novel and illuminates how students have responded to such a laser-focused
                        classroom assignment and what it teaches them about reading Romantic texts. </p>
                  <p>“Imagining the Internet through the Romantics” chronicles Brian Rejack’s
                        attempts to allow students “to see digital culture from a shifted
                        intellectual perspective” and reflects on “the overlapping domains of
                        teaching and research, new and old media, and the imaginative frameworks
                        that help us place their iterative connections.” Rejack considers how the
                        inherent immateriality of digital culture intersects with the “Romantic
                        ideology” of textual media and how his students’ process of imaginatively
                        “embodying” Romantic texts via new media reflects the relationship between
                        imagination and matter. Using texts as disparate as an AT&amp;T commercial,
                        Leonardo Solaas’s net-art installation<title level="m"> Google
                            Variations</title>, Apple iCloud promotional materials, and Percy
                        Shelley’s “The Cloud,” Rejack describes how he invites his students to
                        recognize “the ways in which they live as historical bodies in and of the
                        world” and asks his readers to consider the evolving roles of digital
                        technology in the classroom. </p>
                  <p>In “Revisiting the Radical Republican Publishers of the Romantic Era in the
                        Digital Era,” Michael Demson considers another intersection of print and
                        digital media: employing digital resources in a course on four republican
                        publishers of the Romantic era (William Blake, Leigh Hunt, William Hone, and
                        William Cobbett). Demson suggests that such a course would have been nearly
                        impossible before resources like <title level="m">Romantic Circles, The
                            William Blake Archive, </title>and <title level="m">The William Hone
                            Biotext</title> that make available previously inaccessible (or at least
                        difficult and costly to access) texts and images to both graduate and
                        undergraduate classrooms. Demson notes that, for example, it is now possible
                        for his students to search for phrases like “rotten borough” across hundreds
                        of publications or to trace the ways an author or periodical cover a
                        particular story over time. Demson describes how a combination of
                        traditional and digital media can combine in the classroom to offer students
                        a richer experience of Romantic-era print culture. </p>
                  <p>In the final essay in this edition, “Playing with Independence: Using
                        Multiplayer Online Narratives to Explore Independent and Interdependent
                        Tensions in Romantic-Period Literature,” Jon Saflofske explores how
                        multiplayer games enable students to explore questions about character and
                        plot in Romantic fiction. The fact that these games are specifically
                        multiplayer and require cooperation between students “simulates
                        opportunities for negotiating the tensions between independence and
                        interdependence,” according to Saklofske, and inspires collaborative
                        creativity (and occasionally productive frustration) that mirrors both the
                        experience of living in the late eighteenth century and also of working
                        together on a creative project. </p>
                  <p>As a collection, these seven essays offer diverse ways of thinking about the
                        intersections of Romanticism and pedagogy: both what Romantic-era figures
                        themselves thought about the processes of learning and teaching and also
                        what we as modern educators might consider as we present these texts and
                        figures to our students. It is our hope that they will contribute to ongoing
                        conversations among scholars and teachers of Romanticism about the history
                        and future of humanities education, and in particular will foster
                        cross-historical conversations. </p>

               <p rend="noCount"> This essay chronicles my experience teaching a course outside of
                    the realm of Romanticism (a first-year writing course focused on digital media),
                    an experience which occasioned reflection on the lessons that Romanticism can
                    offer us about contemporary new media, and in particular how we approach new
                    media pedagogically. The essay begins with an overview of new media scholarship
                    which seeks to redress the tendency to view new media as always immaterial, the
                    scholarship that informed much of the focus of the course in question. I next
                    discuss some of the tools and methods adopted in teaching the course. And the
                    final move in the essay turns toward Romanticism, and specifically to theories
                    of and scholarship on the Romantic imagination. My final contention is that the
                    Romantic imagination offers ways to resist the ideology of immateriality which
                    characterizes so much of new media discourse. </p>

               <p>In the spring of 2011, I taught a first-year writing seminar focused on fictional
                    and non-fictional representations of the internet and digital culture.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I’d like to thank the students of my course for
                        all the enthusiasm and insight they brought to our investigations of digital
                        culture. Their hard work helped shape my thinking in ways that I couldn’t
                        have imagined beforehand. </note> As a devoted Romanticist, I envisioned
                    such an opportunity as a chance to step outside my usual nineteenth-century base
                    and see what effects the time spent in unfamiliar terrain might produce. My goal
                    was to help students approach critically various aspects of technological life,
                    and, in so doing, encourage them to reflect on the relation between college
                    writing and the twenty-first-century media landscape. The connection between my
                    initial conception of the course and Romanticism was tangential at most. I
                    titled the course “Imagining the Internet” because I wanted students to see
                    digital culture from a shifted intellectual perspective, specifically through
                    the logic of defamiliarization that imagination enables. In particular I wanted
                    to counter the reigning digital rhetoric, one which privileges immateriality as
                    if it were actually the ontological condition of computing. From its beginnings
                    cyberculture has represented the digital realm as one free from materiality, as
                    in the emblematic early example of the hackers in William Gibson’s <title level="m">Neuromancer</title> (1984) who long to escape into cyberspace and
                    away from their bodies, which they derisively term “meat.” That immaterial
                    ideology persists in our contemporary practices like cloud computing and syncing
                    between devices, both of which give the impression that the data accessed has no
                    fixed material basis, but merely exists as eternally mutable zeroes and ones. As
                    such, “imagination” may have seemed an odd choice, given that it tends to be
                    understood as the mental faculty capable of transporting us out of embodied
                    experience, in a manner akin to what cyberspace purportedly enables. Instead, I
                    wanted students to discover some of the complex material exchanges that make
                    possible digital culture’s aura of immateriality, and to do so by imagining the
                    materiality that so easily eludes our grasp of the digital. Although I began the
                    course assuming that it would take me into new territory, I quickly found myself
                    in a space eerily familiar to me as a Romanticist, a space where imagination,
                    ideology and materiality exist in fraught relation to one another. In this essay
                    I recount that experience as a way to reflect on the overlapping domains of
                    teaching and research, new and old media, and the frameworks that help us place
                    their iterative connections. </p>
               <p>In what follows, then, I demonstrate how I presented my students with the digital
                    rhetoric of immateriality, how we attempted to resist that rhetoric with the aid
                    of digital tools, and how that process illuminated what it means to
                    imaginatively embody Romantic texts, an illumination that additionally cast
                    light back on new media. Romantic theories of imagination offered a conceptual
                    framework for students to intellectually and creatively rematerialize the
                    seemingly immaterial nature of digital objects. As Lori Emerson argues
                    concerning interface design trends in contemporary computing, new media
                    interfaces are now “steadily making their way toward invisibility,
                    imperceptibility, and inoperability” (1), characteristics which become equated
                    rhetorically with “naturalness” and the devices’ seemingly “magical” properties
                    (4–19). When dealing with technologies of such complexity, when, as Percy
                    Shelley claims, “our calculations have outrun conception,” the imagination can

                    materiality back into view.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> While my focus in
                        this essay rests on how these issues played out in the classroom (and how
                        that experience subsequently helped me see anew the connections between my
                        scholarship and pedagogy), I’m indebted to the work of several other
                        scholars who have imagined various digital futures for Romanticism through
                        their practices. I’m thinking of course of the many digital resources, like
                            <ref target="http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/">
                        <title level="m">The

                        <title level="j">NINES</title>
                     </ref>, that have invigorated
                        nineteenth-century scholarship in the digital era. But also I have in mind
                        work like Paul Youngquist’s playful and incisive “Techno-Prosthetic Romantic
                        Futurism,” an essay in the mold of hypertext fiction, in which he suggests,
                        among other things, imagining <ref target="http://www.erudit.org/projspec/article/013157ar/950.html">“criticism of Romanticism as a field of digital possibility,”</ref> a
                        realm where the <ref target="http://www.erudit.org/projspec/article/013157ar/190.html">hacker
                            is the hero of “digital resistance” just as the Romantics hacked
                            textuality before the advent of cyberspace</ref>. Similarly compelling
                        is Andrew Stauffer’s insistence that, in the digitizing and archiving of
                        nineteenth-century texts, we ought to “use the digital environment not to
                        supplant the paper record, but to develop a more nuanced critical method for
                        understanding the physical forms and features of the papers that the
                        Romantics left behind” (17). </note> Now more than five years after the
                    teaching experience I relate in this article, I have taught Romanticism several
                    more times, in different contexts (as part of a survey, in seminar form devoted
                    wholly to Romanticism, as part of a genre-based course) and to different
                    audiences (undergraduate English majors and non-majors, MA and PhD students),
                    and as a result I am more confident in my conviction that when we teach
                    Romanticism, we teach a form of media studies. Imagining a medium (old or new)
                    just is doing Romanticism. In that sense, the habits of mind and practice
                    outlined here signify a pedagogy <emph>of</emph> Romanticism as much as one
                        <emph>for</emph> Romanticism.</p>

                  <head>I. “There is no matter here”: The Illusions of Medial Ideology</head>
                  <p>The intellectual kernel that led me to develop the course, and which began to
                        solidify in my mind the productive connections between Romanticism and new
                        media studies, was Matthew Kirschenbaum’s identification of a “medial
                        ideology” pervading the study of electronic media. Acknowledging his debt to
                        Jerome McGann’s notion of “Romantic ideology,” Kirschenbaum defines his
                        related ideology as “one that substitutes popular representations of a
                        medium […] for a more comprehensive treatment of the material particulars of
                        a given technology” (36).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> McGann’s
                            argument in 1983 that Romanticist scholarship suffered from “an
                            uncritical absorption in Romanticism’s own self-representations” (1)
                            transfers remarkably well to the realm of media studies. Kirschenbaum
                            was not the first to resist such uncritical absorption in the context of
                            new media. For instance, a decade prior, Katherine Hayles attempted as
                            much by identifying and challenging what she calls an “ideology of
                            disembodiment” which has its roots in early communications theory and
                            computational practices. She contends that “[t]he body’s
                            dematerialization depends in complex and highly specific ways on the
                                <emph>embodied</emph> circumstances that an ideology of
                            dematerialization would obscure” (193). Kirschenbaum extends the work of
                            recapturing embodied circumstances by focusing on the forensic level of
                            digital materiality (i.e. down to the bit level of the hard drive) as
                            well as the formal level of its appearance in various software and
                            hardware configurations (i.e. a blinking cursor on the screen).</note>
                        Kirschenbaum demonstrates how the representations of digital culture portray
                        new media as divorced from the material aspects of its existence—we treat
                        zeroes and ones as if they were merely abstractions, not as metaphors to
                        signify particular material processes. To establish some of the course’s
                        foundational assumptions about new media, then, I introduced my students to
                        a variety of “popular representations of [the] medium.” We aimed to read
                        these texts through a conventional humanities practice: ideology critique.
                        The specific aspect of digital ideology we examined was the assumption that
                        bodies do not matter, and that material concerns disappear in the purely
                        disembodied flow of data. One can witness that assumption’s most extreme
                        form in the desire to translate the human brain into binary code and thereby
                        achieve digital immortality (by now a common science fiction trope as well
                        as an <ref target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uIzS1uCOcE">actual goal
                            of many technological enthusiasts</ref>), but it also persists in the
                        banal versions one encounters regularly in the practice of everyday digital
                        life. The first example discussed here, and one of the first texts I
                        presented to my students, falls squarely in the former category: John Perry
                        Barlow’s “<ref target="https://projects.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html">A
                            Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</ref>,” first published in
                        February 1996 through the <title level="m">Electronic Frontier
                            Foundation</title>, an internet advocacy group co-founded by Barlow. In
                        what became a widely copied and disseminated document of the early Web,
                        Barlow addresses the “Governments of the Industrial World,” the “weary
                        giants of flesh and steel” who have no sway over “the new home of Mind,”
                        rhetorical figures which pose industry as the evil cyborg enemies of the
                        pure spirit of humanity. Cyberspace is posed as “an act of nature […]
                        [which] grows itself through our collective actions,” and that such growth
                        “consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a
                        standing wave in the web of our communications.” With freedom from the
                        trappings of industry, politics, capitalism and other material concerns,
                        Barlow insists of cyberspace, “there is no matter here.” The social
                        reorganization promised by cyberspace extends to individual subjectivity as
                        well, with a similar stripping away of matter. Barlow claims that “our
                        identities have no bodies,” and that, like the discrete packets of bits that
                        zoom across the globe from one computer to another, they are endlessly
                        mutable and mobile. These bodiless identities, without the limitations of
                        material existence inhabit a world of pure imagination: “whatever the human
                        mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost.”
                        Or, we might say, channeling Gene Wilder’s Willy Wonka, “If you want to view
                        paradise, simply look around and view it. Anything you want to, do it. Want
                        to change the world, there’s nothing to it.” </p>
                  <p>So says another representative example that my students and I analyzed: <ref target="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZMZoy3rrlM&amp;">an AT&amp;T
                            advertisement</ref> from 2010 which uses “Pure Imagination” as its
                        backing music. The ad co-opts the rhetoric of early techno-utopian
                        manifestos like Barlow’s, but it drastically changes the kind of “freedom”
                        on offer. Freedom in the ad means life in a corporate world with the promise
                        of escape through the internet, even as the network itself becomes more
                        corporatized and centrally controlled through seemingly ubiquitous points of
                        access and handy “tethered devices.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                            Jonathan Zittrain uses the term “tethered devices” to refer to products
                            like smartphones, iPods, and gaming consoles, the uses of which are
                            restricted by the companies that produce them (as opposed to personal
                            computers, which users can open, modify, and install third-party
                            software on without the parent company’s approval). Zittrain argues that
                            the prevalence of such devices will enact “a wholesale shift of our
                            information ecosystem away from generativity” (102) and towards greater
                            control (from regulators, the hardware companies, service providers,
                            etc.). </note> The ad shows various young urbanites navigating through a
                        post-industrial world, still one of flesh and steel, and yet they seem
                        unaware of the magical world that pulses around them (like a wireless
                        network), here pictured in the form of childlike drawings brought to life
                        amidst the cityscape. Toward the commercial’s end, the drawings all
                        collapse, suggesting the end of imagination precisely at the moment that the
                        objects become fully material (a train crashes into a wall; a three-eyed
                        monster drapes over the side of a bridge; a giant robot falls to the ground,
                        along with his attendant cloud shapes). After the figures disappear, the ad
                        cuts to an isolated man sitting on a bench perched on a concrete overlook,
                        his head downcast, his shirt unbuttoned and tie loosened, his briefcase,
                        coffee and lunch next to him—all helpful details suggesting his
                        post-industrial ennui, presumably the cause of the imaginary figures’
                        departures. But suddenly, the man remembers his smartphone, and its
                        unearthly glow lights up his now smiling face, as one of the imagined
                        figures return to the scene. Once again he lives in a world of pure
                        imagination.</p>
                  <p>In addition to introducing the ideology of cyberspace as a disembodied,
                        immaterial realm free from politics, class, and matter itself, I used these
                        two texts to reflect on the way we access and interpret such materials.
                        YouTube, the site on which we watched the ad, is a vastly useful collection
                        of visual materials, but not a transparent one. Our class discussed, for
                        example, YouTube’s (then current, now defunct) motto, “Broadcast
                            yourself,”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For most of its existence,
                            YouTube’s title (as displayed in the title bar of a web browser) has
                            read “YouTube – Broadcast Yourself.” After October 24, 2012, the title
                            appears only as “YouTube.” As the site’s emphasis has shifted from
                            producing to consuming, the devaluing of individuals doing the
                            “broadcasting” by and of themselves is unsurprising.</note> as an
                        intentional alignment with the history of amateur broadcasting in the early
                        twentieth century, which has repeatedly followed the pattern of innovation,
                        amateur development, and corporate appropriation described in <title level="m">The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information
                            Empires</title> (2010) by Tim Wu. With the AT&amp;T ad, the self that is
                        broadcasted is named “<ref target="https://www.youtube.com/user/attoffer">attoffer</ref>,” and when you click on “his” personal website, it
                        unsurprisingly directs you to offers for a subscription to AT&amp;T’s
                        various network services. What begins as an open service, a place where
                        anyone can post videos for free without limitations on access and ownership,
                        becomes increasingly closed, regulated and centrally controlled. While
                        peddling immaterial ideology to the extent that the “self” is the message
                        being broadcast, as Barlow hoped identities without bodies might do, YouTube
                        suggests, through its specific medial transactions, a contradictory set of
                        ideas about what pure imagination through a network might entail. Here the
                        freedom of cyberspace comes at a cost, one that “attoffer” will happily
                        specify, even as its parent company’s rhetoric obscures the material
                        interactions through which the network functions.</p>
                  <p>After introducing this particular awareness of digital materiality, I hoped
                        to help students to see immaterial ideology <emph>as </emph>ideology.
                        Discussing texts like Barlow’s “Declaration” and the AT&amp;T advertisement
                        certainly began that process, but those methods were firmly rooted in an old
                        method: ideologically attuned close reading. I wanted also to use digital
                        tools to demonstrate the ways in which our experience of digital culture
                        comes back to materiality. Text analysis software, for instance, offers a
                        particularly striking way to reflect on textual materiality and to imagine
                        what it might mean to reintroduce material specificity to digital objects.
                        By demonstrating a text’s mutability as it moves from one material medium to
                        another, the complexities of textual signification become newly
                            visible.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This recognition is similar
                            to McGann’s point about the theoretical and conceptual value gained from
                            encoding literary texts into digital environments: “Because our computer
                            tools are models of what we imagine we know—they’re built to our
                            specifications—when they show us what they know they are reporting
                            ourselves back to us” (<title level="m">Radiant Textuality</title>
                            143).</note> When the class read Rudy Rucker’s classic cyberpunk novel
                            <title level="m">Software</title> (1982), we put the novel’s entire text
                        into a web-based program called <ref target="http://voyant-tools.org">
                        <title level="m">Voyant</title>
                     </ref>, which analyzes the number of
                        occurrences of distinct words, and allows the manipulation of them in
                        various ways. One can view a word cloud (the larger words representing
                        visually their higher relative frequency), chart one word against another,
                        track a word’s appearance at different times throughout the book, and
                        otherwise manipulate the textual “corpus” as a dataset. With <title level="m">Software</title>, for example, one can track “software” and
                        “hardware,” the two terms around which the novel dramatizes its main
                        concerns regarding identity and embodiment. Early on a character opines that
                        “the soul is the software” (62). Cobb Anderson, the inventor of the
                        intelligent robots called “boppers,” gets rewarded by his creatures, who
                        translate his soul into new “hardware,” a robot body that looks exactly like
                        his human one, and which negates the pesky problem of mortality. By
                        isolating the two words, one can view them in context across all their
                        instances in the novel in different visual and linguistic representations. </p>
                  <p>Of course, one can accomplish a similar task, but more slowly, using
                        traditional reading methods. The usefulness of a digital tool like this one
                        rests on the altered presentation of information that we might alternatively
                        access through print. I foregrounded this particular realization for my
                        students by focusing on the manipulation of the text required to produce
                        such a representation, a process that reinforces the material specificity of
                        texts, and the variations that occur between digital and print. Rucker
                        published, in 2010, the entire <title level="m">Ware Tetralogy</title>
                            (<title level="m">Software</title> and its three follow-ups) in a
                        single-volume print edition, which my students purchased for use in the
                        course. Students could alternatively read the novel in digital form, which
                        Rucker simultaneously published for free as a PDF made available through his
                        website and distributed under a Creative Commons license. Even with most of
                        the remediation already done for us, the process of transporting the digital
                        text into another software environment allowed us to reflect on how we might
                        understand “text” in relation to the novel’s interest in software and
                        hardware. The novel’s linguistic data became akin to code that we could run
                        on the different software and hardware configurations of a print book, a PDF
                        reader, or a web-based text analysis program.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> McGann offers another useful model for this approach to
                            textuality, when he writes, in <title level="m">Radiant
                                Textuality</title>, that “Any given textual form represents a
                            complex set of transactional codes written for simultaneous and/or
                            sequential execution” (150).</note> One particular problem, however,
                        demonstrated how the process of textual migration itself, like the
                        transmission of Cobb’s “software” (the data that makes up his “soul”) into
                        new “hardware” (a fresh robot body), reoriented the nature of the novel’s
                        print and digital materialities. When copying and pasting the text from the
                        PDF, the running header, reading “<title level="m">Rudy Rucker</title>” and
                            “<title level="m">The Ware Tetralogy: Software</title>” respectively on
                        the verso and recto (terms complicated by the typical single-page display of
                        PDFs), becomes part of the “corpus” analyzed by <title level="m">Voyant</title>. When tracking the instances of the word “software,” the
                        numbers get significantly skewed (since it appears seventy-three times in
                        the header). The result of witnessing this material negotiation of a
                        print-based text simultaneously published in digital format and then
                        transported into another instantiation was that my students had to consider
                        the text “as a laced network of linguistic and bibliographic codes” (<title level="m">Textual Condition</title> 13). Do we count those seventy-three
                        instances of “software” that occur in the header? Or rather,
                            <emph>how</emph> do we count them and account for their meaning? Such
                        questions become relevant when manipulating the text with an awareness of
                        the particular transactions that make such manipulation possible. Like the
                        novel itself, which skeptically regards the transmission of one’s “soul” via
                        software implemented in new “hardware,” our treatment of the digital text in
                        relation to its print forms helped us see the processes of transmission not
                        as transparent, but rather as contingent upon specific material factors. </p>
                  <p>In addition to analyzing print-based materials with the aid of digital tools,
                        the class also examined born-digital texts to see further the obscuring
                        effects of immaterial digital ideology. Students took a particular shine to
                        a project by Leonardo Solaas, a programmer and new media artist who created
                            <title level="m">Google Variations</title>, a net-art installation that
                        re-presents Google in altered states. Most of the variations present a
                        functional Google homepage with only slight tweaks. <ref target="http://turbulence.org/Works/google/pond/">“The Google
                            Pond,”</ref> for example, creates a visual ripple effect when moving the
                        cursor over the page. Similarly, <ref target="http://turbulence.org/Works/google/painter/">“Paint it
                            Google”</ref> transforms the cursor into a paint tool, and the page into
                        a color palette and canvas. Others have a more programmatic purpose and a
                        lesser degree of functionality. <ref target="http://turbulence.org/Works/google/god/1.htm">“Google is
                            God”</ref> displays six separate pages, designed to look like individual
                        search results from Google, all of which present quotations regarding the
                        correspondence between Google and divine power. The final result, however,
                        gestures outside of Solaas’s pre-programmed response, and opens an actual
                        Google results page for the query, <ref target="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+is+god">“google is
                            god.”</ref> The movement from “net art” to genuine web page occurs
                        without signal and as such works toward Solaas’s goal of destabilizing and
                        denaturalizing what has become such a dominant feature of internet use. The
                        final variation, titled <ref target="http://turbulence.org/Works/google/some/day/google/will/not/be/there/">“The Future,”</ref> reinforces the contingency of Google, and of all
                        such digital objects. It displays a typical “HTTP 404,” or “Page Not Found,”
                        error message, a standard code to indicate when communication with the
                        server is intact, but the requested page could not be found. The title of
                        the requested page in this case is “some/day/google/will/not/be/there/.” The
                        implication, of course, is that Google’s server has no such page because
                        Google does not anticipate such an eventuality. The “missing” page
                        nonetheless speaks by virtue of its absence. Solaas’s presentation reminds
                        us that Google will not exist for all eternity (an obvious truth), but
                        furthermore that the nature of its existence is contingent upon the
                        particularities of our material interfaces and programming and always
                        experienced in relation to the larger culture of computing. </p>
                  <p>The denaturalizing of digital objects performed by a work like <title level="m">Google Variations</title> enabled students to adopt a similar
                        perspective in their own productions. All students were required to write
                        for our course blog, a forum in which they could reflect on and treat
                        critically (and playfully<note place="foot" resp="editors"> One student, for
                            example, wrote his brief bio on our “Users” page as a series of 1s and
                            0s in ASCII binary code, with a link to <ref target="http://www.roubaixinteractive.com/PlayGround/Binary_Conversion/Binary_To_Text.asp">a website</ref> that would convert it to text.</note>) the
                        particular communicative modes enabled by the blog form. As is typical of
                        the form, students regularly used media in their posts, linked outside the
                        blog, referenced other peers’ posts, and perhaps most useful for the
                        course’s writing instruction goals, self-consciously adopted a tone more
                        informal than that employed in their academic papers. We specifically
                        discussed that difference in our conversations about academic writing in
                        multiple class sessions devoted to peer review. I also asked students to
                        contemplate the particularities of expression enabled by their word
                        processing software when writing their academic essays. For their second
                        paper, I assigned students a relatively conventional comparison paper
                        (analyzing texts from two different media), but with the additional
                        stipulation that they manipulate their medium with something in addition to
                        text. For most students this meant embedding images or video in their
                        essays, but even this simple task helped them reflect on the content of
                        their papers: rematerializing and denaturalizing digital objects. For
                        example, one student writing about William Gibson’s <title level="m">Agrippa</title> (1992) and Solaas’s <title level="m">Google
                            Variations</title> argues through an analysis of the two works “whether
                        a user is forced to submit to a medium or is granted options, the mechanism
                        through which one receives information dictates the interpretation of that
                        information.” She writes that <title level="m">Google Variations</title>
                        “reminds users of their role on a search engine since every movement creates
                        a new effect,” which in turn helps to erase the influence of Google itself:
                        namely, that because of Google’s ubiquity, “the user forgets the mechanism,
                        allowing the mechanism to have an influence without the user’s awareness.”
                        By embedding in her essay screenshots of her manipulation of <title level="m">Google Variations</title>, the student reinforced her argument
                        visually and methodologically (Figure 1). In effect, her image of “Paint it
                        Google” represents the kind of awareness of “the mechanism” she describes in
                        the paper. Not only has she altered the page by using the cursor to deform
                        Google’s logo, she has also typed in the search box, obscured but still
                        legible, “Vanderbilt University First Year Writing Seminars,” of which our
                        course was one. This moment of textual and visual play gets “captured” by
                        her computer’s screen capture software, and then redeployed in its modified
                        form by conscious manipulation of the software that enables her to compose
                        her essay. The essay itself, a product of the course being queried in her
                        altered Google, becomes another digital object subject to the conscious
                        manipulation of media she describes in the paper’s argument and analysis.</p>

                  <p> Entering into this assignment, and into the course more generally,
                        I assumed that it would be valuable to adopt digital methods and tools since
                        the course content was focused on new media. I came to realize more
                        strikingly what I had only intuited to be true before: that such tools are
                        valuable for the kinds of insight they produce, not simply because they
                        exist and so must be worth adopting. Objects like <title level="m">Voyant</title>’s text analysis software, Wordpress’s blog platform, and
                        even Microsoft Word as a basic—and, some would say, poor—multi-media
                        compositional tool all encouraged students to see their own practices with
                        digital technologies in relation to the intellectual stance we were taking
                        toward computational practices more broadly. Our discussions of digital
                        culture’s ideology of disembodiment and immateriality helped to reorient the
                        way students looked at digital objects, including their own work. The tools
                        we used in producing and reflecting on that reorientation continued the
                        process of rematerializing the digital that we began by close reading. Of
                        course, such tools do not inherently encourage an awareness of
                        materiality—they can just as readily obscure computational processes. Tools
                        do not function transparently, and most of us lack the technological
                        expertise required to conceive fully of their mechanisms. However, using the
                        tools can produce understanding of a different sort. The re-presentation of
                        digital objects in altered forms allows for and encourages imaginative
                        knowledge of the relation between virtual and material. Romantic notions of
                        imagination prove particularly useful to support this stance precisely
                        because such theories of imagination insist on the material forms that
                        communicate the seemingly immaterial nature of imaginative experience. </p>

                  <p>To connect more directly digital ideology with Romantic imagination, let me
                        offer one further example of that ideology’s emphasis on immateriality. “The
                        cloud” has become a ubiquitous term in the past few years, thanks in no
                        small part to Apple’s honorific christening of its cloud-based service with
                        the obligatory prefixed “i.” Essentially, cloud computing refers to the
                        practice of remotely storing data which can be accessed through a network,
                        as opposed to storing data on a local hard disk (like the one in a personal
                        computer). Apple announced their iCloud service at the Apple Worldwide
                        Developers Conference in June 2011.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> A clip
                            from the talk during which Jobs discusses iCloud can be found <ref target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnzCnPSQM7c">here, on
                                YouTube</ref>.</note> In the keynote address, Steve Jobs playfully
                        remarked, “Some people think the cloud is just a hard disk in the sky […] We
                        think it’s way more than that, and we call it iCloud.” What distinguished
                        iCloud from other cloud services (such as Dropbox), is that iCloud promised
                        automatically to integrate storage across multiple devices and within
                        various applications without the user having to make such changes actively
                        (in Dropbox, for example, the user stores data through the same logic of
                        files and folders that governs storage on a local disk). iCloud, in the
                        words of Jobs at the keynote, “just works.” The implications for this
                        development meant that computational devices would no longer function
                        primarily as storage receptacles, but rather as access portals to data
                        stored elsewhere and managed largely by someone (or something) else. As Nick
                        Bilton put it on the <title level="m">New York Times’ Bits </title>blog in
                        response to Jobs’s keynote, with iCloud, “Apple is reiterating the
                        irrelevance of the personal computer.” Furthermore, it is forwarding that
                        irrelevance through immaterial rhetoric relating to digital data storage and
                            retrieval.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This kind of rhetoric has
                            only increased as cloud computing has become increasingly prevalent in
                            the past few years. A more recent example can be found in <ref target="http://www.wired.com/2013/11/software-is-reorganizing-the-world-and-cloud-formations-could-lead-to-physical-nations/">Balaji Srinivasan’s opinion piece in <title level="m">Wired</title>

                            Barlow in 1996, “With our bodies hemmed in, our minds have only the
                            cloud—and it is the cloud that has become the destination for an
                            extraordinary mental exodus.”</note>

                        and the journey back to other devices. This is digital data unmediated by
                        the old metaphors of computing, the now naturalized files, folders, and
                        desktops—those pesky reminders that even digital objects are material (at
                        both the “forensic” and “formal” levels, in Kirschenbaum’s schema).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> With “forensic materiality,” Kirschenbaum
                            refers to the material changes wrought at the level of “micron-sized
                            residue of digital inscription,” and at the human-readable level, as
                            with “the contours of the keyboard and mouse that make their bodily
                            marks felt in the ongoing pandemic of repetitive strain and white-collar
                            work injuries” (10-11). “Formal materiality” refers to “the imposition
                            of multiple relational computational states on a data set or digital
                            object” (12). In other words, formal materiality includes not only the
                            digital object, but also data about the object (for instance, data that
                            indicates to a particular piece of software how the object will be
                            presented to the user). Kirschenbaum’s aim is to move away from what
                            Nick Montfort terms “screen essentialism,” and instead to analyze new
                            media through the formal processes that naturalize digital objects at
                            their visible instantiations (31). </note> Yet even as the cloud
                        metaphor dematerializes the physical, political, and economic exigencies
                        that make possible remote storage and retrieval (“it just works”), the sleek
                        metallic image of the <ref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20110714194123/http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud logo</ref> reminds us that Apple’s cloud is open only to those
                        who possess sleek metallic devices to match.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Since the original roll-out of iCloud in fall 2011, the
                            visual design has changed (along with other Apple visual interface
                            designs), leaving behind the emphasis on the cold aluminum for a
                            seemingly more warm and inviting sky-blue logo. The original images

                        bauxite needed to produce the aluminum that makes the device possible. </p>
                  <p> The cloud, then, is a medium that erases its presence, even if we think of
                        ontology in terms of “commands, addresses and data,” as Friedrich Kittler
                        argues we should when concerned with technical media. Doing so eliminates,
                        or at least deemphasizes, the material negotiations behind the transactions
                        that occur between processes, transmission and storage. With cloud
                        computing, for instance, storage still occurs on a physical server
                        somewhere, typically in large data centers like the one Apple is <ref target="http://www.wired.com/2014/04/green-apple/">currently building
                            outside of Reno, Nevada</ref> or the recently completed one in
                        Prineville, Oregon, which it built to help accommodate the storage demands
                        of iCloud when it debuted in late 2011. The Oregon storage center neighbors
                        a similar facility owned by Facebook, another company that stores massive
                        amounts of data. Both companies benefit from a recent property tax law
                        passed by the Oregon state legislature (SB 1532), which Senator Mark Haas
                        claims “will allow the state to stay competitive while attracting additional
                        high tech companies to Oregon” (“Oregon Senate OKs Facebook Tax Fix”).
                        Similarly, the Apple data center in Nevada will benefit from 88 million
                        dollars in tax exemptions (Harkinson). The representations of cloud
                        computing, however—the image of little blue rays connecting your device to
                        the cloud, the logo of the metallic cloud itself—obscure the very material,

                            energy gathered on site. As Steven Levy points out, 98% of Apple’s
                            carbon footprint comes from its manufacturing processes, so its
                            self-congratulatory publicity (“We’re still the only company in our
                            industry whose data centers are powered by 100 percent renewable energy”

                            In (perhaps cynically) drawing attention to this fact, I admit
                            exhibiting symptoms of what Timothy Morton calls “beautiful soul
                            syndrome” (140-150), particularly given that, since 2007, I have owned
                            two MacBooks, three iPhones, and one iPad. Following Morton’s argument,
                            I hope to resist said syndrome by recognizing that Apple’s carbon
                            footprint is my carbon footprint, and that in order to act with
                            environmental responsibility, we must dive deeper into the acceptance of
                            our own intimate culpability for the ongoing ecological
                            catastrophe.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I focus on the “cloud” here since it is an image invoked frequently in the
                        Romantic period, thanks largely to Luke Howard’s 1803 <title level="m">Essay
                            on the Modifications of Clouds</title>, the basis of our modern cloud
                        classification system. Goethe wrote enthusiastically about Howard’s system,
                        claiming that it “bestow[s] form on the formless and a system of ordered
                        change on the boundless” (qtd. in Slater 120). In a poem praising Howard,
                        Goethe writes that “He grips what cannot be held, cannot be reached, / He is
                        the first to hold it fast” (qtd. in Badt 12). Howard, in other words,
                        connects the material and immaterial realms, and through his systemic model
                        encourages further imaginative insight through aesthetic representation. As
                        John R. Williams writes in his biography of Goethe, the poet saw Howard’s
                        work as demonstrative proof that “the disparate, the inchoate, the ephemeral
                        and the apparently unstable can be grasped, intuited, and shaped by the
                        ‘living gifts’ of the creative imagination” (119). Howard’s accomplishment,
                        according to Goethe, was providing a systematic model through which
                        imaginative thinking could operate on and reveal the matter of clouds.
                        Similar to how digital tools helped my students reorient their understanding
                        of what constitutes digital materiality, Howard’s scientific system enabled
                        the further imaginative understanding of natural phenomena. </p>
                  <p>The cloud, which in the Romantic period provides evidence of the
                        imagination’s capacity to act on external matter, gets translated back into
                        a figure of immaterial communication in the rhetoric of digital technology.
                        This turn is unsurprising given the long history of equating Romanticism
                        more largely, and Romantic imagination in particular, with escape from
                        social and material history. Recent scholars on imagination, however, have
                        focused on the way that it operates in relation to materiality. Alexander
                        Schlutz, for example, ascribes imagination’s problematic status in the
                        history of philosophy to its “peculiarly liminal position,” poised between
                        “mind and body, self and world, the ideal and the real” (5). Imagination
                        challenges Enlightenment accounts of subjectivity precisely because of its
                        connection to the senses and the body, and its mediation of the external
                        world to internal understanding. In short, imagination exposes the illusion
                        of “the mind’s freedom and autonomy from the vicissitudes of its physical
                        embodiment” (4). Richard Sha similarly rematerializes imagination by
                        situating it in the context of Romantic-era medical discourse. Sha notes
                        that in Romanticist scholarship, imagination has been long maligned as a
                        tool of ideology, the escapist faculty “on the side of the immateriality of
                        consciousness” (198-9). His argument, however, suggests that imagination
                        held such appeal to the Romantics because it was understood physiologically.
                        Even though medical discourse warned of the imagination’s ability to disease
                        the mind and body, that recognition paradoxically “made unassailable the
                        imagination’s ability to transform matter” (199).</p>
                  <p>What the course’s attention to imagination in new media discourse revealed
                        was that another way to rematerialize the imagination is to conceive of it
                        as a medium.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Seb Franklin similarly
                            approaches the cloud as medium, as a figure that “oscillate[s] between
                            the realms of transcendent ethereality and complex materiality,” in his
                            reading of “the political character of cloud computing” (452). He argues
                            that the ideology of cloud computing offers the ideal of “connectivity
                            with no nodes (or individual subjects), only a shapeless bundle of edges
                            throughout which communication can occur and thus be captured, parsed,
                            measured, and defined. The ubiquitous, immaterial connectivity and
                            processing emblematized by cloud computing promises mediation, but of
                            what? It promises nothing less than to mediate the entirety of the
                            social through the indifferent logic of computation” (461). Srinivasan’s
                            article in <title level="m">Wired</title>, mentioned above, represents a
                            good example of a celebratory version of that imagined future; in his
                            formulation, the cloud becomes an immaterial space for utopian social
                            and political reorganization.</note> Shelley’s poem “The Cloud,” for
                        example, uses it as an image, like Apple’s, of storage and transmission.
                        Similar to his “balloon laden with knowledge,” and to the west wind carrying
                        “dead thoughts over the universe” (“Ode to the West Wind,” 63), Shelley’s
                        cloud is a channel through which information may travel.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> All references to Shelley come from Neil Fraistat’s and
                            Donald H. Reiman’s <title level="m">Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</title>

                        showers for the thirsting flowers;” she “bears light shade for the leaves
                        when laid / In their noon-day dreams” (“The Cloud,” 1, 3-4). Like the
                        iCloud, she has a tenuous materiality, and can “pass through the pores, of
                        the oceans and shores” (75). At the same time, she is “daughter of Earth and
                        Water, / And nursling of the Sky,” and so unites heaven and earth, mind and
                        body (73-4). Like imagination, she mediates between matter and spirit,
                        functioning as a channel through which historical actors can “hold an
                        unremitting interchange / With the clear universe of things around” (“Mont
                        Blanc,” 39-40). In “A Defence of Poetry,” the job of imagination is to
                        manage the “materials of external life” (531), which have been multiplying
                        through developments in science and technology, like the classification of
                        clouds, to the extent that “our calculations have outrun conception; we have
                        eaten more than we can digest” (530). Instead of enabling escape from
                        matter, imagination puts the body and spirit into proper relation to one
                        another. Without the poetic, imaginative power, the “body […] become[s] too
                        unwieldy for that which animates it” (531). For Shelley, language is an
                        originary product of imagination, but the “materials, instruments and
                        conditions of art” give us only secondary access, such that unmediated
                        language is a “mirror which reflects” while expression through physical
                        forms is “as a cloud which enfeebles.” Both unmediated conception and
                        mediated expression, however, whether mirror or cloud, cast rays of light
                        which are “the mediums of communication” (513). Shelley attempts to idealize
                        language, poetry, and imagination apart from matter but keeps returning to
                        the necessity for “portals of expression from the caverns of the spirit”
                        (532). In other words, imagination functions only by manipulating the
                        materials of existence, the dead leaves of thought, the enfeebling clouds
                        that render our calculations conceivable, and of course the texts that come
                        down to us. Even if they fail to some extent, the mediated forms of
                        imagination provide the best and only way to communicate the experience of
                        unmediated imaginative experience. Imagination is such a treasured mode of
                        thought precisely because of its ability to link the realms of mind and
                        matter, spirit and body, innocence and experience, and furthermore to
                        communicate those relations through materialized forms of expression.
                        Perhaps this view of the cloud, and of electronic media more broadly, as a
                        material negotiation between processes, transmission and data storage helps
                        “thicken the medium” (McGann <title level="m">Textual Condition</title> 14)
                        even as it represents itself as the absence of mediation.</p>
                  <p>John Keats’s thoughts on imagination posit it as a similarly mediating force,
                        bridging the mind and body. A key word in his thinking is “ethereal,” which
                        seemingly refers to immateriality but nonetheless often registers in the
                        material realm.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Stuart Sperry, for
                            instance, has noted the contemporary usage of ethereal in chemistry as
                            an important reference point for Keats: “The notion of an ethereal
                            matter forever at work in the world’s atmosphere and bringing about
                            continual changes in its elements offered Keats a useful and suggestive
                            parallel to the operation of the spirit of poetry” (40). Through various
                            chemical metaphors, Sperry claims, “Keats is able to conceive of verse
                            in terms that are substantial and material and, more abstractly, as a
                            kind of supernatural energy” (51).</note> Take, for instance, his
                        statement of poetic purpose at the beginning of his tour of northern England
                        and Scotland in the summer of 1818: “I shall learn poetry here and shall
                        henceforth write more than ever, for the abstract endeavour of being able to
                        add a mite to that mass of beauty which is harvested from these grand
                        materials, by the finest spirits, and put into etherial existence for the
                        relish of one’s fellows” (I, 301).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> As
                            readers of his letters well know, Keats’s orthography is delightfully
                            idiosyncratic. All of the quotations are reproduced as they appear in
                            Rollins’s transcriptions. If misspellings are present, <emph>sic</emph>
                            should be assumed.</note> The work of poetry involves material processes
                        like harvesting and increasing beauty’s “mass,” while also transforming that
                        material into new forms that hover between mind and matter—the “etherial”
                        things are “relished” in the mind and body. In a playful letter to Benjamin
                        Bailey from a few months earlier, Keats divides “Ethereal things” into three
                        divisions: “Things real—things semireal—and no things” (I, 242-3). Those of
                        the second category, “Love, the Clouds &amp;c […] require a greeting of the
                        Spirit to make them wholly exist.” The sonnet he produces as an elaboration
                        on his ideas represents “the mind of Man” following the progression of
                        seasons, beginning in “lusty spring when fancy clear / Takes in all beauty
                        with an easy span.” Like Coleridge’s distinction between secondary
                        imagination and fancy, Keats puts the next stage of thinking into the
                        creative realm: in summer the mind “chews the honied cud of fair spring
                        thoughts, / Till, in his Soul dissolv’d they come to be / Part of himself”
                        (I, 243). The more active role of imagination is to transform the materials
                        of the external world into a part of the self, understood through the
                        material processes of ingestion and digestion. As Coleridge elaborates his
                        system, quoting from the Elizabethan poet, John Davies, “As we our food into
                        our nature change,” so too does the imagination act upon physical materials
                        (496).</p>
                  <p>The imagination, in these reflections, does not transport identity outside
                        the body but rather reinstantiates it in a newly altered but still embodied
                        presence. Keats’s anecdote about embodying a sparrow is instructive here:
                        “if a Sparrow come before my Window I take part in its existince and pick
                        about the Gravel.” He means this as an illustration of his constant focus on
                        the present—“nothing startles me beyond the Moment”—but it comes in a letter
                        reflecting on imagination (I, 186). In this letter he makes his well-known
                        comparison of imagination to “Adam’s dream—he awoke and found it truth” (I,
                        185). Keats also suggests that imagination is the basis for what an
                        afterlife might resemble, or “the redigestion of our most ethereal Musings
                        on Earth” (I, 186). The ability to occupy another body, like the sparrow’s,
                        is a product of imagination as a meeting of spirit and body. The poet
                        fulfills this “negative capability,” of “being in uncertainties” (I, 193) of
                        “continually […] filling some other Body” (I, 387). In this sense we can
                        conceive of Keats’s embodied identity as virtual, as produced through an
                        imaginative relation between experience, thought and sensation. Such
                        virtuality does not erase materiality, but rather revises one’s felt
                        experience of embodiment.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Jonathan
                            Mulrooney makes these seemingly contradictory claims: “In Keats all
                            subjects are virtual. In Keats all subjects are bodily” (313). His point
                            is that virtual identity comes to be through an embodied experience
                            attuned to “a cognition of what passes in the affective mode of
                            perception” (314). From this perspective, he suggests that for Keats
                            “‘Mind’[…] is not a shelter from the frailties of embodied life; rather,
                            mind could be said to be for Keats always the idea of the body—the
                            body’s changing idea of itself” (315). In his recent book, <title level="m">Multiplying Worlds</title>, Peter Otto proposes a
                            different version of Romantic subjectivity in relation to theories of
                            the virtual. He argues that Romantic visual culture “suggested that
                            reality itself was an indeterminate combination of the actual and
                            virtual,” thereby creating a space in which the viewer could construct a
                            self in relation to those interlacing actual and virtual realms (15).
                            Otto, like Mulrooney, maintains the significance of embodied experience
                            in this process, though he emphasizes the social, commercial element of
                            the experience, given that the blending of actual and virtual occurs in
                            the public spaces of the panorama, phantasmagoria and other popular
                            entertainments. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The imagination, then, as formulated by Shelley and Keats, offers a renewed
                        conception of what it means to inhabit a body in a materially-bound
                        existence. This insight, I realized from my experience teaching about
                        digital culture, could apply as well to how we study new media and to how we
                        ask our students to understand digital tools through classroom practice and
                        critical orientation. Both the concepts and the practices renew our sense of
                        materially embodied experience in the world, which is what digital tools
                        should do for our students—help them come to know the ways in which they
                        live as historical bodies in and of the world. To do so we brought
                        imagination—rendered immaterial in new media discourse—back to matter.</p>

                  <head>III. The Matter of Texts, Digital and Otherwise</head>
                  <p>When we rematerialize imagination through media, we necessarily reimagine
                        texts. In one of his long journal letters to his brother George and
                        sister-in-law Georgiana, Keats writes: <quote>our friends say I have altered
                            completely—am not the same person—perhaps in this letter I am for in a
                            letter one takes up one’s existence from the time we last met—I dare say
                            you have altered also—evey man does—Our bodies every seven years are
                            completely fresh-materiald […] We are like the relict garments of a
                            Saint: the same and not the same: for the careful Monks patch it and
                            patch it: till there’s not a thread of the original garment left. (II,
                            208)</quote> The letter becomes a textual body that Keats fills with his
                        imaginatively produced, virtual identity. And like the physical body
                        continually “fresh-materiald,” or like the holy patchwork garment, the
                        reimagined textual self undergoes transformation through the negotiation of
                        imagination and matter. This recognition disturbs as well as excites. Keats
                        reflects that “’T is an uneasy thought that in seven years the same hands
                        cannot greet each other again” (II, 209), a thought which can potentially
                        threaten the stability of identity. Imagination, however, enables texts (or
                        bodies) to communicate effectively: “All this may be obviated by a willful
                        and dramatic exercise of our Minds towards each other” (II, 209). The
                        imaginative “exercise” of mind relocates embodied identity in the shifting
                        matter of existence: alternatively, in Keats’s formulation, bodies and texts
                        across time and space. </p>
                  <p>In focusing on the imaginary processes Keats links with forms of mediation, I
                        share Yohei Igarashi’s recent contention that “communicative mediation
                        constitutes a significant, although still largely unremarked, concern of
                        Keats’s poetry and letters” (173). And like Igarashi and several other
                        Romanticists writing in the last decade or so, I also conceive of the
                        Romantic era more broadly as crucially shaped and defined by its privileged
                        place in “the history of mediation.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In
                            the introduction to <title level="m">This is Enlightenment</title>,
                            Siskin and Warner offer the “history of mediation” as an alternative
                            approach to the “history of ideas.” Instead of seeking to recover the
                            “ideas” that comprise what Enlightenment is, they propose reassembling
                            the medial transactions employed to convey those ideas, “and thus more
                            readily identify patterns in those interactions” (11). In shifting their
                            focus to Romanticism, Siskin and Warner argue that, understood in
                            relation to their history of mediation, “the Romantic subject is the
                            self on the platform of Enlightenment” (“What Is Romanticism?” 288). In
                            short, “Enlightenment is an event in the history of mediation,” which
                            involves radical transformations in “cardinal mediations,” including
                            infrastructure (postal system, coffee houses), genres and formats
                            (periodical essays, magazines), practices (clubs, societies), and
                            protocols (copyright, publishing practices) (“This Is Enlightenment” 1,
                            12-15). The Romantic subject, then, comes into being by operating on the
                            platform that these mediations establish.</note> Jerome McGann and Alan
                        Liu have, in different ways, argued for the capacity of new media to help us
                        “imagine what we know” about old media, as McGann puts it, borrowing from
                            Shelley.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> McGann argues as much in

                            Gitelman’s argument that “new media are less points of epistemic rupture
                            than they are socially embedded sites for the ongoing negotiation of
                            meaning as such” (6), Alan Liu suggests more of a bi-directional flow
                            between old and new. He calls for “a <foreign>poiesis</foreign> of
                            digital literary studies able to imagine how old and new literary media
                            together allow us to imagine.” My shift is merely to emphasize that the
                                <foreign>poiesis</foreign> on display in Romantic-era texts can
                            accomplish similar productive insights about relations between old and
                            new media. </note> But we’ve also seen an increasing number of scholars
                        attempt to recover “the conceptual breadth of early discussions of media,”
                        as James Brooke-Smith describes some of the insights articulated by Kevis
                        Goodman in <title level="m">Georgic Modernity and British
                            Romanticism.</title>
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Brooke-Smith adds
                            to our understanding of early discussions of media by claiming we can
                            find in the work of William Wordsworth and Charles Babbage a “media-less
                            media theory” (4), or “media theory in the absence of a
                                <emph>technological</emph> media concept,” an intellectual position
                            which would not fully emerge until toward the end of the century
                            (2).</note> Celeste Langan and Maureen McLane locate in Romantic poetry
                        such a sophisticated sensitivity to issues of mediation that they posit,
                        “Romantic poetry might even serve as a synonym for what we mean by
                        multimedia” (239). My experience of teaching new media suggested to me a
                        similar reversal of the usual linear narratives of media history. As
                        Siegfried Zielinski poses the issue in calling for a media archaeological
                        method: “do not seek the old in the new, but find something new in the old”
                        (3). To do so requires an openness to being in uncertainty about Romanticism
                        and the history of mediation. My ultimate contention, then, is that the
                        materiality of the Romantic imagination is that of a medium. Mediums imagine
                        for us, and we imagine through them. Imagination communicates between mind
                        and body, matter and spirit, and by doing so makes possible the affects of
                        aesthetic experience that come through material forms like texts. Writing
                        about Keats’s “La Belle Dame,” McGann claims that “Romantic imagination
                        emerges with the birth of an historical sense, which places the poet, and
                        then the reader, at a critical distance from the poem’s materials” (<title level="m">Romantic Ideology</title> 79). By “materials” McGann means the
                        ballad and romance traditions, mythological figures, and the particular
                        perspective through which Keats revives them. I would add that the
                        imagination emerges with a self-consciousness about the poem’s physical
                        materials, its production, and the distance between conception, expression
                        and reception. In imagining what a medium can do, Romantic writers mine the
                        ontology of media, always aware in the end of the ineluctable limitations of
                        communication. As Alexander Galloway, Eugene Thacker, and McKenzie Wark
                        argue in their collaborative volume: “Every communication evokes a possible
                        excommunication that would instantly annul it. Every communication harbors
                        the dim awareness of an excommunication that is prior to it, that conditions
                        it and makes it all the more natural” (10). For the Romantic writers,
                        mediums function when they fail, as with Keats’s claim that in our embodied
                        and textual forms, “We are like the relict garments of a Saint: the same and
                        not the same” or Shelley's recognition that we necessarily rely on imperfect
                        “portals of expression from the caverns of the spirit.” In an era of
                        perpetual triumphalism for each new and improved shiny happy media machine,
                        perhaps we need now to look to broken forms, dysfunctional devices, and the
                        faultures of other decrepit things. </p>
                  <p> I’d like to conclude by sharing a final example of student work from the
                        course, since this student demonstrated the kind of knowing, critical
                        playfulness toward the history of mediation that can help to rematerialize
                        our relation to the digital, and especially since he embraced the breaking
                        points of media. I’ll call this student “Neo” since he was writing about
                            <title level="m">The Matrix</title> (1999) and showed some programming
                        skill. As described above, the assignment asked students to write a
                        comparison paper about two texts from different media, and to use multiple
                        media forms in their papers. To meet the latter criteria, many students
                        creatively employed video and image in their papers (as with the screenshots
                        of <title level="m">Google Variations</title> mentioned earlier). For his
                        multimedia component, Neo wrote a computer program. He gave me instructions
                        on how to compile the Java program on my computer, and when I eventually
                        managed it, it produced the following. (Figure 2).</p>

                  <p>Fig. 2 A screenshot showing the narrative produced by my student’s
                        Java program.</p>
                  <p>The program asks you to enter your name, and once you do, it
                        produces this narrative, inspired by and loosely adapted from <title level="m">The Matrix</title>. A mysterious figure offers you truth in
                        the form of a red pill. Prompted again to type “red” of “blue,” the input
                        “red” outputs the rudimentary image of a book, with Neo’s essay title on it.
                        The final line of the narrative reads: “The figure hands you an old dusty
                        book with a beaten spine. ‘Read,’ he says. ‘Read and be free.’” The program
                        that has produced the narrative, also produces the content of the essay, the
                        “book” that will lead to freedom. After the introductory narrative, the
                        program outputs the entire essay text. (Figure 3).</p>

                        that the particular software environment cannot interpret.</p>
                  <p>   With this creative representation, Neo recognized his remediated
                        paper as part of a history of mediation. The green text on black screen
                        recalls an earlier era in computing, inspired by <title level="m">The
                            Matrix</title>’s popularization of the green on black image, while the
                        textual interface gestures toward text adventure games, or interactive
                        fiction. The presence of his paper in the metafiction as “an old dusty
                        book,” both suggests that old media continue to hold value (precisely
                        because of their anachronism), and belies the separation of old and new
                        (since the old book is being delivered simultaneously as Word document and
                        script in a Java program). But even more significantly, as Neo wrote in his
                        instructions to me, “the original manifestation of the piece [the essay as a
                        word document with all its formatting details] is limited by the ASCII
                        interpretation by the specific computer.” As a result, before the essay text
                        is a long string of unreadable characters (for instance,
                        “{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf1038\cocoasubrtf350…”). These characters
                        fail to signify to (most) human eyes, but also to the Terminal program,
                        which cannot render the formatting instructions from Word into sensible
                        form, and instead leaves them as inert code. Neo’s insight reminds us that
                        all electronic media are not one, that we continue to experience new media
                        through engagements with the old, and that the material specificities of
                        such engagements can be rendered visible through informed representation.
                        The mediated, mediating Romantic imagination, which appears so frequently
                        disembodied in the evolution of digital discourse, can help us see the
                        materials that make up that history. </p>

               <p rend="noCount"> This article examines the connection between Tom Wedgwood’s
                    pedagogical theories and his materialist theories of mind, which emphasized the
                    importance of emotion in character formation. Wedgwood hoped to open an
                    experimental school for infants with the goal of producing a generation of
                    politically radical geniuses. This article situates Wedgwood’s ideas within the
                    context of Romantic theories of cognition, debates about the mind-body
                    relationship, and social reform, and points to a growing trend that connected
                    bodily health and moral virtue. It argues for the significance of his largely
                    ignored or undervalued contributions to Romantic thinking about the mind, body,
                    and education. </p>

               <p>Tom Wedgwood is commonly relegated to a footnote in the more fascinating
                    histories of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth. Aside from a few
                    admiring late nineteenth and early twentieth-century accounts of his brief life
                    by members of the extended family, there is but a smattering of scholarship that
                    examines his role in the intellectual circles in which he moved.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Meteyard, Litchfield, and Tremayne and
                        Boole.</note> Beginning with David Erdman’s two-part series “Coleridge,
                    Wordsworth, and the Wedgwood Fund,” published in 1956, critics generally examine
                    Wedgwood’s relationship with Coleridge and Wordsworth. For example, Erdman
                    credits Wedgwood with influencing the shape of <title level="m">The
                        Prelude</title>’s exploration of the relationship between childhood
                    experiences and the development of genius, a topic that Wedgwood’s pedagogical
                    plan takes up. Even if Wordsworth found Wedgwood’s ideas about education so
                    repugnant that he struck off in the opposite direction, “Tom’s educational Plan
                    had a stimulating effect on his thinking” (Erdman I: 434). Erdman also discusses
                    Wedgwood’s role in convincing his brother Josiah to provide half of the 150₤
                    annuity that freed Coleridge from becoming a Unitarian minister and enabled him
                    to pursue a career in poetry and metaphysics. </p>
               <p>With varying degrees of sympathy, scholars such as Francis Doherty (1987), Neil
                    Vickers (1999, 2001), and John Beer (2001, 2010) look at Wedgwood’s influence on
                    Coleridge’s “abstruse research” (“Dejection” 89). Each examines him as “a
                    shaping force in Coleridge’s intellectual development” (Vickers 90), but not as
                    a significant contributor to the critical conversations in which Wedgwood
                    participated. To my knowledge, Francis À Court’s “<title level="m">Magnifique,
                        mais ce n’est pas Daguerre</title>: Some Notes on the Life of Tom Wedgwood”
                    (2003) is the only contemporary account that presents Wedgwood’s life as a
                    whole, viewing his relationship to Coleridge and Wordsworth as just one part of
                    a bigger picture. He argues that to historians of the Wedgwoods—an interesting
                    family in its own right—“Tom’s chief interest lies in his exceptional gifts as a
                    scientist, and they tend to speculate on what he <emph>might </emph>have
                    achieved, had he not been ill, rather than with his <emph>actual</emph>
                    connection with Coleridge” (79). From my perspective, his relationship with
                    these two poets is an important aspect of his history, but his contribution the
                    debates about cognition and about educational practice, particularly the way in
                    which he combined these two interests, is just as intriguing. Consequently, Tom
                    Wedgwood’s role in the intellectual history of the early Romantic period
                    deserves closer scrutiny.</p>
               <p>Wedgwood’s intellectual energies were divided between two issues that preoccupied
                    many Romantic thinkers—the workings of the human mind and theories of education.
                    “Education,” Alan Richardson claims, “was one of the most hotly contested and
                    frequently discussed topics of [. . .] the Romantic age” (2). Yet, Beer
                    characterizes Wedgwood’s participation in this discussion as a simple obsession
                    with the latest craze. He argues that Wedgwood was under “the strong hold of the
                    necessitarian doctrines of the day, and the rage for educational experiments”
                    (Beer 26). This account of Wedgwood’s theoretical commitments, with its use of
                    terms such as “the rage” and “fashionable,” implies that his interest in these
                    subjects was uncritical, nothing more than a desire to fit in with his friends.
                    Wedgwood, in this view, is not seen as a serious thinker in his own right, but
                    as a hanger-on who spouted the modish opinions of the day, presumably because of
                    his dearth of original thought. While not all critics dismiss Wedgwood, the
                    general consensus can be summed up by two comments by Beer. The first is that
                    Wedgwood needed to be “argued into a subtler view of the human mind, no longer
                    taking for granted the fashionable doctrine of its explicability simply through
                    the association of ideas” (Beer 27). In other words, Wedgwood is nothing more
                    than a jejune associationist. Second, Beer claims that it is impossible to
                    determine if Wedgwood had any original thought because he left no published
                    corpus. He gives little credence to Wedgwood’s ideas, which are, admittedly,
                    difficult to access in their fragmented and incomplete form.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Some of Wedgwood’s papers are held in the <ref target="http://www.wedgwoodmuseum.org.uk/archives">Wedgwood Museum

               <p>Wedgwood died in 1805 at the age of thirty-four, leaving behind little “in the
                    way of published papers or actual records of discoveries, [that] accounts for or
                    seems to correspond with the high esteem in which he was held by his

                    Scottish lawyer and Wedgwood’s brother-in-law, was ostensibly helping him
                    prepare a manuscript of metaphysical speculations in 1802, it was not completed
                    by the time Wedgwood died. According to various letters, Coleridge was also
                    involved in this project, having committed to write “a preface on the history of
                    metaphysical opinions” (Beer 29).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On 19
                        February 1802, Coleridge wrote to Thomas Poole that he was “finishing the
                        History of the opinions concerning Space &amp; Time for Mackintosh” (<title level="m">CL</title> II: 787). Earlier that month Southey informed
                        William Taylor that Wedgwood was working on a book with Mackintosh as “the
                        man midwife” (qtd. in Beer 29).</note> After Wedgwood’s death, his brother
                    Jos charged Mackintosh and Coleridge with publishing his brother’s legacy
                    posthumously. He asked Mackintosh to complete the manuscript for publication and
                    Coleridge to write Wedgwood’s biography. Both men, we know, were afflicted with
                    the same character flaw—procrastination—and neither produced what he had
                    promised. Thus, Wedgwood’s substantial but unorganized archive of notebooks was
                    never synthesized into publishable form. “In the absence of this promised work,”
                    Beer asserts, “it remains hard to say exactly what was distinctive about Tom
                    Wedgwood’s ideas” (30). I disagree with this assessment of his work. </p>
               <p>Though Wedgwood’s work remains largely unpublished and somewhat fragmentary, it
                    is distinctive because of the way in which he applied his cognitive theories to
                    his educational programme. Where critics such as Beer or Vickers might
                    characterize his views in terms of a “naïve commitment to the idea of man as
                    machine” (Vickers 89), I claim that Wedgwood’s pedagogical plan is worthy of
                    notice because it is based on his materialist theories of cognition. Wedgwood
                    was not a mere neophyte who mindlessly parroted the “fashionable doctrines” of
                    the day (Beer 27), but put thought into his metaphysical researches. He used a
                    methodology similar to Coleridge’s (or perhaps Coleridge used a methodology
                    similar to his) that involved self-scrutiny, sensory experiments such as those
                    proposed by Erasmus Darwin in <title level="m">Zoonomia</title> (1794), and
                    observation of his nieces and nephews in their infancy and early childhood. </p>
               <p>Wedgwood participated in a vibrant intellectual community that included not only
                    the poets, but men of science, such as Darwin, Thomas Beddoes, and Humphry Davy,
                    all of whom were interested in embodied theories of cognition as well as
                    theories of education. He corresponded with William Godwin and, through him, was
                    in contact with Mary Wollstonecraft. He was also related by marriage to the
                    Edgeworths, who are known for <title level="m">Practical Education</title>
                    (1798). Many of these figures, like Wedgwood, were interested in applying
                    Hartley’s associationist ideas to education. Yet, Wedgwood’s theories go further
                    in some respects because they are predicated on his own research and reading,
                    which extend beyond Hartley’s <title level="m">Observations on Man</title>
                    (1749). “[R]aised in the laboratories of his father’s potteries in Etruria”
                    (Beer 26), Wedgwood was a scientific-minded young man who turned his attention
                    to the concerns that interested his mentors, peers, and, indeed, many
                    thinkers—cognitive science and education. His carefully reasoned application of
                    the principles of materialist cognition to the education of children as a way to
                    usher in a new era of political justice is a significant contribution to
                    intellectual history, even if, like Jeremy Bentham’s panopticon, it was never
                    implemented.</p>
               <p>In this article, my goal is to explicate Tom Wedgwood’s cognitive theory and to
                    situate it within the larger context of the late eighteenth- and early
                    nineteenth-century mind-matter debates. In doing so, I draw on archival material
                    as well as on the snippets of his work that have been published by scholars and
                    by family members. I also interrogate the relationship between his theory of
                    mind and his pedagogical programme, showing how the former led into and
                    buttressed the latter. Wedgwood’s work is significant because it gathered
                    together several strands of Romantic philosophical thought, from Hartley’s
                    theory of association (divested of its theology) to Godwin’s doctrine of
                    perfectibility, in an attempt to formulate a practical plan of education that
                    would bring about a society of geniuses committed to the principles of liberty,
                    equality, communitarian values, and social justice. It was, as Wedgwood wrote to
                    Godwin, his “master stroke which should anticipate a century or two upon the
                    large-paced progress of human improvement” (qtd. in Erdman I: 430). </p>
               <p>Though an associationist and a committed materialist, he did not unquestioningly
                    adhere to Hartley’s theories, as Beer and Vickers suggest. In addition to his
                    own insights, derived from observations of himself and others, he took into
                    account the materialist theories of cognition advanced by Darwin and, to an
                    extent, Davy. These theories posit an active mind in contrast to Hartley’s
                    theory (and Locke’s before him) that advances an empirical account of the mind
                    that is necessarily passive, “a lazy Lookeron on an external World” (Coleridge,
                        <title level="m">CL</title> II: 709). Similar to Darwin, he saw free will as
                    circumscribed, yet Wedgwood’s pedagogical plan has some depth. Unlike those who
                    adopted “the new rational approach to education, with its emphasis on method and
                    factual knowledge” (Richardson 4), Wedgwood was primarily concerned with
                    educating the mind by educating the body. He emphasized the importance of
                    feeling, which for him was an embodied phenomenon, in educating infants into
                    well-adjusted, emotionally stable adults (in contrast to Coleridge and himself). </p>
               <p>Wedgwood was interested in ameliorating the human condition, and with the receipt
                    of “a considerable trust” inherited from his father, the famous potter, he
                    thought that an experimental school would prove to be “the most profitable mode
                    of beneficial expenditure” (qtd. in Erdman I: 430). Aside from the vast fortune,
                    in this respect he was no different than Coleridge or Davy, both of whom had
                    outlined educational plans designed to produce a particular type of enlightened
                    being. Yet, though Coleridge was, for a time, considering opening a school as a
                    means of supporting his family (a plan that was put to rest when the Wedgwoods
                    convinced him to take the unencumbered annuity), neither he nor Davy developed
                    their plans as thoroughly and in as much detail as Wedgwood. So, where many
                    critics dismiss Wedgwood as unoriginal, significant only in respect to his
                    connection to Coleridge and Wordsworth, I contend that his application of
                    materialist cognitive theory to education offers insight into both Romantic
                    period debates and brings to light new connections between Romantic cognitive
                    science and theories of education.</p>

                  <head>The Mind-Matter Debates</head>
                  <p>Tom Wedgwood’s interest in theories of cognition, I argue, was not merely the
                        result of his intellectual environment, but also driven by his personal
                        torment. He suffered from a mysterious illness for most of his life, a life
                        characterized by “ceaseless struggle with bodily suffering” (Litchfield 91).
                        His pain was “so severe that he would sometimes throw himself to the ground
                        screaming” (Wedgwood and Wedgwood 101). Scrawled on a single folded slip of
                        paper tucked into a notebook in the Barlaston archive is the following
                        anguished note: <quote>My mind is now eternally preying on itself—I am
                            watching myself with anxious and unceasing vigilance. I have every

                        Anxiety” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40-28515/14).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Wedgwood frequently used abbreviations in his notebooks

                            readability, I have silently provided the full word for abbreviations as
                            necessary. In other quotations from archival material, I have silently

                            reading.</note> This brief, undated observation reveals the way in which
                        Wedgwood conceived of the mind-body relationship and gives us a glimpse into
                        his theory of cognition. For Wedgwood, mental well-being and bodily health
                        were intimately and inextricably connected. He was convinced that his
                        physical ailments were directly caused by his poor mental state, which he
                        characterized as a “wavering &amp; superficial examination of future
                        urgencies &amp; conducts” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40-28515/14), or to
                        put it more simply, an unhealthy obsession with the future. Influenced by
                        his father’s Lunar Society friends, who held varying versions of Hartley’s
                        Doctrine of Association, Wedgwood saw his mental state not as a bad
                        attitude, but as the result of bad habits. </p>
                  <p>According to Associationism, ideas in the mind are formed by concurring
                        bodily sensations. These sensations become associated with ideas, either
                        linearly or in clusters, such that they are able to be recalled even in the
                        absence of the original objects or stimuli. For example, if a person sees or
                        hears a bird chirping in a tree the objects will associate together in the
                        mind. Consequently, any time that person hears (or sees) a bird, she will
                        automatically think of a tree. In this way, objects, experiences, and ideas
                        connect in trains that are later recalled and remembered together. Despite
                        its long history beginning with Aristotle, Association rose to prominence in
                        the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries through Locke’s fourth edition of
                            <title level="m">An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</title> (1700),
                        Hume’s <title level="m">A Treatise of Human Nature</title> (1739), and
                        Hartley’s <title level="m">Observations</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a brief but biased history of Association, see

                            volume I.</note> While there is evidence that Wedgwood read each of
                        these books, undoubtedly he was first introduced to the theory by his
                        father’s forward-thinking friends. He grew up in a progressive environment
                        under an educational plan designed by Darwin, an Associationist and founder
                        of the Lunar Society (Meteyard 18). Primarily men of science and industry,
                        members of this informal group met monthly to discuss their latest theories,
                        ideas, and experiments. The theories debated by his father’s friends posited
                        the mind as an embodied, material phenomenon rather than an attribute of an
                        immaterial soul. In addition to Darwin, Joseph Priestley was particularly
                        interested in theories of cognition.</p>
                  <p>Priestley, a noted physicist, chemist, theologian, Dissenting clergyman, and
                        most importantly a materialist, developed an interest in Hartley’s theory of
                        cognition when he was a student at Davenport Academy.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Dissenters were Christians of various beliefs
                            (Anabaptists, Diggers, etc.) who broke with the Church of England in the
                            sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. Priestley was a
                            Unitarian. Dissenters, Hartley included, were barred from becoming
                            clergy in the Anglican Church because they refused to subscribe to the
                            Thirty-Nine Articles.</note> Where Locke’s account of association
                        remains largely unconcerned with the role of the body in cognition, Hartley
                        explicitly addresses the reciprocity between body and mind. <title level="m">Observations</title> offers a detailed physiological account of Locke’s
                        theory that proposes the Doctrine of Vibrations as a method of neural
                        transduction, that is, the way in which the body converts sensory stimuli
                        into neural signals that are communicated to the brain and nervous system.
                        Priestley popularized Hartley’s work by publishing <title level="m">Hartley’s Theory of Mind </title>(1775), an abridged edition that
                        omitted the theory of vibrations and the entire second volume in which
                        Hartley explained the theological implications of his theory. As Priestley
                        recognized, and I agree, the most significant and radical part of Hartley’s
                        theory is its materialist account of cognition that locates the mind in the
                        body. Priestley used Hartley’s observation that physical substances, such as
                        “Poisons, spirituous Liquors, Opiates, Fevers, Blows upon the Head
                            <emph>&amp;c.</emph> all plainly affect the Mind” (Hartley 9), to argue
                        for materialist monism, both in the prefatory essays to Hartley’s work and
                        in his own <title level="m">Disquisitions Relating to Matter and
                            Spirit</title> (1777). </p>
                  <p>Wedgwood’s notebooks indicate that he was familiar with “Priestley’s Hartley,
                        including the memorable injunction to Philosophers” and may also have read
                        the first volume of <title level="m">Observations</title> (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                        Collection E40–28451). He boasts in 1796 that “without having read Hartley
                        [...] [i]t is a considerable confirmation of many of my observations formed
                        from the closest scrutiny of my own changes of state, that they coincide
                        very exactly with many of the most important ones of this author”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). Upon reading Hartley, it seems,
                        Wedgwood found confirmation for the conclusions he had drawn based on
                        self-observation of his emotional and physical states. This memo is followed
                        by some notes on Hartley and a list of other philosophers (including Hume,
                        Berkeley, and Locke), which give us some idea of his reading during this
                        period. Yet, the fact that Wedgwood was familiar with materialist theories
                        of cognition “without having read Hartley” indicates how widespread these
                        ideas were amongst a certain segment of the English reading public. This was
                        due in no small part to Priestley, who sparked the mind-matter debates that
                        raged throughout the Romantic period.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See
                            Robertson, “Soulful Sensorium: The Body in British Romantic Brain

                  <p>Traditionalists and conservatives reacted violently against Hartley’s and
                        Priestley’s materialist theories, in part because the thinkers who held
                        these views tended to be political radicals who supported the ideals of the
                        French Revolution. More importantly, though, Hartley’s theory threatened
                        neo-Platonic Christian doctrine by dissolving the mind-body dichotomy and
                        abolishing free will by making association an entirely passive process.
                        While many people found the idea of the passive mind repugnant, men such as
                        Priestley and Darwin did not. Rather than turning away from materialism
                        altogether, Darwin accepted the basic premise of Hartley’s and Priestley’s
                        theories—that cognition is an embodied, physiological, process—and attempted
                        to formulate a more active account of the mind than theirs provided.</p>
                  <p>Prior to reading Hartley, Wedgwood had already read <title level="m">Zoonomia</title>, which offers Darwin’s account of neural transduction.
                        Trying to overcome the mental passivity inherent in the Doctrine of
                        Vibrations, Darwin theorized that the body produces a substance that he
                        called “the spirit of animation or sensorial power” that translates sensory
                        stimuli into mental ideas (61). He uses these two terms interchangeably, and
                        while “spirit of animation” seems to imply an immaterial principle, Darwin
                        clearly identifies this mutable and highly active substance as a “secretion”
                        of “the brain and spinal marrow” (57).<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                            Elsewhere, I argue that Darwin deliberately uses obfuscating
                            philosophical language in order to protect himself from the sort of
                            persecution that Priestley experienced when his laboratory was destroyed
                            in the Church and King Riots of 1791.</note> That is, sensorial power is
                        an organic substance produced by the body, making cognition a decidedly
                        material phenomenon. As a medical practitioner, Darwin was not interested in
                        the philosophical debate about materialism and dualism. Instead, like
                        Wedgwood, he wanted to discover how the mind and body affected each other
                        for practical purposes, so that he could better diagnose and treat disease.
                        In fact, <title level="m">Zoonomia</title> is a two-volume nosology that
                        offers a systematic theory of how to treat bodily and mental disorders based
                        on Darwin’s organic theory of mind. Significantly, in contrast to his
                        predecessors’ theories, Darwin’s model is not based on mechanical
                        principles. Rather, he posits a mind that obeys the laws of organic life.
                        That is, the mind, in his view, is subject to the same laws as all other
                        animate matter, but these laws are substantively different than Newton’s
                        laws of physics, which govern the inanimate world. </p>
                  <p>While critics are correct to trace Wedgwood’s ideas back to Hartley, in fact,
                        Darwin had a greater influence. Wedgwood believed that the principles of the
                        human mind could be explained by the Doctrine of Association, but he did not
                        uncritically accept Hartley’s passive account, as Beer and Vickers assert.
                        He acknowledged that “Association” was “one of the original principles of
                        mechanical Philosophy,” but thought that it was “perhaps capable of
                        resolution into other principles which are already presumed as
                        indispensible” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). These “other
                        principles” refer to Darwin’s laws of organic life. Wedgwood accepted that
                        “the activity, the versatility of the mind” was “deducible from the
                        principle laid down by Darwin as the origin of all muscular motion”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). Though Wedgwood occasionally
                        referred to the mind as “yet a mere transcript” that is “formed by external
                        circumstances alone, without ever [. . .] exercising any volition in
                        adapting itself to them” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28476A), for the
                        most part he seemed to follow Darwin's account.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Determining Wedgwood's exact stance is sometimes
                            difficult because his notes are fragmentary and undated. In the quoted
                            passage, which is just a few jotted notes, he was considering “pure
                            reasoning” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28476A). His stance seemed
                            to be that the mind begins as a “mere transcript” and becomes active as
                            it develops. This difficulty determining which views represent
                            Wedgwood’s most developed or recent line of thought is part of the
                            problem of working with archival material.</note> Darwin's theory of
                        cognition is an interesting mix of Hartleyean Associationism and his own
                        organic principles. While he saw the mind as active, he still considered
                        free will to be circumscribed by external circumstances.</p>
                  <p>It appears, then, that Wedgwood viewed cognition as an organic, active
                        process, but not a process that is entirely unconstrained, as in dualist
                        theories of the mind. He believed, in keeping with his materialist approach,
                        that human beings are subject “to simple and universal laws” (Doherty 309),
                        like any other natural object. His driving passion in the first several
                        years of his adulthood was to answer the question: “From how few &amp; how
                        simple original principles can all the functions of the Mind be
                        derived?”(V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28515/107). He wanted, like many
                        of his peers, to discover the routines, procedures, and details of the
                        mind’s physiological functioning, not least so that he could understand
                        himself and his ailments better and, hopefully, to rectify his miserable
                        physical and mental condition.</p>
                  <p>The physical fact of Wedgwood’s suffering, along with his early exposure to
                        radical theories of mind, motivated him to pursue research into the
                        materialist theories of cognition that were being advanced by late
                        eighteenth-century thinkers. If the cornerstone of this empirical theory is
                        that a person’s character is a direct result of his or her habits, the good
                        news for Wedgwood was that habit could be changed. Human beings, according
                        to Hartley, “have a Power of suiting our Frame of Mind to our Circumstances,
                        of correcting what is amiss, and improving what is right” (Hartley 84). This
                        must have given Wedgwood hope, at least in the early years, that his
                        miserable physical and mental condition could be reversed. In the undated
                        note that lists the physical pains that he attributed to his mental state,
                        Wedgwood resolves to stop worrying about the future. He vowed to “Give
                        myself over the present moment—Oh grand, inestimable secret of human
                        happiness!!” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40-28515/14). This exclamation
                        indicates his mental plan of action. Physically, he resolved to “Still the
                        rising tumult—Press down the throbbing heart” and to “Practise this with
                        unshaken constancy” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40-28515/14). For Wedgwood
                        understanding the mind-body connection and how to influence it was an
                        immensely personal concern. It was also a concern that was deeply
                        intertwined with emotional feeling. Association, according to Wedgwood, is
                        not just a process whereby sensations are linked together to create trains
                        of ideas. It is a process by which pleasurable or painful sensations are
                        joined together to create ideas that are associated with particular
                        feelings. Cognition, in Wedgwood’s view, is an emotionally charged, embodied
                        process.</p>

                  <head>“So Exquisitely Sensitive Are We”</head>
                  <p>One of Wedgwood’s most significant contributions to Romantic cognitive
                        science was the elaboration of the relationship between emotion, cognition,
                        and association. Wedgwood qualifies and extends materialist theories of
                        cognition, building on those advanced by Hartley and Priestley, by
                        considering the role of affective feeling in the process of association. In
                        setting out their terminology, both Hartley and Priestley equate ideas with
                        feeling. Hartley states that “<emph>Sensations</emph> are those Feelings of
                        the Mind, which arise from the Impressions made by external Objects on the
                        several parts of our Bodies. All our other internal Feelings may be called
                            <emph>Ideas</emph>” (ii). Likewise, Priestley claims that ideas, no
                        matter how abstract, are “<emph>mental feelings</emph>, occasioned by the
                        impression of external objects” (xliv). For the most part, Hartley and
                        Priestley use the term <emph>feeling</emph> to refer to “experiences such as
                        touch as when we appreciate the shape or texture of an object,” rather than
                        to affective experience (Damasio 3).<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                            Hartley offered his physiological account of cognition as part of a
                            larger theological theory about the perfectibility of humankind and
                            cultivation of virtue and vice. He sets out a moral taxonomy that will
                            lead humanity, both ontogenetically and phylogenetically, to reunion
                            with God. Pleasure and pain are, thus, important to his theory of
                            character formation with respect to virtue and vice. When he uses the
                            word <emph>feeling</emph> it sometimes seems to refer to affective
                            experience as well as sensation.</note> Yet, because sensation is always
                        accompanied by pleasure or pain, tactile feeling quickly leads to affective
                        feeling. </p>
                  <p>Thus, the term “feeling” can also imply “some variant of the experience of
                        pain or pleasure as it occurs in emotions and related phenomena” (Damasio
                        3). As Priestley claims, a child does not know fear “till it has received
                        some hurt; upon which the painful idea left in the mind by the remembrance
                        of hurt becomes associated with the idea of the circumstance in which he
                        received the hurt” (xxxi). At this point, the child develops a fear of the
                        hurtful object. Yet, while feeling is central to both Hartley’s and
                        Priestley’s theories, neither elaborates the implications of so closely
                        aligning thought with emotion. The consequence of intertwining cognitive
                        processes with sensation clearly signals the mind’s dependence on the body,
                        but as sensation is always accompanied by pleasure or pain, which is
                        transformed into love or fear, there is an affective dimension that neither
                        Hartley nor Priestley fully explores. Wedgwood, on the other hand, tormented
                        by his own unstable emotions, investigates the relationship between sensory
                        and affective feeling as a fundamental aspect of mentation.</p>
                  <p>When Wedgwood claims that “all thinking is a matter of feeling”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28478), he means affective, or
                        emotionally-charged, feeling. Seeing an intimate connection between sensory
                        and affective feeling, Wedgwood conflates the two senses of the word. He
                        argues that when we receive a physical sensation from an object in the
                        world, it is always accompanied by an affective experience before it is
                        associated with an idea that correlates to the object of sensation. He asks,
                        “May not the origin of the faculty of Association be illustrated with
                        greater success by [. . .] fixing our attention upon simple feeling?”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28478). Accordingly, Wedgwood argues that
                        affective experience drives the process of association. In his view,
                        “muscular action is associated with Feeling &amp; not with Idea”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). In other words, objects in the
                        world become associated more powerfully with a person’s emotional experience
                        of them than with the sensory, or physical, experience of them. Thus,
                        associated ideas do not call up other ideas, but rather emotional
                            states.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In an 1803 letter to Robert
                            Southey, Coleridge expresses a similar idea. He writes, “association
                            depends in much greater degree on the recurrence of resembling states of
                            Feeling, than on Trains of Idea [. . .] Ideas <emph>never</emph> recall
                            Ideas . . . it is the Soul, the state of Feeling” that recalls ideas
                                (<title level="m">CL</title> II: 961).</note> The consequence of
                        this assertion is that if an object or idea associates under pleasant
                        circumstances, subsequent experiences of it will be positive. If it
                        associates under negative conditions, it will later be experienced
                        negatively. For example, Wedgwood noted that any time he heard bells tolling
                        during the day he automatically felt dejected. He traced this response back
                        to an experience in Germany. He realized that when he heard any bells chime
                        in daytime “there was a striking resemblance between the tone &amp; that of
                        the Hamburg bell with which I had several unpleasant association &amp;
                        amongst the rest, a sensation of melancholy” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28452). Because his original experience of hearing bells during the day
                        was associated with unpleasant feelings, any repetition of this stimulus
                        triggers an analogous emotional response.</p>
                  <p>Often this associative process happens on an unconscious level. For example,
                        Wedgwood observed that when he “views a beautiful object in nature without
                        Emotion,” the “next moment on reviewing it, I feel Emotion”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). Or, as with the Hamburg bells, when
                        he heard bells chime during the day he involuntarily fell into a state of
                        dejection even though he did not consciously remember the initial event that
                        established this mood-stimulus relationship. As with the twentieth-century
                        theory of the mood-state dependency effect, the emotional state of the
                        perceiver “may become associated with otherwise neutral” sensory data at the
                        time that it is neurophysiologically encoded (Lewis and Critchley 432). That
                        is, sensory data that have no particular affective quality attached to them
                        can become linked to an emotional state through association. For whatever
                        reason, the chiming bells in Hamburg were painful to Wedgwood because of
                        some other unknown, negative circumstance related to them. This neutral
                        stimulus had been associated with an unpleasant emotion, and, henceforth
                        Wedgwood was prey to despondency and despair whenever he was exposed to
                        similar stimuli. The implication of this observation is that, according to
                        Wedgwood, mood is induced by memory, often unconsciously: “feeling often
                        remains without any idea to what it owes its birth” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                        Collection E40–28515). Feeling, then, rather than ideas, drives habit and
                        character formation. More important than the stimuli to which human beings
                        are exposed is their affective response to them. </p>
                  <p>Another implication of Wedgwood’s hypothesis is that emotion is embodied.
                        “All our feelings,” he claimed, are “different modifications of central
                        nerves” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28515/47). In other words, when
                        people experience emotions, there is movement in the central and peripheral
                        nervous systems. Wedgwood did not specify if the movement is caused by
                        vibrations, as in Hartley’s theory, or sensorial power, as in Darwin’s.
                        Though, similar to Davy’s speculation in early notebooks, Wedgwood thought
                        neural transduction might be a phenomenon corresponding to “electric
                        activity” or some “analogous activity of our nerve, assuming that Light,
                        Heat, Electricity is the same matter differently elicited” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                        Collection E40–28478). The inference is clear that affective feeling, like
                        sensory feeling, is physiological. </p>
                  <p>The idea that emotion is embodied is important for Wedgwood because it
                        allowed him to speculate that infants are not born with any particular
                        temperament, but that it develops over time in response to their
                            environment.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Though it was declining
                            in popularity in the eighteenth century, the ancient theory of humours
                            held that a person was born with a sanguine, choleric, melancholic, or
                            phlegmatic temperament.</note> Thus, education and upbringing could
                        drastically influence a child’s character as a consequence of Association.
                        In essence, Wedgwood took Locke’s theory of <foreign>tabula rasa</foreign>
                        and extended it beyond the acquisition of ideas and knowledge and beyond
                        even the development of virtue and vice as in Hartley’s theory, claiming
                        that feeling is also involved in the process of association. </p>
                  <p>Wedgwood came to his conclusions, in part, by reading <title level="m">Zoonomia,</title> in which Darwin theorizes that infants acquire the
                        capacity for emotion through muscular action. This could happen mimetically
                        by imitating the facial expressions of others. By smiling, frowning,
                        scowling, and so forth, they stimulate the emotional feelings associated
                        with each of these muscular actions.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                            Recent research has shown that “facial configurations” do, in fact
                            “differentially affect [. . .] peoples [<emph>sic</emph>] felt emotions”
                            (Glenberg et al. 121). Individuals experienced “strong physical
                            sensations when they contracted muscles that produced facial
                            configurations that resembled the universal facial expressions for
                            certain emotions” (Levenson, Ekman, and Friesen 364).</note> It could
                        also occur as by-products of other kinds of actions. For example, Darwin
                        notes that infants experience pleasure when breastfeeding. Since sucking
                        naturally causes the corners of the infant’s mouth to pull upward into a
                        smile, later in life people smile when they feel happy as a result of
                        muscular association and habit. Wedgwood noted that “Darwin’s hypothesis of
                        our ideas of sensations being repetitions of original impressions [...]
                        appears to me capable of substantial proof” and was “greatly confirmed by
                        the general analogy of the gradual acquirement of perfection of all our
                        functions, from which it would be strange to exclude our
                            <emph>feelings</emph>” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28452). Simply
                        put, Wedgwood observed that muscular and sensory acuity develops as infants
                        grow and mature. He reasoned by analogy that this same process must apply to
                        emotions as well. </p>
                  <p>Wedgwood considered it “[i]nstructive to consider with what labour &amp;
                        unceasing effort [...] muscular trains are formed in infancy” because it
                        provided evidence that people are not born with fully formed cognitive
                        faculties, but that they develop over time (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28451). The observations that “Trains of Ideas are, evidently, from the
                        imbecility of children, formed with the same expense of time and exertion”
                        validated the hypothesis that cognition is a material phenomenon, not the
                        function of a fully formed, immaterial soul (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28451). Wedgwood took early childhood developmental processes as proof
                        that the mind and body are formed together, and so, together shape
                        temperament. He applied this theory of association to knowledge acquisition
                        and to emotion. While an excess of negative emotion in childhood could
                        debilitate a person for life, these emotional experiences are also related
                        to bodily comfort or discomfort as well.</p>
                  <p>For Wedgwood, “Our own body is the centre &amp; measure of all our
                        acquirements” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28515/515). Not only does it
                        provide the basis for “ideas of distance” and magnitude, but it is the locus
                        of all our affective experience (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28515/515).
                        That is, we understand spatial concepts, generally considered to be abstract
                        ideas, through our senses.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The issue of
                            how abstract ideas such as distance, magnitude, shape, and even concepts
                            such as benevolence or justice could exist or be perceived if they were
                            not Platonic ideals or transcendental abstractions was a matter of
                            intense debate amongst materialist and dualist cognitive theorists, such
                            as Darwin, Beddoes, Davy, Thomas Brown, and others. </note> At the same
                        time, the body is also the foundation for character, emotional temperament,
                        and all our future happiness or misery. “The Happiness of Man,” he claimed,
                        “is comprised entirely in <title level="m">Sensation</title> &amp; <title level="m">Emotion</title>; Imagination &amp; Action are only deemed
                        important from being observed immediately to antecede pleasurable &amp;
                        painful Sensation &amp; Emotion” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28457). In
                        keeping with the intellectual atmosphere of his politically radical mentors,
                        Wedgwood saw “the great end of Existence [as] Individual happiness,” which
                        he associated with “Self regulation” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28480). Self-regulation refers to a balanced state of mind and of body
                        that prevents a person from falling too far into dejection, vacillating
                        between emotional extremes, and suffering unduly from physical
                        complaints.</p>
                  <p>“[F]rom repeated experiments,” he discovered that “the same events which will
                        make you miserable by anticipation [. . .] will hardly disturb your
                        equanimity for a moment in better health” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28480). He recognized that one’s state of mind is greatly affected by
                        one’s phenomenological experience of the world, and he believed that this
                        could be controlled through more careful attention to the process of
                        association, particularly in children. Therefore, to discover how to train
                        the mind (imagination) and the body (action) in order to increase happiness
                        and decrease misery became his primary concern. He tried to record the
                        “Incidents, Thoughts, Feeling, &amp;c of my early life” so that he could
                        discover and “illustrate the composition of Feeling, its growth &amp;
                        maturation” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28490). He hoped “to display in
                        my own history some of the errors &amp; perhaps some of the advantages of my
                        education—to unravel the web of my ideas &amp; sensations—to trace my
                        present habits to their origins” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28490). He
                        did not, however, get far. His memoirs consist of a page and half of events
                        that occurred when he was between five and seven years old. Like Wordsworth,
                        who was not satisfied enough with <title level="m">The Prelude</title> to
                        publish it during his lifetime, Wedgwood found the task daunting, noting
                        “the difficulty [...] in investigating the origin of different feelings”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28478). He notes: <quote>One is obliged to
                            decompound one’s present feelings into their component sensations and
                            take for granted that the components are much the same as they were in
                            our earliest infancy—But it is impossible to make just allowance for the
                            growth to perfection of each ingredient of sensation in the long
                            interval between infancy &amp; manhood—still more impossible to
                            recollect their first development and earliest natures.
                            (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28478)</quote> A better plan of action,
                        then, was to try “to ascertain the truth of any hypothesis of the
                        association of the Powers of Mind by experimenting with children”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). Thus, Wedgwood’s theory was also
                        formed by observing his nieces and nephews, as he turned his attention to
                        formulating a pedagogical theory that took into account his materialist
                        theories of cognition. </p>

                  <head>Wedgwood’s Materialist Pedagogy</head>
                  <p>Wedgwood’s plans for an experimental school, with its emphasis on the
                        importance of affective feeling in association, are predicated on his
                        materialist theory of cognition. The most complete outline of his plan
                        appears in a letter to William Godwin dated 1797, printed in the first part
                        of Erdman’s article. His theory of education, on which his plan for the
                        school was based, however, exists mostly in unpublished notebooks, though
                        some of his insights have been summarized by Boole in an essay that precedes
                        Tremayne’s selection of excerpts from Wedgwood’s notebooks. The majority of
                        his notes on education and pedagogy are interspersed with his notes on
                        cognition and on association, more generally. The proximity of the notes on
                        cognition to the “Hints &amp; speculation on Education” throughout the
                        archival notebooks reveals how intertwined these two projects were
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). Wedgwood’s goal was to understand
                        human cognition from a materialist perspective and apply those insights to
                        rearing and educating children. </p>
                  <p>His approach relies on Hartley’s assumption that it was possible for “the
                        Affections and Passions” to “be analysed into their simple compounding
                        parts, by reversing the Steps of the Associations which concur to form them”
                        (81). Hartley claims that by analyzing the steps of association “we may
                        learn how to cherish and improve the good” characteristics and qualities and
                        “check and root out such as are mischievous and immoral;” we may also learn
                        “how to suit our Manner of Life, in some tolerable Measure, to our
                        intellectual and religious Wants” (81). Wedgwood believed he had arrived at
                        certain insights through his reading and observations that would allow him
                        formulate a plan that would produce certain types of adults. Wedgwood,
                        “devoid of any religious sense” (Doherty 305), adapted Hartley’s theory to a
                        secular context. While he did not believe that right association would lead
                        people to God, or theopathy in Hartley’s theory, he did think it dictated
                        behaviour, health, and affect. </p>
                  <p>From Wedgwood’s perspective the “great business of human education lies in
                        correcting, often in the most arbitrary manner, pleasurable and painful
                        feelings with a multitudinous variety of objects &amp; events, which, as yet
                        wholly indifferent to him [the child] are afterwards to become the principle
                        means &amp; instruments of all his pleasures &amp; pain” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                        Collection E40–28482). The problem for Wedgwood was the “arbitrary manner”
                        in which “a multitudinous variety of objects &amp; events,” that are in and
                        of themselves neutral, become associated with different states of feeling.
                        These associations determine the whole course of a person’s life, but
                        particularly his or her emotional and physical dispositions. Wedgwood’s aim
                        was to direct early childhood experiences “with the view of creating
                            <emph>agreeable</emph> feeling” in children so that that they would
                        mature into healthy, well-adjusted adults (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28482). </p>
                  <p>He began his investigation into pedagogy with the assumption that “Before
                        entering upon any of the principles of a regular plan of education, we
                        should decide upon the kind of being we wish to produce” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                        Collection E40–28463). In order to formulate a pedagogical plan, educators
                        first need to determine not what they want their pupils to learn, but how
                        they want them to <emph>be</emph> when they reach adulthood. The type of
                        beings that Wedgwood wished to produce were benevolent geniuses, who would
                        be capable of bringing to fruition the sort of just and equitable society
                        described in various philosophical treatises such as Godwin’s <title level="m">Political Justice</title> (1793). Referring to Godwin and
                        other intellectuals whom he admired, he noted that “there are a dozen men in
                        this kingdom whom their own exertions, a good education, or fortunate
                        circumstances, have raised to such a pitch of moral excellence as to be
                        enabled to resist the ruinous temptations of wealth, power, &amp; sensual
                        pleasure” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28515/28). This temperament, in
                        his opinion, was a crucial part of genius. Wedgwood’s goal was to use the
                        principles of materialist cognitive science in order to consistently provide
                        “a good education” that would produce human beings of this kind.</p>
                  <p>Wedgwood’s experimental educational programme, which was designed to form
                        emotionally stable geniuses, had two primary objects: <quote>(I) To produce
                            a being possessing the largest possible means of affecting his own

                     <quote>(II) the happiness of others. (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                            E40–28486)</quote> These two attributes—the ability to make oneself
                        happy and the desire to make others happy—are, in this view, the foundation
                        of a citizenry capable of and motivated to enact an equitable society. For
                        this reason, “<title level="m">Emotion</title> is the chief subject of
                        Education,” for, emotionally healthy adults are “best adapted to produce
                        individual happiness; &amp; to call forth an activity which shall have the
                        widest influence upon the happiness of others” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28486). Because, for Wedgwood, emotion is an embodied phenomenon that is
                        closely tied to cognition and drives association, <quote>Education, consists

                        phenomena, Wedgwood hoped to educate infants and children into adults who

                            sympathy with the unretrievably [<emph>sic</emph>] unfortunate whom he

                            shall enable him to act so as to afford the greatest possible relief—to
                            keep their eyes invariably fixed on the great standard of human conduct,

                     <note place="foot" resp="editors"> In this excerpt
                            from a notebook, Wedgwood added the word “unretrievably” and crossed out
                            “whom he is unable to relieve.” I, uncharacteristically, included the
                            crossed out material because it was unlike Wedgwood to discourage
                            sympathy for “the unfortunate.” He generally encouraged benevolence and
                            charitable acts. The fact that these individuals cannot, for whatever
                            reason, be helped is the important defining attribute that makes
                            sympathy for them detrimental rather than desirable.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wedgwood valued the qualities noted in this passage, most likely because he,
                        in his estimation, lacked them himself. Thus, the characteristics that he
                        hoped to cultivate in his pupils were freedom from “useless &amp; harassing
                        emotions,” a positive outlook that refuses to focus on the negative in
                        “every situation,” and “tranquillity and equilibrium” in all circumstances.
                        If these attributes could be cultivated in childhood not only would
                        education produce emotionally stable adults, but given the link between
                        emotion and the body, they would also be physically healthy, free of the
                        debilitating pain and chronic ill-health from which he suffered. In this
                        way, they would be able to make themselves and others happy, thus creating a
                        contented, and therefore just, society.</p>
                  <p>In order to achieve this goal, Wedgwood emphasized the physical and emotional
                        wellbeing of his hypothetical pupils, whom he envisioned as infants. In
                        order to attend to “Sensation,” his first proposition was to create an
                        environment that would “simplify &amp; render intense the first affections
                        of Sense &amp; [. . .] excite those affections under every possible
                        favorable circumstance of pleasure” (qtd. in Erdman I: 431). Simplification,
                        intensity, and pleasure, in his view, are the three necessary ingredients
                        for controlling and manipulating a baby’s bodily experience. Simplicity—or
                        introducing objects, sounds, scents, and so forth incrementally rather than
                        all at once—would reduce the chaos of sensory perception that he surmised
                        infants, with their undeveloped senses, must experience when thrust into an
                        uncontrolled environment of sensory stimuli. This manner of “administering
                        impressions” would solve the problems caused by having “their attention [. .
                        .] vaguely solicited by a thousand objects at once” (qtd. in Erdman I:
                            431).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> As a point of interest, in one
                            of his notebooks, Coleridge refers to the unstructured nature of
                            association as “an unintelligible affrightful Riddle, […] a chaos of <hi rend="strikethrough">dark tailless</hi> dark limbs &amp; trunk,
                            tailless, headless, nothing begun &amp; nothing ended” (<title level="m">CN</title> III: 4057).</note> He conjectured that “if supplied too
                        rapidly with impression,” the infant would become overwhelmed, but “if
                        [impressions are supplied] too slowly, stupidity &amp; limited conception”
                        would result (qtd. in Erdman I: 431). Sensory stimuli must be controlled so
                        that strong connections would be formed between external objects and the
                        ideas that result from association. Furthermore, the infants’
                        superintendents must be careful to ensure that all stimuli associate under
                        the most pleasurable conditions possible. Otherwise, negative associations
                        would be made, thus making the child susceptible to bad temper and poor
                        health.</p>
                  <p>Wedgwood noted that educators and parents readily “instruct the <emph>eye
                            &amp; ear</emph>, in teaching language;” however, “Sight &amp; Touch are
                        the two important Senses” and should be given equal attention (qtd. in
                        Erdman I: 431). A child’s body should be educated with as much care as its
                        mind. Because sight and touch are so closely interrelated, “they must be
                        taught together” (qtd. in Erdman I: 431). To educate the senses, Wedgwood
                        proposed a “nursery” with “plain grey walls with one or two vivid objects
                        for sight &amp; touch” (qtd. in Erdman I: 431). He suggested that “hard
                        bodies be hung about them so as to continually irritate their palms as they
                        happen to come in contact” in order to encourage digital “manipulation”
                        (qtd. in Erdman I: 431). Slowly introducing infants to the external world
                        after their long confinement in the womb would reduce the shock of birth
                        trauma, which is compounded, according to Wedgwood, by the riotous assault
                        of sensation on the infant’s <emph>tabula rasa</emph> body. Properly
                        attending to the child’s bodily needs would, in Wedgwood’s theory of
                        embodied cognition, necessarily improve its mind.</p>
                  <p>Careful attention to the child’s surroundings was, as Richardson observes,
                        common to most associationist theories of education. While Wedgwood’s ideas
                        resemble those of other rationalist educators, there are some significant
                        differences. Lunar Society member Richard Lovell Edgeworth and his daughter
                        Maria Edgeworth, co-authors of <title level="m">Practical Education</title>,
                        proposed a “sanitized, carefully superintended version of the upper-class
                        home, with every detail arranged” (Richardson 54). In contrast to Wedgwood’s
                        hypothetical seminary, they “prefer[red] ‘domestic’ education to boarding
                        school” (55). The Edgeworths also recommended a series of “practical
                        experiments that children can perform,” while discouraging certain types of
                        literature that could potentially disorder their imagination (53). Along
                        similar lines, Beddoes designed a set of “rational toys” to inculcate
                        mathematical principles (Erdman II: 491). Wedgwood, however, was less
                        concerned with lessons and reading material than he was with ensuring that
                        the bodily needs of children would be met. He wanted to make sure that they
                        would not be subjected to distressing situations and that they would be
                        diverted from painful emotional states. Where the Edgeworths’ pupil would be
                        “carefully inculcated [with] habits of rational thought” (Richardson 57),
                        Wedgwood’s pupil was to be carefully cultivated to be physically and
                        emotionally robust. </p>
                  <p> In addition to providing suggestions for controlling and manipulating an
                        infant’s initial sensory data, Wedgwood also considered “how to connect high
                        degrees of pleasure with these impressions” (qtd. in Erdman I: 432). The
                        cultivation of pleasure and avoidance of pain is closely connected to the
                        fourth point on Wedgwood’s list, that is, “Muscular motion, or activity”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28486). Bodily discomfort, in his theory,
                        leads directly to poor health and low spirits. If a child is forced to
                        “remain torpid &amp; inert for some time, the health is deranged”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28452). Furthermore, “Pains of the body,
                        whether from hunger, sickness or external injury, when long continued,
                        induce a depression of spirits, or painful Emotion which endures a
                        considerable time after the painful Sensation has ceased” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                        Collection E40–28457). “<title level="m">Stretching</title>,” on the other
                        hand, “augments pleasure” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28457). Emotion
                        originates in the pleasurable or painful states of the infant body.
                        “Consider[ing] the early states of being in infancy,” Wedgwood conjectured
                        that breastfeeding, or the satiation of hunger, is a “most agreeable state”
                        in which the baby is “using muscular exertion” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28457). During this activity of nursing, the child’s “body is thrown
                        into action, kicks &amp; stretching” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28457). Thus, movement is pleasurable and restraint painful.</p>
                  <p>As pleasure and pain are always accompanied by the basic emotions of fear and
                        love in Wedgwood’s materialist theory of cognition, these bodily states lead
                        to affective states. If a child suffers from excessive bodily pain by being
                        forcibly restrained, not having its basic needs met, or from being neglected
                        when in distress, the long-term consequences can lead not only debility and
                        depression, but even to wickedness or malevolence. Wedgwood theorized that
                        the unsatisfied desire to have pain relieved leads, <quote>Perhaps in this
                            kind of progress [to] </quote>

                     <quote>Revenge. (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28457)</quote> Unrelieved
                        pain, in Wedgwood’s conception of affective stages, causes individuals to
                        pass through the abovementioned phases until eventually they want to seek
                        revenge for the hurt caused them. Continued exposure to uncomfortable
                        situations results in bad tempered adults and even violence. After being
                        freed from restraint, for example, a child moves “with <emph>more</emph>
                        violence than he would otherwise do &amp; then a habit of violent Muscular
                        Exertion when under provocation, is daily strengthened” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                        Collection E40–28457), leading a child to respond with violence when
                        provoked. The response to pain in childhood becomes a habit that is not only
                        carried into adulthood, but forms the basis of a person’s emotional
                        character. “Hence, children, from rudely pushing each other, come to repeat
                        the pushes, or in other words, to beat each other;” they develop the
                        “mechanical” habit of responding with violence even when there is no pain
                        present, “as in the case of a choleric man” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28457). The “muscular energy” that accumulates in painful circumstances
                        “must expend itself on something;” hence, “Choleric men stamp the ground,
                        tear their hair, grind their teeth, break furniture” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                        Collection E40–28457).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Here we see
                            Wedgwood drawing on the theory of humours, but making the assumption
                            that these character types are not innate but formed through
                            association.</note> Thus, children should not be “left to fight out
                        their own battles [or] settle their own disputes” for “[w]hat can result
                        from such a method but tyranny &amp; injustice on the one hand &amp;
                        dejection and cunning on the other” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467).
                        The implications of this observation are that an unjust society is made up
                        of violent and “cunning” individuals. </p>
                  <p>Wedgwood urged “every parent [to] conceive of himself as one of the Trustees
                        of a benevolent power that wishes the happiness of Mankind, and of his
                        children as the instruments of its production” (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole
                        82). To create a society founded on equality and justice, parents and
                        educators must rear children who literally embody these principles. That is,
                        they should not merely claim to value democratic ideals such as liberty and
                        equality but must enact them with their whole beings, which includes both
                        the actions they take and their emotional natures. In addition to
                        disallowing children to hit each other, Wedgwood argued that “no violence
                        should be done to the feelings of the child” (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole
                        82). Teasing children, abruptly disrupting their pleasure, startling them,
                        or using insensitive methods to get them to comply with parents’ wishes
                        creates youngsters who are timid and easily frightened. Washing and dressing
                        them against their wills while “they supplicate for liberty and a cessation
                        to their pain” (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole 78) or “feigning to set out”
                        while pretending not to care if the child follows as a way to get them to
                        leave a place desensitizes them to the sufferings of others (79). If a
                        parent or caregiver ignores children’s pleas to stop hurting them, they
                        learn to disregard others’ pain. Likewise, feigning indifference teaches
                        them indifference. Wedgwood described these standard parenting tactics as “a
                        picture of brutal insensibility” that is “set before children who are
                        afterwards expected to sympathise in the distresses and attend to the
                        complaints of all about them!” (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole 78). “Children,”
                        he exhorted, “must be kept happy” if they are to grow up into benevolent
                        adults (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28525/116).</p>
                  <p>Wedgwood also advised not allowing children to have toys of their own.
                        Instead, with “regard to Property, it would be advisable that children
                        should have everything perfectly in common” to abolish the notion of private
                        property (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole 89), which he saw as the root of many
                        social ills. “The moral error of these notions is fully exposed,” he
                        claimed, “by our attempt to answer a child’s questioning of ‘What does
                            <emph>mine</emph> mean?’” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467). There
                        is “[n]o reply [that] can be made that does not directly inculcate
                        selfishness &amp; injustice” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467).
                        Personal possessive pronouns, in Wedgwood’s view, are necessarily predicated
                        on self-interest and promote self-seeking and personal gain at the expense
                        of others because conceptually they refer to private ownership. He advocated
                        the “extirpation” of these words from children’s vocabulary—“those
                        mischievous particles, <emph>My</emph>, <emph>Mine</emph>, <emph>His</emph>,
                            <emph>Yours</emph>,<emph> Hers</emph>, must never be pronounced in their
                        hearing” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467). For “children [who] have
                        already imbibed the corrupt notion of property to the evident risk of
                        injuring their temper,” he recommended “mak[ing] common presents to the
                        whole nursery” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28515/34). To further
                        abolish the notion of individual ownership and to reinforce the notion of
                        shared property, children “shou’d have all articles of dress in common that
                        their different sizes will admit of” and “[a]ll Playthings” should “be
                        common—the same of chairs, beds, &amp;c &amp;c” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28467). The goal, again, was to mould children to grow into adults who
                        espouse ideals of social equity.</p>
                  <p>Wedgwood drew his conclusions, in part, from his observations of his nieces
                        and nephews. In a plain grey notebook with the words “Baby Wedgwood [...]
                        her faults &amp; the associated habits” written lightly in pencil across the
                        front, Wedgwood makes the following observations: <quote>B—subject to
                            occasional dejection of spirits &amp; frequent fits of peevishness—These
                            often arise from want of food—And often from very slight
                            provocations—the origin of her extreme irritability must be searched for
                            in the method of her education. [...] When B. is vexed by any trivial
                            provocation, &amp; dejection of spirits strongly marked in her
                            countenance is associated with the events, wholly disproportionate to
                            the real nature. (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467)<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The excerpted words are “with Bessy
                                Wedgwood,” which presumably references Elizabeth Allen Wedgwood,
                                Josiah’s wife and mother to the child in question. Baby Wedgwood was
                                most likely Charlotte Wedgwood, Jos and Bessy’s second daughter born
                                in 1797, though Wedgwood and Wedgwood suggest that it might have
                                been Elizabeth, their first daughter born in 1793
                            (111).</note>
                     </quote> These remarks synthesize Wedgwood’s thoughts about
                        the relationship between the body, pleasure and pain, emotions, and
                        pedagogy. Characterizing his niece’s temperament as peevish, irritable, and
                        prone to “dejection,” he theorized that “One part of the mischief done to
                        B’s temper arises from the strong notions infused into her of
                            <emph>exclusive property</emph>” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28467), which he saw as adding to her misery by increasing her desire
                        for things belonging to her brother and by causing anxiety when he played
                        with her toys. Equally notable, however, he observed that her distemper
                        often arose from physical causes, such as “want of food.” Her tendency to
                        overreact to “any trivial provocation” and “her feebleness of spirits &amp;
                        irritability of temper” are “[o]wing partly to a weak frame, &amp; partly to
                        injurious treatments” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467). Though
                        Wedgwood did not consider his brother and sister-in-law abusive parents, he
                        believed that even mild physical mistreatment, neglect of her basic needs,
                        and the inculcation of incorrect principles were responsible for B’s
                        disordered personality. </p>
                  <p>The typical childrearing strategies of the late eighteenth and early
                        nineteenth centuries, which failed to carefully heed the needs of the
                        child’s body, were to blame for sickly, distempered children. These
                        practices were implicitly based on the common belief that the soul and the
                        mind are immaterial principles that inhabit, but exist separately from, the
                        material body. If the mind and body are separate entities, then the body
                        needs little attention because it has little bearing on a child’s
                        temperament. Or, conversely, this view of the mind-body relationship could
                        lead to a theory in which the body must be mortified so that children do not
                        become tempted by sensual pleasures or the enjoyments of the flesh. With the
                        emergence of materialist theories of mind that privileged the body’s role in
                        cognition, thinkers such as Wedgwood looked more closely at how children
                        were treated physically, mentally, and emotionally. </p>
                  <p>In addition to outlining the flaws in B’s “method of education”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467), Wedgwood also offered suggestions
                        for rectifying the flaws in his niece’s character, which he also applied
                        more generally to his theory of education. To correct B’s tendency towards
                        temper tantrums, “[o]ne mode of cure, derived from medical analogy seems to
                        promise, at least <emph>alleviation</emph> consisting in shortening &amp;
                        mitigating the fit[s]” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467). He proposed
                        an “experiment” for increasing B’s capacity to “bear [...] sudden privations
                        with little discomposure” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467). In “this
                        experiment it wou’d be worth while to prepare some new &amp; diverting
                        toys—the more striking the better” to divert her from her “suffering”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467). To cure her of the invitiating
                        effects of “<emph>exclusive property</emph>,” Wedgwood suggested that
                        “Playthings shou’d be given which require assistance from another &amp;
                        being left alone with her brother, she wou’d naturally be led to associate
                        him with her amusements [...] If left much together, they wou’d soon become
                        necessary to each other” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467). The
                        purpose of these suggestions and experiments was to train B to become more
                        capable of bearing hardship cheerfully, to increase her ability to make
                        herself happy, and to encourage a sense of cooperation and fellowship with
                        her siblings. These qualities would allow her to mature into a healthy and
                        benevolent adult.</p>
                  <p>Wedgwood’s propositions for educating children at home or in an institutional
                        setting were similar. He recommended attention to children’s bodily and
                        emotional wellbeing by attending to diet, physical examinations, and
                        exercise so as to encourage children to develop characteristics and
                        qualities that allow them to succeed in life. The qualities that would
                        produce benevolent beings of genius included: <lg>
                        <l>1. Sound health, body robust &amp; active</l>
                        <l>2. Even, firm spirits</l>
                        <l>3. Presence of mind</l>
                        <l>4. Fortitude</l>
                        <l>5. Good humour—inirritable [<emph>sic</emph>] temper</l>
                        <l>6. A clear &amp; constant view of his duties to himself &amp; to his
                                species</l>
                        <l>7. A perfect assurance—inaccessibility to all diffidence,
                                bashfulness, confusion</l>
                        <l>8. Strong understanding, quickness of parts &amp;c.</l>
                        <l>9. Conciliating manners</l>
                        <l>10. Correct taste in Arts, Music, &amp;c. (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                                Collection E40–28463) </l>
                     </lg> This list gives insight into the ideal subject that Wedgwood hoped to
                        produce through the process of education. This being would hypostatize the
                        social ideals of the political radicals with whom he consorted and be free
                        of the physical and emotional debilities from which Wedgwood, himself,
                        suffered.</p>

                  <head>Conclusion</head>
                  <p>Wedgwood’s pedagogical goal was to “form by education” individuals who would
                        not ignore the social ills found in “our jails, hospitals, [...] our
                        Bridewalls [<emph>sic</emph>] and Poor Houses,” but would “hunt out and
                        expose that misery in its gloomiest recesses and combat those fatal
                        prejudices which have chiefly occasioned it by splitting society into
                        subordinate classes” (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole 70). In order to create
                        these concerned and motivated future citizens, he argued that educators
                        should determine which qualities they wished to cultivate in their pupils
                        then implement a plan of education based on the principles of materialist
                        cognitive science, which privileged the body by making it necessary to
                        cognition. He held that it is “important [. . .] in Education [. . .] [t]o
                        implant as early as possible habits of real industry and serious occupation,
                        such as will exercise the body and [. . .] furnish that happiness of
                        pleasure for which alone we live” (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole 69).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> While Wedgwood's discussions of education
                            often assume male pupils, here, as with his discussion of B's
                            temperament, he is discussing the benefits of exercise for women and
                            girls. He argues, along the lines of Wollstonecraft, that women are
                            “delicate, feeble, and sickly” because, unlike men, they do not exercise
                            their bodies (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole 68).</note> Thus, he believed
                        that attending to the body was the way to properly form the mind. </p>
                  <p>Wedgwood’s theory is wonderfully idealistic, but aspects of it are extreme.
                        For example, in the interest of controlling early association he cautioned
                        that “the child must never go out of doors or leave his own apartment,” as
                        the “explication of Nature would be attended to with great difficulty” (qtd.
                        in Erdman I: 431). This was an idea that Wordsworth and Coleridge, with
                        their idealized concept of the child of nature, found repugnant, as Erdman
                        notes. Furthermore, it is highly impracticable. Elsewhere, Wedgwood
                        suggested that in order to instil fortitude and tranquillity in the face of
                        danger <quote>the parent might invite an attack of a fierce bull, stand with
                            perfect composure till the animal be within two or three paces of him,
                            then suddenly expand an umbrella, hold his hat before his face, or
                            somehow contrive to amuse or terrify the foe; whilst his child, on the
                            other side of the stile, shall witness his intrepidity and address, and
                            by degrees, practise the same feat himself in company with his parent.
                            Or the child might begin his triumph with a raging turkey-cock. (qtd. in
                            Tremayne and Boole 85)</quote> More realistically perhaps, but radical
                        for his day, was his suggestion that “Hospitals, prisons, madhouses should
                        be visited, but in so cautious a manner that the mind might experience no
                        shock, but be gradually familiarised with their horrors” (qtd. in Tremayne
                        and Boole 85). Though Wedgwood spent time with his nieces and nephews,
                        clearly he had no children of his own or he may not have made such
                        far-fetched suggestions. Nonetheless, his goal was to inculcate children
                        with steady emotional character, physical health, and moral
                        fortitude—characteristics that could not be taught, but must be embodied. </p>
                  <p>“Moral sensibility [could be] nicely cultivated during education,” but only
                        because “Feeling connects copiously with due notions of things, [and]
                        creates a species of intuition in conduct” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28470). Thus, Wedgwood proposed an educational programme that educated
                        children’s emotions by focusing on their bodies. In keeping with his mentors
                        and his contemporaries, Wedgwood theorised that cognition is an embodied
                        phenomenon. Like the Edgeworths, Beddoes, and other rationalist educators he
                        drew upon the principles of association as he formulated his plan. Unlike
                        these thinkers, however, he emphasized the importance of feeling, not just
                        in association but also in education. Writing from his own experience of
                        mental, physical, and emotional torment, Wedgwood strove to formulate a plan
                        that would not only free individuals from depression and ill health, but
                        would also create citizens capable of enacting the ideal society of which he
                        and his radical associates dreamed. Had he been healthier or lived longer
                        perhaps his experimental school would have made it beyond the hypothetical
                        stage; or perhaps he would have been able to have children of his own on
                        which to experiment. As it stands, his legacy remains in primarily archival
                        form, but gives us rich insight into the interconnections of the mind-matter
                        debates, theories of pleasure and pain, and pedagogy in the early Romantic
                        period.</p>

               <p rend="noCount"> This paper discusses the outcomes of a multi-year project to
                    engage undergraduate students in active and constructive encounters with
                    Romantic period themes and contexts via web-based, multi-user gamespaces.
                    Interactive, participatory learning environments, akin to humanities “lab”
                    spaces where controlled experimentation and exploration can take place,
                    encourage students to innovate, create, share, and play together. This
                    pedagogical strategy engages students with the complexities, advantages, and
                    difficulties faced by the intersection of independent and interdependent
                    approaches to creativity, communication, and action during the Romantic period,
                    allowing them to become performatively involved in experiential situations (as
                    players/classroom citizens and as builders/authors) that reflect the thematic
                    issues that they are studying. </p>

                  <head>Introduction: Setting the Stage</head>
                  <p>Romantic-period literature frequently asserts individual selves against
                        traditional subjectivities. Various characters, including unacknowledged
                        poetic geniuses, orphans, Byronic misanthropes, humanized gods, godlike
                        everymen, and tragic last men have collectively contributed to the
                        individualistic stereotypes at the heart of the ideal and ideological
                        notions of Romanticism that have followed us into the twenty-first century.
                        This literary litany of self-reflexive lyrics, esoteric compositions, and
                        fictional caricatures associate independence with individualism in ways that
                        eclipse the presence of collaborative, collective and creative
                            <emph>interdependence</emph> during the Romantic era. Moreso than lonely
                        creative voices, collective movements towards new subjectivities and
                        subjective categorizations, driven by a dissenting, interdependent spirit of
                        independence, permeated the revolutionary politics and inventive,
                        collaborative aesthetics of this period in British history. Samuel Taylor
                        Coleridge recognized this in “The Nightingale” (1798), which deconstructs
                        the impossible-to-sustain idea of loneliness, independence and solitude
                        among a community of warbling poets: “But never elsewhere in one place I
                        knew / So many Nightingales: and far and near / In wood and thicket over the
                        wide grove / They answer and provoke each other’s songs” (55-58). </p>
                  <p>This fundamental tension between collectivist and individualist pursuits of
                        independence and the implicit acknowledgement of the necessity and
                        inevitability of larger-scale interdependencies and collaborations is an
                        essential characteristic of the period that needs to be more emphatically
                        conveyed to undergraduate-level students. Indeed, countering a false sense
                        of insular individualism and exposing the ironies of idealizing “freedom”
                        from within a legal, social contract is necessary to fully understand the
                        relationship between literature and politics in this period as well as to
                        comprehend twenty-first century political beliefs and cultural practice.
                        Asking undergraduates to challenge individualistic ideals is essential
                        within arts and humanities programs, which continue to perpetuate a
                        misleading Romantic ideal of the scholar as a competitively independent and
                        exclusive individual genius. In a manner that replicates the state of our
                        individualist professional practice, publication, and promotional
                        evaluation, many university-level literature programs (at both the
                        undergraduate and graduate level) offer classroom and program environments
                        for students that discourage interdependent activities and accomplishments
                        even though most faculty members must adopt collaborative and integrative
                        practices in order to navigate everyday teaching, service, and research
                        situations. To leave students unprepared for the promises and pitfalls of
                        communal scholarly practice and mutual imposition is to leave them
                        unprepared for the collaborative world that awaits them after their degree
                        is earned.</p>

                  <head>MOOspace: Choosing an appropriate arena</head>
                  <p>To encourage the collaboration so necessary in today’s workforce and, more
                        importantly, to help students confront the interdependent cultures,
                        aesthetics, and politics of the Romantic era, I have appealed to the
                        supplementary use of multiplayer online environments, which allow students
                        to inhabit various social contexts rather than just abstractly understand
                        them. These virtual spaces, like literary settings, offer an imaginary arena
                        to showcase human drama. The difference between these environments and the
                        worlds created through literary expression (and some traditional classroom
                        practices) is that the player directly participates in the narrative, and
                        players, unlike readers, can dream together in real-time, in the same space.
                        While books can simulate such environments through representation, novels
                        from this period do not enable readers to become characters in their
                        stories, nor do they promote collaborative interactions between readers in
                        bookspace. Designing specific stories and contexts for students to
                        experience within these multi-user environments encourages co-operative
                        play, inviting them not only to negotiate the tension between independence
                        and collaborative life in the eighteenth century, but also to learn in a
                        different way than they usually do in the humanities. Supplementing a
                        traditional classroom space in which they are largely independent operators
                        with the collaborative humanities laboratory of the multi-user gamespace is
                        a worthwhile educational intervention. While many other collaborative
                        classroom activities could be leveraged to encourage the same results
                        without relying on computer and online technologies, this particular
                        approach offers additional, valuable, and marketable learning experiences to
                        humanities students regarding scripting, problem solving through program
                        design and environment planning, order of operations, and working in a
                        digital environment in general.</p>
                  <p>Digital gamespaces offer unique opportunities for designers and players: the
                        designer is able to write the rules by which the story appears, as well as
                        planning the story arc(s) (what Janet Murray calls procedural authorship
                        (152)). Murray states that “the procedural author creates not just a set of
                        scenes, but a world of narrative possibilities” (153), which is akin to a
                        constructivist facilitation—a useful alternative to traditional teaching
                        methods in which students are handed pre-rendered narrative syllabi and
                        expected to follow along with the expert lecturer. Ian Bogost’s <title level="m">Persuasive Games</title> (2007) extends this idea by
                        recognizing that games employ a procedural rhetoric (i.e. persuasion through
                        the authorship of rules of behavior, through a dynamic model). Players are
                        required to contribute actively to their own progress within specific
                        experiential fields in which choices and consequences have been pre-rendered
                        for them. These affordances contribute to a rhetorical opportunity that can
                        help to facilitate player identification with a designer-author’s intentions
                        and ideas via performative participation.</p>
                  <p>The gamespaces that I have been using to engage undergraduate students with
                        these ideas are hosted within a somewhat outdated environment as far as
                        multiplayer game opportunities go, but which avoids obsolescence by
                        remaining configurable, affordable, and textual. Acadia University’s
                        gamespaces are built within enCore Xpress, an open-source MOO database and
                        graphical user interface.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> A descriptive
                            tutorial for students that discusses the purpose of MOOs and describes
                            how to use Acadia’s version of this environment was created by Jean-Marc
                            Giffin and can be found <ref target="http://moo.acadiau.ca/~moo/encore/images/moo-tutorial.html">here</ref>.</note> Since the MOO acronym might not be familiar to
                        many readers, a brief history and explanation follows: MUDs (Multi-user
                        Dungeons) appeared in the late 1970s and were the first multi-user online
                        gamespaces. They used a text-based “chat room” interface to involve a number
                        of simultaneous, networked computer users in role-playing situations within
                        described environments that resembled early single-player text-adventure
                        games like <title level="m">Zork</title>. As MUDs evolved, ASCII graphics
                        were added to some versions and their virtual spaces were harnessed by some
                        users for educational ends. MOOs (MUD Object Oriented), the evolutionary
                        cousins of MUDs, were born in the early 1990s and retained the text-based
                        environment of MUDs but used an object-oriented programming language and a
                        persistent object database to extend the flexibility and opportunities
                        offered by MUD environments. Uniquely, users could also construct virtual
                        environments from within those spaces via simple commands that eliminated
                        the need for high-level programming knowledge. <note place="foot" resp="editors">This opportunity to add to or modify a virtual
                            environment from within such an environment is becoming more common in
                            recent mainstream digital games, such as <title level="m">Minecraft</title> and <title level="m">Little Big
                            Planet</title>.</note> Despite being over fifteen years old, the
                        open-source accessibility, web-based aspect, multimedia opportunities, and
                        programmability of the enCore Xpress MOO influenced my decision to utilize
                        it for the purpose of delivering “serious,” multi-user games to my
                        undergraduate Romantic-period literature students as part of their classroom
                        experience.</p>
                  <p>Acadia University’s modified version of enCore Xpress, called Golgonooza
                        (Blake’s city of the imagination), enables the creation and use of
                        multiplayer, goal-oriented, persuasive role-playing games in my
                        undergraduate classrooms. Its focused purpose and more developed toolkit
                        takes it beyond the now defunct <title level="m">Romantic Circles
                            MOO</title> (Villa Diodati), which also used encore Xpress and which has
                        no true pedagogical successor on the RC website. Golgonooza is also distinct
                        from other computer-assisted pedagogical innovations. For example, Roger
                        Whitson’s “William Blake and Media” class engaged students via Twitter,
                        Zotero, and blogging activities, but none of these (individually or
                        collectively) achieves the community and role-playing potential of enCore
                        Xpress’ interactive story-world environment. </p>
                  <p>I have installed two versions of the encore MOO on Acadia’s servers. The
                        first (<ref target="http://moo.acadiau.ca:7000">http://moo.acadiau.ca:7000</ref>) is based on version 4 of enCore
                        Xpress. This database (named Golgonooza) hosts a hardcoded gamespace based
                        on the environments featured in Mary Robinson’s novel <title level="m">The
                            Natural Daughter</title> (1799). This game was designed by Beth Lyons (a
                        former theatre undergraduate student), Jean-Marc Giffin (a former
                        undergraduate Computer Science student at Acadia), and me. The other MOO
                        installation (named Golgonooza 2.0 and found at <ref target="http://moo.acadiau.ca:7001">http://moo.acadiau.ca:7001</ref>)
                        has been customized to host persuasive arguments in the form of interactive
                        digital gamespaces that are created by students in my year-long,

                  <p>Both Acadia versions of enCore Xpress have been extensively customized
                        through a collaborative effort between myself and Jean-Marc Giffin.
                        Together, we have designed and implemented a few unique affordances that
                        distinguish Golgonooza 2.0 from other installations of enCore Xpress: our
                        modified version of enCore features a game design toolkit that uses a GUI to
                        allow the user to create a system of navigable, interconnected locations and
                        to populate those locations with objects and non-player character bots that
                        can “converse” with the player. Entrances and exits can be customized to
                        facilitate one-way travel, to defy the logic of compass-based navigation, or
                        to be invisible until players receive certain objects or information.
                        Objects, characters and locations can be customized and augmented through
                        textual descriptions, audio, images and video. NPCs (non-player characters)
                        can be static or programmed to wander on random or scripted paths throughout
                        the gameworld. Interactions with NPC’s are managed through conversation tree
                        scripts. Different scripts can be written for different interactions (based
                        on the player’s class or gender), and this scripting can be used to give
                        NPC’s “memories” of previous encounters with the player (Figure 1).</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>Golgonooza’s <title level="m">The Natural Daughter</title> game is not a
                        simple re-presentation of Robinson’s narrative or characters but is meant to
                        question critically the individualistic triumph promoted by the novel’s
                        overly optimistic conclusion and to raise questions about the tensions
                        between realism and idealism in literature of the period. In other words, it
                        builds upon the cultural critique begun but left unfinished in Robinson in
                        order to help students perceive in a more robust and visceral fashion how
                        late eighteenth-century social hierarchies and mores constrained
                        individuals. After reading and discussing Robinson’s novel over a few weeks
                        of class time, groups of two or three students log into the MOO environment
                        using a single user account. The members of each team collaboratively
                        contribute to their single character’s progress in a role-playing game that
                        positions them as a woman in late-eighteenth-century England. Students are
                        told that their goal is to become a “successful young woman.” This goal is
                        intentionally vague, and remains open for interpretation, allowing the
                        student teams to consider “success” in relation to the historical period
                        that is being represented, to the parameters modeled in Robinson’s book
                        (perseverance and ethical consistency against universal adversity), or to
                        twenty-first century notions of “success” (such as self-determination,
                        empowerment, independence, and equal opportunity). By collaboratively
                        controlling a single character’s movement and dialogue, each team of student
                        players are put in situations where they (playing as eighteenth-century
                        women) experience social life at Bath, the difficulties of married (or
                        single) life in rural and urban situations, and London’s opportunities and
                        temptations.</p>
                  <p>Importantly, each player character’s class and social status are randomized
                        variables that can change with each new playthrough. One’s class position
                        initially establishes a specific level (or deficit) of social freedom and
                        flexibility in the gameworld, and a player’s initial reputation (based on
                        such social stereotypes) generates different responses and opportunities (or
                        not) from other, non-player characters and the environment itself.
                        Reputation remains a variable throughout the experience, though, and can be
                        sullied or redeemed by one’s actions and choices while interacting with the
                        game’s selection of fickle characters. Players quickly learn that whatever
                        initial position they have in the gameworld as a result of their social
                        class is precarious and that any interaction within such unstable
                        environments can easily lead to a reduction, maintenance, or augmentation of
                        this reputation. Thus, like Martha, the protagonist in Robinson’s novel,
                        players often find themselves negotiating between individualistic ambitions
                        and selfish desires, as well as between social responsibilities and
                        co-operative sympathies. </p>
                  <p>What makes this experience more than just a participatory replay of the
                        book’s narrative is that players cannot succeed by twenty-first-century
                        standards, and, given that they are not allowed to replicate the success of
                        the novel’s idealistic conclusion, in which Martha’s individualistic
                        determination allows her to persevere through hyperbolic adversity and marry
                        the “right” man, they cannot succeed by Robinson’s Romantic standards
                        either. The “best” ending that a player can achieve is to be married to a
                        husband who provides financial stability but little emotional support. The
                        character becomes stuck in a type of limbo where she is faced with few
                        opportunities, growing ennui, and a husband who dismisses her as if she was
                        another one of his servants. This particular end in the game does not equal
                        freedom, but is the achievement of a sort of life-in-death that recalls the
                        personal Hell experienced by Coleridge’s ancient mariner (though the mariner
                        still possessed the poetic power to affect others and could still tell his
                        tale, whereas the players of this game are much more disabled). Achieving
                        such ends exposes student-players to circumstances that parallel the
                        experiences of women in late-eighteenth-century England: any accomplishment
                        is still circumscribed by the rules and inherent limitations of a largely
                        unsympathetic and restrictive system. Overall, then, this game encourages
                        students to performatively interrogate and problematize the kind of
                        individualistic strategy that Robinson’s protagonist chooses, but it also
                        raises questions about the nature and limits of interdependence in this
                        period. The game world and its rule systems are mechanical, unsympathetic,
                        and frustrating for the idealistic player, and limited choices masquerading
                        as freedom reveal the difficulty of choosing one’s own adventure in a
                        consequential universe.</p>
                  <p>This circumscribed setup allows students to empathize with the cultural
                        milieu in which Martha operates, as well as to consider the broader
                        emotional aims of narrative itself. Given that most commercially available
                        digital games cater to the pleasure of the player (and consumer), students
                        familiar with this storytelling medium will be surprised that this example
                        takes an antagonistic position toward the player’s success. Yet, this
                        frustration is instructive, as it teaches greater awareness of both the
                        cultural limitations within Romantic-era society and of the amelioration
                        afforded by narrative, both then and now. This game enacts Katie Salen’s and
                        Eric Zimmerman’s useful definition of “play” (“free movement within a more
                        rigid structure” (304)) quite literally, demonstrating in its story and in
                        its mechanics that: <list type="ordered">
                        <item> Limited flexibility is not freedom.</item>
                        <item>The player, like a reader, is not authoritative, despite the
                                deceptive appearance of agency and choice within game systems. </item>
                        <item>Digital games can be used for social, political and psychological
                                confrontations as well as for escape. </item>
                     </list> This experience also presents a challenge to and rejection of the
                        often solitary nature of gameplay, scholarship, and the privacy of
                        traditional readership by asking a group of students to be responsible for a
                        single avatar’s progress. Team-based play continually engages players in
                        dialogue, collaboration, and co-operation as they work through individual
                        differences for the good of their single player-character. </p>
                  <p>In the last four years of using this game in my undergraduate Romantic-period
                        literature classroom, I have found that students still have “fun” with this
                        game (and here I rely on Raph Koster’s definition of “fun” as the opposite
                        of boring (42)), but are not satisfied with the experience due to their
                        unrealistic expectations for success generated by Robinson’s novel. This
                        attests to the effectiveness of game-based pedagogy, as the purpose behind
                        the creation and implementation of these game experiences is not to
                        entertain the students, but to facilitate a memorable learning experience by
                        generating a dissonance between expectation and experience in a supportive
                        classroom environment. Postmortem discussions with students have resulted in
                        excellent opportunities to comparatively examine the social function of the
                        novel in the Romantic period. For example, the idealism and sentimentalism
                        that problematize Robinson’s proto-feminist narrative are exposed and
                        questioned though the contrasting pessimism built into the game’s world. The
                        fact that both novel and game explore the relationship between independent
                        motivations and intentions enacted within interdependent environments
                        creates an important thematic link, which fuels classroom discussions. The
                        key here is that student-players encounter and critically examine Robinson’s
                        novel through traditional classroom lectures, discussions and debates, but
                            <emph>also</emph> augment and enrich such experience by performatively
                        negotiating with and metacritically engaging with Robinson’s ideas within a
                        multiplayer gamespace. Making use of simulated experiences and follow-up
                        discussions about those experiences fosters extended learning opportunities
                        that supplement the existing opportunities that come from a critical reading
                        of the novel. Any dissatisfaction and reluctance that might accompany the
                        use of the technology, amplified by the game’s inherent difficulty, creates
                        an overall environment of frustration, an arena in which players are brought
                        closer to an understanding not only of women’s growing dissatisfaction
                        during this period of burgeoning individualism in British history, but also
                        of the philosophical, psychological and social paradoxes that reside at the
                        heart of the period’s uncertain cultural expressions.</p>

                  <head>Endgame: Playing with Fiction</head>
                  <p>Games are not “ethics-free” environments. Like novels, they are virtual
                        spaces in which human beings are exposed to the consequences of action and
                        conflict within larger social, political, and economic systems. Games allow
                        readers to become players, which generates the potential for sympathetic
                        understanding, empathetic engagement, and a chance to experience the ways
                        that an environment is impacted by their choices in the safe, non-fatal
                        frame of a classroom activity. This interactive narrative challenges the
                        period’s fiction and the students’ perceptions of that fiction within
                        equally fictional environments. It engages students in thoughtful play that
                        lifts the painted veil from romantic mediations via a game-based
                            <foreign>mise en abyme</foreign> that exposes the limits of fictionally
                        constructed expectation and places the player in a persistent tension
                        between independent and interdependent action that is not achieved through
                        reading alone. In contrast to the idea that digital games promote
                        thoughtless reflex and complicity within pre-rendered systems, it is
                        possible to use such environments to generate an essential lucidity and
                        experiential unease that catalyzes <emph>thought-full</emph> awareness and
                        critical reflections. Questioning the limits and opportunities of fictions
                        and mediating structures from within such fictions and structures is the
                        ultimate aim of such play. </p>
                  <p>It could be argued that one does not need to appeal to technology to achieve
                        such pedagogical ends. Traditional group work, staged debates, role-playing
                        exercises and even custom-developed tabletop games could all be harnessed to
                        produce a similar effect. This is certainly true, but my overall point is
                        that the <title level="m">Natural Daughter</title> MOO game has generated
                        useful in-class discussions regarding general ideas, such as comparing the
                        technological aspects of book-based and computer-based storytelling and the
                        position and power of readers versus players. More specifically, though,
                        this experience never fails to catalyze engaging discussions that apply
                        Romantic-period contexts to students’ understanding of themselves and their
                        contemporary experiences. In addition to a heated debate about the way that
                        eighteenth-century novels and twenty-first-century digital games have both
                        been accused of individually isolating and socially networking their
                        audiences, I have also witnessed a lengthy classroom discussion regarding
                        the parallels between the way that inventive and innovative experimentation
                        in the Romantic period diversified the creative landscape but led to
                        tensions between imagination and nostalgia, and the ways that revolutionary
                        transitions in our current media landscape interrupt our habits and generate
                        similar reactions. However, the most important learning opportunity that
                        emerges from utilizing such digital gamespaces in the Romantics classroom
                        appears when student players are asked to become builders within the MOO
                        environment.</p>

                  <head>Programmers: Extending collaborative creativity from players to
                        builders</head>
                  <p>In my year-long undergraduate Romantics course, the use of the MOO platform
                        is extended towards a completely different end in the second term: it
                        becomes an environment in which students complete a group assignment that
                        asks them to collaboratively build a persuasive, rhetorically argumentative
                        gamespace related to specific course readings. To turn students from readers
                        (consumers) to players (participants) to builders (creators) is to empower
                        them and to promote an understanding of the ways that media can shape
                        understanding and action. This project is a twenty-first-century extension
                        of the revolutionary kinds of media-based awareness and agency that creators
                        and consumers were experiencing in the Romantic period.</p>
                  <p>To make room for this project in the syllabus, I replace two essay
                        assignments (out of the six that I normally assign) with a digital game
                        development project in which students collaboratively design and build
                        non-linear, interactive narrative gamespaces within the MOO using a simple
                        but robust GUI (Graphical User Interface) developer toolkit. This is
                        beneficial because it introduces students to programming structures through
                        the customization of branching story opportunities and the population of a
                        virtual environment with scripted NPC conversation “bots,” and objects, but
                        does not require them to learn a programming language to accomplish this. By
                        simplifying the tools available to students through the use of a GUI, I can
                        expose them to modding and customizing practices that involve branching
                        narrative scripts without bottlenecking their potential to deliver a rich,
                        collaborative result (see figures 2 and 3).</p>

                  <p>The normal vehicle for student work and evaluation in undergraduate
                        humanities courses is—of course—the rhetorical essay. While this is a
                        tried-and-true method of critical expression, and one that I continue to use
                        in my Romantics classes, the essay is only one form of argumentative
                        communication, and students—unfortunately—learn to take the form for granted
                        at the same time as they become more proficient at adapting their ideas to
                        its formal constraints. Moreover, the essay format offers a time-limited
                        value, as many students will enter a workplace that requires them to
                        communicate in multimedia formats. Our increasingly diverse media landscape,
                        amplified by the accessibility of digital technologies, has established an
                        urgent educational need for multiple and integrated media literacies,
                        transmedia awareness, and a working, hands-on knowledge of comparative media
                        and cultural studies ideas and practices. Although consuming and thinking
                        about class material is important, the productive and creative energies
                        generated in response to such material should not have to be exclusively
                        limited to traditional paradigms. Although the novelty of inserting a game
                        development process into an upper-level undergraduate course disconcerts
                        many students who feel that they have already mastered the algorithms at the
                        heart of undergraduate assignments, it is in essence a refreshing
                        opportunity for students to reconsider exactly what an essay does and how it
                        accomplishes its persuasive argumentation in comparison to a playable space
                        in which players need to be directed toward an acceptance of the same ideas
                        as essay readers.</p>
                  <p> At the beginning of January, students receive the project briefing and the
                        required development timeline (see figure 4).</p>

                  <p>Early on, students are reminded that “Your players will not be playing a game
                        based on a poem, play, or novel, but will progress through an experiential
                        architecture that performatively exposes them to an argument relating to
                        that literary work.” In other words, these games possess the same
                        argumentative function as a traditional essay, but students need to import
                        and adapt familiar forms and functions of rhetorical communication to a
                        radically different environment. While part of rhetorical writing is to
                        encourage one’s reader to keep reading, and while the act of reading implies
                        at least a willingness to engage with the author’s ideas, the reading
                        process is not as participatory (or as potentially powerful) as a player’s
                        progress: whereas readers (in most cases) simply watch the author build a
                        rhetorically sound argumentative structure and populate it with proof,
                        players are asked to build the structure and gather the proof themselves, as
                        directed by the game designer. Such participatory preconditions offer an
                        advantage to game designers who are trying to encourage certain actions,
                        behaviors, or beliefs in their players. As a result, games have the
                        potential to be an extremely effective rhetorical medium: staging a
                        convincing argument by leading a player through an active and concrete
                        construction process, rather than—as is often done in essay
                        writing—abstractly narrating such construction to a largely passive but
                        still critical observer. </p>
                  <p>The grading rubric for this assignment calls attention to tensions and
                        reconciliations between independent and interdependent work, expanding the
                        thematic explorations from the gameplay that students experienced in the
                        first term by putting students in situations where they must accommodate
                        their individual differences to a collaborative working environment.
                        Individual student assessment is based on a combination of individual
                        contributions and group grades. This approach is specifically designed so
                        that students must depend equally on their own abilities and their group’s
                        performance (preventing an over-reliance on either). Productively, it allows
                        students who might feel restrained by their group’s performance to augment
                        such shortcomings by asserting their individual abilities, and conversely
                        allows students who might lack such individual genius to assert their
                        competency in group-related activities. In this way, collaboration,
                        co-operation, and selfless reliance are fundamentally encouraged by this
                        project: no one student could possibly complete the requirements on their
                        own, so groups are responsible for self-organization and the delegation and
                        management of roles and responsibilities (with guidance and mentorship from
                        me during the process). Over the four years of incorporating this into my
                        curriculum, I have discovered that letting go of individual control is very
                        difficult for some of these students, as many have never been exposed to
                        substantial collaborative, graded work at the university level. Actively
                        confronting complexities together through building and making things (rather
                        than just reacting to already-built things) while avoiding reductive and
                        idealistic activities performatively reinforces the model of creative and
                        critical networking at the heart of Romantic-period invention.</p>
                  <p>This assignment in which players become part of a community of builders who
                        collaboratively work towards the same goal involves individualistic
                        capabilities in a co-operative sphere, performatively engaging students in a
                        synthesis of independent thinking and interdependent practice. In this way,
                        students are more directly exposed to the opportunities and difficulties
                        that arose during Romantic period collaborations fuelled by independent
                        energies, such as the invention of the <title level="m">Lyrical
                            Ballads</title> or the creation of the French <title level="m">Declaration of The Rights of Man and of the Citizen.</title> Such an
                        experience does not just provide students with a chance to learn about the
                        connection between independence and interdependence during this historical
                        period; it <emph>involves</emph> them in experiential situations (as
                        players/classroom citizens and as builders/authors) that allow them to more
                        directly understand the intersections between collaborative challenges and
                        individual inspirations experienced by Romantic period writers.</p>

                  <head>Extensions: Golgonooza will never be finished</head>
                  <p>In the first year that I introduced gameplay to the class, student groups
                        could choose to focus on creating a critical interpretative argument
                        relating to Byron’s “Manfred,” Jane Austen’s <title level="m">Northanger
                            Abbey</title>, or Coleridge’s “Kubla Khan” or “The Rime of the Ancient
                        Mariner.” Notably, the “Kubla Khan” group used their gamespace to question
                        Coleridge’s imaginative theories and visions through unsettling situations
                        and unpredictable NPCs while still allowing the player to indulge in them.
                        Their game expanded on and also offered a critical perception of “Kubla
                        Khan”’s thematic possibilities, its drug-fuelled origins, and its
                        fragmentary nature. While certain groups and individuals performed more
                        strongly and effectively in this assignment’s first iteration, all students
                        were able to bring individual strengths to bear on their collaborative
                        creations, resulting in richly realized environments, characters, and
                        narratives.</p>
                  <p>In an effort to create an opportunity for idea exchanges between groups (not
                        just within them), the second year of this assignment’s implementation
                        focused on a single author. I asked students to select one of Keats’s 1819
                        odes and to create a persuasive gamespace that allowed the player
                        performatively to engage with a critical argument made by the design group
                        about their chosen ode. Additionally (unlike the previous year’s
                        selections), the odes that students chose for their projects were not part
                        of the course curriculum and were not taught or discussed in class, thus
                        offering the students a greater level of independence in the interpretative
                        process. </p>
                  <p>During the 2012-2013 academic year and inspired by the conference version of
                        this paper presented at NASSR 2011, I further refined the assignment beyond
                        a focus on individual literary works, asking student groups to establish an
                        argument in gamespace that asserted a conclusive thesis about the thematic
                        tensions between independence and interdependence in Romantic-period
                        writing, choosing literary examples from the course syllabus. Unifying all
                        of the student groups under this thematic banner allowed for a post-mortem
                        that related more specifically to the larger course themes and also allowed
                        students to draw from on their own experience during the assignment’s
                        creation and completion to inform their in-game argument. </p>
                  <p>Last year, I drew from class discussions that questioned the absence of
                        specifically targeted “duties” and responsibilities within the National
                        Assembly of France’s 1789 <title level="m">Declaration of the Rights of Man
                            and of the Citizen</title> by asking students to create a game-based
                        argument that explored the tension between rights and duties during the
                        Romantic period. This year, I have asked students to extend the debate
                        between Thomas Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, William Godwin, and Edmund Burke
                        relating to the distinction between people and principles. After this year’s
                        work is complete, the Golgonooza 2.0 MOO will host five years’ worth of
                        student projects. Unlike essay assignments that generally trace a single
                        line of communication between professor and student in a very specific and
                        limited temporal frame, all of the student work in the MOO remains archived
                        and publically accessible.</p>

                  <p>Some students vehemently oppose the nature of this assignment, as well as the
                        requirement that they work in groups (thus subjecting their course grades to
                        the influence of variable group dynamics). During the first year’s
                        assignment one student, who consistently refused to work as a member of a
                        team, complained to my Department Chair that this non-traditional assignment
                        was threatening to disrupt his accrued GPA and was not why he was taking
                        English literature courses. During the second year of the assignment,
                        another student decided to disappear for the duration of the project, but
                        continued to log into the gamespace toolkit and re-design (or vandalize) his
                        teammates’ efforts with ideas that he had not discussed with his group. This
                        vandalism became so disruptive that I removed him from the team, and he
                        dropped the course soon after. These extreme reactions are exceptions, but
                        are also a reminder that issues relating to collaboration in creative and
                        social contexts during the Romantic period remain relevant to young,
                        creative minds in the twenty-first century. The MOO and the assignments
                        constructed around the use of such a gamespace allow students to become
                        performatively involved in the thematic issues that they are studying. Their
                        varying reactions (excitement, curiosity, resistance, and discomfort) to new
                        experiences near the end of an undergraduate career resist the abstraction
                        and depersonalization at the heart of much academic work while at the same
                        time allowing them to experience collaboration before confronting it in a
                        professional setting post graduation. </p>
                  <p>Student feedback has convinced me of the overall value and necessity of this
                        sort of experience for the Romanticism classroom. Without fail, all
                        participants (even those who enjoy game-based narratives) chronicle an
                        initial discomfort related to the unfamiliar nature of the assignment and
                        technology that is slowly replaced by engagement with their group and
                        project. Since university learning should be safe yet uncomfortable (as
                        student comfort indicates that education is merely reinforcing their
                        accepted and habitual subject position rather than challenging it), it
                        appears that working in groups is a necessary, supportive, and helpful
                        antidote to students’ individual discomfort. While some students—such as
                        those mentioned in the above paragraph—consistently have problems with
                        giving up total control of the assignment to others, most students express a
                        significant amount of satisfaction with the process, the product, and the
                        way that this world-building exercise resonates with Romantic-period
                        preoccupations and projects. One student commented that the unique nature of
                        this project “shook up the university slump” she felt that she had been in
                        during the final years of her program and was thankful that it allowed her
                        to express herself “in a different way.” This cleansing of blunted
                        perceptions via unsettling and unfamiliar situations that call for
                        revolutionary and imaginative processes exposes students to the ways and
                        means that a number of Romantic period “builders” creatively reacted to the
                        tumultuous here and now of England in the late eighteenth century.</p>

                  <head>Technological Obsolescence: Game Over?</head>
                  <p>Many instructors who are reluctant to integrate digital apparatuses into
                        their pedagogical toolkit cite the short-lived nature of hardware, software,
                        and compatibility. Investing a considerable amount of time in the
                        development of a tool or exercise, only to discover that it is incompatible
                        with many students’ machines within a few years of implementation,
                        understandably discourages enthusiastic innovation. However, this risk is
                        worth taking, as using writing to reflect on writing can easily become an
                        insular and uncritical process. As Jerome McGann suggests in <title level="m">Radiant Textuality: Literature After the World Wide
                            Web</title> (2004), “We no longer have to use books to study other books
                        or texts” (168). The enCore Xpress platform was selected for flexibility and
                        longevity, given its web-based delivery and its relative stability as a
                        database, and our modified versions have successfully been migrated across
                        servers at Acadia during infrastructure reconfigurations. Nonetheless, the
                        MOO is no Grecian Urn—the “chat” frame of the webpage that the MOO generates
                        relies on Java, which is becoming less common and thus less supported (and
                        usually blocked by default) by most web browsers. As a result, students have
                        had increasing technical difficulties using the MOO platform on their laptop
                        computers over the past two years. Most of the time these issues can be
                        solved by adding exceptions for certain websites within the Java
                        configuration program and within particular browsers. </p>
                  <p> While rapid obsolescence is a constant problem for digital tools and
                        resources, there are potential ways to work around this problem. We are
                        currently looking into ways either to convert the MOO's Java-based frame
                        into HTML, or—in the worst case scenario—to create a Virtual Machine
                        “wrapper” (that is, to allow students to easily boot and run an older
                        version of Linux with better compatibility with Java on their computers as a
                        virtual machine). However, it is likely that the MOO will soon need to be
                        retired and replaced. The crucial thing is not to abandon the ideas and
                        methods that the technology enables. Unlike the now-defunct <title level="m">Villa Diodati</title> MOO that has fallen into inaccessible ruins, with
                        only its vast and trunkless introductory page standing as a reminder that
                        there was ever something there, Golgonooza will never truly be a ghost town:
                        it will continue to be an activated complex, an organic archive of the
                        fruits of exceptional student motivation and imagination and a valuable
                        record of a learning process that will continue to grow until more effective
                        alternatives emerge. One possible extension of this idea beyond the computer
                        screen and classroom walls that I am currently exploring is open source
                        game-based narrative platforms for mobile devices that work by tethering
                        game content to actual geographies in an augmented reality layer. When such
                        alternatives become feasible, and as computer hardware, software and
                        networks continue to evolve, I will continue to ensure that both versions of
                        the Golgonooza MOO remain archived and accessible to the broader scholarly
                        community. </p>

                  <head>Revolutionary returns: Teaching nightingales to harmonize and
                        socialize</head>
                  <p>Attempting to engage students with the complexities, advantages, and
                        difficulties faced by the intersection of independent and interdependent
                        approaches to creativity, communication, and action during the Romantic
                        period is not an easy task. Showing and telling methods are easy, but they
                        leave learners disconnected from the ideas that are presented to them.
                        Exposing them to historical contexts and thematic intricacies via
                        interactive, participatory learning environments offers a uniquely involved
                        opportunity—akin to a humanities “lab” space where controlled
                        experimentation and exploration can take place. Making use of this
                        technology for the specific assignments mentioned above has an additional
                        benefit: students learn to innovate, create, share, and play together and
                        are thus professionalized for a collaborative career. Involving them in
                        team-based work that respects individual differences demonstrates an
                        integrative approach to such apparent opposition without watering down the
                        difficulty associated with both poles. These examples of
                        technologically-enabled pedagogy ask students to be less “romantic” about
                        the Romantic period and to recognise the interplay and tension between
                        individual genius/independence and collaborative practice/interdependency at
                        the heart of the lives and texts of the period’s authors.</p>
                  <p>Finally, to get students to reflect on the nature of the academic essay and
                        argument by exposing them to an unfamiliar variation of this process is an
                        invaluable lesson to learn in the latter years of an undergraduate
                        education, when many of the paradigms of higher education have become
                        habitual and naturalised. In doing so, students are able to reconsider the
                        essay’s form and function, perceive its limitations and advantages, and
                        better understand their authorial, critical roles in relation to the
                        abilities of their readers. If my goal as an educator is to mentor students
                        toward a thoughtful, perceptive, and critical lucidity regarding literary
                        expression, communication, creativity, cultural production, and critical
                        dialogue, then—whether or not students emerge from this experience hating
                        the assignments (in which case an appreciation for the strengths of the
                        essay form is renewed) or loving this alternative to essay argumentation (in
                        which case an awareness of the limitations of the essay form is
                        revealed)—the careful use of these gamespaces in the university-level
                        classroom allows me to reach these goals, confront the challenges associated
                        with effective teaching and specific course material, and “win” the
                        pedagogical game by encouraging individual student players to level-up and
                        become lucid, collaborative builders in the spirit of the Romantic period
                        authors that they study. </p>

               <p rend="noCount"> The following essay replays a close-reading, word-by-word
                    in-class exercise of <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>'s opening
                    sentence: "It is a truth universally acknowledged that single men in possession
                    of good fortunate must be in want of a wife." In our close reading students and
                    I explore how, in Austen's hands, her famed use of free indirect discourse and
                    irony deflate transcendental assumptions about gender and class. With this
                    deflationary gesture, Austen’s turning of these tropes allows us to see, in
                    turn, how her work connects to the biopolitical imperative to extend the
                    lifespan of the human species that Foucault sees emerging in the eighteenth
                    century. On our reading, though, irony, as developed by Austen, provides a
                    powerful tool for questioning such an imperative in our own time of planetary
                    peril. </p>

               <p>Jane Austen’s <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> (1813) begins with
                    what sounds like a fairly straightforward aphorism: “It is a truth universally
                    acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want
                    of a wife” (Austen 1). This essay discusses how a word-by-word, in-class close
                    reading of this first sentence unfolds historical and formal problems of
                    Romanticism. In our close reading, students and I attend to the opposition of
                    the universal to the particular in the sentence by thinking about how Austen
                    theorizes irony.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Two recent editions offer a
                        variety of different approaches and resources to teaching Austen. See
                        Bridget Draxler’s, Misty Krueger’s, and Susan Allen Ford’s collection and
                        another Romantic Circles Pedagogy Commons volume, “Teaching Jane Austen,”
                        edited by Devoney Looser and Emily C. Friedman. Daniel R. Mangiavellano’s
                        essay features a different, illuminating classroom reading of the first
                        sentence, as well as several other scenes in the novel, as well as
                        illustrating how these exercises aid students in developing their own
                        writing. </note> Analyzing this opposition through Austen’s formal
                    experimentation, in turn, allows us to see, and question, the gender and class
                    distinctions and constructions of the era. This close reading exercise thus
                    functions as a hermeneutic for our further discussion of the whole novel and of
                    the Romantic period.</p>
               <p>As all readers of Austen know, the sentence invites our scrutiny since it
                    welcomes us into the novel by setting up irony as the dominant mode of what will
                    follow even as it quickly displaces us outside the sentence’s sweeping
                    universalism when the following sentences immediately deposit us into a
                    fully-imagined world: <quote>
                     <lg>
                        <l> However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on
                                his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in
                                the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the
                                rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</l>
                        <l rendition="#indent1"> "My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one
                                day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"</l>
                        <l> Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</l>
                        <l rendition="#indent1"> "But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has
                                just been here, and she told me all about it."</l>
                        <l> Mr. Bennet made no answer.</l>
                        <l rendition="#indent1"> "Do you not want to know who has taken it?"
                                cried his wife impatiently.</l>
                        <l rendition="#indent1"> "<emph>You</emph> want to tell me, and I have

                        <l rendition="#indent1"> "Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says
                                that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the
                                north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four
                                to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed
                                with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before
                                Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the
                                end of next week." (1)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> We move, from one moment to the next, away from the
                    above-it-all, God’s-eye-view, aphoristic generalization of the first sentence to
                    a particular, and highly particularized, neighborhood with certain families
                    claiming the first sentence’s abstract single men for their daughters. That the
                    first sentence appears to offer something of a thesis statement regarding what
                    will unfold in the novel is suddenly rendered questionable in regards to its
                    actual thetic status when the second sentence expands outward and downward, as
                    we are both literally “entering a neighbourhood” and entering into the concerns
                    of “surrounding families”—here, the Netherfielders’ wish to marry off their
                    daughters. Rather than truly contextualizing the major thematic of the book,
                    then, the first sentence instead seems to act as a challenge to the book because
                    of its floating, almost detached, nature, as if it is asking whether or not the
                    book can truly prove this pronouncement’s veracity. Given this strange
                    divergence between the first sentence and the rest of the novel, the
                    sentence—more so than, say, the ones that follow it—demands parsing. Moreover,
                    the sentence complicates not only how to read the novel but how to read in
                    general, since understanding how and what the sentence means will in turn direct
                    how we understand how to read the novel. In other words, this sentence is not
                    simply challenging because of what it means for the novel but for the ways in
                    which it defies readers’ expectations and hence questions how fiction, and thus
                    reading in general, works. Ultimately, this type of self-reflexive questioning
                    is, as we see in class, an exemplary instance of Romantic irony that helps
                    elucidate how Romantic formalism generates questions about the way, to borrow
                    from Trollope, we live now. </p>
               <p>This famous sentence has been much discussed in Jane Austen scholarship, an
                    indication not only of the forceful first impression its aphoristic energy
                    leaves on the reader but also its interpretive permeability and potentiality. In
                    a collection on teaching Jane Austen’s <title level="m">Pride and
                        Prejudice</title>, Kenneth L. Moler discusses examining in his classes the
                    sentence’s allusions to Enlightenment thinkers George Berkeley, David Hume, and
                    Adam Smith, an exercise meant to provide historical and intellectual context for
                    the students.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Moler: “By the time a class is
                        ready to start on the topic of literary allusion in <title level="m">Pride
                            and Prejudice</title>, we have had a good deal to say about the famous
                        opening sentence and its incisive irony. I show that ‘it is a truth
                        universally acknowledged,’ with slight variations is a formula often used in
                        eighteenth-century philosophical discourses, to introduce the first premise
                        of an argument. I quote passages from Berkeley, Hume, and Adam Smith in
                        which the same or similar forms of words are used. (When general rules…are
                        universally acknowledged…we frequently appeal to them as to the standards of
                        judgment, as Smith writes….). It is then possible to see that, amusing as
                        the passage is to us as twentieth-century readers, its effect of ironic
                        deflation would be even funnier to an audience that would associate the
                        first phrase with works like Berkeley’s <title level="m">Principles of Human
                            Knowledge</title> or Hume’s <title level="m">Treatise of Human
                            Nature</title> (89). For more on Austen’s connection to Enlightenment
                        thinkers, see Peter Knox-Shaw’s <title level="m">Jane Austen and the
                            Enlightenment</title> (2009).</note> Similarly, Felicia Bonaparte reads
                    Austen as drawing on Hume’s empiricist skepticism in the novel’s underlying
                    epistemology. In Bonaparte’s view, objective reality does exist for Austen, even
                    though it is never completely knowable since the possibility of wrongly
                    interpreting the world also exists. Proof of this, according to Bonaparte, is
                    that “the very circumstance that one text can yield two utterly different
                    readings plainly indicates that Austen knows how uncertain meanings can be”
                    (153). Edward O’Neill’s nimble article, “‘Found Wanting?’: Second Impressions of
                    a Famous First Sentence,” argues that the sentence turns on the twined meanings
                    of “want” as both “lack” and “desire” and the way that this entwinement threads
                    the plot of the novel by entangling the characters in both meanings at once (a
                    point taken up below). For William Galperin, the paradox of this sentence hinges
                    on the “world of possibility” hinted at by the probable certainty the sentence
                    foregrounds: if the truth must be acknowledged it means that “both men
                        <emph>and</emph> women […are…] the objects <emph>and agents</emph> of
                    cultural imperatives” and hence such truths are malleable to cultural
                    contestation and revision (125-126). William Deresiewicz, meanwhile, points out
                    that it is the only one of Austen’s novels that opens with an aphorism, or
                    rather, as he also points out, a mock aphorism, “for it is immediately intimated
                    that this ‘truth universally acknowledged’ is in fact nothing more than one of
                    the fixed opinions of the ‘neighborhood’ of ‘surrounding families’ amidst which
                    the novel’s action is to take place.” As he puts it later in the same article,
                    “what is presented in these first scenes is more than anything the story of a
                    community: of communal expectations, communal conventions, communal activities”
                    (503). For Galperin and Deresiewicz, in other words, the sentence decidedly
                    establishes cultural and communal meaning rather than the universality the word
                    choice and aphoristic nature of the sentence would seem to imply. Indeed, in the
                    course of teaching this sentence, as we’ll see below, I’ve discovered that the
                    either/or proposition of communally-forged agreement and universally-endowed
                    edict emerges from close reading analysis. </p>
               <p>However, for all the various readings of this sentence on offer, Claudia Brodsky
                    claims that “no critic, to my knowledge, has raised the immediate and pragmatic
                    question of what the sentence actually means” (621). While I by no means wish to
                    claim that this essay settles what the sentence means, it may partially address
                    this vexing problem, even as its main goal is to position the reading aporias of
                    this sentence as a propaedeutic to further pedagogical engagement and scholarly
                    reflection. In other words, what follows in this essay—a record of a classroom
                    collaborative explication—is by no means intended as definitive. Rather, I hope
                    it contributes to unsettling our notions about how the sentence creates meaning
                    while gesturing towards how the sentence functions as part of the whole novel
                    and, indeed, how it adds insight into understanding Romanticism broadly
                    understood. </p>
               <p>Brodsky also points out that <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> locates
                    within the Romantic period a paradoxical nexus: the so-called transition from
                    the romance genre and eighteenth-century sentimental fiction to a historical
                    realist fiction focused on particulars even as it is undergirded by the same
                    universal ahistorical tenets it purports to gainsay. According to Brodsky,
                    realist fiction, despite its protestations to the contrary, nevertheless relies
                    on a historical pretension that disguises its ahistorical elements by pretending
                    they do not exist, a feature which grants the fiction verisimilitude to stand as
                    a chronicle of people and events living in a particular place and time. In
                    teaching Romanticism, we grapple with a literature that reflects radical
                    reformations of how life is mimetically represented and empirically understood.
                    It follows then that just as literary representations of life change in the
                    period, so do, correspondingly, interpretive reading strategies. Therefore our
                    explication of the text seeks to act as a meta-commentary-in-action on how
                    Romantic-era irony, as exemplified in <title level="m">Pride and
                        Prejudice</title>’s first sentence, historically revises the way we read and
                    document the world and the people in it.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Readings of Austen’s irony are many. D. W. Harding’s influential reading of
                        Austen claims all of her works are ironic in that “her books are, as she
                        meant them to be, read and enjoyed by precisely the sort of people whom she
                        disliked; she is a literary classic of the society which attitudes like
                        hers, held widely enough, would undermine.” The first major study of
                        Austen’s handling of irony is Marvin Murdick’s, who claims that “Austen uses
                        irony to defend herself, to distance herself from taking any concrete
                        position on social, cultural, and political issues.” Robert Phiddian has a
                        more recent reading of irony in both Austen and the <title level="m">Harry
                            Potter </title>novels. </note> For students, the takeaway is that
                    fictional tropes like Romantic irony are not simply useful in discussing
                    literature but extend outward to the world around us. Consequently, I use this
                    assignment to push the notion that studying Romanticism is not just something we
                    do in a classroom setting but is one of the complex ways we understand and
                    negotiate the discursive cultural spheres that are our lives. </p>
               <p>In thinking about how teaching the sentence tells us something larger about
                    Romanticism’s discursive cultural capital and revolutionary roots, it might be
                    useful to think of the sentence as staging a face-off between Hegelian and
                    Marxist historicism. Marx, at least according to him, famously turned Hegel on
                    his head, inverting his upwardly ascendant historicism away from
                    world-historical <foreign>Geist</foreign> to the social world of capitalist
                    production and the workers who turn the levers and gears of industrialization.
                    “Doing” history, in Marx’s conception, requires pointing our analytical lenses
                    to the microscopic and microcosmic realities of individuals in a materialist
                    world composed of institutions we’ve created rather than steering toward the
                    macroscopic historical <foreign>telos</foreign> of Hegel. William Wordsworth and
                    Samuel Taylor Coleridge, inspired by the French Revolution’s promises of
                    political democratization and individual liberation, had, in their earlier
                        <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (1798), made a similar suggestion:
                    history takes place not at the level of universal abstraction but at the level
                    of individual lives, even if they are lives typically ignored by
                    historiographers in favor of the powerful. Because we as a class have discussed
                    these ideas before we ever get to our analysis of Austen’s first sentence, it
                    allows me to offer, as an initial proposition, that Austen’s first sentence
                    shows how Romanticism challenges top-down historicism with a bottom-up approach
                    that, while hardly Marxist or even proto-Marxist, will align more clearly with
                    Marxist history as well as, in her own time, Wordsworthian poetic praxis. The
                    study of this sentence can thus be seen to engage in a bit of hyperbole, as a
                    synecdochal representation of the idea that, with Austen and Romanticism, we
                    have in fact become modern if we define modernity as an episteme of both
                    individual and communal self-consciousness and self-awareness. </p>
               <p>As I mentioned above, the first sentence defies readers’ expectations, a move
                    that seems only appropriate given that the novel itself is about misreading
                    people—and in the crucial scene where Elizabeth receives Darcy’s letter, about
                    reading, misreading, and rereading a text—which means that <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>’s first sentence’s ironic posturing actually
                    teaches us the explicatory skills we need to read the book. This lesson occurs
                    in part because the weird distance that the sentence creates between itself and
                    the rest of the novel, even as it is an essential part of that novel, is a type
                    of irony wherein whatever the first sentence claims to be doing looks
                    retroactively suspicious. It is as if the first sentence remains atop its own
                    battlements besieged by, and defending itself from, the army of sentences
                    challenging it from the ground below. As such, the very act of reading the
                    novel, in turn, mirrors how irony works. Irony institutes a critical
                    self-consciousness of how we assert ourselves rhetorically and the novel is
                    about—among many other things—how we have to use irony in order to pass into the
                    sincerity of truth, beyond our first impressions (Austen’s original title for
                    the novel) and into a legible understanding we can adequately defend. Between
                    the first sentence and the second, the novel teaches us how to read it, just as
                    Elizabeth, by moving beyond her own ironic self-distancing and first
                    impressions, learns to read people and texts accurately (Darcy’s letter, Darcy
                    himself, Wickham). The exercise I describe below therefore aids in wrapping our
                    minds around the elusive nature of Romantic irony and the reading strategies it
                    affords our analytical abilities.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For accounts

               <p>This explicatory exercise has worked for me in several different classes,
                    although some of them are not explicitly classes on Romanticism. I have used it
                    in two different types of Writing about Literature courses at Loyola University
                    New Orleans. The Writing about Literature course was intended primarily for
                    sophomore-level students, but junior- and senior-level students often enrolled
                    as well due to the general university requirements that mandated all students
                    must take one Writing about Literature course. In these courses the <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice </title>example functioned mainly as a close
                    reading exercise. </p>
               <p>On the other hand, when I used this exercise in a class fully devoted to
                    Romanticism, more than simply helping us think about how Romantic irony works,
                    it also instanced how Romantic legacies continue to shape our world. The
                    Romantic period is, obviously, a time of radical literary experimentation
                    ranging from Charlotte Smith’s origination of the Gothic sonnet (1784) to
                    Blake’s thoroughgoing weirdness in his marriage of poetry and art (and heaven
                    and hell) to Wordsworth’s and Coleridge’s groundbreaking literary experiment,
                        <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, to Byron’s creation of a
                    novel-in-verse mock-heroic epic, <title level="m">Don Juan</title> (1819-1824).
                    Free indirect discourse, a key innovative feature of Austen’s style, places
                    Austen on this list of Romantic literary radicalization.<note place="foot" resp="editors">D.A. Miller offers a thorough exploration of Austen’s style
                        that argues free indirect discourse allows Austen to hide herself from her
                        novels. Regarding Austen’s style and the first sentence he notes: “whoever
                        wishes to illustrate Austen Style regularly gravitates toward the maxim,
                        assuming that the perfection of this Style is highest, most visible and
                        delectable, in bite-size form. Yet no sooner do we examine this practice of
                        exemplification at any of its numerous sites…than we notice that it
                        apparently suffers from a <emph>dearth of good examples</emph>. How else to
                        explain why, so often, there seems to be only one such example: the first
                        sentence of <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>…” (40).</note> As
                    is well known, free indirect discourse combines third-person and first-person
                    narrative technique so that the omniscient narrator sometimes seems to be
                    speaking for the characters while the characters themselves sometimes appear to
                    adopt the narrator’s voice to speak as an “I.” This narrative chiasmus makes the
                    first sentence all the more confounding. To return to the earlier martial
                    metaphor, from its battlement, the first sentence surveys the novel it sits
                    atop. However, given the way free indirect discourse crosshatches first- and
                    third-person voices, the idea of division, of battle lines drawn up, ready to
                    face off, suddenly seems both facile and newly complicated, as two voices issue
                    forth from one mouth (to mix several metaphors). The interstices of this
                    chiasmus, this narrative and stylistic chimera, produce Austen’s irony because
                    the impersonal voice of the first sentence gains its fully robust ironic energy
                    only in contrast to, and in tandem with, the very personal voices present in the
                    novel. Austen’s irony is thereby stylistically undergirded by the same thematic
                    conflict between the universal and the particular that the first sentence—in
                    part through the emergence of the irony that emerges from this stylistic
                    paradox—suggests the novel will labor to resolve. </p>
               <p>In all of these courses, to begin the exercise I ask students to explicate, for
                    ten minutes overall, each word in Austen’s sentence. Because I stress writing as
                    a learned skill that requires actually engaging in a variety of different types
                    of writing—brainstorming, discovery, note-taking, sketching, rough drafting—they
                    do not simply list random thoughts but write about each word in explicatory
                    paragraph style which requires thinking through nuanced connotations and
                    denotations. This in-class activity fosters our subsequent group discussion by
                    creating concrete definitional and conceptual examples with which to work.
                    Typically, I assign this exercise midway through the semester (somewhere between
                    weeks seven and nine) so that, by that point, students and I will have discussed
                    what “explication” means and how to write one. Indeed, students have already
                    written one paper (three and a half to four pages) exclusively devoted to
                    explicating one passage from a previous text. The <title level="m">Pride and
                        Prejudice</title> exercise, then, is designed to supplement and expand on
                    earlier explication discussions and assignments and to do so by providing an
                    actual example of close reading in action.</p>
               <p>I sometimes use the following literary example to illustrate what I wish students
                    to focus on in close reading. In Dorothy L. Sayers’ <title level="m">Busman’s
                        Honeymoon</title> (1937), Lord Peter Wimsey, aristocratic sleuth and
                    “new-wedded lord,” finds a corpse in the cellar of his rural honeymoon home.
                    During the course of their investigation of the murder, Wimsey details his
                    detective methodology to his wife, Harriet Vane: <quote>"You can have no idea,"
                        said Peter, irrelevantly, "how refreshing it is to talk to somebody who has
                        a grasp of method. The police are excellent fellows, but the only principle
                        of detection they have really grasped is that wretched phrase, <foreign>Cui
                            bono</foreign>? They <emph>will</emph> hare off after motive, which is a
                        matter for psychologists. Juries are just the same. If they can see a motive
                        they tend to convict, however often the judge may tell them that there's no
                        need to prove motive, and that motive by itself will never make a case.
                        You've got to show how the thing was done, and then, if you like, bring in
                        motive to back up your proof. If a thing could only have been done one way,
                        and if only one person could have done it that way, then you've got your
                        criminal, motive or no motive. There's How, When, Where, Why and Who—and
                        when you've got How, you've got Who. Thus spake Zarathustra." (232)</quote>
                    I find adopting this methodology helpful in discussing Jane Austen, but in
                    modified form: when you’ve got “How,” you’ve got “What.” Or, to rephrase it:
                    when you know <emph>how</emph> a text works then you know <emph>what</emph> it
                    means. In questing for textual meanings, we seek not just the destinations, a
                    bunch of Xs that mark the spots, but the various journeys that get us to those
                    meanings. Just as you cannot convict a criminal without a <foreign>corpus
                        delicti</foreign>, you cannot assert a persuasive account of what a text
                    means without a logical chain of textual evidence that demonstrates how the
                    crime—in this metaphor the sentence is the murder—was committed. Or so I tell my
                    students. (Wimsey’s assertion of course contradicts mine as he says you can
                    convict without this empirical evidence—but, then again, that’s precisely what
                    I’m trying to get students not to do.) </p>
               <p>In this way I use the exercise to showcase what I call “being a reader.” As I’m
                    sure many teachers are aware, students often think there is a solution to a
                    text, some type of roadmap they need to be given in order to follow and arrive
                    at the final destination of the text’s “true” meaning, a definitive path to a
                    true definition. “Being a reader,” I stress, entails approaching the study of
                    Romanticism and literature in general as an interpretive, productive endeavor
                    (in fact this is an important lesson deriving from Percy Bysshe Shelley’s <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title>, discussed below). I try to show,
                    through empirical and democratic writing and conversational exercises like this
                    one, how literary tropes and texts <emph>work</emph> to produce meanings as
                    opposed to many students’ initial inclination to cursorily gloss, or paraphrase,
                    a text’s meaning. Setting myself up as a reader, or interpreter, of literature,
                    just like they are, helps students to see not only the difference between
                    understanding a text’s meaning and interpreting a text <emph>for</emph> multiple
                    meanings, but also the value of interpretation, key to entering into formal
                    literary discourse. At the same time, as in the prosecutorial metaphor above,
                    there are multiple readings of a text that one can produce, but each reading
                    must be backed up with a persuasive chain of textual evidence in order to
                    convince anyone. Here, however, the prosecutorial metaphor falls apart since,
                    presumably, there can only be a guilty or not guilty verdict in a criminal
                    trial—and this verdict is either correct or incorrect—whereas there can be
                    several convincing and competing interpretations of a given text. So rather than
                    claim absolute matter-of-fact status for our interpretation, this exercise
                    illustrates the multiplicity of meanings in <title level="m">Pride and
                        Prejudice</title>’s opening sentence, allowing students to hear different
                    interpretations and progress the class forward from my telling them about
                    interpretive reading strategies to showing them interpretation in action. </p>
               <p>The short writing assignment we begin with primes our class discussion. After
                    they have finished writing, we then proceed word by word, to explore the
                    nuances, implications, and even the digressions that arise during this
                    procession through the sentence. Accordingly, the rest of this essay will follow
                    a similar pattern for several paragraphs, addressing each word in turn before
                    pivoting to a broader thematic analysis of the sentence’s interconnectivity
                    while making some preliminary suggestions as to how this reading speaks to the
                    novel as a whole. And although this pedagogical exercise’s emphasis on close
                    reading might seem to agree with Raymond Williams’s remark that “it is a truth
                    universally acknowledged, that Jane Austen chose to ignore the decisive
                    historical events of her time,” students and I disagree (113). Peeling back
                    layers, as it does, our reading addresses, slowly, with each piece of oxidized
                    skin, the gender and economic implications of the novel, implications we spend
                    even more time addressing in later class discussions than I describe here.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Many scholars have addressed gender in Austen.
                        Some of the more well-known are: Mary Poovey; Claudia L. Johnson; Susan
                        Fraiman; Clara Tuite; Gilbert and Gubar.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The first word, “it,” usually proves easy enough for students, who define it as a
                    neuter pronoun in need of a referent. This is fair enough out of context, but,
                    “it” quickly becomes more complicated as the full context of the sentence
                    unravels. That is to say, depending on how one understands the first and second
                    clause of the sentence, “it” can vary as to not only <emph>what</emph> it refers
                    to, but also in <emph>how</emph> it refers to it—a point that we will “unfold”
                    or “unroll” (from the Latin <foreign>explicare</foreign>), as I tell my
                    students, as the discussion progresses.  </p>
               <p>As President Bill Clinton famously claimed, much depends on what the definition
                    of “is” is. “Is” is, most obviously, the most ubiquitous verb in the English
                    language and the one that for students proves the most intractable to concrete
                    definition. The superficially simple question, “What does ‘is’ mean?” genuinely
                    baffles. For students, the verb’s meaning seems self-evident. Hence, they
                    typically offer variations on “it just means ‘here’ or it just means ‘present.’”
                    But whenever I conduct this exercise, I always, frustratingly enough for the
                    students, refuse such answers, pushing them to drill down further. Such a
                    process leads to unexpected insights. As one exasperated student, a
                    soon-to-retire police officer, eloquently and quite commonsensically put it
                    after an intensely confusing back-and-forth, “‘is’ just means that you is.”
                    “Well,” I said in response, “but what does it mean to ‘is’? This table here
                    ‘is,’ right? But what does it mean? What is ‘is-ing’? What are you doing if you
                    are ‘is-ing’? I am is-ing right now? What happened? What is happening? Or let’s
                    put it this way, what is the is-ness of ‘is’?” These counter-questions, which we
                    always go through in each class, usually result, through some circumlocutory
                    means, in the definition “to be.” <lg>
                     <l>“Which means,” I ask, “exactly what? What does it mean ‘to be’”?</l>
                     <l>“It's the future tense of ‘is,’” someone says.</l>
                     <l>“Right. Well, a bit more accurately, it’s the infinitive of “is.” But
                            what does ‘to be’ mean? To say ‘is’ means ‘to be’ only substitutes one
                            tense of the word for another. </l>
                     <l> We could just as easily say that ‘is’ means ‘you are and you were.’”
                        </l>
                  </lg> Such a line of questioning eventually reaches a provisional
                        <foreign>terminus ad quem</foreign> when a student offers that ‘is’ means
                    ‘to exist.’” </p>
               <p>So far, so good. We’ve worked our way to a definition and usually done so, if the
                    police officer’s comment above is any indication, with both considerable
                    good-humor and productive frustration. And yet…we are not finished with the verb
                    “is” quite yet. After all, what else, beyond its ontological meaning, can the
                    verb “to be” do? It can, of course, work as a copula, linking words in an A=B
                    relationship. Additionally, as we think through it, ‘is’ can be a passive verb,
                    depriving a sentence of agent and action. But is this how it functions in the
                    first sentence of <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>? Is there a
                    subject? An actor or agent? </p>
               <p> At this point we forestall the answers to those questions and this allows us to
                    begin opening up the complexities of the sentence to larger thematic scrutiny.
                    If “is” means “exist” in the sentence, and also acts as a linking verb
                    connecting the pronoun “it” with its referent “truth,” then the first part of
                    the sentence translates as “a truth exists.” This translation would seem to lend
                    to the “truth” an ontological status beyond cultural and social constructivism
                    because it is indicative of something indubitable, something indisputable,
                    something incontestable and yet numinous—a pure transcendental truth. At this
                    point students and I find that we are back in the realm of universals and
                    particulars, although, really, we have never left it. </p>
               <p>On the other hand, this reading of “truth” as transcendental is itself challenged
                    by the “is-ness” of is in that the passive construction here couples it to not
                    just “truth” but to “<emph>a truth</emph>” that itself depends on being
                    “universally acknowledged.” The article “a,” which we were initially tempted to
                    traverse, deflates the universalism of the hypostasized truth we contemplated
                    moments before. This instance of “a” felling the expansive infinity embedded in
                    the word “truth” proves illuminating, as the puny confronts the cosmically
                    giant, “a”’s David to the truth’s Goliath. Like the shocking outcome of the
                    Israelites’ encounter with the Philistines, “a” versus “truth” indexes an
                    unexpected result as “a”’s deflationism effectuates an emerging interpretive
                    divergence. With one puny stone a-sling, a particular truth fells a universal
                    truth, we might say.</p>
               <p>Students’ definition of “universally” bears out this divergence. Whereas in the
                    above explication of “is” a reified truth appears, the phrase “universally
                    acknowledged,” as students quickly realize, suggests that someone or something,
                    either a human or non-human agent, must be doing the acknowledging. One
                    definition they offer is through inference by way of textual elision. Isn’t it
                    curious, after all, that the acknowledgement of this truth, despite its claimed
                    universality, is not ascribed to anyone either grammatically or thematically?
                    However, my students argue, “a truth universally acknowledged,” since it is
                    acknowledged, <emph>must </emph>be acknowledged by <emph>someone</emph>. Hence,
                    there is not necessarily anything transcendental about it but rather something
                    stubbornly human. And if this truth is a mere commonplace contra what we
                    speculated that “universality” meant, then the truth becomes, or rather is, only
                    a truism, a maxim, or a bon mot made up by a given community of humans (in this
                    case, of course, it would be the Netherfield coterie). </p>
               <p>  And yet, and yet, as Byron might say, and as students do say, “universally”
                    can, and perhaps simply does, undeniably imply a cosmic transcendentality, the
                    initial interpretation to which “is” defined as “exists” led us. For
                    “universally,” as students have pointed out above, can mean “cosmic and
                    transcendental”—a kind of platonic universal truth—but since this truth is
                    “acknowledged” and since “acknowledged” can <emph>also</emph> imply that
                        <emph>someone</emph> must be doing the acknowledging, then humans may simply
                    acknowledge this truth in the sense that they <emph>accept</emph> that it does
                    exist. Rather than the above solution, in which “acknowledged” means the
                    Netherfield residents generated said truth via communal intersubjective
                    agreement, the world of this scenario is filled with characters who point upward
                    to the heavens, like Plato in Raphael’s <title level="m">School of
                        Athens</title>, sure of, and accepting of the fact, that answers descend
                    from the <foreign>mysterium tremendum</foreign>. </p>
               <p>In the classroom we now find ourselves in a position aptly described by Claudia
                    Johnson, who writes that “Austen has contrived <title level="m">Pride and
                        Prejudice</title> in such a way that virtually every argument about it can
                    be undercut with a built-in countervailing argument, a qualifying ‘on the other
                    hand’ which forestalls conclusiveness” (77). The novel’s other-handedness means
                    that “the intricately counterbalanced construction of <title level="m">Pride and
                        Prejudice</title> obliges us to regroup and reassess characters and issues,
                    to broaden our judgments and to accept contradiction” (77). Likewise, our class
                    has discovered three (for now) contradictory interpretations: <lg>
                     <l>a) It is a transcendental truth universally acknowledged as cosmic law,
                            that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a
                            wife.</l>
                     <l>b) It is a transcendental truth universally acknowledged by a given
                            community, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in
                            want of a wife.</l>
                     <l>c) It is a communally constructed truth universally acknowledged by a
                            given community, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must
                            be in want of a wife.</l>
                  </lg> Arriving at this textual conundrum places us squarely in a classical but
                    contemporarily relevant philosophical dilemma: is truth found (the
                    transcendental thesis) or made (the social constructivist thesis)?
                    Interpretations (a) and (b) cohere with the transcendental thesis and would seem
                    to indicate that single men’s wife-wanting is cosmically induced, beyond their
                    control and choice, which flattens certain patriarchal ideological problems that
                    the “single man” part of the sentence raises. After all, an innate categorical
                    drive to find a wife would refuse the idea of free, conscious will in the matter
                    and would seem to convert patriarchal power to something deterministically
                    induced by forces from elsewhere. Thus country gentry life would not be
                    structured by patriarchal privilege but rather divine fiat: rich men want wives
                    because they are programmed at some natural level to want wives. In contrast,
                    the social constructivist thesis (c) indicates that rich, single men who want
                    wives do so because the society in which they live creates matrimonial
                    expectations that such men will wish to marry. It may even create expectations
                    that women will want to be courted by such men and marry them. This social
                    constructivist thesis suggests that deep gender power divisions—created by
                    people and social forces—motivate and mobilize men’s actions in their
                    relationships with the unmarried females they court. Our various options, then,
                    point us directly at exactly what is at stake in interpreting whether the
                    sentence means events in the novel play out this way because of natural law or
                    because of tacitly, or not-so-tacitly, agreed-upon covenants in the world of the
                    country-house romance. These interpretations speak to the ideological concerns
                    of Regency England, what Marilyn Butler refers to as the “war of ideas.” As I
                    put it broadly and somewhat simply to students, this post-Revolutionary time of
                    indulgent complacency, with a hedonist regent running in place as a ruler,
                    nevertheless staged battles between political conservatisim and progressive
                    radicalism in the social marketplace of ideas. We might, at this point, I tell
                    students, initially understand the latter possibility—that communal norms
                    structure society rather than transcendental laws divined from God—as the
                    radical political position. We might also, I add, chalk up Austen’s irony as a
                    social hermeneutic tool that advances this radical position. </p>
               <p>At this juncture I usually ask students if we can find any textual evidence or
                    interpretive imperative in the rest of the second clause of the sentence that
                    will persuasively bolster one reading over the other. Helpfully, my students
                    have had a fairly keen, though not fully developed, awareness of
                    class-consciousness pegged to gender roles, which emerges when we come to
                    “single man.” <note place="foot" resp="editors">Two places to begin in terms of
                        class criticism on Austen are Marilyn Butler and Alistair Duckworth. Both
                        view Austen as essentially politically conservative, protecting the norms of
                        marriage in Regency society. Later critics like Fraiman and Johnson, who
                        combine an analysis of gender politics with social class, see her as
                        politically progressive. </note> At first glance, given the contextual
                    provision supplied by the marriage proviso, this adjective-noun combination
                    appears to be comparatively noncontroversial in meaning. And yet, each time I’ve
                    led students in this discussion, pinning down what a “single man in possession
                    of a good fortune” means poses marvelous explicatory hurdles. For what does
                    “single” mean after all? Does it mean singular? Individual? Sole? Alone?
                    Eligible? Exemplary? Much debate ensues regarding this word, none of it
                    definitive. However, it is notable that the word’s prodigious denotations
                    reintroduce the bipartite crossroads of particularity and universality—either
                        <emph>this </emph>single man or <emph>all </emph>single men everywhere—that
                    paused our explication above. This particular-universal distinction continues,
                    as we discover, with the modifiers surrounding “single.” We find “man” pretty
                    self-evident (though perhaps we should not). But whatever “single” means here,
                    “good” leads down several rabbit holes (should we take the blue or red pill?)
                    that return us, also, to the platonic philosophical themes evoked by
                    “universally.” Several definitions are readily available to us: “nice”;
                    “significant”; “sufficient”; “beneficial”; “morally correct.” Less obviously,
                    students find that “good” might mean “prosperity” or even “luck.” Hence, we
                    arrive at “a single man who is fortunate” rather than a single man possessing
                    wealth. But whether or not the single man merely has good fortune or has
                    significant wealth, students identify the sentence’s emphasis on the man—and
                    either his bachelorhood or his exemplarity—as raising real concerns about gender
                    subordination as tied to class privilege (or lack thereof, as the case may be).
                    On this reading, the sentence’s straightforwardly single-man insistence suggests
                    a raft of slippery issues: namely, that the novel believes rich men are the
                    rightful arbitrators of what women want. </p>
               <p>Although we do not discuss the rest of the novel during this class period, if we
                    did we would discover, of course, that Elizabeth Bennet, rather than a wealthy
                    man (Darcy, say), is the novel’s primary focus. Our acontextual reading of this
                    sentence affirms how our expectations are ironically contended with and shortly
                    overturned as the narrative voice subtly shifts from third-person impersonality
                    (and universality?) to a point-of-view at ground level before, as Alex Woloch
                    argues, it shifts again when Elizabeth assumes narrative control in chapter
                        7.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Woloch: “This passage functions as an
                        externalization of Elizabeth’s consciousness, so that her ‘something more of
                        quickness’ finds its corollary in her ‘quick pace’ and her ‘impatient
                        activity.’ The dilation of the description—as it drifts into the present
                        tense through a series of participles (‘crossing,’ ‘jumping,’ ‘springing,’
                        ‘finding herself’)—is unique up to this moment in the text. In fact, this
                        passage stands out within the narrative as a whole. It is a purely unplotted
                        moment in this densely plotted novel, a free space in the narrative—or
                        rather the only ‘plot’ that it serves to advance is precisely the
                        asymmetrical construction of Elizabeth as the center of narrative interest.
                        The passage shows how a thought in <title level="m">Pride and
                            Prejudice</title>, a tendency of consciousness, can become gradually
                        externalized” (80). </note> Woloch shows how the Bennet sisters, in
                    literally arriving at a crossroads, also arrive at a narrative, stylistic, and
                    thematic crossroads, with Elizabeth claiming control of several action gerunds,
                    a verbal transition that asserts her agency: <quote>In Meryton they parted; the
                        two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and
                        Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick
                        pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient
                        activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary
                        ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.
                        (23)</quote> Following Woloch’s insight, we can see how this passage focuses
                    in even more tightly on one particular character, as if it puts Elizabeth,
                    cinematically speaking, in close-up whereas she had been seen only in medium
                    shots up to this point. Above we asked whether the first sentence had an actor
                    or an agent. Is it possible the actor is Elizabeth? Thinking in terms of free
                    indirect discourse, this fabulously unlikely-looking idea has some currency,
                    since this ironic opening sentence is just the sort of bon mot Elizabeth,
                        <foreign>agent provocateur,</foreign> might toss off in order to then
                    turnabout and challenge or disprove it. If Elizabeth, who often has her
                    first-person assertions voiced by the third-person narrator throughout the novel
                    (a claim which is admittedly debatable), were in fact the missing agent of this
                    first sentence, then this textual elision would validate our earlier assertions
                    about the connection between irony and free indirect discourse. It would also
                    highlight, yet again, how the universal—in the form of the omniscient
                    narrator—struggles with the particular in the form of Elizabeth. </p>
               <p> One way students and I parse this universal/particular interpretive puzzle is to
                    continue to interrogate, by means of addition, the sentence’s further class
                    implications beyond the “single man.” In Jose Saramago’s <title level="m">The
                        History of the Siege of Lisbon</title> (1998), the proofreader Raimondo
                    Silva, assigned in the novel to correct a book of the same name, inserts the
                    word “not” in a crucial sentence, thereby altering the historical record of the
                    invasion of Portugual by preventing, on the page, the Crusaders from aiding
                    Alfonso I in reconquering the city and converting it back to Christianity—a
                    seismic event in Portuguese history. Although our exercise does not carry the
                    same seismic tremors, we follow Saramago’s proofreader in his textual surgery of
                    insertion and alteration to further explore the class concerns the sentence
                    leaves unresolved. Do single men not in possession of a good fortune want wives?
                    Or is this a society in which only rich men can be in want of a wife? Here we
                    insert “not”: <quote>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that single men not
                        in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. </quote> And then
                    we insert another “not”: <quote>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that
                        single men not in possession of a good fortune must not be in want of a
                        wife. </quote> Inserting “not” helps zero in further on how moneyed
                    interests would appear to command control of the society we are about to enter
                    via this sentence.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Deresiewicz employs a
                        similar strategy. "It is a truth universally acknowledged": that is, it is a
                        belief ensconced in "the minds of the surrounding families." The novel takes
                        as its point of departure, not customs or conventions, but cognitive
                        processes. In particular, it begins by setting out the kind of cognitive
                        process that crucially characterizes the community's thinking, the deductive
                        logic of the syllogism. As we might reformulate it:<lg>
                        <l>All single men in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a
                                wife.</l>
                        <l>Mr.Bingley is a single man in possession of a good fortune</l>
                        <l>Mr. Bingley must be in want of a wife.</l>
                     </lg>Our "universal truth," "well fixed" as it is in the minds of the
                        surrounding families, serves as the major premise, the starting-point of
                        deduction. "The feelings or views" of the single man in question empirical
                        evidence that may be thought to bear on the issue have no place in the
                        process and are therefore discounted. And because they are discounted, there
                        is no possibility that they will modify the major premise. Without the
                        countercheck of induction, of fresh observation and reconsideration,
                        conjecture crowns itself as certainty ("must be"), and beliefs once accepted
                        harden into "universal truths" (504-505).</note> Whereas above we discussed
                    the vagaries of a rich man and a lucky man wanting a wife, with our Saramagian
                    additions we broaden the patriarchal possibilities outward to encompass all men
                    and not just those felicitous few who have economic wealth or serendipitous
                    fortuity. Adding “not” to the sentence is deceptive because while it looks like
                    an addition, it is really just a way to translate the sentence. Without the
                    context of the whole novel—and wealth-conscious characters therein—the
                    indeterminacy of “single,” “good,” and “fortune” leave us vacillating about the
                    sentence’s meaning. In its refusal to specify, the sentence <emph>can</emph>
                    mean that single men who are not wealthy must be in want of wives. Similarly, it
                        <emph>can</emph> mean that if single men who are wealthy want wives then,
                    contrastingly, single men who are not wealthy may not want wives. Both
                    not-addition scenarios share a commonality: regardless of the audience’s
                    composition men remain the only actors strutting across this stage as if it were
                    an Elizabethan playhouse. Bolstering this reading, as several students note, the
                    “single man” (however one construes him) is given adjectival access as well as
                    the verb “possessing” and the “good fortune” attendant on that verbiage, while
                    the glimpse of women we see in the passage is an adjectivally flattened,
                    verbally unadorned—and here we see this larger theme again—universal
                    descriptor-as-function rather than an individualized, and particularized, agent.
                    The conversion of women to wives squares the circle on class and gender: all men
                    can want or not want wives whereas all women are simply the objects of wanting.
                    By advancing this position through the irony explored above, Austen lays a trap
                    for her readers: Elizabeth Bennet, in thought and action, seems to resist just
                    such a position throughout the rest of the novel. And, as we read the novel,
                    determining whether or not Elizabeth successfully manages to resist being merely
                    an object of a man’s matrimonial desires will in turn determine where we come
                    down on whether the novel simultaneously advances a radical politics or
                    recuperates the internal order of a patriarchal society underpinned by rich men
                    wanting and getting the wives that they want. Meanwhile, though, while we are
                    simultaneously left having advanced a great deal in our understanding of the
                    sentence, both grammatically and thematically, we are no closer, really, to
                    solving definitively the principle dilemma regarding transcendental
                    men-and-women truths versus historical and social representations of
                    men-and-women truths than when we began. </p>
               <p>However, students have come to several realizations and conclusions. The
                    universals of the cosmos, and the particulars of rural cultural existence,
                    translate into a classical cultural debate that students express in contemporary
                    popular parlance as the difference, and perhaps even the historical transition,
                    between “needs” and “wants.” My students’ explications of “want” mirrors that of
                    Edward O’Neill, who sees it as either “lack” or “desire” (77). He writes,
                    “Either a single man lacks a wife by definition, or might be supposed to “want”
                    in the sense of desiring one—a more genuine, and more exciting, conjecture”
                    (79). An illustrative example of “want”-as-lack occurs in the film <title level="m">Shakespeare in Love</title> (1998), when Richard Burbage cries
                    out, “Mistress Roselyn! My sleeve wants for a button!” In this case, the sleeve
                    needs a button to close—it lacks what it needs to properly function. Desiring,
                    alternately, requires a cognitive, if not emotional, or even physiological,
                    response, with a fixed goal as its hopefully attainable endpoint. What is
                    desired isn’t lacking in the sense of something needed—like in the button
                    example—but rather something simply consciously sought after for, well, whatever
                    reason whether that be sexual or social gratification, monetary fulfillment,
                    power mongering, or what have you. But for O’Neill, the irony of the sentence,
                    and perforce the novel, is that the novel’s prime concern is with wives who
                    “want”—either by lack or desire—single men in possession of a good fortune. This
                    reading reverses the apparently androcentric propulsive plot the sentence has
                    set the stage for (i.e. the male actors strutting the boards above). </p>
               <p>Taking up O’Neill’s gynocentric reading pressures the preposition, “in,” that
                    props up the word “want.” The preposition, as we discuss, can, and maybe
                    conclusively does, cancel the debate between lack and desire. Whether “in”
                    equals lack or desire, if the preposition translates to “in an existential state
                    of being in want,” then this refers us back to the idea of cosmic law—what
                    governs human life in every community everywhere. But if “in” translates
                    differently, as something along the lines of “within a mental space of willing
                    choice,” then “in” ascribes decision to human beings, granting them the autonomy
                    the existential above option rules out. Wanting a wife is not just a natural
                    phenomena hardwired into male brains; it’s a result of a given community’s
                    normative beliefs and values. Taking “want” in this fashion sides with the
                    particularities of history, understanding social mores as definers of life’s
                    love matches. Such a reading can support the above suggestion that this line
                    comes from Elizabeth: it ignores individual choice, what many would argue
                    Elizabeth possesses, as she marries, technically speaking, above her station but
                    only once she <emph>decides</emph> to do so with the man whom she has begun
                    to—though this is of course debatable—reform. Thus, like we theorized above, the
                    sentence is a provocative proposition, one Elizabeth throws down like a gauntlet
                    so that she may challenge it in the coming pages. This reading, though strange
                    and unlikely-sounding, is nevertheless in keeping with the nature of Elizabeth’s
                    (and Austen’s) irony and wit. </p>
               <p>“But this would mean…” one student said haltingly, a bit amazed, “that ‘in’ is
                    the most important word in the sentence.” “In” then. To our total surprise “in”
                    turns out to be the textual crux of the passage since it determines how we
                    understand “want,” which, in its divergent lacks and desires, manages how we
                    interpret just exactly what the single man—and by her absence, Elizabeth—is
                    doing. Close reading, as we see, requires attending even to the most irrelevant
                    looking and mechanically functioning words of a text for these words might prove
                    to be more important than whatever initially jumps out at us (“truth,”
                    “universally,” and “acknowledged”). </p>
               <p>Having arrived at this critical juncture, students, hopefully, can derive a few
                    bits of insight about the “close” and the “reading” of close reading. In fact,
                    we actually perform a contracted close reading of “close reading.” What do these
                    words mean when put to work together? By modifying “reading,” “close” transforms
                    “reading” into something more than the mundane (which of course is not mundane
                    at all) activity of reading words on a page. Instead it presses us down into
                    that page. With close reading we are suddenly down in between the letters on the
                    page, brushing our fingertips against the curlicues of s’s and the low-hanging
                    arms of g’s, exploring at the most minute level not only definitions and
                    semantics, but also the phonemic and morphemic aspects of words. That the
                    miniscule proposition “in” possesses enough strength to prop up the entire
                    sentence and govern its meaning demonstrates just how close one has to get.
                    Moreover, we see at this juncture that even the most seemingly insignificant
                    words can direct interpretive possibilities if attended to particularly. As such
                    “reading,” in its turn, modifies “close” by creating a dialectic synthesis—a
                    specific type of analytical activity—that moves us from grammar to thematics,
                    semantics to styles. By reading close we look for how things like word order and
                    word choice (to take but two examples) create theme and style (to take two more)
                    without ever appearing to consciously do so. After all, words are of course
                    subject to many different orders and choices. Reading close teases out from
                    these orders and choices the whats and hows of meaning at what looks like a
                    larger, higher-order level—theme and style seem like “big” things after all—even
                    as they emerge only from smaller, subatomic levels which, given their actual
                    importance, are just as large, when one thinks about it, as the things they
                    produce. “Close” reading, “reading” close, are both instances, we might say, of
                    particulars and universals revealing themselves as irreducibly scrambled. But
                    this scrambling is, in its turn, all the more reason why close reading is
                    necessary. Such notions are, no doubt, well known to literary scholars, but for
                    students being inaugurated into textual analysis, especially early in the
                    semester, encountering these close reading conceptualizations prove to be
                    eye-opening and foundational to future literary investigation. </p>
               <p>Our class discussion ends with the realization—or at least the communal
                    agreement!—that close reading is a specific critical ability, one useful in
                    discovering the complicated meanings implicitly and explicitly present in every
                    text. Of equal yield from our discussion are the meta-implications of the
                    sentence’s irony, which, on our reading, foregrounds both a theory of knowledge
                    production and references a well-known debate in the history of ideas and
                    philosophy, that between universals and particulars.</p>
               <p>Pedagogically and epistemologically speaking, then, this exercise lands us at a
                    typical Romantic philosophical flashpoint: is there a transcendental truth, some
                    force beyond the human world that foundationally grounds that world? Our reading
                    opens up that possibility that there are only the truths we make rather than any
                    we can find by seeking truth. In fact, we had acknowledged, as it were, that no
                    truths are ever non-contingent even those as seemingly intransigent as class and
                    gender normativities that ground our being in a reality we have created. Percy
                    Bysshe Shelley famously closes <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title>
                    (1821) by claiming that poets are “the unacknowledged legislators of the world.”
                    Shelley’s expansive definition of poetry hails back toward the Greek notion of
                        <foreign>poiesis</foreign>, that is, a creative maker, an interpreter of the
                    world who produces, by means of those interpretations, new truths. A final
                    lesson I try to stress with this close reading exercise—one that connects to
                    what I call “being a reader”—is that our multidirectional yet interconnected
                    interpretations of this crucial sentence position us as poets in Shelley’s
                    sense: critical readers who, through our interpretations, create, even as we
                    discover, meaning and meanings about the world in which we live through the lens
                    of a novel set in a world two hundred years removed from our own. That idea
                    might smack of the universalism our exercise has just, effectively speaking,
                    denied any purchase; however, what this claim about <foreign>poiesis</foreign>
                    really does is reappropriate Shelley’s universalist thesis by wedding it to the
                    particularities of present-day irony that emerge from the novels of Jane Austen
                    in the Romantic period. “Unveiling” this reading strategy—to use one of
                    Shelley’s favorite metaphors in <title level="m">Defence</title>—amounts to more
                    than just a reading strategy and gets at the heart of what teaching Romanticism
                    teaches us. My more ambitious, upward-and-outward hope for this classroom close
                    reading is that it provides students tools that will pay off as we continue to
                    think about how this period of literary and cultural history shapes us and our
                    present condition. Indeed, Romanticism is often characterized as I have done so
                    here: as a time of self-reflexivity and the directly connected constitution of
                    the fully individuated, modern subject. And Romantic irony has long been
                    recognized as a key mechanism, borne in literary experimentation (a kind of
                    Frankensteinian creature stitched together by various texts) to the emergence of
                    this subject. But if one were to recontextualize what I’m suggesting here in
                    slightly different, more current scholarly terms, we could also see Austen’s
                    irony as tracking with what Michel Foucault calls the birth of biopolitics, the
                    human awareness of ourselves as a species and the concurrent commitment “to make
                    [that species] live,” as Foucault puts it (<title level="m">History</title> 1:
                        133-160).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See also: <title level="m">Security, Territory, and Population</title> 6. </note>Thought of in
                    this way, the first sentence of Austen’s novel allows us to see, through the
                    interplay of the universal and the particular, how larger universalist
                    categorizations like species begin to intersect with the personalized subject.
                    Since students are indeed aware of the times of planetary peril in which we live
                    (despite what depressing poll numbers might assert), illuminating this
                    cross-section—of them as individuals and as members of a group engaged in
                    collective life—seems not only useful but maybe even necessary. As one example,
                    Romanticist Timothy Morton argues that the concept of Romantic irony is crucial
                    to changing our thinking about climate change because it provides us the needed
                    distance to look at ourselves and examine our attitudes and actions (Morton 19,
                    172-173). Given that rich patriarchal societies are most responsible for climate
                    change, our exploration of the gender and class implications proliferating from
                    this sentence intersects here as well. And while it is perhaps silly if not
                    self-indulgent to place so much weight on one sentence and one lesson, as a
                    popular phrase from modern feminism instructs us, “the personal is the
                    political.” Consequently, if the biggest challenge we face as a species is the
                    climate crisis, then it may well be the case that extending “the personal” to
                    embrace “the species” is the crucial step to “the political” now. Thoughts like
                    these are beyond the stated scope of this exercise, but it may well be that, in
                    some unknowable personal future for a given student, that this exercise will
                    help them ponder their own historical embodiments and individuation and maybe
                    even, correspondingly, to ponder political solutions to the problems our species
                    continues to not only face but cause. </p>
