            This article examines the connection between Tom Wedgwood’s pedagogical theories and his materialist theories of mind, which emphasized the importance of emotion in character formation. Wedgwood hoped to open an experimental school for infants with the goal of producing a generation of politically radical geniuses. This article situates Wedgwood’s ideas within the context of Romantic theories of cognition, debates about the mind-body relationship, and social reform, and points to a growing trend that connected bodily health and moral virtue. It argues for the significance of his largely ignored or undervalued contributions to Romantic thinking about the mind, body, and education.

                <p>Tom Wedgwood is commonly relegated to a footnote in the more fascinating
                    histories of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth. Aside from a few
                    admiring late nineteenth and early twentieth-century accounts of his brief life
                    by members of the extended family, there is but a smattering of scholarship that
                    examines his role in the intellectual circles in which he moved.<note
                        place="foot" resp="editors"> See Meteyard, Litchfield, and Tremayne and
                        Boole.</note> Beginning with David Erdman’s two-part series “Coleridge,
                    Wordsworth, and the Wedgwood Fund,” published in 1956, critics generally examine
                    Wedgwood’s relationship with Coleridge and Wordsworth. For example, Erdman
                    credits Wedgwood with influencing the shape of <title level="m">The
                        Prelude</title>’s exploration of the relationship between childhood
                    experiences and the development of genius, a topic that Wedgwood’s pedagogical
                    plan takes up. Even if Wordsworth found Wedgwood’s ideas about education so
                    repugnant that he struck off in the opposite direction, “Tom’s educational Plan
                    had a stimulating effect on his thinking” (Erdman I: 434). Erdman also discusses
                    Wedgwood’s role in convincing his brother Josiah to provide half of the 150₤
                    annuity that freed Coleridge from becoming a Unitarian minister and enabled him
                    to pursue a career in poetry and metaphysics. </p>
                <p>With varying degrees of sympathy, scholars such as Francis Doherty (1987), Neil
                    Vickers (1999, 2001), and John Beer (2001, 2010) look at Wedgwood’s influence on
                    Coleridge’s “abstruse research” (“Dejection” 89). Each examines him as “a
                    shaping force in Coleridge’s intellectual development” (Vickers 90), but not as
                    a significant contributor to the critical conversations in which Wedgwood
                    participated. To my knowledge, Francis À Court’s “<title level="m">Magnifique,
                        mais ce n’est pas Daguerre</title>: Some Notes on the Life of Tom Wedgwood”
                    (2003) is the only contemporary account that presents Wedgwood’s life as a
                    whole, viewing his relationship to Coleridge and Wordsworth as just one part of
                    a bigger picture. He argues that to historians of the Wedgwoods—an interesting
                    family in its own right—“Tom’s chief interest lies in his exceptional gifts as a
                    scientist, and they tend to speculate on what he <emph>might </emph>have
                    achieved, had he not been ill, rather than with his <emph>actual</emph>
                    connection with Coleridge” (79). From my perspective, his relationship with
                    these two poets is an important aspect of his history, but his contribution the
                    debates about cognition and about educational practice, particularly the way in
                    which he combined these two interests, is just as intriguing. Consequently, Tom
                    Wedgwood’s role in the intellectual history of the early Romantic period
                    deserves closer scrutiny.</p>
                <p>Wedgwood’s intellectual energies were divided between two issues that preoccupied
                    many Romantic thinkers—the workings of the human mind and theories of education.
                    “Education,” Alan Richardson claims, “was one of the most hotly contested and
                    frequently discussed topics of [. . .] the Romantic age” (2). Yet, Beer
                    characterizes Wedgwood’s participation in this discussion as a simple obsession
                    with the latest craze. He argues that Wedgwood was under “the strong hold of the
                    necessitarian doctrines of the day, and the rage for educational experiments”
                    (Beer 26). This account of Wedgwood’s theoretical commitments, with its use of
                    terms such as “the rage” and “fashionable,” implies that his interest in these
                    subjects was uncritical, nothing more than a desire to fit in with his friends.
                    Wedgwood, in this view, is not seen as a serious thinker in his own right, but
                    as a hanger-on who spouted the modish opinions of the day, presumably because of
                    his dearth of original thought. While not all critics dismiss Wedgwood, the
                    general consensus can be summed up by two comments by Beer. The first is that
                    Wedgwood needed to be “argued into a subtler view of the human mind, no longer
                    taking for granted the fashionable doctrine of its explicability simply through
                    the association of ideas” (Beer 27). In other words, Wedgwood is nothing more
                    than a jejune associationist. Second, Beer claims that it is impossible to
                    determine if Wedgwood had any original thought because he left no published
                    corpus. He gives little credence to Wedgwood’s ideas, which are, admittedly,
                    difficult to access in their fragmented and incomplete form.<note place="foot"

                <p>Wedgwood died in 1805 at the age of thirty-four, leaving behind little “in the
                    way of published papers or actual records of discoveries, [that] accounts for or
                    seems to correspond with the high esteem in which he was held by his
                    contemporaries” (Tremayne and Boole 10).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> His
                        publications include “Experiments and Observations on the Production of
                        Light from Different Bodies, by Heat and by Attrition,” published in the

                        series as well as Tremayne and Boole.</note> While James Mackintosh, the
                    Scottish lawyer and Wedgwood’s brother-in-law, was ostensibly helping him
                    prepare a manuscript of metaphysical speculations in 1802, it was not completed
                    by the time Wedgwood died. According to various letters, Coleridge was also
                    involved in this project, having committed to write “a preface on the history of
                    metaphysical opinions” (Beer 29).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On 19
                        February 1802, Coleridge wrote to Thomas Poole that he was “finishing the
                        History of the opinions concerning Space &amp; Time for Mackintosh” (<title
                            level="m">CL</title> II: 787). Earlier that month Southey informed
                        William Taylor that Wedgwood was working on a book with Mackintosh as “the
                        man midwife” (qtd. in Beer 29).</note> After Wedgwood’s death, his brother
                    Jos charged Mackintosh and Coleridge with publishing his brother’s legacy
                    posthumously. He asked Mackintosh to complete the manuscript for publication and
                    Coleridge to write Wedgwood’s biography. Both men, we know, were afflicted with
                    the same character flaw—procrastination—and neither produced what he had
                    promised. Thus, Wedgwood’s substantial but unorganized archive of notebooks was
                    never synthesized into publishable form. “In the absence of this promised work,”
                    Beer asserts, “it remains hard to say exactly what was distinctive about Tom
                    Wedgwood’s ideas” (30). I disagree with this assessment of his work. </p>
                <p>Though Wedgwood’s work remains largely unpublished and somewhat fragmentary, it
                    is distinctive because of the way in which he applied his cognitive theories to
                    his educational programme. Where critics such as Beer or Vickers might
                    characterize his views in terms of a “naïve commitment to the idea of man as
                    machine” (Vickers 89), I claim that Wedgwood’s pedagogical plan is worthy of
                    notice because it is based on his materialist theories of cognition. Wedgwood
                    was not a mere neophyte who mindlessly parroted the “fashionable doctrines” of
                    the day (Beer 27), but put thought into his metaphysical researches. He used a
                    methodology similar to Coleridge’s (or perhaps Coleridge used a methodology
                    similar to his) that involved self-scrutiny, sensory experiments such as those
                    proposed by Erasmus Darwin in <title level="m">Zoonomia</title> (1794), and
                    observation of his nieces and nephews in their infancy and early childhood. </p>
                <p>Wedgwood participated in a vibrant intellectual community that included not only
                    the poets, but men of science, such as Darwin, Thomas Beddoes, and Humphry Davy,
                    all of whom were interested in embodied theories of cognition as well as
                    theories of education. He corresponded with William Godwin and, through him, was
                    in contact with Mary Wollstonecraft. He was also related by marriage to the
                    Edgeworths, who are known for <title level="m">Practical Education</title>
                    (1798). Many of these figures, like Wedgwood, were interested in applying
                    Hartley’s associationist ideas to education. Yet, Wedgwood’s theories go further
                    in some respects because they are predicated on his own research and reading,
                    which extend beyond Hartley’s <title level="m">Observations on Man</title>
                    (1749). “[R]aised in the laboratories of his father’s potteries in Etruria”
                    (Beer 26), Wedgwood was a scientific-minded young man who turned his attention
                    to the concerns that interested his mentors, peers, and, indeed, many
                    thinkers—cognitive science and education. His carefully reasoned application of
                    the principles of materialist cognition to the education of children as a way to
                    usher in a new era of political justice is a significant contribution to
                    intellectual history, even if, like Jeremy Bentham’s panopticon, it was never
                    implemented.</p>
                <p>In this article, my goal is to explicate Tom Wedgwood’s cognitive theory and to
                    situate it within the larger context of the late eighteenth- and early
                    nineteenth-century mind-matter debates. In doing so, I draw on archival material
                    as well as on the snippets of his work that have been published by scholars and
                    by family members. I also interrogate the relationship between his theory of
                    mind and his pedagogical programme, showing how the former led into and
                    buttressed the latter. Wedgwood’s work is significant because it gathered
                    together several strands of Romantic philosophical thought, from Hartley’s
                    theory of association (divested of its theology) to Godwin’s doctrine of
                    perfectibility, in an attempt to formulate a practical plan of education that
                    would bring about a society of geniuses committed to the principles of liberty,
                    equality, communitarian values, and social justice. It was, as Wedgwood wrote to
                    Godwin, his “master stroke which should anticipate a century or two upon the
                    large-paced progress of human improvement” (qtd. in Erdman I: 430). </p>
                <p>Though an associationist and a committed materialist, he did not unquestioningly
                    adhere to Hartley’s theories, as Beer and Vickers suggest. In addition to his
                    own insights, derived from observations of himself and others, he took into
                    account the materialist theories of cognition advanced by Darwin and, to an
                    extent, Davy. These theories posit an active mind in contrast to Hartley’s
                    theory (and Locke’s before him) that advances an empirical account of the mind
                    that is necessarily passive, “a lazy Lookeron on an external World” (Coleridge,
                        <title level="m">CL</title> II: 709). Similar to Darwin, he saw free will as
                    circumscribed, yet Wedgwood’s pedagogical plan has some depth. Unlike those who
                    adopted “the new rational approach to education, with its emphasis on method and
                    factual knowledge” (Richardson 4), Wedgwood was primarily concerned with
                    educating the mind by educating the body. He emphasized the importance of
                    feeling, which for him was an embodied phenomenon, in educating infants into
                    well-adjusted, emotionally stable adults (in contrast to Coleridge and himself). </p>
                <p>Wedgwood was interested in ameliorating the human condition, and with the receipt
                    of “a considerable trust” inherited from his father, the famous potter, he
                    thought that an experimental school would prove to be “the most profitable mode
                    of beneficial expenditure” (qtd. in Erdman I: 430). Aside from the vast fortune,
                    in this respect he was no different than Coleridge or Davy, both of whom had
                    outlined educational plans designed to produce a particular type of enlightened
                    being. Yet, though Coleridge was, for a time, considering opening a school as a
                    means of supporting his family (a plan that was put to rest when the Wedgwoods
                    convinced him to take the unencumbered annuity), neither he nor Davy developed
                    their plans as thoroughly and in as much detail as Wedgwood. So, where many
                    critics dismiss Wedgwood as unoriginal, significant only in respect to his
                    connection to Coleridge and Wordsworth, I contend that his application of
                    materialist cognitive theory to education offers insight into both Romantic
                    period debates and brings to light new connections between Romantic cognitive
                    science and theories of education.</p>

                    <p>Tom Wedgwood’s interest in theories of cognition, I argue, was not merely the
                        result of his intellectual environment, but also driven by his personal
                        torment. He suffered from a mysterious illness for most of his life, a life
                        characterized by “ceaseless struggle with bodily suffering” (Litchfield 91).
                        His pain was “so severe that he would sometimes throw himself to the ground
                        screaming” (Wedgwood and Wedgwood 101). Scrawled on a single folded slip of
                        paper tucked into a notebook in the Barlaston archive is the following
                        anguished note: <quote>My mind is now eternally preying on itself—I am
                            watching myself with anxious and unceasing vigilance. I have every

                        Anxiety” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40-28515/14).<note place="foot"
                            resp="editors"> Wedgwood frequently used abbreviations in his notebooks
                            (e.g., “consq<hi rend="sup">t</hi>” for consequent). For the sake of
                            readability, I have silently provided the full word for abbreviations as
                            necessary. In other quotations from archival material, I have silently

                            reading.</note> This brief, undated observation reveals the way in which
                        Wedgwood conceived of the mind-body relationship and gives us a glimpse into
                        his theory of cognition. For Wedgwood, mental well-being and bodily health
                        were intimately and inextricably connected. He was convinced that his
                        physical ailments were directly caused by his poor mental state, which he
                        characterized as a “wavering &amp; superficial examination of future
                        urgencies &amp; conducts” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40-28515/14), or to
                        put it more simply, an unhealthy obsession with the future. Influenced by
                        his father’s Lunar Society friends, who held varying versions of Hartley’s
                        Doctrine of Association, Wedgwood saw his mental state not as a bad
                        attitude, but as the result of bad habits. </p>
                    <p>According to Associationism, ideas in the mind are formed by concurring
                        bodily sensations. These sensations become associated with ideas, either
                        linearly or in clusters, such that they are able to be recalled even in the
                        absence of the original objects or stimuli. For example, if a person sees or
                        hears a bird chirping in a tree the objects will associate together in the
                        mind. Consequently, any time that person hears (or sees) a bird, she will
                        automatically think of a tree. In this way, objects, experiences, and ideas
                        connect in trains that are later recalled and remembered together. Despite
                        its long history beginning with Aristotle, Association rose to prominence in
                        the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries through Locke’s fourth edition of
                            <title level="m">An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</title> (1700),
                        Hume’s <title level="m">A Treatise of Human Nature</title> (1739), and
                        Hartley’s <title level="m">Observations</title>.<note place="foot"

                            volume I.</note> While there is evidence that Wedgwood read each of
                        these books, undoubtedly he was first introduced to the theory by his
                        father’s forward-thinking friends. He grew up in a progressive environment
                        under an educational plan designed by Darwin, an Associationist and founder
                        of the Lunar Society (Meteyard 18). Primarily men of science and industry,
                        members of this informal group met monthly to discuss their latest theories,
                        ideas, and experiments. The theories debated by his father’s friends posited
                        the mind as an embodied, material phenomenon rather than an attribute of an
                        immaterial soul. In addition to Darwin, Joseph Priestley was particularly
                        interested in theories of cognition.</p>
                    <p>Priestley, a noted physicist, chemist, theologian, Dissenting clergyman, and
                        most importantly a materialist, developed an interest in Hartley’s theory of
                        cognition when he was a student at Davenport Academy.<note place="foot"
                            resp="editors"> Dissenters were Christians of various beliefs
                            (Anabaptists, Diggers, etc.) who broke with the Church of England in the
                            sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. Priestley was a
                            Unitarian. Dissenters, Hartley included, were barred from becoming
                            clergy in the Anglican Church because they refused to subscribe to the
                            Thirty-Nine Articles.</note> Where Locke’s account of association
                        remains largely unconcerned with the role of the body in cognition, Hartley
                        explicitly addresses the reciprocity between body and mind. <title level="m"
                            >Observations</title> offers a detailed physiological account of Locke’s
                        theory that proposes the Doctrine of Vibrations as a method of neural
                        transduction, that is, the way in which the body converts sensory stimuli
                        into neural signals that are communicated to the brain and nervous system.
                        Priestley popularized Hartley’s work by publishing <title level="m"
                            >Hartley’s Theory of Mind </title>(1775), an abridged edition that
                        omitted the theory of vibrations and the entire second volume in which
                        Hartley explained the theological implications of his theory. As Priestley
                        recognized, and I agree, the most significant and radical part of Hartley’s
                        theory is its materialist account of cognition that locates the mind in the
                        body. Priestley used Hartley’s observation that physical substances, such as
                        “Poisons, spirituous Liquors, Opiates, Fevers, Blows upon the Head
                            <emph>&amp;c.</emph> all plainly affect the Mind” (Hartley 9), to argue
                        for materialist monism, both in the prefatory essays to Hartley’s work and
                        in his own <title level="m">Disquisitions Relating to Matter and
                            Spirit</title> (1777). </p>
                    <p>Wedgwood’s notebooks indicate that he was familiar with “Priestley’s Hartley,
                        including the memorable injunction to Philosophers” and may also have read
                        the first volume of <title level="m">Observations</title> (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                        Collection E40–28451). He boasts in 1796 that “without having read Hartley
                        [...] [i]t is a considerable confirmation of many of my observations formed
                        from the closest scrutiny of my own changes of state, that they coincide
                        very exactly with many of the most important ones of this author”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). Upon reading Hartley, it seems,
                        Wedgwood found confirmation for the conclusions he had drawn based on
                        self-observation of his emotional and physical states. This memo is followed
                        by some notes on Hartley and a list of other philosophers (including Hume,
                        Berkeley, and Locke), which give us some idea of his reading during this
                        period. Yet, the fact that Wedgwood was familiar with materialist theories
                        of cognition “without having read Hartley” indicates how widespread these
                        ideas were amongst a certain segment of the English reading public. This was
                        due in no small part to Priestley, who sparked the mind-matter debates that
                        raged throughout the Romantic period.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See
                            Robertson, “Soulful Sensorium: The Body in British Romantic Brain

                    </p>
                    <p>Traditionalists and conservatives reacted violently against Hartley’s and
                        Priestley’s materialist theories, in part because the thinkers who held
                        these views tended to be political radicals who supported the ideals of the
                        French Revolution. More importantly, though, Hartley’s theory threatened
                        neo-Platonic Christian doctrine by dissolving the mind-body dichotomy and
                        abolishing free will by making association an entirely passive process.
                        While many people found the idea of the passive mind repugnant, men such as
                        Priestley and Darwin did not. Rather than turning away from materialism
                        altogether, Darwin accepted the basic premise of Hartley’s and Priestley’s
                        theories—that cognition is an embodied, physiological, process—and attempted
                        to formulate a more active account of the mind than theirs provided.</p>
                    <p>Prior to reading Hartley, Wedgwood had already read <title level="m"
                            >Zoonomia</title>, which offers Darwin’s account of neural transduction.
                        Trying to overcome the mental passivity inherent in the Doctrine of
                        Vibrations, Darwin theorized that the body produces a substance that he
                        called “the spirit of animation or sensorial power” that translates sensory
                        stimuli into mental ideas (61). He uses these two terms interchangeably, and
                        while “spirit of animation” seems to imply an immaterial principle, Darwin
                        clearly identifies this mutable and highly active substance as a “secretion”
                        of “the brain and spinal marrow” (57).<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                            Elsewhere, I argue that Darwin deliberately uses obfuscating
                            philosophical language in order to protect himself from the sort of
                            persecution that Priestley experienced when his laboratory was destroyed
                            in the Church and King Riots of 1791.</note> That is, sensorial power is
                        an organic substance produced by the body, making cognition a decidedly
                        material phenomenon. As a medical practitioner, Darwin was not interested in
                        the philosophical debate about materialism and dualism. Instead, like
                        Wedgwood, he wanted to discover how the mind and body affected each other
                        for practical purposes, so that he could better diagnose and treat disease.
                        In fact, <title level="m">Zoonomia</title> is a two-volume nosology that
                        offers a systematic theory of how to treat bodily and mental disorders based
                        on Darwin’s organic theory of mind. Significantly, in contrast to his
                        predecessors’ theories, Darwin’s model is not based on mechanical
                        principles. Rather, he posits a mind that obeys the laws of organic life.
                        That is, the mind, in his view, is subject to the same laws as all other
                        animate matter, but these laws are substantively different than Newton’s
                        laws of physics, which govern the inanimate world. </p>
                    <p>While critics are correct to trace Wedgwood’s ideas back to Hartley, in fact,
                        Darwin had a greater influence. Wedgwood believed that the principles of the
                        human mind could be explained by the Doctrine of Association, but he did not
                        uncritically accept Hartley’s passive account, as Beer and Vickers assert.
                        He acknowledged that “Association” was “one of the original principles of
                        mechanical Philosophy,” but thought that it was “perhaps capable of
                        resolution into other principles which are already presumed as
                        indispensible” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). These “other
                        principles” refer to Darwin’s laws of organic life. Wedgwood accepted that
                        “the activity, the versatility of the mind” was “deducible from the
                        principle laid down by Darwin as the origin of all muscular motion”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). Though Wedgwood occasionally
                        referred to the mind as “yet a mere transcript” that is “formed by external
                        circumstances alone, without ever [. . .] exercising any volition in
                        adapting itself to them” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28476A), for the
                        most part he seemed to follow Darwin's account.<note place="foot"
                            resp="editors"> Determining Wedgwood's exact stance is sometimes
                            difficult because his notes are fragmentary and undated. In the quoted
                            passage, which is just a few jotted notes, he was considering “pure
                            reasoning” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28476A). His stance seemed
                            to be that the mind begins as a “mere transcript” and becomes active as
                            it develops. This difficulty determining which views represent
                            Wedgwood’s most developed or recent line of thought is part of the
                            problem of working with archival material.</note> Darwin's theory of
                        cognition is an interesting mix of Hartleyean Associationism and his own
                        organic principles. While he saw the mind as active, he still considered
                        free will to be circumscribed by external circumstances.</p>
                    <p>It appears, then, that Wedgwood viewed cognition as an organic, active
                        process, but not a process that is entirely unconstrained, as in dualist
                        theories of the mind. He believed, in keeping with his materialist approach,
                        that human beings are subject “to simple and universal laws” (Doherty 309),
                        like any other natural object. His driving passion in the first several
                        years of his adulthood was to answer the question: “From how few &amp; how
                        simple original principles can all the functions of the Mind be
                        derived?”(V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28515/107). He wanted, like many
                        of his peers, to discover the routines, procedures, and details of the
                        mind’s physiological functioning, not least so that he could understand
                        himself and his ailments better and, hopefully, to rectify his miserable
                        physical and mental condition.</p>
                    <p>The physical fact of Wedgwood’s suffering, along with his early exposure to
                        radical theories of mind, motivated him to pursue research into the
                        materialist theories of cognition that were being advanced by late
                        eighteenth-century thinkers. If the cornerstone of this empirical theory is
                        that a person’s character is a direct result of his or her habits, the good
                        news for Wedgwood was that habit could be changed. Human beings, according
                        to Hartley, “have a Power of suiting our Frame of Mind to our Circumstances,
                        of correcting what is amiss, and improving what is right” (Hartley 84). This
                        must have given Wedgwood hope, at least in the early years, that his
                        miserable physical and mental condition could be reversed. In the undated
                        note that lists the physical pains that he attributed to his mental state,
                        Wedgwood resolves to stop worrying about the future. He vowed to “Give
                        myself over the present moment—Oh grand, inestimable secret of human
                        happiness!!” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40-28515/14). This exclamation
                        indicates his mental plan of action. Physically, he resolved to “Still the
                        rising tumult—Press down the throbbing heart” and to “Practise this with
                        unshaken constancy” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40-28515/14). For Wedgwood
                        understanding the mind-body connection and how to influence it was an
                        immensely personal concern. It was also a concern that was deeply
                        intertwined with emotional feeling. Association, according to Wedgwood, is
                        not just a process whereby sensations are linked together to create trains
                        of ideas. It is a process by which pleasurable or painful sensations are
                        joined together to create ideas that are associated with particular
                        feelings. Cognition, in Wedgwood’s view, is an emotionally charged, embodied
                        process.</p>

                <div type="section">
                    <head>“So Exquisitely Sensitive Are We”</head>
                    <p>One of Wedgwood’s most significant contributions to Romantic cognitive
                        science was the elaboration of the relationship between emotion, cognition,
                        and association. Wedgwood qualifies and extends materialist theories of
                        cognition, building on those advanced by Hartley and Priestley, by
                        considering the role of affective feeling in the process of association. In
                        setting out their terminology, both Hartley and Priestley equate ideas with
                        feeling. Hartley states that “<emph>Sensations</emph> are those Feelings of
                        the Mind, which arise from the Impressions made by external Objects on the
                        several parts of our Bodies. All our other internal Feelings may be called
                            <emph>Ideas</emph>” (ii). Likewise, Priestley claims that ideas, no
                        matter how abstract, are “<emph>mental feelings</emph>, occasioned by the
                        impression of external objects” (xliv). For the most part, Hartley and
                        Priestley use the term <emph>feeling</emph> to refer to “experiences such as
                        touch as when we appreciate the shape or texture of an object,” rather than
                        to affective experience (Damasio 3).<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                            Hartley offered his physiological account of cognition as part of a
                            larger theological theory about the perfectibility of humankind and
                            cultivation of virtue and vice. He sets out a moral taxonomy that will
                            lead humanity, both ontogenetically and phylogenetically, to reunion
                            with God. Pleasure and pain are, thus, important to his theory of
                            character formation with respect to virtue and vice. When he uses the
                            word <emph>feeling</emph> it sometimes seems to refer to affective
                            experience as well as sensation.</note> Yet, because sensation is always
                        accompanied by pleasure or pain, tactile feeling quickly leads to affective
                        feeling. </p>
                    <p>Thus, the term “feeling” can also imply “some variant of the experience of
                        pain or pleasure as it occurs in emotions and related phenomena” (Damasio
                        3). As Priestley claims, a child does not know fear “till it has received
                        some hurt; upon which the painful idea left in the mind by the remembrance
                        of hurt becomes associated with the idea of the circumstance in which he
                        received the hurt” (xxxi). At this point, the child develops a fear of the
                        hurtful object. Yet, while feeling is central to both Hartley’s and
                        Priestley’s theories, neither elaborates the implications of so closely
                        aligning thought with emotion. The consequence of intertwining cognitive
                        processes with sensation clearly signals the mind’s dependence on the body,
                        but as sensation is always accompanied by pleasure or pain, which is
                        transformed into love or fear, there is an affective dimension that neither
                        Hartley nor Priestley fully explores. Wedgwood, on the other hand, tormented
                        by his own unstable emotions, investigates the relationship between sensory
                        and affective feeling as a fundamental aspect of mentation.</p>
                    <p>When Wedgwood claims that “all thinking is a matter of feeling”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28478), he means affective, or
                        emotionally-charged, feeling. Seeing an intimate connection between sensory
                        and affective feeling, Wedgwood conflates the two senses of the word. He
                        argues that when we receive a physical sensation from an object in the
                        world, it is always accompanied by an affective experience before it is
                        associated with an idea that correlates to the object of sensation. He asks,
                        “May not the origin of the faculty of Association be illustrated with
                        greater success by [. . .] fixing our attention upon simple feeling?”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28478). Accordingly, Wedgwood argues that
                        affective experience drives the process of association. In his view,
                        “muscular action is associated with Feeling &amp; not with Idea”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). In other words, objects in the
                        world become associated more powerfully with a person’s emotional experience
                        of them than with the sensory, or physical, experience of them. Thus,
                        associated ideas do not call up other ideas, but rather emotional
                            states.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In an 1803 letter to Robert
                            Southey, Coleridge expresses a similar idea. He writes, “association
                            depends in much greater degree on the recurrence of resembling states of
                            Feeling, than on Trains of Idea [. . .] Ideas <emph>never</emph> recall
                            Ideas . . . it is the Soul, the state of Feeling” that recalls ideas
                                (<title level="m">CL</title> II: 961).</note> The consequence of
                        this assertion is that if an object or idea associates under pleasant
                        circumstances, subsequent experiences of it will be positive. If it
                        associates under negative conditions, it will later be experienced
                        negatively. For example, Wedgwood noted that any time he heard bells tolling
                        during the day he automatically felt dejected. He traced this response back
                        to an experience in Germany. He realized that when he heard any bells chime
                        in daytime “there was a striking resemblance between the tone &amp; that of
                        the Hamburg bell with which I had several unpleasant association &amp;
                        amongst the rest, a sensation of melancholy” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28452). Because his original experience of hearing bells during the day
                        was associated with unpleasant feelings, any repetition of this stimulus
                        triggers an analogous emotional response.</p>
                    <p>Often this associative process happens on an unconscious level. For example,
                        Wedgwood observed that when he “views a beautiful object in nature without
                        Emotion,” the “next moment on reviewing it, I feel Emotion”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). Or, as with the Hamburg bells, when
                        he heard bells chime during the day he involuntarily fell into a state of
                        dejection even though he did not consciously remember the initial event that
                        established this mood-stimulus relationship. As with the twentieth-century
                        theory of the mood-state dependency effect, the emotional state of the
                        perceiver “may become associated with otherwise neutral” sensory data at the
                        time that it is neurophysiologically encoded (Lewis and Critchley 432). That
                        is, sensory data that have no particular affective quality attached to them
                        can become linked to an emotional state through association. For whatever
                        reason, the chiming bells in Hamburg were painful to Wedgwood because of
                        some other unknown, negative circumstance related to them. This neutral
                        stimulus had been associated with an unpleasant emotion, and, henceforth
                        Wedgwood was prey to despondency and despair whenever he was exposed to
                        similar stimuli. The implication of this observation is that, according to
                        Wedgwood, mood is induced by memory, often unconsciously: “feeling often
                        remains without any idea to what it owes its birth” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                        Collection E40–28515). Feeling, then, rather than ideas, drives habit and
                        character formation. More important than the stimuli to which human beings
                        are exposed is their affective response to them. </p>
                    <p>Another implication of Wedgwood’s hypothesis is that emotion is embodied.
                        “All our feelings,” he claimed, are “different modifications of central
                        nerves” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28515/47). In other words, when
                        people experience emotions, there is movement in the central and peripheral
                        nervous systems. Wedgwood did not specify if the movement is caused by
                        vibrations, as in Hartley’s theory, or sensorial power, as in Darwin’s.
                        Though, similar to Davy’s speculation in early notebooks, Wedgwood thought
                        neural transduction might be a phenomenon corresponding to “electric
                        activity” or some “analogous activity of our nerve, assuming that Light,
                        Heat, Electricity is the same matter differently elicited” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                        Collection E40–28478). The inference is clear that affective feeling, like
                        sensory feeling, is physiological. </p>
                    <p>The idea that emotion is embodied is important for Wedgwood because it
                        allowed him to speculate that infants are not born with any particular
                        temperament, but that it develops over time in response to their
                            environment.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Though it was declining
                            in popularity in the eighteenth century, the ancient theory of humours
                            held that a person was born with a sanguine, choleric, melancholic, or
                            phlegmatic temperament.</note> Thus, education and upbringing could
                        drastically influence a child’s character as a consequence of Association.
                        In essence, Wedgwood took Locke’s theory of <foreign>tabula rasa</foreign>
                        and extended it beyond the acquisition of ideas and knowledge and beyond
                        even the development of virtue and vice as in Hartley’s theory, claiming
                        that feeling is also involved in the process of association. </p>
                    <p>Wedgwood came to his conclusions, in part, by reading <title level="m"
                            >Zoonomia,</title> in which Darwin theorizes that infants acquire the
                        capacity for emotion through muscular action. This could happen mimetically
                        by imitating the facial expressions of others. By smiling, frowning,
                        scowling, and so forth, they stimulate the emotional feelings associated
                        with each of these muscular actions.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                            Recent research has shown that “facial configurations” do, in fact
                            “differentially affect [. . .] peoples [<emph>sic</emph>] felt emotions”
                            (Glenberg et al. 121). Individuals experienced “strong physical
                            sensations when they contracted muscles that produced facial
                            configurations that resembled the universal facial expressions for
                            certain emotions” (Levenson, Ekman, and Friesen 364).</note> It could
                        also occur as by-products of other kinds of actions. For example, Darwin
                        notes that infants experience pleasure when breastfeeding. Since sucking
                        naturally causes the corners of the infant’s mouth to pull upward into a
                        smile, later in life people smile when they feel happy as a result of
                        muscular association and habit. Wedgwood noted that “Darwin’s hypothesis of
                        our ideas of sensations being repetitions of original impressions [...]
                        appears to me capable of substantial proof” and was “greatly confirmed by
                        the general analogy of the gradual acquirement of perfection of all our
                        functions, from which it would be strange to exclude our
                            <emph>feelings</emph>” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28452). Simply
                        put, Wedgwood observed that muscular and sensory acuity develops as infants
                        grow and mature. He reasoned by analogy that this same process must apply to
                        emotions as well. </p>
                    <p>Wedgwood considered it “[i]nstructive to consider with what labour &amp;
                        unceasing effort [...] muscular trains are formed in infancy” because it
                        provided evidence that people are not born with fully formed cognitive
                        faculties, but that they develop over time (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28451). The observations that “Trains of Ideas are, evidently, from the
                        imbecility of children, formed with the same expense of time and exertion”
                        validated the hypothesis that cognition is a material phenomenon, not the
                        function of a fully formed, immaterial soul (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28451). Wedgwood took early childhood developmental processes as proof
                        that the mind and body are formed together, and so, together shape
                        temperament. He applied this theory of association to knowledge acquisition
                        and to emotion. While an excess of negative emotion in childhood could
                        debilitate a person for life, these emotional experiences are also related
                        to bodily comfort or discomfort as well.</p>
                    <p>For Wedgwood, “Our own body is the centre &amp; measure of all our
                        acquirements” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28515/515). Not only does it
                        provide the basis for “ideas of distance” and magnitude, but it is the locus
                        of all our affective experience (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28515/515).
                        That is, we understand spatial concepts, generally considered to be abstract
                        ideas, through our senses.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The issue of
                            how abstract ideas such as distance, magnitude, shape, and even concepts
                            such as benevolence or justice could exist or be perceived if they were
                            not Platonic ideals or transcendental abstractions was a matter of
                            intense debate amongst materialist and dualist cognitive theorists, such
                            as Darwin, Beddoes, Davy, Thomas Brown, and others. </note> At the same
                        time, the body is also the foundation for character, emotional temperament,
                        and all our future happiness or misery. “The Happiness of Man,” he claimed,
                        “is comprised entirely in <title level="m">Sensation</title> &amp; <title
                            level="m">Emotion</title>; Imagination &amp; Action are only deemed
                        important from being observed immediately to antecede pleasurable &amp;
                        painful Sensation &amp; Emotion” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28457). In
                        keeping with the intellectual atmosphere of his politically radical mentors,
                        Wedgwood saw “the great end of Existence [as] Individual happiness,” which
                        he associated with “Self regulation” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28480). Self-regulation refers to a balanced state of mind and of body
                        that prevents a person from falling too far into dejection, vacillating
                        between emotional extremes, and suffering unduly from physical
                        complaints.</p>
                    <p>“[F]rom repeated experiments,” he discovered that “the same events which will
                        make you miserable by anticipation [. . .] will hardly disturb your
                        equanimity for a moment in better health” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28480). He recognized that one’s state of mind is greatly affected by
                        one’s phenomenological experience of the world, and he believed that this
                        could be controlled through more careful attention to the process of
                        association, particularly in children. Therefore, to discover how to train
                        the mind (imagination) and the body (action) in order to increase happiness
                        and decrease misery became his primary concern. He tried to record the
                        “Incidents, Thoughts, Feeling, &amp;c of my early life” so that he could
                        discover and “illustrate the composition of Feeling, its growth &amp;
                        maturation” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28490). He hoped “to display in
                        my own history some of the errors &amp; perhaps some of the advantages of my
                        education—to unravel the web of my ideas &amp; sensations—to trace my
                        present habits to their origins” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28490). He
                        did not, however, get far. His memoirs consist of a page and half of events
                        that occurred when he was between five and seven years old. Like Wordsworth,
                        who was not satisfied enough with <title level="m">The Prelude</title> to
                        publish it during his lifetime, Wedgwood found the task daunting, noting
                        “the difficulty [...] in investigating the origin of different feelings”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28478). He notes: <quote>One is obliged to
                            decompound one’s present feelings into their component sensations and
                            take for granted that the components are much the same as they were in
                            our earliest infancy—But it is impossible to make just allowance for the
                            growth to perfection of each ingredient of sensation in the long
                            interval between infancy &amp; manhood—still more impossible to
                            recollect their first development and earliest natures.
                            (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28478)</quote> A better plan of action,
                        then, was to try “to ascertain the truth of any hypothesis of the
                        association of the Powers of Mind by experimenting with children”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). Thus, Wedgwood’s theory was also
                        formed by observing his nieces and nephews, as he turned his attention to
                        formulating a pedagogical theory that took into account his materialist
                        theories of cognition. </p>

                <div type="section">
                    <head>Wedgwood’s Materialist Pedagogy</head>
                    <p>Wedgwood’s plans for an experimental school, with its emphasis on the
                        importance of affective feeling in association, are predicated on his
                        materialist theory of cognition. The most complete outline of his plan
                        appears in a letter to William Godwin dated 1797, printed in the first part
                        of Erdman’s article. His theory of education, on which his plan for the
                        school was based, however, exists mostly in unpublished notebooks, though
                        some of his insights have been summarized by Boole in an essay that precedes
                        Tremayne’s selection of excerpts from Wedgwood’s notebooks. The majority of
                        his notes on education and pedagogy are interspersed with his notes on
                        cognition and on association, more generally. The proximity of the notes on
                        cognition to the “Hints &amp; speculation on Education” throughout the
                        archival notebooks reveals how intertwined these two projects were
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). Wedgwood’s goal was to understand
                        human cognition from a materialist perspective and apply those insights to
                        rearing and educating children. </p>
                    <p>His approach relies on Hartley’s assumption that it was possible for “the
                        Affections and Passions” to “be analysed into their simple compounding
                        parts, by reversing the Steps of the Associations which concur to form them”
                        (81). Hartley claims that by analyzing the steps of association “we may
                        learn how to cherish and improve the good” characteristics and qualities and
                        “check and root out such as are mischievous and immoral;” we may also learn
                        “how to suit our Manner of Life, in some tolerable Measure, to our
                        intellectual and religious Wants” (81). Wedgwood believed he had arrived at
                        certain insights through his reading and observations that would allow him
                        formulate a plan that would produce certain types of adults. Wedgwood,
                        “devoid of any religious sense” (Doherty 305), adapted Hartley’s theory to a
                        secular context. While he did not believe that right association would lead
                        people to God, or theopathy in Hartley’s theory, he did think it dictated
                        behaviour, health, and affect. </p>
                    <p>From Wedgwood’s perspective the “great business of human education lies in
                        correcting, often in the most arbitrary manner, pleasurable and painful
                        feelings with a multitudinous variety of objects &amp; events, which, as yet
                        wholly indifferent to him [the child] are afterwards to become the principle
                        means &amp; instruments of all his pleasures &amp; pain” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                        Collection E40–28482). The problem for Wedgwood was the “arbitrary manner”
                        in which “a multitudinous variety of objects &amp; events,” that are in and
                        of themselves neutral, become associated with different states of feeling.
                        These associations determine the whole course of a person’s life, but
                        particularly his or her emotional and physical dispositions. Wedgwood’s aim
                        was to direct early childhood experiences “with the view of creating
                            <emph>agreeable</emph> feeling” in children so that that they would
                        mature into healthy, well-adjusted adults (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28482). </p>
                    <p>He began his investigation into pedagogy with the assumption that “Before
                        entering upon any of the principles of a regular plan of education, we
                        should decide upon the kind of being we wish to produce” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                        Collection E40–28463). In order to formulate a pedagogical plan, educators
                        first need to determine not what they want their pupils to learn, but how
                        they want them to <emph>be</emph> when they reach adulthood. The type of
                        beings that Wedgwood wished to produce were benevolent geniuses, who would
                        be capable of bringing to fruition the sort of just and equitable society
                        described in various philosophical treatises such as Godwin’s <title
                            level="m">Political Justice</title> (1793). Referring to Godwin and
                        other intellectuals whom he admired, he noted that “there are a dozen men in
                        this kingdom whom their own exertions, a good education, or fortunate
                        circumstances, have raised to such a pitch of moral excellence as to be
                        enabled to resist the ruinous temptations of wealth, power, &amp; sensual
                        pleasure” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28515/28). This temperament, in
                        his opinion, was a crucial part of genius. Wedgwood’s goal was to use the
                        principles of materialist cognitive science in order to consistently provide
                        “a good education” that would produce human beings of this kind.</p>
                    <p>Wedgwood’s experimental educational programme, which was designed to form
                        emotionally stable geniuses, had two primary objects: <quote>(I) To produce
                            a being possessing the largest possible means of affecting his own
                            happiness </quote>
                        <quote>(II) the happiness of others. (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                            E40–28486)</quote> These two attributes—the ability to make oneself
                        happy and the desire to make others happy—are, in this view, the foundation
                        of a citizenry capable of and motivated to enact an equitable society. For
                        this reason, “<title level="m">Emotion</title> is the chief subject of
                        Education,” for, emotionally healthy adults are “best adapted to produce
                        individual happiness; &amp; to call forth an activity which shall have the
                        widest influence upon the happiness of others” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28486). Because, for Wedgwood, emotion is an embodied phenomenon that is
                        closely tied to cognition and drives association, <quote>Education, consists
                            in </quote>
                        <quote>1 Sensation</quote>
                        <quote>2 Emotion </quote>
                        <quote>3 Idea, thought, notion, &amp;c </quote>
                        <quote>4 Muscular motion, or activity. (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                            E40–28486)</quote> By attending to these four interrelated physiological
                        phenomena, Wedgwood hoped to educate infants and children into adults who
                        would be able <quote>to subdue those useless &amp; harassing emotions of
                            sympathy with the unretrievably [<emph>sic</emph>] unfortunate whom he
                            is unable to relieve—to extract the agreeable from every situation &amp;
                            pay little attention to its opposite—in cases of danger, extreme
                            distress, instead of sinking under fear or unavailing grief, to summon
                            the energies of his mind, preserve tranquillity &amp; equilibrium that
                            shall enable him to act so as to afford the greatest possible relief—to
                            keep their eyes invariably fixed on the great standard of human conduct,
                            the production of Happiness. (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                            E40–28515/28)</quote><note place="foot" resp="editors"> In this excerpt
                            from a notebook, Wedgwood added the word “unretrievably” and crossed out
                            “whom he is unable to relieve.” I, uncharacteristically, included the
                            crossed out material because it was unlike Wedgwood to discourage
                            sympathy for “the unfortunate.” He generally encouraged benevolence and
                            charitable acts. The fact that these individuals cannot, for whatever
                            reason, be helped is the important defining attribute that makes
                            sympathy for them detrimental rather than desirable.</note></p>
                    <p>Wedgwood valued the qualities noted in this passage, most likely because he,
                        in his estimation, lacked them himself. Thus, the characteristics that he
                        hoped to cultivate in his pupils were freedom from “useless &amp; harassing
                        emotions,” a positive outlook that refuses to focus on the negative in
                        “every situation,” and “tranquillity and equilibrium” in all circumstances.
                        If these attributes could be cultivated in childhood not only would
                        education produce emotionally stable adults, but given the link between
                        emotion and the body, they would also be physically healthy, free of the
                        debilitating pain and chronic ill-health from which he suffered. In this
                        way, they would be able to make themselves and others happy, thus creating a
                        contented, and therefore just, society.</p>
                    <p>In order to achieve this goal, Wedgwood emphasized the physical and emotional
                        wellbeing of his hypothetical pupils, whom he envisioned as infants. In
                        order to attend to “Sensation,” his first proposition was to create an
                        environment that would “simplify &amp; render intense the first affections
                        of Sense &amp; [. . .] excite those affections under every possible
                        favorable circumstance of pleasure” (qtd. in Erdman I: 431). Simplification,
                        intensity, and pleasure, in his view, are the three necessary ingredients
                        for controlling and manipulating a baby’s bodily experience. Simplicity—or
                        introducing objects, sounds, scents, and so forth incrementally rather than
                        all at once—would reduce the chaos of sensory perception that he surmised
                        infants, with their undeveloped senses, must experience when thrust into an
                        uncontrolled environment of sensory stimuli. This manner of “administering
                        impressions” would solve the problems caused by having “their attention [. .
                        .] vaguely solicited by a thousand objects at once” (qtd. in Erdman I:
                            431).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> As a point of interest, in one
                            of his notebooks, Coleridge refers to the unstructured nature of
                            association as “an unintelligible affrightful Riddle, […] a chaos of <hi
                                rend="strikethrough">dark tailless</hi> dark limbs &amp; trunk,
                            tailless, headless, nothing begun &amp; nothing ended” (<title level="m"
                                >CN</title> III: 4057).</note> He conjectured that “if supplied too
                        rapidly with impression,” the infant would become overwhelmed, but “if
                        [impressions are supplied] too slowly, stupidity &amp; limited conception”
                        would result (qtd. in Erdman I: 431). Sensory stimuli must be controlled so
                        that strong connections would be formed between external objects and the
                        ideas that result from association. Furthermore, the infants’
                        superintendents must be careful to ensure that all stimuli associate under
                        the most pleasurable conditions possible. Otherwise, negative associations
                        would be made, thus making the child susceptible to bad temper and poor
                        health.</p>
                    <p>Wedgwood noted that educators and parents readily “instruct the <emph>eye
                            &amp; ear</emph>, in teaching language;” however, “Sight &amp; Touch are
                        the two important Senses” and should be given equal attention (qtd. in
                        Erdman I: 431). A child’s body should be educated with as much care as its
                        mind. Because sight and touch are so closely interrelated, “they must be
                        taught together” (qtd. in Erdman I: 431). To educate the senses, Wedgwood
                        proposed a “nursery” with “plain grey walls with one or two vivid objects
                        for sight &amp; touch” (qtd. in Erdman I: 431). He suggested that “hard
                        bodies be hung about them so as to continually irritate their palms as they
                        happen to come in contact” in order to encourage digital “manipulation”
                        (qtd. in Erdman I: 431). Slowly introducing infants to the external world
                        after their long confinement in the womb would reduce the shock of birth
                        trauma, which is compounded, according to Wedgwood, by the riotous assault
                        of sensation on the infant’s <emph>tabula rasa</emph> body. Properly
                        attending to the child’s bodily needs would, in Wedgwood’s theory of
                        embodied cognition, necessarily improve its mind.</p>
                    <p>Careful attention to the child’s surroundings was, as Richardson observes,
                        common to most associationist theories of education. While Wedgwood’s ideas
                        resemble those of other rationalist educators, there are some significant
                        differences. Lunar Society member Richard Lovell Edgeworth and his daughter
                        Maria Edgeworth, co-authors of <title level="m">Practical Education</title>,
                        proposed a “sanitized, carefully superintended version of the upper-class
                        home, with every detail arranged” (Richardson 54). In contrast to Wedgwood’s
                        hypothetical seminary, they “prefer[red] ‘domestic’ education to boarding
                        school” (55). The Edgeworths also recommended a series of “practical
                        experiments that children can perform,” while discouraging certain types of
                        literature that could potentially disorder their imagination (53). Along
                        similar lines, Beddoes designed a set of “rational toys” to inculcate
                        mathematical principles (Erdman II: 491). Wedgwood, however, was less
                        concerned with lessons and reading material than he was with ensuring that
                        the bodily needs of children would be met. He wanted to make sure that they
                        would not be subjected to distressing situations and that they would be
                        diverted from painful emotional states. Where the Edgeworths’ pupil would be
                        “carefully inculcated [with] habits of rational thought” (Richardson 57),
                        Wedgwood’s pupil was to be carefully cultivated to be physically and
                        emotionally robust. </p>
                    <p> In addition to providing suggestions for controlling and manipulating an
                        infant’s initial sensory data, Wedgwood also considered “how to connect high
                        degrees of pleasure with these impressions” (qtd. in Erdman I: 432). The
                        cultivation of pleasure and avoidance of pain is closely connected to the
                        fourth point on Wedgwood’s list, that is, “Muscular motion, or activity”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28486). Bodily discomfort, in his theory,
                        leads directly to poor health and low spirits. If a child is forced to
                        “remain torpid &amp; inert for some time, the health is deranged”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28452). Furthermore, “Pains of the body,
                        whether from hunger, sickness or external injury, when long continued,
                        induce a depression of spirits, or painful Emotion which endures a
                        considerable time after the painful Sensation has ceased” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                        Collection E40–28457). “<title level="m">Stretching</title>,” on the other
                        hand, “augments pleasure” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28457). Emotion
                        originates in the pleasurable or painful states of the infant body.
                        “Consider[ing] the early states of being in infancy,” Wedgwood conjectured
                        that breastfeeding, or the satiation of hunger, is a “most agreeable state”
                        in which the baby is “using muscular exertion” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28457). During this activity of nursing, the child’s “body is thrown
                        into action, kicks &amp; stretching” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28457). Thus, movement is pleasurable and restraint painful.</p>
                    <p>As pleasure and pain are always accompanied by the basic emotions of fear and
                        love in Wedgwood’s materialist theory of cognition, these bodily states lead
                        to affective states. If a child suffers from excessive bodily pain by being
                        forcibly restrained, not having its basic needs met, or from being neglected
                        when in distress, the long-term consequences can lead not only debility and
                        depression, but even to wickedness or malevolence. Wedgwood theorized that
                        the unsatisfied desire to have pain relieved leads, <quote>Perhaps in this
                            kind of progress [to] </quote>

                        pain, in Wedgwood’s conception of affective stages, causes individuals to
                        pass through the abovementioned phases until eventually they want to seek
                        revenge for the hurt caused them. Continued exposure to uncomfortable
                        situations results in bad tempered adults and even violence. After being
                        freed from restraint, for example, a child moves “with <emph>more</emph>
                        violence than he would otherwise do &amp; then a habit of violent Muscular
                        Exertion when under provocation, is daily strengthened” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                        Collection E40–28457), leading a child to respond with violence when
                        provoked. The response to pain in childhood becomes a habit that is not only
                        carried into adulthood, but forms the basis of a person’s emotional
                        character. “Hence, children, from rudely pushing each other, come to repeat
                        the pushes, or in other words, to beat each other;” they develop the
                        “mechanical” habit of responding with violence even when there is no pain
                        present, “as in the case of a choleric man” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28457). The “muscular energy” that accumulates in painful circumstances
                        “must expend itself on something;” hence, “Choleric men stamp the ground,
                        tear their hair, grind their teeth, break furniture” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                        Collection E40–28457).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Here we see
                            Wedgwood drawing on the theory of humours, but making the assumption
                            that these character types are not innate but formed through
                            association.</note> Thus, children should not be “left to fight out
                        their own battles [or] settle their own disputes” for “[w]hat can result
                        from such a method but tyranny &amp; injustice on the one hand &amp;
                        dejection and cunning on the other” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467).
                        The implications of this observation are that an unjust society is made up
                        of violent and “cunning” individuals. </p>
                    <p>Wedgwood urged “every parent [to] conceive of himself as one of the Trustees
                        of a benevolent power that wishes the happiness of Mankind, and of his
                        children as the instruments of its production” (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole
                        82). To create a society founded on equality and justice, parents and
                        educators must rear children who literally embody these principles. That is,
                        they should not merely claim to value democratic ideals such as liberty and
                        equality but must enact them with their whole beings, which includes both
                        the actions they take and their emotional natures. In addition to
                        disallowing children to hit each other, Wedgwood argued that “no violence
                        should be done to the feelings of the child” (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole
                        82). Teasing children, abruptly disrupting their pleasure, startling them,
                        or using insensitive methods to get them to comply with parents’ wishes
                        creates youngsters who are timid and easily frightened. Washing and dressing
                        them against their wills while “they supplicate for liberty and a cessation
                        to their pain” (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole 78) or “feigning to set out”
                        while pretending not to care if the child follows as a way to get them to
                        leave a place desensitizes them to the sufferings of others (79). If a
                        parent or caregiver ignores children’s pleas to stop hurting them, they
                        learn to disregard others’ pain. Likewise, feigning indifference teaches
                        them indifference. Wedgwood described these standard parenting tactics as “a
                        picture of brutal insensibility” that is “set before children who are
                        afterwards expected to sympathise in the distresses and attend to the
                        complaints of all about them!” (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole 78). “Children,”
                        he exhorted, “must be kept happy” if they are to grow up into benevolent
                        adults (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28525/116).</p>
                    <p>Wedgwood also advised not allowing children to have toys of their own.
                        Instead, with “regard to Property, it would be advisable that children
                        should have everything perfectly in common” to abolish the notion of private
                        property (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole 89), which he saw as the root of many
                        social ills. “The moral error of these notions is fully exposed,” he
                        claimed, “by our attempt to answer a child’s questioning of ‘What does
                            <emph>mine</emph> mean?’” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467). There
                        is “[n]o reply [that] can be made that does not directly inculcate
                        selfishness &amp; injustice” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467).
                        Personal possessive pronouns, in Wedgwood’s view, are necessarily predicated
                        on self-interest and promote self-seeking and personal gain at the expense
                        of others because conceptually they refer to private ownership. He advocated
                        the “extirpation” of these words from children’s vocabulary—“those
                        mischievous particles, <emph>My</emph>, <emph>Mine</emph>, <emph>His</emph>,
                            <emph>Yours</emph>,<emph> Hers</emph>, must never be pronounced in their
                        hearing” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467). For “children [who] have
                        already imbibed the corrupt notion of property to the evident risk of
                        injuring their temper,” he recommended “mak[ing] common presents to the
                        whole nursery” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28515/34). To further
                        abolish the notion of individual ownership and to reinforce the notion of
                        shared property, children “shou’d have all articles of dress in common that
                        their different sizes will admit of” and “[a]ll Playthings” should “be
                        common—the same of chairs, beds, &amp;c &amp;c” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28467). The goal, again, was to mould children to grow into adults who
                        espouse ideals of social equity.</p>
                    <p>Wedgwood drew his conclusions, in part, from his observations of his nieces
                        and nephews. In a plain grey notebook with the words “Baby Wedgwood [...]
                        her faults &amp; the associated habits” written lightly in pencil across the
                        front, Wedgwood makes the following observations: <quote>B—subject to
                            occasional dejection of spirits &amp; frequent fits of peevishness—These
                            often arise from want of food—And often from very slight
                            provocations—the origin of her extreme irritability must be searched for
                            in the method of her education. [...] When B. is vexed by any trivial
                            provocation, &amp; dejection of spirits strongly marked in her
                            countenance is associated with the events, wholly disproportionate to
                            the real nature. (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467)<note

                        prone to “dejection,” he theorized that “One part of the mischief done to
                        B’s temper arises from the strong notions infused into her of
                            <emph>exclusive property</emph>” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28467), which he saw as adding to her misery by increasing her desire
                        for things belonging to her brother and by causing anxiety when he played
                        with her toys. Equally notable, however, he observed that her distemper
                        often arose from physical causes, such as “want of food.” Her tendency to
                        overreact to “any trivial provocation” and “her feebleness of spirits &amp;
                        irritability of temper” are “[o]wing partly to a weak frame, &amp; partly to
                        injurious treatments” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467). Though
                        Wedgwood did not consider his brother and sister-in-law abusive parents, he
                        believed that even mild physical mistreatment, neglect of her basic needs,
                        and the inculcation of incorrect principles were responsible for B’s
                        disordered personality. </p>
                    <p>The typical childrearing strategies of the late eighteenth and early
                        nineteenth centuries, which failed to carefully heed the needs of the
                        child’s body, were to blame for sickly, distempered children. These
                        practices were implicitly based on the common belief that the soul and the
                        mind are immaterial principles that inhabit, but exist separately from, the
                        material body. If the mind and body are separate entities, then the body
                        needs little attention because it has little bearing on a child’s
                        temperament. Or, conversely, this view of the mind-body relationship could
                        lead to a theory in which the body must be mortified so that children do not
                        become tempted by sensual pleasures or the enjoyments of the flesh. With the
                        emergence of materialist theories of mind that privileged the body’s role in
                        cognition, thinkers such as Wedgwood looked more closely at how children
                        were treated physically, mentally, and emotionally. </p>
                    <p>In addition to outlining the flaws in B’s “method of education”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467), Wedgwood also offered suggestions
                        for rectifying the flaws in his niece’s character, which he also applied
                        more generally to his theory of education. To correct B’s tendency towards
                        temper tantrums, “[o]ne mode of cure, derived from medical analogy seems to
                        promise, at least <emph>alleviation</emph> consisting in shortening &amp;
                        mitigating the fit[s]” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467). He proposed
                        an “experiment” for increasing B’s capacity to “bear [...] sudden privations
                        with little discomposure” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467). In “this
                        experiment it wou’d be worth while to prepare some new &amp; diverting
                        toys—the more striking the better” to divert her from her “suffering”
                        (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467). To cure her of the invitiating
                        effects of “<emph>exclusive property</emph>,” Wedgwood suggested that
                        “Playthings shou’d be given which require assistance from another &amp;
                        being left alone with her brother, she wou’d naturally be led to associate
                        him with her amusements [...] If left much together, they wou’d soon become
                        necessary to each other” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467). The
                        purpose of these suggestions and experiments was to train B to become more
                        capable of bearing hardship cheerfully, to increase her ability to make
                        herself happy, and to encourage a sense of cooperation and fellowship with
                        her siblings. These qualities would allow her to mature into a healthy and
                        benevolent adult.</p>
                    <p>Wedgwood’s propositions for educating children at home or in an institutional
                        setting were similar. He recommended attention to children’s bodily and
                        emotional wellbeing by attending to diet, physical examinations, and
                        exercise so as to encourage children to develop characteristics and
                        qualities that allow them to succeed in life. The qualities that would
                        produce benevolent beings of genius included: <lg>
                            <l>1. Sound health, body robust &amp; active</l>
                            <l>2. Even, firm spirits</l>
                            <l>3. Presence of mind</l>
                            <l>4. Fortitude</l>
                            <l>5. Good humour—inirritable [<emph>sic</emph>] temper</l>
                            <l>6. A clear &amp; constant view of his duties to himself &amp; to his
                                species</l>
                            <l>7. A perfect assurance—inaccessibility to all diffidence,
                                bashfulness, confusion</l>
                            <l>8. Strong understanding, quickness of parts &amp;c.</l>
                            <l>9. Conciliating manners</l>
                            <l>10. Correct taste in Arts, Music, &amp;c. (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                                Collection E40–28463) </l>
                        </lg> This list gives insight into the ideal subject that Wedgwood hoped to
                        produce through the process of education. This being would hypostatize the
                        social ideals of the political radicals with whom he consorted and be free
                        of the physical and emotional debilities from which Wedgwood, himself,
                        suffered.</p>

                    <head>Conclusion</head>
                    <p>Wedgwood’s pedagogical goal was to “form by education” individuals who would
                        not ignore the social ills found in “our jails, hospitals, [...] our
                        Bridewalls [<emph>sic</emph>] and Poor Houses,” but would “hunt out and
                        expose that misery in its gloomiest recesses and combat those fatal
                        prejudices which have chiefly occasioned it by splitting society into
                        subordinate classes” (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole 70). In order to create
                        these concerned and motivated future citizens, he argued that educators
                        should determine which qualities they wished to cultivate in their pupils
                        then implement a plan of education based on the principles of materialist
                        cognitive science, which privileged the body by making it necessary to
                        cognition. He held that it is “important [. . .] in Education [. . .] [t]o
                        implant as early as possible habits of real industry and serious occupation,
                        such as will exercise the body and [. . .] furnish that happiness of
                        pleasure for which alone we live” (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole 69).<note
                            place="foot" resp="editors"> While Wedgwood's discussions of education
                            often assume male pupils, here, as with his discussion of B's
                            temperament, he is discussing the benefits of exercise for women and
                            girls. He argues, along the lines of Wollstonecraft, that women are
                            “delicate, feeble, and sickly” because, unlike men, they do not exercise
                            their bodies (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole 68).</note> Thus, he believed
                        that attending to the body was the way to properly form the mind. </p>
                    <p>Wedgwood’s theory is wonderfully idealistic, but aspects of it are extreme.
                        For example, in the interest of controlling early association he cautioned
                        that “the child must never go out of doors or leave his own apartment,” as
                        the “explication of Nature would be attended to with great difficulty” (qtd.
                        in Erdman I: 431). This was an idea that Wordsworth and Coleridge, with
                        their idealized concept of the child of nature, found repugnant, as Erdman
                        notes. Furthermore, it is highly impracticable. Elsewhere, Wedgwood
                        suggested that in order to instil fortitude and tranquillity in the face of
                        danger <quote>the parent might invite an attack of a fierce bull, stand with
                            perfect composure till the animal be within two or three paces of him,
                            then suddenly expand an umbrella, hold his hat before his face, or
                            somehow contrive to amuse or terrify the foe; whilst his child, on the
                            other side of the stile, shall witness his intrepidity and address, and
                            by degrees, practise the same feat himself in company with his parent.
                            Or the child might begin his triumph with a raging turkey-cock. (qtd. in
                            Tremayne and Boole 85)</quote> More realistically perhaps, but radical
                        for his day, was his suggestion that “Hospitals, prisons, madhouses should
                        be visited, but in so cautious a manner that the mind might experience no
                        shock, but be gradually familiarised with their horrors” (qtd. in Tremayne
                        and Boole 85). Though Wedgwood spent time with his nieces and nephews,
                        clearly he had no children of his own or he may not have made such
                        far-fetched suggestions. Nonetheless, his goal was to inculcate children
                        with steady emotional character, physical health, and moral
                        fortitude—characteristics that could not be taught, but must be embodied. </p>
                    <p>“Moral sensibility [could be] nicely cultivated during education,” but only
                        because “Feeling connects copiously with due notions of things, [and]
                        creates a species of intuition in conduct” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                        E40–28470). Thus, Wedgwood proposed an educational programme that educated
                        children’s emotions by focusing on their bodies. In keeping with his mentors
                        and his contemporaries, Wedgwood theorised that cognition is an embodied
                        phenomenon. Like the Edgeworths, Beddoes, and other rationalist educators he
                        drew upon the principles of association as he formulated his plan. Unlike
                        these thinkers, however, he emphasized the importance of feeling, not just
                        in association but also in education. Writing from his own experience of
                        mental, physical, and emotional torment, Wedgwood strove to formulate a plan
                        that would not only free individuals from depression and ill health, but
                        would also create citizens capable of enacting the ideal society of which he
                        and his radical associates dreamed. Had he been healthier or lived longer
                        perhaps his experimental school would have made it beyond the hypothetical
                        stage; or perhaps he would have been able to have children of his own on
                        which to experiment. As it stands, his legacy remains in primarily archival
                        form, but gives us rich insight into the interconnections of the mind-matter
                        debates, theories of pleasure and pain, and pedagogy in the early Romantic
                        period.</p>
