            </header><br/><br/><div class="wrapper">
               <p>In the last twenty years, scholars of Romanticism have approached education as a subject
                  of historical inquiry, as well as a modern conundrum. Some have turned their attention
                  to the rich debates in the Romantic era about education and children’s literature,
                  while others have entered a discussion taking place today among academics, administrators,
                  institutional trustees, and lawmakers about the nature of higher education, in particular
                  the place of the humanities within university and college curricula. At first glance
                  these two debates, separated by nearly two hundred years, seem far removed from one
                  another. When cultural scholars discuss eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century education,
                  we most often mean primary or secondary education, whereas our conversations about
                  contemporary education typically center on undergraduate pedagogy at both the classroom
                  and institutional level. Pedagogy roundtables at NASSR and ASECS, for example, focus
                  on best practices for teaching historical texts to today’s college students.

                           Eighteenth-Century Studies (ASECS) has included at least fourteen sessions (poster
                           sessions, roundtable discussions, and panel presentations) devoted to classroom teaching,
                           including the annual panels “Innovative Course Design” and “Let’s Get Engaged!,” as
                           well as the annual poster session “Teaching the Eighteenth Century.” At least two
                           of these sessions are also slated for the 2015 annual meeting of ASECS. The North

                  </div> Yet, many of the same issues that concern us today pervaded late eighteenth-century
                  education: the worry that students are distracted by technology, the complaint that
                  students have become uncivil, or the fear that economic rather than intellectual achievement
                  drives education. In “Children, Adolescents, and Fashionable Urban Society in Eighteenth-Century
                  England,” Peter Borsay argues that the mid-eighteenth century witnessed a sea change
                  in middle-class education as pedagogues increasingly taught practical skills to help
                  children advance economically in the real world (56). Borsay’s research suggests that
                  the movement toward pragmatic skills, though certainly influenced by philosophers
                  like Jean-Jacques Rousseau, was also a reaction to changing ideas about the purpose
                  of education and the socio-economic environment young people would encounter as adults.
                  Such concerns can certainly be felt on college campuses today: as Jim Engell and Arthur
                  Dangerfield have rightfully argued in <em>Saving Higher Education in the Age of Money</em> (2005), decisions at the college level are often made according to financial concerns,
                  with students more likely to choose and administrators more likely to prioritize science,
                  engineering, mathematics, and business programs over departments of art history, English,
                  philosophy, and classics (1-2).</p>
            </div>
            <p>Such similarities within education, though, exist not simply on the macro level of
               policy and research but also on the micro level of daily classroom teaching. Educators
               from Charlotte Smith to Hannah More sought, much as we do today, to make literature
               relevant to young students deluged with media and worried about money. It is the relationship
               in approach and concern between the educators of the Romantic era and today that has
               motivated this edition. This collection combines studies of pedagogical history in
               the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century with discourses about innovations
               taking place in today’s classrooms. By including essays on both topics, we hope to
               expose the breadth and richness of educational debates in Romanticism, to shed light
               on new ways to teach Romantic texts, and, finally, to encourage readers to find links

               <h2><span class="head">Innovations in Romantic-Era Education: New Audiences, Old Concerns</span></h2>
               <p>In the Romantic era, questions about classroom innovations and the potential benefits
                  and dangers of literacy were debated in the popular press, exclaimed from pulpits,
                  and dissected by all manner of writers and theorists. From the 1780s to the 1830s,
                  these disputants struggled to identify what the so-called lower classes—women, children,
                  and poor people in particular—should learn and read. Technological improvements in
                  printmaking meant that the written word was more accessible than ever before, and
                  this accessibility sparked debates over the dangers of literacy and methods to combat
                  the widespread dissemination of texts and ideas. Perhaps no figure exemplifies this
                  anxiety over pedagogical change more than Sarah Trimmer. Trimmer’s <em>Guardian of Education</em> (1802) is as conservative as it is reactionary, never more so than when declaiming
                  its own necessity: <span class="quote">‘Many people […] will be apt to consider us in the light of ALARMISTS, if we talk
                     of <em>a conspiracy against </em>CHRISTIANITY <em>and all </em>SOCIAL ORDER, […] one of which is, endeavouring to infect the minds of the rising
                     generation, through the medium of <em>Books of Education</em> and <em>Children’s Books</em>; but that such a conspiracy does actually exist has been proved by undeniable authority,
                     (as we shall shew in the course of our work). (2)’</span> Such authority proves to be Trimmer herself, as a mother, teacher, author, and high
                  church Anglican. Trimmer promises in the <em>Guardian</em> to hunt down radicalism and immorality in children’s books. Unsurprisingly, she finds
                  juvenile literature attacked on all sides: unlike in her own youth, contemporary books
                  are “replete with hidden mischief” (64) and contemporary publishers so eager to turn
                  a profit that they will sell anything, even books that “threaten the utter perversion
                  of all principle” (65). Most alarming, Trimmer deduces a change not only in the content
                  of children’s books but also in their educational principles: <span class="quote">‘Indeed numbers of modern publications for children are evidently calculated to bring
                     about the same changes of system in the education of the children of this nation,
                     as has been produced by similar means on the Continent, […] and if not checked in
                     their progress, the consequences will be equally fatal to the principle and morality
                     of this nation. (64) ’</span> Trimmer’s choice of diction is deliberate, designed to inflame a paranoid socio-political
                  culture already concerned that the French revolution could migrate to British soil.
                  For Trimmer, the dangerous effects of this pedagogical change are pervasive and imminent,
                  and the cultural price of such literature is nothing less than the loss of national
                  character and public peace.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>William Godwin’s Juvenile Library, the children’s publishing house he established
                     in 1805 (and the subject of the editors’ ongoing <em>Romantic Circles Electronic Edition</em>), is another example of contemporary anxiety regarding what types of literature should
                     be available to children. In 1813 an anonymous spy sent a report to the Home Office
                     about Godwin’s subversive activities. His concern was not Godwin’s widely received
                     and oft-republished <em>Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and Its Influence on General Happiness and Principles </em>(1793), nor his public defense of Thomas Hardy, John Thelwall, and John Horne Tooke
                     at their treason trials in 1795, but rather his publication of children’s textbooks. <em>Fables Ancient and Modern </em>(1805), Godwin’s version of Aesop’s tales, may not strike readers today as particularly
                     pernicious, yet this anonymous spy disagrees, envisioning Godwin’s literature as a
                     radical project to undermine the government by harnessing the anger of the working
                     classes. By offering “every work […] that can be required in the early instruction
                     of children,” the report argues, the Juvenile Library advocates “every principle professed
                     by the infidels and republicans of these days.”
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>We would like to thank Pamela Clemit, who directed us to the original spy report,
                              document TS11/951/3494 in the Public Record Office or “Domestic, Geo. III, 1813. January
                              to March. No. 217.”</span></div>
                     </div> The result, the spy warns, may be a civil war: “By such means did Voltaire and his
                     brethren for twenty years before the Revolution in France spread infidelity and disloyalty
                     through the remotest provinces of that country, and we know too well how they succeeded”
                     (qtd. in Barnett and Gustafson 2).</p>
               </div>
               <p>The recommendations of Trimmer’s <em>Guardian</em> and the concerns about Godwin’s “radical” publishing venture speak to the cultural
                  space of education in early-nineteenth-century Britain. Trimmer may be an alarmist,
                  but she was not an anomaly. Education—in particular early school—was widely regarded
                  as the cradle of future social and spiritual beliefs and, by extension, national health
                  and longevity. Romanticists have long recognized the cultural significance of education
                  in the period. From the 1980s to the early 2000s, writers such as Mitzi Myers and
                  Donelle Ruwe established that children’s literature was an untapped yet crucially
                  important area of intellectual inquiry. Scholars ranging from Alan Richardson and
                  James Holt McGavran to, more recently, Jackie Horne and Andrew O’Malley have uncovered
                  new information about the nature of childhood and children’s literature in the eighteenth
                  and early nineteenth centuries. Their combined work suggests that education was a
                  crucial testing ground in the Romantic era for formulating socioeconomic, religious,
                  political, and ultimately national values. In the early nineteenth century, education
                  was considered a ground zero for the creation of a civil society in a rapidly expanding
                  and unequal world.</p>
               <p>Though alarmist, Trimmer’s observations about the deluge of new educational materials
                  were indeed accurate. The Romantic era witnessed broad experimentation with and theorization
                  of education at various levels. As Trimmer rightfully acknowledges, Rousseau’s <em>Émile, ou De l’éducation </em>(1762) profoundly influenced British educational philosophy. Thomas Day and Richard
                  Lovell Edgeworth, famously, sought to raise children according to Rousseau’s model.
                  Maria Edgeworth, Mary Wollstonecraft, Charlotte Smith, William Godwin, Frances Burney,
                  and others engaged with his ideas on an intellectual level, picking those elements
                  that made sense while criticizing those that seemed objectionable. Wollstonecraft’s
                  <em>Vindication of the Rights of Woman </em>(1792) and Edgeworth’s <em>Belinda </em>(1801), for example, attacked Rousseau’s educational program for women as inadequate
                  and infantilizing, and the Rousseauvian tutor-figure appears unfavorably in Godwin’s
                  <em>Fleetwood, or the New Man of Feeling </em>(1805) and Burney’s <em>Camilla, or a Portrait of Youth </em>(1796).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Changes within British education, however, go well beyond Rousseau’s pedagogical philosophy,
                     as Borsay has demonstrated. Though it certainly imported continental children’s books
                     and educational treatises, mid- to late-eighteenth century Britain became a testing
                     ground for homegrown educational innovations driven by inadequacies within the pedagogical
                     options available. Grammar schools had been set up in the Renaissance in order to
                     educate poor children, but according to Alan Richardson’s <em>Literature, Education, and Romanticism </em>(1994), by the mid- to late- eighteenth century they had largely begun to exclude
                     poor children in favor of middle and upper class pupils (81). Public institutions
                     like Eton and Westminster were almost exclusively the purview of wealthy children,
                     and they drew criticism for a savage, corrupting student culture, in particular the
                     fagging system that exposed the vulnerability of the lower classmen to the brutality
                     of the upperclassmen.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                              (3)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For example, young Percy Shelley’s resistance to fagging and other such “Shelley-baits”
                              at Eton is recounted in many biographies, including James Bieri’s Percy Bysshe Shelley:
                              A Biography: Youth's Unextinguished Fire, 1792-1816, (University of Delaware Press,
                              2004). In The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley (1858), Thomas Jefferson Hogg identifies
                              Shelley’s refusal to submit to the “aggravated miseries” inflicted upon the youngest
                              and weakest students by the older “tyrants” as an early example of the poet’s opposition
                              to tyranny in all its forms.</span></div>
                     </div> These institutions, moreover, focused largely on teaching classical languages, a pedagogy
                     whose value was, according to Borsay and Richardson, being questioned (Borsay 56,
                     Richardson 80). Oxford and Cambridge universities, meanwhile, excluded Dissenters
                     and other non-Anglicans. In short, while an educational system—<em>ad hoc</em> at best—was in place in Britain in the eighteenth century, it did not meet the needs
                     of women, Dissenters, and working class children and, indeed, served only a wealthy,
                     male minority of the population.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The Romantic era thus is characterized by efforts to improve upon pre-existing institutions
                  and curricula, and many such efforts attempted to ameliorate issues debated since
                  the early eighteenth century, such as the inadequate instruction of girls and poor
                  children. Richardson’s research suggests that educational debates became particularly
                  heated in the 1790s and again in the 1820s (65, 214). Education changes correlate
                  with an explosion in publishing—especially children’s book publishing—as well as with
                  the rise of female pedagogues, such as Anna Barbauld, Wollstonecraft, and Trimmer,
                  and with increased socioeconomic, cultural, and political turbulence. They also bookend
                  what has traditionally been seen as the temporal boundaries of the Romantic era, thereby
                  highlighting the centrality of educational reform within this period as a means of
                  assessing and addressing social tensions. </p>
               <p>One area that has received particular attention by scholars is the growth of women’s
                  education in the eighteenth century. If education for young men was decentralized
                  and non-compulsory, it was even more so for girls, for whom there was no established
                  educational system like the public schools and universities available to young men.
                  The eighteenth century saw the increase in boarding schools for girls, though many
                  girls were educated at home by a parent or governess. Women’s basic education throughout
                  the eighteenth century consisted of arithmetic, reading, writing, and sewing. Better
                  schools and home schooling would provide instruction in dancing, music, comportment,
                  embroidery, and later botany, geography, and modern foreign languages. By the 1780s
                  and 1790s, many women writers were rethinking female education through treatises and
                  children’s literature; most prominent among these were Wollstonecraft, Smith, Hester
                  Chapone, Eleanor Fenn, and More. Some writers sought to cultivate qualities like temperance,
                  rationality, and benevolence as an antidote not only to the attainment of fashionable
                  accomplishments thought to characterize women’s education but also to the metaphorical
                  lobotomizing of women epitomized by Rousseau’s Sophie. As Myers argues in “Impeccable
                  Governesses, Rational Dames, and Moral Mothers,” writers like Wollstonecraft, Fenn,
                  and Smith innovated a pedagogical fiction that would inculcate such qualities through
                  the figure of the female mentor. </p>
               <p>While Wollstonecraft and others sought to make female education more rigorous, other
                  pedagogues turned to the educational needs of working-class children and adults. The
                  Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) was founded in 1698 and was active
                  in fits and starts throughout the eighteenth century, seeing a brief resurgence in
                  the 1820s (Richardson 214). Its primary purpose was to teach reading and catechism
                  to poor children. The SPCK eventually found itself competing with Charity Schools,
                  Sunday Schools, and Industrial Schools. Although rivals, these charitable institutions
                  provided an alternative to the local “dame” schools that had cropped up across Britain.
                  Without national oversight, dame schools ran the gamut from legitimate private schools
                  to little more than housing services for poor children; furthermore, as Richardson
                  observes, its teachers were often accused of being variously uneducated, overworked,
                  underpaid, and even drunk (87). </p>
               <p>SPCK and other charity schools were founded on a largely unappealing idea of encouraging
                  poor children to understand and submit to their own subordinate, God-given positions,
                  to be obedient to rules and employers, and to “better” themselves by mimicking middle
                  class morality. These efforts were matched by other endeavors to replace broadsides
                  and chapbooks with improving stories (of which Hannah More’s <em>Cheap Repository Tracts</em> are the most famous). Both SPCK and Sunday schools arose as a means of addressing
                  an increasingly literate British society. The SPCK’s and Sunday Schools’ answer was
                  to confine students’ access to literature to the bible and devotional tracts; likewise
                  Mechanics Institutes, though initially founded by skilled laborers as an antidote
                  to the religious lessons offered in charity schools, eventually ceded control to middle
                  class “sponsors” who limited their reading to certain types of so-called improving
                  books. These limitations reflected middle class desires to control and channel literacy
                  in order to encourage the inculcation of middle class values, including industry,
                  order, temperance, cleanliness, and restraint, to their social inferiors (Richardson
                  220). As Richardson explains, it was not until the 1820s that the message of subordination
                  and religious obedience gave way to a new discourse about education for the poor primarily
                  advanced by James Mill, Jeremy Bentham, Henry Bourgham, Francis Jeffrey, and Charles
                  Knight (214-215). As Richardson argues, this new discourse maintained that “literacy
                  was to be managed rather than restrained” and that a more liberally educated workforce
                  “would prove a more sure path to social stability (and limited reform) than would
                  the combination of passive literacy, Christian morals, and deferential behavior advanced
                  by an earlier generation of educationalists” (215).</p>

               <h2><span class="head">The essays</span></h2>
               <p>Modern teachers of the Romantic era might find unexpected sympathy with some of Trimmer’s
                  less hysterical complaints, such as her concern that students are saturated in popular
                  media that degrade their intellects. Any teacher who has complained about losing his
                  or her students to the lure of iPhones or who has sighed over students’ use of emoticons
                  in an email can understand, at least in part, Trimmer’s position. Today, there is
                  a tangible sense that we are at a moment of change within education. As Engell and
                  Dangerfield argue, monetary concerns seem more directly entrenched in the curricular
                  decisions made at universities than in previous generations, especially as administrators,
                  educators, and students seek to determine the role of humanistic study within modern
                  higher education. Two issues that become intertwined in literary and cultural history
                  classrooms are humanities and technology, as instructors seek to innovate pedagogical
                  methods to reach a new generation of students. For Romanticists, the most pressing
                  questions remain as straightforward as their answers are complicated: how can we encourage
                  students to engage with Romantic texts in thoughtful and thought-provoking ways? What
                  values will they derive from studying old texts? How can technology improve our ability
                  to teach these texts and to make them relevant? </p>
               <p>Towards these ends, this edition has been organized into two separate but conversational
                  sections: <em>Pedagogies in Romanticism </em>and <em>Pedagogies of Romanticism</em>. The first addresses questions of Romantic-era theories and practices by exploring
                  four figures who grappled with questions about how and why one learns: Tom Wedgewood,
                  Wollstonecraft, Smith, and Lord Byron. The second set of essays focuses on the teaching
                  of Romanticism today. While some examine ways of utilizing digital resources, including
                  gaming, in the modern Romantics classroom, others consider more traditional pedagogical
                  methods, such as close reading, in new ways.</p>
               <p>In part one’s “‘Hints &amp; Speculation on Education’: Tom Wedgwood’s Materialist Pedagogy,”
                  Lisa Ann Robertson considers Wedgwood’s role within the intellectual history of the
                  early Romantic period, including contemporary debates about education and materialist
                  theories of cognition. Wedgwood, she argues, is today a marginalized figure valued
                  more for his associations with William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge than
                  for his own work, yet he “is significant because [he] gathered together several strands
                  of Romantic philosophical thought” to form “a practical plan of education that would
                  bring about a society of geniuses committed to the principles of liberty, equality,
                  communitarian values, and social justice.” Reading Wedgwood’s manuscripts, accounts
                  of his own physical ailments, and plans for an experimental school, as well as texts
                  that influenced him (such as Joseph Priestley’s edition of <em>Hartley’s Theory of Mind </em>(1775) and Erasmus Darwin’s <em>Zoonomia</em> (1794)), Robertson traces Wedgwood’s understanding of the relationships between emotions,
                  thought, and association and situates the heretofore under-recognized influence of
                  his work within the larger context of Romantic-era theories of cognition and education.</p>
               <p>Suzanne L. Barnett’s “Generic Mutability and the Pedagogy of Realism in Charlotte
                  Smith’s <em>The Romance of Real Life</em> and Mary Wollstonecraft’s <em>Original Stories from Real Life</em>” positions those two works in larger conversations about gender, genre, authority,
                  and reading’s role in education in the Romantic period. Barnett argues that these
                  women writers’ experiments with the hybrid genres of “romance of real life” and (fictional)
                  “stories from real life” stem from anxieties about the suitability of women for fiction-writing
                  and attempts to marshal the “serious” genre of historiography and the pedagogy of
                  the real into the service of the moral education of both children <em>and</em> their mothers.</p>
               <p>In “Byron’s <em>Cain</em> and Romantic Education,” Cassandra Falke places <em>Cain</em> within Romantic discourses of learning and compares Byron’s depiction of “heroic
                  learning” to Romantic-era pedagogy that stressed moral discipline and education as
                  preparation for a life of useful work. In Byron’s time, the idea that reading should
                  prepare the lower classes for utility and virtuous servitude was complicated by <em>Cain</em>’s almost immediate piracy, which, according to its contemporary critics, put a tool
                  of potentially “dangerous disturbance” into the hands of ignorant and unprepared working-class
                  readers. Falke paints Cain’s desire to learn and the play’s treatment of knowledge
                  as not only a locus of conversation about hubris and Byron’s blasphemy but also as
                  a “subtle inquiry into the possibility and limits of knowledge.”</p>
               <p>The second part of this edition turns from the pedagogical theories of Romantic-period
                  writers to consider how modern educators might most successfully teach Romantic literature
                  and culture to twenty-first-century students. “Universal Truths, Unacknowledged Legislators:
                  Teaching the First Sentence of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>” offers a targeted yet expansive classroom exercise in which students analyze word-by-word
                  Austen’s famous line: “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in
                  possession of a large fortune, must be in want of a wife.” This process “unfolds historical
                  and formal problems of Romanticism,” including Austen’s criticism of gender and class
                  constructions. Chris Washington compares the self-reflexive irony of this first sentence
                  to the rest of the novel and illuminates how students have responded to such a laser-focused
                  classroom assignment and what it teaches them about reading Romantic texts.</p>
               <p>“Imagining the Internet through the Romantics” chronicles Brian Rejack’s attempts
                  to allow students “to see digital culture from a shifted intellectual perspective”
                  and reflects on “the overlapping domains of teaching and research, new and old media,
                  and the imaginative frameworks that help us place their iterative connections.” Rejack
                  considers how the inherent immateriality of digital culture intersects with the “Romantic
                  ideology” of textual media and how his students’ process of imaginatively “embodying”
                  Romantic texts via new media reflects the relationship between imagination and matter.
                  Using texts as disparate as an AT&amp;T commercial, Leonardo Solaas’s net-art installation<em>Google Variations</em>, Apple iCloud promotional materials, and Percy Shelley’s “The Cloud,” Rejack describes
                  how he invites his students to recognize “the ways in which they live as historical
                  bodies in and of the world” and asks his readers to consider the evolving roles of
                  digital technology in the classroom.</p>
               <p>In “Revisiting the Radical Republican Publishers of the Romantic Era in the Digital
                  Era,” Michael Demson considers another intersection of print and digital media: employing
                  digital resources in a course on four republican publishers of the Romantic era (William
                  Blake, Leigh Hunt, William Hone, and William Cobbett). Demson suggests that such a
                  course would have been nearly impossible before resources like <em>Romantic Circles, The William Blake Archive, </em>and <em>The William Hone Biotext</em> that make available previously inaccessible (or at least difficult and costly to
                  access) texts and images to both graduate and undergraduate classrooms. Demson notes
                  that, for example, it is now possible for his students to search for phrases like
                  “rotten borough” across hundreds of publications or to trace the ways an author or
                  periodical cover a particular story over time. Demson describes how a combination
                  of traditional and digital media can combine in the classroom to offer students a
                  richer experience of Romantic-era print culture.</p>
               <p>In the final essay in this edition, “Playing with Independence: Using Multiplayer
                  Online Narratives to Explore Independent and Interdependent Tensions in Romantic-Period
                  Literature,” Jon Saflofske explores how multiplayer games enable students to explore
                  questions about character and plot in Romantic fiction. The fact that these games
                  are specifically multiplayer and require cooperation between students “simulates opportunities
                  for negotiating the tensions between independence and interdependence,” according
                  to Saklofske, and inspires collaborative creativity (and occasionally productive frustration)
                  that mirrors both the experience of living in the late eighteenth century and also
                  of working together on a creative project. </p>
               <p>As a collection, these seven essays offer diverse ways of thinking about the intersections
                  of Romanticism and pedagogy: both what Romantic-era figures themselves thought about
                  the processes of learning and teaching and also what we as modern educators might
                  consider as we present these texts and figures to our students. It is our hope that
                  they will contribute to ongoing conversations among scholars and teachers of Romanticism
                  about the history and future of humanities education, and in particular will foster
                  cross-historical conversations. </p>

               Eighteenth-Century Studies (ASECS) has included at least fourteen sessions (poster
               sessions, roundtable discussions, and panel presentations) devoted to classroom teaching,
               including the annual panels “Innovative Course Design” and “Let’s Get Engaged!,” as
               well as the annual poster session “Teaching the Eighteenth Century.” At least two
               of these sessions are also slated for the 2015 annual meeting of ASECS. The North
               American Society for the Study of Romanticism (NASSR) offers fewer pedagogical panels
