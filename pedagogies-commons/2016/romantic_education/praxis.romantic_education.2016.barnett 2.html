            <p class="noCount">This paper investigates the didactic and pedagogic values of Romantic realism by looking
               at the ways in which Wollstonecraft and Smith, in particular, experiment with the
               synthesis of Romance and history and how these experiments form the core of their
               pedagogical projects undertaken within the growing genre of children’s prose. Wollstonecraft’s
               and Smith’s productions for young readers address the anxiety about women’s ability
               to employ historical fact and realism in serious literature and replace women’s “state
               of perpetual childhood” with the powerful roles of educator and arbitrator. But these
               authors also help create a hybrid genre that allows them to temper history with the
               attractiveness of Romance and to elevate fiction by infusing it with realism, thus
               turning fiction into a medium that can address history, society, and all aspects of
               “real life” as it acts as a powerful pedagogical tool on young minds. </p>

               <p>Mary Wollstonecraft’s second published work, <em>Original Stories from Real Life; with Conversations, Calculated to Regulate the Affections,
                     and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness</em> (1788), was her first commercial literary success, running into six editions over
                  twelve years and establishing her reputation as an authority on both childhood education
                  and literature for children. However, despite its contemporary success, <em>Original Stories</em><div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                           Richardson’s Literature, Education, and Romanticism: Reading as Social Practice, 1780-1832
                           (1994), perhaps the most extensive treatment of the subject thus far—the title is
                           usually elided to simply “Original Stories”, thus de-emphasizing the work’s apparent
                           preoccupation with realism; for the sake of brevity, however, this essay will hereafter
                           use the same abbreviation.</span></div>
                  </div> has fallen off the radar of recent critical explorations of romantic-era children’s
                  literature and of romantic views of childhood, perhaps mentioned in passing or relegated
                  to a footnote while whole chapters are devoted to the works of Maria Edgeworth, William
                  Wordsworth, Hannah More, or Sarah Trimmer. It is frequently dismissed as an anomalous
                  example of a radical writer producing apparently conservative and apolitical work
                  for children (see: Mary V. Jackson and Geoffrey Summerfield, among others

                           he sees as its bland conservatism; his study’s very first mention of Wollstonecraft’s
                           work is to claim that “Original Stories has a strong claim to be the most sinister,
                           ugly, overbearing book for children ever published. It is permeated by a grim, humorless,
                           tyrannical spirit of hectoring and unswerving spiritual and mental rectitude—all in
                           the name of healthy growth: a dream of reason producing, indeed, a veritable monster
                           in the form of Mrs. Mason” (229).</span></div>
                  </div>) or as a mere illustration within discussions of radical writers for adults who “also”
                  wrote for children. The role that Wollstonecraft’s works for children played in the
                  veritable explosion of literature for children in the last two decades of the eighteenth
                  century has yet to be explored fully.</p>
            </div>
            <p>However, no attention whatsoever has yet been focused on <em>Original Stories</em>’ own generic hybridity and the implications that such hybridity has both on the way
               we read the <em>Stories</em> themselves and on the ways in which we can place that work within Wollstonecraft’s
               body of work and amongst the parallel productions of her contemporaries. <em>Original Stories</em> is a unique amalgam that owes a part of its makeup to the popular moral tales for
               children (from the works produced by John Newbery earlier in the century through the
               newer productions of writers like Trimmer and Anna Barbauld) but also draws on elements
               of romance (as we shall see, a controversial subject for children’s reading) and the
               so-called “romance of real life,” a genre identified by Michael Gamer and popularized
               in part by Wollstonecraft’s contemporaries Charlotte Smith and Maria Edgeworth. Even
               the most cursory glance at Wollstonecraft’s work’s title hints at its generic heterogeneity.
               “Original stories” suggests an imaginative source, while the phrase “from real life”
               seems to make the paradoxical claim that the stories are both empirically true and
               verifiable while at the same time “original” creations. The next portion of the title
               informs us that these “stories” contain “conversations,” again implying a quasi-journalistic
               truth claim, while “calculated,” “regulated,” and “form” all suggest that this is
               a book with a premeditated mission and pedagogical purpose. Finally “affections,”
               “mind,” “truth,” and “goodness” all present the qualities and entities that Wollstonecraft’s
               project aims either to instill or improve and are themes she will return to in later
               works, including the attempt in <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> to carve out a space for the rational female mind capable of housing both “affections”
               and reason.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p><em>Original Stories </em>is not Wollstonecraft’s only work that presents a vexed relationship between different
                  genres, and specifically between the antipodal pulls of realism and romanticism, rationality
                  and imagination: note for example the generic funambulism in <em>Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman</em> (1798) between romance’s impossibly dramatic characters (represented by the gothic
                  sufferer Maria and her improbable prison romance) and passages of stark realism (as
                  in Jemima’s chillingly realistic narratives of society’s underbelly). Wollstonecraft’s
                  published works encompass the genres of “thoughts,” a “view,” and “letters,” and the
                  self-presentations of the two <em>Vindications</em> as explorations of the realities of contemporary society are offset by the sense of
                  novelistic un-reality proclaimed by the title of the pseudo-autobiographical <em>Mary: a Fiction</em> (1788); clearly Wollstonecraft was no stranger to generic experimentation. But her
                  participation in the genre of “tales” or “romances of real life” (itself a generic
                  hybrid) in her only original work aimed at children suggests a particular set of ideological
                  assumptions regarding the didactic and pedagogic values of realism. The fact that
                  this questioning of genres was of particular interest to the period’s women writers,
                  coupled with the fact that, as Mitzi Meyers demonstrates, women were not only the
                  principal producers of literature for children, but also among the leading educational
                  theorists of the day, suggests that an exploration of precisely what Wollstonecraft
                  intended with her “original,” instructive stories “from real life” aimed at children
                  might help clarify not only Wollstonecraft’s own literary and philosophical projects
                  but also the growing genre in which her <em>Original Stories</em> participates. When we consider that Charlotte Smith’s <em>The Romance of Real Life</em> was published in 1787, at the time Wollstonecraft was writing her <em>Original Stories</em>, and that Wollstonecraft was familiar with Smith’s work due to the former’s position
                  as a reviewer for <em>The Analytical Review</em>,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Though Wollstonecraft did not reviewThe Romance of Real Life, she did review Smith’s
                           Emmeline (1788), Ethelinde (1789), Celestina (1791), Desmond (1792), and Marchmont
                           (1796) for The Analytical Review (Fletcher 99; 120; 141; 152; 255). Although Wollstonecraft
                           and Smith knew and admired each other’s work, it is unlikely they ever met or corresponded
                           (Stanton 51; Todd Revolutionary xx).</span></div>
                  </div> the lines of association between <em>Original Stories</em> and the romance of real life genre become clearer. Reading Wollstonecraft’s collection
                  of stories “from real life” as simultaneously a comment on, expansion of, and conversation
                  with Smith’s recent collection of stories “of real life” will help illuminate the
                  generic experimentation of each.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The identification of the romance of real life as not only a genre distinct from the
                  novel but as a sort of anti-novel in which the excesses of romance are “corrected”
                  by an attempted synthesis with history (that most dignified of discourses) suggests
                  the period’s unease regarding the novel’s status and respectability, especially when
                  it is produced or consumed by women (Gamer, “Romance” 237). The shifting role of women
                  as both writers and readers of novels and the dangers of women’s allegedly innate
                  sensibility are subjects to which Wollstonecraft turns her attention in the second <em>Vindication </em>and in its claims that the “exquisite sensibility” that women are encouraged to cultivate
                  and the novels they are taught to swoon over relegate them to a “state of perpetual
                  childhood” (9). Women authors of the 1780s had to contend not only with the usual
                  questions of respectability that troubled any professional woman writer but also with
                  the perception that the novel was a genre particularly dangerously suited to women’s
                  acute sensibility. This conflict between women writers’ attraction to the novel as
                  a new and accessible discourse (for it required no formal training or knowledge of
                  classical languages) and the sense that, despite the earlier success of Frances Burney
                  and Sarah Fielding, women’s suitability to the genre was questionable, inspired the
                  experimentation with a new genre that merged the entertainment value of the romance
                  or novel with the respectable and edifying genre of history.

                           period discussed here, seems to have been influenced by this sense of conflict and
                           debate between history and novels that surrounded his future wife’s early career.</span></div>

               <p>Another motivation for women to present their writing as something with direct ties
                  to historical fact is related to Myers’s claims that the popularity of both moral
                  tales and children’s literature with women writers was an attempt to appropriate the
                  realm of education as a domestic (and thus feminine) concern and, concurrently, to
                  gain recognition in the world of letters that was in the 1780s and early 1790s still
                  very much a masculine realm. Insisting that the tales they tell— even the apparently
                  “romantic” ones—are drawn from real life imparts to women writers a certain palpable
                  authority and prevents them from becoming mere “novelists.”

                  </div> If we recognize the proliferation of so-called realistic romances among early romantic
                  women writers as a defensive fusion of romance with private memoirs, domestic biographies,
                  and other allegedly ahistorical discourses in an attempt to attain the authority of
                  truth, we are invited to read any such self-proclaimed real-life tales as an attempt
                  at self-ratification. For example, although Wollstonecraft’s <em>Stories</em> do not label themselves as “romances” per se, her title’s emphasis on both originality <em>and </em>realistic mimesis suggest this same sort of self-conscious acknowledgement of the
                  apparent difficulties of the female writer to duplicate faithfully the world around
                  her.</p>

               <p>Smith’s preface to <em>The Romance of Real Life</em> provides as clear and revealing a summary as one could seek of these tensions surrounding
                  one writer’s forays into the seemingly incompatible genres of romance and history.
                  In Smith’s case, she finds both genres lacking for her purpose and instead constructs
                  a hybrid discourse that borrows aspects from each genre and is simultaneously both
                  and neither: <span class="quote">‘A Literary friend, whose opinion I greatly value, suggested to me the possibility
                     of producing a few little volumes, that might prove as attractive as the most romantic

                     that the voluminous and ill-written work, entitled <em>Les Causes Célébres</em>, might furnish me with very ample materials for so desirable a purpose. He advised
                     me to select such stories from this collection, as, though disfigured by the affectation
                     and bad taste of the compiler, Guyot [<em>sic</em>] de Pitaval, might lead us to form awful ideas of the force and danger of the human
                     passions. He wished me to consider myself as under no restriction, but that of adhering
                     to authenticated facts; and by telling each story in my own way, to render it as much
                     as possible an interesting lesson of morality. (129

                  the unnamed, male, “Literary friend” (identified by Gamer as William Hayley; 298)
                  whose guidance she seems to solicit or even require. It is this friend who proposes
                  the project, suggests the source text, and advised the author how and in what style
                  she ought to proceed (three of the paragraph’s four sentences begin with the male
                  friend’s proclamations: “He affirmed […] He advised […] He wished”). Such apparent
                  deference on the part of a fledgling female writer (who had produced only one other
                  prose work, a translation of Prèvost’s <em>Manon Lescaut</em>, in the previous year) might be understandable if not for the fact that, although
                  new to prose, Smith was already a well-established literary figure by 1787. <em>Elegiac Sonnets</em><div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">

                           and experimentation does not begin and end with her 1787 prose work. Furthermore,
                           a case could be made that Smith’s later works for children—Rural Walks (1795), Rambles

                  successful author seem to defer to a male preceptor? Her translator’s preface to <em>Manon Lescaut</em>, in contrast, is authoritative with its claims that she herself found the original
                  novel in Normandy and amused some English friends by masterfully translating passages
                  extempore. She also proudly declares the liberties she has taken with the text, including
                  lengthening the short sentences she finds “so unpleasant to the English ear,” altering
                  the narrative structure, and eliding many “trite” and repetitive passages (5), claims
                  which all suggest an author in command of her source material and comfortable with
                  her authority. However, <em>Manon Lescaut </em>was published anonymously—its title page simply proclaiming itself “A French Story”—and
                  the preface contains no tell-tale pronouns or details; indeed, the public seems to
                  have assumed that the translator was male (Fletcher 84). The fact that <em>The Romance of Real Life</em> was Smith’s first work in prose to feature her name on the title page might have contributed
                  to the fact that the beginning of its preface seems to defer to masculine literary
                  authority.</p>
            </div>
            <p>However, this apparent obsequiousness is more complicated than it first appears, and
               as the preface progresses this sense of deference falls away and is replaced by the
               same confident, authoritative tone that characterizes Smith’s earlier, anonymous preface.
               The “Literary friend” is never again mentioned, and Smith is openly critical not only
               of the original (male) author, Gayot de Pitaval (claiming that “the style of the original
               is frequently obscure; the facts are often anticipated, and often repeated, in almost
               the same words, in different parts of the story,” among many other complaints) but
               also of a new edition of the same work by François Richer, claiming that his work
               is “less interesting” and less accurate than her own. Her announcement that Richer
               has produced another, inferior French version of “<em>my</em> original” (emphasis added) suggests the degree to which she saw herself as “owning”
               the text she had completely rewritten. The “great pleasure” she has taken in the work,
               despite its many complexities and roadblocks, is repeatedly emphasized. Even as the
               difficulties of her task had begun to overwhelm her, she claims, she kept in sight
               the potential usefulness of her project, and it is this mission that made the experience
               pleasurable: <span class="quote">‘Yet it occurred to me, that the reason which made the work difficult and unpleasant
                  for me to write, would render it, when finished, a desirable book to those who may
                  wish to obtain some idea of a celebrated publication, without wading thro’ the obscurities
                  and extraneous matter of M. de Pitaval. (129) ’</span> This is a pivotal (forgive the pun) moment in the preface, a moment in which the
               author emerges from the passive figure that occupied the first paragraph, and an emergence
               that centers not only on her rejection of the authoritative original she is adapting
               but also on her ambition that the book have instructional value. While the author’s
               reliance on her male friend might be the first noteworthy feature of the preface,
               it is by no means its only one; in fact, when read in light of the remainder of the
               preface, the first paragraph’s agenda becomes clearer and, I would argue, considerably
               less straightforward than it first appeared. Although the spectre of the Literary
               friend’s influence hovers throughout the opening paragraph, the claims that Smith
               herself is making for both her own agency and for her project’s pedagogical purpose
               begin to surface with her statement that “by telling each story in [her] own way,
               [she will] render it as much as possible an interesting lesson of morality.” This
               discovery of her “own way” in which to remake these frivolous French tales signals
               her intention of making these stories “both interesting and instructive,” unlike “romantic
               fiction” (which is “attractive,” but, it is implied, not instructive) and “genuine
               history” (which contains “solid instruction,” but less attraction). Since neither
               mode of discourse is entirely satisfactory, she will make her own by “adhering to
               authenticated facts” while at the same time “telling each story in [her] own way.”
               This hybrid that she has created—part attractive romantic fiction, part “genuine history”—is
               presented as an improvement not only over the forty-year old original that was “disfigured
               by the affectation and bad taste” of its creator (or was, in other words, factually
               accurate but stylistically flawed), but also the new version by Richer unmixed with
               romance and therefore “less interesting.” Smith is not claiming that romance and history
               are mutually exclusive, rather that neither side tells the entire story, or tells
               the story in a way that makes it attractive and, therefore, useful as a moral instructor.
               This is the impetus behind her unique title that was to launch a thousand spin-offs,
               for “the romance of real life” is nowhere close to a faithful translation of the original
               French title, <em>Les Causes Célébres</em>. Smith is clearly not aiming for an accurate translation of the title, but rather
               a transformation of it, whereby the two elements that she sees as necessary for a
               literary work’s instructive value—that the tales be true (because nothing is as educational
               as experiencing the “real”), but are told as if they were fiction (because nothing
               is as satisfying as a good read)—combine to form a palatable mixture of fiction and
               reality. If a work is (or even claims to be) drawn from real life, the lessons that
               can be gleaned from it are almost as valuable as actually having the same real-life
               experience. Readers at home can live through the harrowing adventures of Anglade or
               Louisa d’Antail, and, through the virtue of a sensibility that would relate their
               feelings of empathy to <em>real people</em> <em>who actually existed</em>, they might feel deeply for them and learn from the sufferers’ examples as if they
               were their own experiences. Smith’s brief and modest-seeming preface is in fact a
               watershed moment for the generic conventions of prose. It is the introduction of realism
               into romance, of history into fiction, and its central claim that this hybridity is
               necessary in order to produce a work of prose “both interesting and instructive” (and
               the implied claim that this is what good prose should aim to do) signal a new way
               of thinking about the purpose of writing.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It is perhaps no coincidence that Smith—herself a mother—comes to this revelation
                  at the same time that the English public is becoming obsessed with the child reader.
                  Due in part to the new availability of cheap paper, a subsequent upsurge in publishing
                  activity, and increased literacy rates among all classes, the last decades of the
                  eighteenth century saw an unprecedented interest in producing printed material aimed
                  at children, material that often came loaded with ideology. From Hannah More’s <em>Cheap Repository Tracts </em>that preached duty, obedience, and conformity to prevalent social values to the piously
                  conservative works of Sarah Trimmer, the new literature available to children was
                  obsessed with what sorts of lessons children might glean from the written word. Too
                  much romance or fancy, even in the form of chapbook fairy tales, was seen as dangerous
                  to young unformed minds in a way that should remind us of the period’s anxiety about
                  the effect fiction might have on the similarly immature minds of women (as in Wollstonecraft’s
                  claim that women are being relegated to a “state of perpetual childhood”). Imagination
                  was a dangerous quality to cultivate, since it taught children to imagine worlds other
                  than the one in which they were born into—a world in which, for example, Little Goody
                  Two-Shoes can rise from poverty through schooling, become a governess, and marry a
                  rich nobleman—and introduced them to the notion of choice, the idea that their destinies
                  were in their hands and that any ragged child could, through hard work, virtue, and
                  a bit of luck, become a prince or princess. Thus in class-bound England, especially
                  in the years after the French Revolution, imagination suggested radical democratic
                  ideals and leveling—dangerous concepts in a society in which literacy rates were rising
                  in the lower classes and Paine’s <em>Rights of Man</em> (1791) was a runaway best-seller. In 1802 Trimmer founded the <em>Guardian of Education</em>, a version of the <em>Anti-Jacobin Review</em> specifically aimed at rooting out subversive elements in children’s literature. The
                  world of romance and imagination was seen by many as singularly unfit for childish
                  consumption (just as too much novel-reading would corrupt their silly mothers), and
                  books for children were thought to require a strong moral stance and firm basis in
                  real life, where animals do not talk and poor little girls never become fine ladies.

            </div>
            <p>However, as Smith notes in the preface discussed above, “solid instruction” itself
               is not sufficient to retain the interest of any reader, young or old, without some
               of the attraction of “romantic fiction.” It is this happy medium that Wollstonecraft
               tries to deliver with her <em>Original Stories from Real Life</em>, an attempt to synthesize the moral instruction that many, including Wollstonecraft,
               felt that children need while also providing them with the elements of fiction and
               story-telling that they desire. Although a lack of definitive proof in the form of
               reviews or letters makes it impossible to prove that Wollstonecraft read Smith’s <em>Romance of Real Life</em> in the year in which she was composing <em>Original Stories</em>, the complementary titles alone would suggest that, even if no direct influence exists,
               the two writers were at least drawing from the same ideological pool. Regardless,
               it is highly likely that Wollstonecraft <em>did</em> indeed read Smith’s work in 1787; in that year Wollstonecraft left her position as
               a governess in Ireland and headed to London, where she became a member of Joseph Johnson’s
               circle and immersed herself in literary life, and due to her position with <em>The Analytical Review</em> she had already reviewed Smith’s work as early as July 1788. Even without a definite
               provenance, however, it is clear that both Smith and Wollstonecraft had in mind similar
               reexaminations of the generic conventions of prose and ideas regarding the pedagogical
               import of realism. Their audiences might have differed—Wollstonecraft’s consisting
               of children (and their parents) in need of moral instruction, and Smith’s the wider
               reading public—but their motivations and techniques are surprisingly similar. In fact
               if we bracket the central frame of <em>Original Stories</em>—Mrs. Mason’s storytelling and careful manipulation of situations that allow her charges
               to experience the stories of others—its similarities to Smith’s <em>Romance</em> become striking: both works feature a collection of disjointed tales that illustrate
               well-defined morals and are presented as historically and factually true accounts
               of real experiences colored with an imaginative cast.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Wollstonecraft’s preface immediately delineates the text’s purpose and testifies to
                  its necessity: <span class="quote">‘These conversations and tales are accommodated to the present state of society; which
                     obliges the author to attempt to cure those faults by reason, which ought never to
                     have taken root in the infant mind. Good habits, imperceptibly fixed, are far preferable
                     to the precepts of reason; but, as this task requires more judgment than generally
                     falls to the lot of parents, substitutes may be sought for, and medicines given, when
                     regimen would have answered the purpose much better. (359)

                  state of society” and necessary to combat the insidious forces implanting themselves,
                  weed-like, into the “infant minds” of the next generation. In a later paragraph Wollstonecraft
                  essentially dismisses contemporary parents, noting that they have their “own passions
                  to combat with, and fastidious pleasures to pursue” and are therefore too busy to
                  tend to their children’s moral education themselves; she proposes that we address
                  our efforts to salvaging the succeeding generation, which might yet be taught the
                  virtue their parents lack.

                  practical training, or any knowledge beyond the parlor or nursery leads to a weakened
                  society.

                           edition [of Original Stories]—word by word, line by line—while Rights of Woman was

                  </div> The fourth paragraph of the preface even claims that the text—written in a mature
                  style which, she acknowledges, might be “not quite on a level with the capacity of
                  a child”—might be as useful to the adult who would read it aloud to the child as to
                  that child itself: “The Conversations are intended to assist the teacher as well as
                  the pupil.” This statement—along with the fact that, indeed, the style is hardly childish,
                  and many of the situations mature—suggests that Wollstonecraft’s intended audience
                  might be wider than it first appears; a second glance at the full title discovers
                  that children are nowhere mentioned, and it is not “childish minds” but “the mind”
                  that the title claims to “form.” The fact that the text was published by J. Johnson,
                  a house not yet known in 1788 for its juvenile productions, would have contributed
                  to the impression that this was a text for all, offering instruction not only to children
                  but to their parents as well.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The method Wollstonecraft chooses to promote reason to the next generation takes a
               form similar to that which we have seen previously. She has already in the preface’s
               opening sentence claimed that the work to follow will be comprised of “conversations
               and tales” and notes in its final sentence that “the Tales which were written to illustrate
               the moral, may recall it, when the mind has gained sufficient strength to discuss
               the argument from which it was deduced” (360)—in other words, the tales are the instruments
               with which an attentive reader might arrive at the real-life lesson, much as Smith’s
               “attractive” fictional style was the means of delivering her real-life lessons. Wollstonecraft’s
               preface makes another similar claim: <span class="quote">‘The way to render instruction most useful cannot always be adopted; knowledge should
                  be gradually imparted, and flow more from example than teaching: example directly
                  addresses the senses, the first inlets to the heart; and the improvement of those
                  instruments of the understanding is the object education should have constantly in
                  view, and over which we have most power. (359) ’</span> This idea that unadulterated “instruction” is not always the best method of teaching,
               that sometimes “examples” that address the “senses” and “heart” are more effective
               vehicles of education and refinement, echoes Smith’s claims for the insufficiency
               of “solid instruction” alone. Elsewhere in her preface Wollstonecraft notes that the
               “affections”—highlighted in the work’s subtitle—are the forces that should “warm the
               heart, and animate the conduct,” suggesting the same interest that Smith demonstrates
               in the sensory processing of literature. Again, the reader is presented as engaging
               in the same sort of relationship with the text whereby the experiences he or she reads
               about will affect their sensibilities in the same way as would actual lived or directly
               observed experiences. The idea that reading these stories—or having them read out
               loud—will do as much good for any child as they did for Mary and Caroline is ratified
               by <em>Original Stories</em>’ last chapter, in which Mrs Mason presents her charges with a book—presumably <em>the </em>book, <em>Original Stories</em> itself—recording all of their adventures and conversations and claims that it will
               act as a substitute for their real-life guide; she then asks that the girls write
               to her, but only if they record “the genuine sentiments of [their] hearts,” which
               suggests confidence that that such things can truly be duplicated in a letter. The
               belief that the written word can faithfully replicate the truest expressions of heart
               and mind is perhaps not a new one, but what <em>is</em> new here is the concept that this direct line between heart and pen can serve a useful
               purpose, that sensibility might be put into the service of morality.</p>
            <p>The structure of <em>Original Stories</em> demonstrates this concept. Having observed a moral shortcoming in one or both of
               her charges, Mrs Mason orchestrates a scenario in which she can offer a counter-example;
               for instance, after seeing the girls kill insects, Mrs Mason makes an elaborate show
               of walking off the path and into the wet grass to avoid stepping on a line of snails.
               After offering a brief homily on the topic, she then tells a series of short accounts
               of other people’s experiences in similar situations, often using only vague descriptions
               and no proper names; on the issue of cruelty to animals, anonymous accounts of puppy-drowning
               and guinea-pig-torture ensue. Up until this point, the <em>Stories</em>’ pedagogical project is fairly straightforward: the girls are <em>told</em> that what they are doing is wrong, and they are offered examples of how other people
               erred in the same way in order to shame them into a different behavior. It is the
               final step in Mrs Mason’s program of moral education that supports the claims Wollstonecraft
               makes in the preface regarding the necessity of knowledge that flows from example
               and hinges on sensibility and affection: the girls are plunged into the actual and
               are taken to view real relics or meet real people whose true stories ratify their
               tutor’s tales. Standing before crazy Robin’s cave, Mrs Mason relates the story of
               the man she actually knew, assisted, and even wept with over the body of his murdered
               dog, serving as an eyewitness to the events she describes. This “real life” example
               is shown as making an immediate impression on the girls: “Was that the cave? asked
               Mary. They ran to it. Poor Robin! Did you ever hear of any thing so cruel!” (376).
               Mrs Mason’s presentation of the actual Robin’s cave produces a reaction in Mary and
               Caroline far more marked than any of her stories and examples ever had, demonstrating
               the pedagogical value of the real. Not coincidently, this move from story into reality
               is also the point in each “real life” example that elements of romance and sensibility
               are the most marked. The account of Robin standing over the bed containing his dead
               children is a scene ripped straight from the pages of a sentimental novel and engineered
               to elicit its audience’s tears: <span class="quote">‘The poor father, who was now bereft of all his children, hung over their bed in speechless
                  anguish; not a groan or a tear escaped from him, whilst he stood, two or three hours,
                  in the same attitude, looking at the dead bodies of his little darlings. (375)’</span> In these examples, pathos is key, demonstrating Wollstonecraft’s theory that sentiment
               can inspire genuine moral reformation, both in Mary and Caroline and in the readers
               of <em>Original Stories</em> (for these are also presented to the readers as tales “<em>from Real Life</em>,” just as the introduction presents Mary and Caroline as real little girls with a
               true history). The rest of the collection continues in much the same vein: a failing
               in the girls is identified, a lecture laced with religious instruction is given, a
               “real life” story is told, and some sort of proof, often in the form of the person
               himself or herself, is produced. Throughout <em>Original Stories</em>, the real person, place, or experience is consistently portrayed as a force that
               supports the stories people tell. As in Smith’s conception of the romance of real
               life, historical fact and storytelling are complementary, rather than contradictory,
               concepts. Whenever Mrs Mason tells a character’s history, real-life details ratify
               her version, and when those stories are told, they are told in a manner that borrows
               conventions of romance and sensibility to make the tale even more affecting, sympathetic,
               and thus instructive.</p>
            <p>One aspect of Wollstonecraft’s work less present in Smith’s is the recurrent preoccupation
               with religious duty and salvation, a characteristic that has erroneously led many
               critics to align Wollstonecraft with the many religious writers for children, including
               the aforementioned More and Trimmer, with whom Wollstonecraft had nothing else in
               common (and quite a bit at odds). The fact that the lessons Mrs Mason attempts to
               instill in Mary and Caroline are so often related to questions of Christian virtue
               suggests another layer of meaning to Wollstonecraft’s pedagogical aims. The idea that
               a book can be a vehicle for the dissemination of life lessons of course suggests the
               Protestant belief in the value of individual bible study, and Mrs Mason’s presentation
               to the girls of a book full of stories meant to “[illustrate] the instruction it contains”
               is clearly reminiscent of the New Testament. In fact, Mrs Mason herself is frequently
               and insistently portrayed as a Christ figure whose stories redeem the fallen girls,
               who are certainly no angels in the opening chapters. Even the “contents” page, with
               its list of chapter titles like “The Inconveniences of immoderate Indulgence” and
               “The Danger of Delay” suggests a collection of sermons or biblical parables. Mrs Mason
               repeatedly stresses that the way to do the most good in the world is by imitating
               God: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">The greatest pleasure life affords [is] that of resembling God, by doing good. (368)</div>
                  <div class="l">You ought, by doing good, to imitate Him. (370)</div>
                  <div class="l">I now daily contemplate His wonderful goodness; and, though at an awful distance,
                     try to imitate Him. (423)</div>
                  <div class="l">We are His children when we try to resemble Him. (431)</div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> William Blake clearly picks up on Mrs Mason’s messianic fervor when he illustrates
               her in the frontispiece of the third edition with her arms spreading over the heads
               of her young charges, simultaneously a mother hen sheltering her brood and a Christ
               figure framed in a cross-like doorway, vines piercing her outstretched palms (fig.
               1). While the preface claims that children’s introduction to true religion must come
               from a recognition of the “Universal Father” whom they will then wish to imitate,
               we see the girls awed by the all-seeing eye of their guardian and expressing a desire
               to imitate not God, but Mrs Mason herself, the text’s divine substitute—“I wish to
               be a woman, said Mary, and to be like Mrs Mason” (389). The idea that the real life
               of earthly existence is but preparation for a heavenly home—that the “Most High is
               educating us for eternity” (437)—lends an added urgency to the text’s stated goal
               to “form the mind to truth and goodness.” Patricia Demers claims that Evangelical
               writers like Wollstonecraft’s near-contemporary Mary Martha Butt Sherwood—one of a
               group Demers dubs “Romantic Evangelicals”—adopt a method of “seeing into the life
               of things, without contradiction or irony” which is “simultaneously domestic and eschatological”
               (131).</p>

            <p>As a result, <span class="quote">‘Their characters’ zeal in finding and defining an earthly home prompts their almost
                  automatic longing for a heavenly home. Theirs is a consciously double vision, glimpsing
                  the eternal in the natural, the sublime in the quotidian. (131)’</span> This “glimpsing the eternal in the natural” is one of the activities that Wollstonecraft
               repeatedly portrays Mrs Mason doing, and the idea that the text prepares one for real
               life, which then in turn prepares one for eternal life, is one that the character
               often trumpets. While there are some problems with aligning Wollstonecraft too closely
               to a group of writers with which she has little in common, the implication that Christianity
               yields a way of looking at real life as a heavenly preamble is important to bear in
               mind when considering <em>Original Stories</em>, a book which repeatedly presents itself as being concerned with Christian morality.
               The idea that real life is an important pedagogical tool because its lessons help
               us not only to become better citizens but also fit “to be angels hereafter,” with
               “a nobler employment in our Father’s kingdom” (371-2) and that Mrs Mason’s real-life
               tales and illustrations help Mary and Caroline not only to become better girls, but
               to become Christians and, eventually, angels is quite a burden to attach to any one
               text.</p>
            <p>It is this idea of the “sublime in the quotidian” and the potentially salvific powers
               of woman on which I would like to end by tying together the various strains of ideology
               surrounding the blending of the genres of “real life” and “romance,” “factual” and
               “imaginary,” that we have seen occurring in Smith’s and Wollstonecraft’s texts. Even
               putting aside her many Christological qualities, Mrs Mason is an extraordinary female
               character to emerge from the 1780s: an independent landlord, munificent mistress,
               beloved pillar of her community, and unwavering moral guide. Her strict yet maternal
               presence portrays her as inhabiting what were in Wollstonecraft’s time two seemingly
               disparate spheres: the mother/woman, and the serious moral agent. Myers argues that,
               in fact, Wollstonecraft and her generation of writers for children (which would include
               Smith, who published <em>Rural Walks</em> only seven years after the publication of <em>Original Stories</em>) introduced the idea of “everyday female heroism” and the notion of the “heroic potential
               available in ordinary female life” (34; 50). Traditionally relegated to home and garden,
               women writers found new sources of inspiration, and their production of literature
               for children that reflected those sources spread them to the next generation. From
               the sense of anxiety regarding women’s ability to address historical fact and real
               life in serious literature sprang a hybrid genre that allowed them not only to temper
               history with the attractiveness of romance but also to elevate mere “romantic fiction”
               by infusing it with realism, turning it into something that can address history, society,
               and all aspects of “real life,” and, due in part to a changing cultural climate that
               put women in the position of educators, act as a pedagogical tool. There is a clear
               correlation between this experimentation with realism in the last decades of the eighteenth
               century and the development of the national tale in the early nineteenth, another
               hybrid genre that mixes romance and history, pioneered by women writers like Sydney
               Owenson (<em>The Wild Irish Girl: A National Tale</em>; 1806) and Jane Porter (<em>The Scottish Chiefs</em>; 1809). By the time Sir Walter Scott “invented” the historical novel with <em>Waverly</em> in 1814, he could draw on a rich tradition of texts in which the romantic and the
               realistic coalesced, a combination that has at its core the generic experimentations
               of women like Smith and Wollstonecraft.</p>

               usually elided to simply “<em>Original Stories</em>”, thus de-emphasizing the work’s apparent preoccupation with realism; for the sake
               of brevity, however, this essay will hereafter use the same abbreviation.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Summerfield pulls no punches in expressing his dislike of<em>Original Stories</em> and what he sees as its bland conservatism; his study’s very first mention of Wollstonecraft’s
               work is to claim that “<em>Original Stories</em> has a strong claim to be the most sinister, ugly, overbearing book for children ever
               published. It is permeated by a grim, humorless, tyrannical spirit of hectoring and
               unswerving spiritual and mental rectitude—all in the name of healthy growth: a dream
               of reason producing, indeed, a veritable monster in the form of Mrs. Mason” (229).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Though Wollstonecraft did not review<em>The Romance of Real Life</em>, she did review Smith’s <em>Emmeline</em> (1788), <em>Ethelinde</em> (1789), <em>Celestina</em> (1791), <em>Desmond</em> (1792), and <em>Marchmont </em>(1796) for <em>The Analytical Review</em> (Fletcher 99; 120; 141; 152; 255). Although Wollstonecraft and Smith knew and admired
               each other’s work, it is unlikely they ever met or corresponded (Stanton 51; Todd

               unlike the romance of real life, suggesting that Smith’s drive towards generic innovation
               and experimentation does not begin and end with her 1787 prose work. Furthermore,
               a case could be made that Smith’s later works for children—<em>Rural Walks</em> (1795), <em>Rambles Farther </em>(1796), <em>Minor Morals</em> (1798), and <em>Conversations, Introducing Poetry </em>(1804) —are in fact influenced by the same generic experimentation and sense of “romantic
               realism” in Wollstonecraft’s <em>Original Stories</em> that I here argue that she, in turn, derived from Smith’s early works, but the limited
               scope of this essay prevents an in-depth discussion of works by Smith that followed
               <em>Original Stories</em>. However, since an extensive study of Smith’s work for children has not yet been
               written, the apparent exchange between these two authors regarding the pedagogical
               effect of realism certainly suggests one avenue of inquiry.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               the usual smooth way of exhibiting proud humility. A general rule <em>only </em>extends to the majority—and, believe me, the few judicious parents who may peruse
               the book, will not feel themselves hurt—and the weak are too vain to mind what is
               said in a book intended for children […] If parents attended to their children, I
               would not have written the stories; for, what are books—compared to conversations
