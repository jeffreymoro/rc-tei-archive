            <p class="noCount">This paper discusses the outcomes of a multi-year project to engage undergraduate
               students in active and constructive encounters with Romantic period themes and contexts
               via web-based, multi-user gamespaces. Interactive, participatory learning environments,
               akin to humanities “lab” spaces where controlled experimentation and exploration can
               take place, encourage students to innovate, create, share, and play together. This
               pedagogical strategy engages students with the complexities, advantages, and difficulties
               faced by the intersection of independent and interdependent approaches to creativity,
               communication, and action during the Romantic period, allowing them to become performatively
               involved in experiential situations (as players/classroom citizens and as builders/authors)
               that reflect the thematic issues that they are studying. </p>

               <h2><span class="head">Introduction: Setting the Stage</span></h2>
               <p>Romantic-period literature frequently asserts individual selves against traditional
                  subjectivities. Various characters, including unacknowledged poetic geniuses, orphans,
                  Byronic misanthropes, humanized gods, godlike everymen, and tragic last men have collectively
                  contributed to the individualistic stereotypes at the heart of the ideal and ideological
                  notions of Romanticism that have followed us into the twenty-first century. This literary
                  litany of self-reflexive lyrics, esoteric compositions, and fictional caricatures
                  associate independence with individualism in ways that eclipse the presence of collaborative,
                  collective and creative <em>interdependence</em> during the Romantic era. Moreso than lonely creative voices, collective movements
                  towards new subjectivities and subjective categorizations, driven by a dissenting,
                  interdependent spirit of independence, permeated the revolutionary politics and inventive,
                  collaborative aesthetics of this period in British history. Samuel Taylor Coleridge
                  recognized this in “The Nightingale” (1798), which deconstructs the impossible-to-sustain
                  idea of loneliness, independence and solitude among a community of warbling poets:
                  “But never elsewhere in one place I knew / So many Nightingales: and far and near
                  / In wood and thicket over the wide grove / They answer and provoke each other’s songs”
                  (55-58).</p>
               <p>This fundamental tension between collectivist and individualist pursuits of independence
                  and the implicit acknowledgement of the necessity and inevitability of larger-scale
                  interdependencies and collaborations is an essential characteristic of the period
                  that needs to be more emphatically conveyed to undergraduate-level students. Indeed,
                  countering a false sense of insular individualism and exposing the ironies of idealizing
                  “freedom” from within a legal, social contract is necessary to fully understand the
                  relationship between literature and politics in this period as well as to comprehend
                  twenty-first century political beliefs and cultural practice. Asking undergraduates
                  to challenge individualistic ideals is essential within arts and humanities programs,
                  which continue to perpetuate a misleading Romantic ideal of the scholar as a competitively
                  independent and exclusive individual genius. In a manner that replicates the state
                  of our individualist professional practice, publication, and promotional evaluation,
                  many university-level literature programs (at both the undergraduate and graduate
                  level) offer classroom and program environments for students that discourage interdependent
                  activities and accomplishments even though most faculty members must adopt collaborative
                  and integrative practices in order to navigate everyday teaching, service, and research
                  situations. To leave students unprepared for the promises and pitfalls of communal
                  scholarly practice and mutual imposition is to leave them unprepared for the collaborative
                  world that awaits them after their degree is earned.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">MOOspace: Choosing an appropriate arena</span></h2>
               <p>To encourage the collaboration so necessary in today’s workforce and, more importantly,
                  to help students confront the interdependent cultures, aesthetics, and politics of
                  the Romantic era, I have appealed to the supplementary use of multiplayer online environments,
                  which allow students to inhabit various social contexts rather than just abstractly
                  understand them. These virtual spaces, like literary settings, offer an imaginary
                  arena to showcase human drama. The difference between these environments and the worlds
                  created through literary expression (and some traditional classroom practices) is
                  that the player directly participates in the narrative, and players, unlike readers,
                  can dream together in real-time, in the same space. While books can simulate such
                  environments through representation, novels from this period do not enable readers
                  to become characters in their stories, nor do they promote collaborative interactions
                  between readers in bookspace. Designing specific stories and contexts for students
                  to experience within these multi-user environments encourages co-operative play, inviting
                  them not only to negotiate the tension between independence and collaborative life
                  in the eighteenth century, but also to learn in a different way than they usually
                  do in the humanities. Supplementing a traditional classroom space in which they are
                  largely independent operators with the collaborative humanities laboratory of the
                  multi-user gamespace is a worthwhile educational intervention. While many other collaborative
                  classroom activities could be leveraged to encourage the same results without relying
                  on computer and online technologies, this particular approach offers additional, valuable,
                  and marketable learning experiences to humanities students regarding scripting, problem
                  solving through program design and environment planning, order of operations, and
                  working in a digital environment in general.</p>
               <p>Digital gamespaces offer unique opportunities for designers and players: the designer
                  is able to write the rules by which the story appears, as well as planning the story
                  arc(s) (what Janet Murray calls procedural authorship (152)). Murray states that “the
                  procedural author creates not just a set of scenes, but a world of narrative possibilities”
                  (153), which is akin to a constructivist facilitation—a useful alternative to traditional
                  teaching methods in which students are handed pre-rendered narrative syllabi and expected
                  to follow along with the expert lecturer. Ian Bogost’s <em>Persuasive Games</em> (2007) extends this idea by recognizing that games employ a procedural rhetoric (i.e.
                  persuasion through the authorship of rules of behavior, through a dynamic model).
                  Players are required to contribute actively to their own progress within specific
                  experiential fields in which choices and consequences have been pre-rendered for them.
                  These affordances contribute to a rhetorical opportunity that can help to facilitate
                  player identification with a designer-author’s intentions and ideas via performative
                  participation.</p>

                  <p>The gamespaces that I have been using to engage undergraduate students with these
                     ideas are hosted within a somewhat outdated environment as far as multiplayer game
                     opportunities go, but which avoids obsolescence by remaining configurable, affordable,
                     and textual. Acadia University’s gamespaces are built within enCore Xpress, an open-source
                     MOO database and graphical user interface.

                     </div> Since the MOO acronym might not be familiar to many readers, a brief history and explanation
                     follows: MUDs (Multi-user Dungeons) appeared in the late 1970s and were the first
                     multi-user online gamespaces. They used a text-based “chat room” interface to involve
                     a number of simultaneous, networked computer users in role-playing situations within
                     described environments that resembled early single-player text-adventure games like <em>Zork</em>. As MUDs evolved, ASCII graphics were added to some versions and their virtual spaces
                     were harnessed by some users for educational ends. MOOs (MUD Object Oriented), the
                     evolutionary cousins of MUDs, were born in the early 1990s and retained the text-based
                     environment of MUDs but used an object-oriented programming language and a persistent
                     object database to extend the flexibility and opportunities offered by MUD environments.
                     Uniquely, users could also construct virtual environments from within those spaces
                     via simple commands that eliminated the need for high-level programming knowledge.

                     </div> Despite being over fifteen years old, the open-source accessibility, web-based aspect,
                     multimedia opportunities, and programmability of the enCore Xpress MOO influenced
                     my decision to utilize it for the purpose of delivering “serious,” multi-user games
                     to my undergraduate Romantic-period literature students as part of their classroom

               <p>Acadia University’s modified version of enCore Xpress, called Golgonooza (Blake’s
                  city of the imagination), enables the creation and use of multiplayer, goal-oriented,
                  persuasive role-playing games in my undergraduate classrooms. Its focused purpose
                  and more developed toolkit takes it beyond the now defunct <em>Romantic Circles MOO</em> (Villa Diodati), which also used encore Xpress and which has no true pedagogical
                  successor on the RC website. Golgonooza is also distinct from other computer-assisted
                  pedagogical innovations. For example, Roger Whitson’s “William Blake and Media” class
                  engaged students via Twitter, Zotero, and blogging activities, but none of these (individually
                  or collectively) achieves the community and role-playing potential of enCore Xpress’
                  interactive story-world environment.</p>
               <p>I have installed two versions of the encore MOO on Acadia’s servers. The first (<a class="link_ref" href="http://moo.acadiau.ca:7000">http://moo.acadiau.ca:7000</a>) is based on version 4 of enCore Xpress. This database (named Golgonooza) hosts a
                  hardcoded gamespace based on the environments featured in Mary Robinson’s novel <em>The Natural Daughter</em> (1799). This game was designed by Beth Lyons (a former theatre undergraduate student),
                  Jean-Marc Giffin (a former undergraduate Computer Science student at Acadia), and
                  me. The other MOO installation (named Golgonooza 2.0 and found at <a class="link_ref" href="http://moo.acadiau.ca:7001">http://moo.acadiau.ca:7001</a>) has been customized to host persuasive arguments in the form of interactive digital
                  gamespaces that are created by students in my year-long, undergraduate Romantic-period
                  literature course.</p>
               <p>Both Acadia versions of enCore Xpress have been extensively customized through a collaborative
                  effort between myself and Jean-Marc Giffin. Together, we have designed and implemented
                  a few unique affordances that distinguish Golgonooza 2.0 from other installations
                  of enCore Xpress: our modified version of enCore features a game design toolkit that
                  uses a GUI to allow the user to create a system of navigable, interconnected locations
                  and to populate those locations with objects and non-player character bots that can
                  “converse” with the player. Entrances and exits can be customized to facilitate one-way
                  travel, to defy the logic of compass-based navigation, or to be invisible until players
                  receive certain objects or information. Objects, characters and locations can be customized
                  and augmented through textual descriptions, audio, images and video. NPCs (non-player
                  characters) can be static or programmed to wander on random or scripted paths throughout
                  the gameworld. Interactions with NPC’s are managed through conversation tree scripts.
                  Different scripts can be written for different interactions (based on the player’s
                  class or gender), and this scripting can be used to give NPC’s “memories” of previous
                  encounters with the player (Figure 1).</p>

               <p>Golgonooza’s <em>The Natural Daughter</em> game is not a simple re-presentation of Robinson’s narrative or characters but is
                  meant to question critically the individualistic triumph promoted by the novel’s overly
                  optimistic conclusion and to raise questions about the tensions between realism and
                  idealism in literature of the period. In other words, it builds upon the cultural
                  critique begun but left unfinished in Robinson in order to help students perceive
                  in a more robust and visceral fashion how late eighteenth-century social hierarchies
                  and mores constrained individuals. After reading and discussing Robinson’s novel over
                  a few weeks of class time, groups of two or three students log into the MOO environment
                  using a single user account. The members of each team collaboratively contribute to
                  their single character’s progress in a role-playing game that positions them as a
                  woman in late-eighteenth-century England. Students are told that their goal is to
                  become a “successful young woman.” This goal is intentionally vague, and remains open
                  for interpretation, allowing the student teams to consider “success” in relation to
                  the historical period that is being represented, to the parameters modeled in Robinson’s
                  book (perseverance and ethical consistency against universal adversity), or to twenty-first
                  century notions of “success” (such as self-determination, empowerment, independence,
                  and equal opportunity). By collaboratively controlling a single character’s movement
                  and dialogue, each team of student players are put in situations where they (playing
                  as eighteenth-century women) experience social life at Bath, the difficulties of married
                  (or single) life in rural and urban situations, and London’s opportunities and temptations.</p>
               <p>Importantly, each player character’s class and social status are randomized variables
                  that can change with each new playthrough. One’s class position initially establishes
                  a specific level (or deficit) of social freedom and flexibility in the gameworld,
                  and a player’s initial reputation (based on such social stereotypes) generates different
                  responses and opportunities (or not) from other, non-player characters and the environment
                  itself. Reputation remains a variable throughout the experience, though, and can be
                  sullied or redeemed by one’s actions and choices while interacting with the game’s
                  selection of fickle characters. Players quickly learn that whatever initial position
                  they have in the gameworld as a result of their social class is precarious and that
                  any interaction within such unstable environments can easily lead to a reduction,
                  maintenance, or augmentation of this reputation. Thus, like Martha, the protagonist
                  in Robinson’s novel, players often find themselves negotiating between individualistic
                  ambitions and selfish desires, as well as between social responsibilities and co-operative
                  sympathies. </p>
               <p>What makes this experience more than just a participatory replay of the book’s narrative
                  is that players cannot succeed by twenty-first-century standards, and, given that
                  they are not allowed to replicate the success of the novel’s idealistic conclusion,
                  in which Martha’s individualistic determination allows her to persevere through hyperbolic
                  adversity and marry the “right” man, they cannot succeed by Robinson’s Romantic standards
                  either. The “best” ending that a player can achieve is to be married to a husband
                  who provides financial stability but little emotional support. The character becomes
                  stuck in a type of limbo where she is faced with few opportunities, growing ennui,
                  and a husband who dismisses her as if she was another one of his servants. This particular
                  end in the game does not equal freedom, but is the achievement of a sort of life-in-death
                  that recalls the personal Hell experienced by Coleridge’s ancient mariner (though
                  the mariner still possessed the poetic power to affect others and could still tell
                  his tale, whereas the players of this game are much more disabled). Achieving such
                  ends exposes student-players to circumstances that parallel the experiences of women
                  in late-eighteenth-century England: any accomplishment is still circumscribed by the
                  rules and inherent limitations of a largely unsympathetic and restrictive system.
                  Overall, then, this game encourages students to performatively interrogate and problematize
                  the kind of individualistic strategy that Robinson’s protagonist chooses, but it also
                  raises questions about the nature and limits of interdependence in this period. The
                  game world and its rule systems are mechanical, unsympathetic, and frustrating for
                  the idealistic player, and limited choices masquerading as freedom reveal the difficulty
                  of choosing one’s own adventure in a consequential universe.</p>
               <p>This circumscribed setup allows students to empathize with the cultural milieu in
                  which Martha operates, as well as to consider the broader emotional aims of narrative
                  itself. Given that most commercially available digital games cater to the pleasure
                  of the player (and consumer), students familiar with this storytelling medium will
                  be surprised that this example takes an antagonistic position toward the player’s
                  success. Yet, this frustration is instructive, as it teaches greater awareness of
                  both the cultural limitations within Romantic-era society and of the amelioration
                  afforded by narrative, both then and now. This game enacts Katie Salen’s and Eric
                  Zimmerman’s useful definition of “play” (“free movement within a more rigid structure”
                  (304)) quite literally, demonstrating in its story and in its mechanics that: </p>
               <ol>
                  <li class="item" id="d2454e287">Limited flexibility is not freedom.</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d2454e288">The player, like a reader, is not authoritative, despite the deceptive appearance
                     of agency and choice within game systems. </li>
                  <li class="item" id="d2454e289">Digital games can be used for social, political and psychological confrontations as
                     well as for escape. </li>
               </ol>
               <p> This experience also presents a challenge to and rejection of the often solitary
                  nature of gameplay, scholarship, and the privacy of traditional readership by asking
                  a group of students to be responsible for a single avatar’s progress. Team-based play
                  continually engages players in dialogue, collaboration, and co-operation as they work
                  through individual differences for the good of their single player-character.</p>
               <p>In the last four years of using this game in my undergraduate Romantic-period literature
                  classroom, I have found that students still have “fun” with this game (and here I
                  rely on Raph Koster’s definition of “fun” as the opposite of boring (42)), but are
                  not satisfied with the experience due to their unrealistic expectations for success
                  generated by Robinson’s novel. This attests to the effectiveness of game-based pedagogy,
                  as the purpose behind the creation and implementation of these game experiences is
                  not to entertain the students, but to facilitate a memorable learning experience by
                  generating a dissonance between expectation and experience in a supportive classroom
                  environment. Postmortem discussions with students have resulted in excellent opportunities
                  to comparatively examine the social function of the novel in the Romantic period.
                  For example, the idealism and sentimentalism that problematize Robinson’s proto-feminist
                  narrative are exposed and questioned though the contrasting pessimism built into the
                  game’s world. The fact that both novel and game explore the relationship between independent
                  motivations and intentions enacted within interdependent environments creates an important
                  thematic link, which fuels classroom discussions. The key here is that student-players
                  encounter and critically examine Robinson’s novel through traditional classroom lectures,
                  discussions and debates, but <em>also</em> augment and enrich such experience by performatively negotiating with and metacritically
                  engaging with Robinson’s ideas within a multiplayer gamespace. Making use of simulated
                  experiences and follow-up discussions about those experiences fosters extended learning
                  opportunities that supplement the existing opportunities that come from a critical
                  reading of the novel. Any dissatisfaction and reluctance that might accompany the
                  use of the technology, amplified by the game’s inherent difficulty, creates an overall
                  environment of frustration, an arena in which players are brought closer to an understanding
                  not only of women’s growing dissatisfaction during this period of burgeoning individualism
                  in British history, but also of the philosophical, psychological and social paradoxes
                  that reside at the heart of the period’s uncertain cultural expressions.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Endgame: Playing with Fiction</span></h2>
               <p>Games are not “ethics-free” environments. Like novels, they are virtual spaces in
                  which human beings are exposed to the consequences of action and conflict within larger
                  social, political, and economic systems. Games allow readers to become players, which
                  generates the potential for sympathetic understanding, empathetic engagement, and
                  a chance to experience the ways that an environment is impacted by their choices in
                  the safe, non-fatal frame of a classroom activity. This interactive narrative challenges
                  the period’s fiction and the students’ perceptions of that fiction within equally
                  fictional environments. It engages students in thoughtful play that lifts the painted
                  veil from romantic mediations via a game-based <span class="foreign">mise en abyme</span> that exposes the limits of fictionally constructed expectation and places the player
                  in a persistent tension between independent and interdependent action that is not
                  achieved through reading alone. In contrast to the idea that digital games promote
                  thoughtless reflex and complicity within pre-rendered systems, it is possible to use
                  such environments to generate an essential lucidity and experiential unease that catalyzes
                  <em>thought-full</em> awareness and critical reflections. Questioning the limits and opportunities of fictions
                  and mediating structures from within such fictions and structures is the ultimate
                  aim of such play.</p>
               <p>It could be argued that one does not need to appeal to technology to achieve such
                  pedagogical ends. Traditional group work, staged debates, role-playing exercises and
                  even custom-developed tabletop games could all be harnessed to produce a similar effect.
                  This is certainly true, but my overall point is that the <em>Natural Daughter</em> MOO game has generated useful in-class discussions regarding general ideas, such
                  as comparing the technological aspects of book-based and computer-based storytelling
                  and the position and power of readers versus players. More specifically, though, this
                  experience never fails to catalyze engaging discussions that apply Romantic-period
                  contexts to students’ understanding of themselves and their contemporary experiences.
                  In addition to a heated debate about the way that eighteenth-century novels and twenty-first-century
                  digital games have both been accused of individually isolating and socially networking
                  their audiences, I have also witnessed a lengthy classroom discussion regarding the
                  parallels between the way that inventive and innovative experimentation in the Romantic
                  period diversified the creative landscape but led to tensions between imagination
                  and nostalgia, and the ways that revolutionary transitions in our current media landscape
                  interrupt our habits and generate similar reactions. However, the most important learning
                  opportunity that emerges from utilizing such digital gamespaces in the Romantics classroom
                  appears when student players are asked to become builders within the MOO environment.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Programmers: Extending collaborative creativity from players to builders</span></h2>
               <p>In my year-long undergraduate Romantics course, the use of the MOO platform is extended
                  towards a completely different end in the second term: it becomes an environment in
                  which students complete a group assignment that asks them to collaboratively build
                  a persuasive, rhetorically argumentative gamespace related to specific course readings.
                  To turn students from readers (consumers) to players (participants) to builders (creators)
                  is to empower them and to promote an understanding of the ways that media can shape
                  understanding and action. This project is a twenty-first-century extension of the
                  revolutionary kinds of media-based awareness and agency that creators and consumers
                  were experiencing in the Romantic period.</p>
               <p>To make room for this project in the syllabus, I replace two essay assignments (out
                  of the six that I normally assign) with a digital game development project in which
                  students collaboratively design and build non-linear, interactive narrative gamespaces
                  within the MOO using a simple but robust GUI (Graphical User Interface) developer
                  toolkit. This is beneficial because it introduces students to programming structures
                  through the customization of branching story opportunities and the population of a
                  virtual environment with scripted NPC conversation “bots,” and objects, but does not
                  require them to learn a programming language to accomplish this. By simplifying the
                  tools available to students through the use of a GUI, I can expose them to modding
                  and customizing practices that involve branching narrative scripts without bottlenecking
                  their potential to deliver a rich, collaborative result (see figures 2 and 3).</p>

               <p>The normal vehicle for student work and evaluation in undergraduate humanities courses
                  is—of course—the rhetorical essay. While this is a tried-and-true method of critical
                  expression, and one that I continue to use in my Romantics classes, the essay is only
                  one form of argumentative communication, and students—unfortunately—learn to take
                  the form for granted at the same time as they become more proficient at adapting their
                  ideas to its formal constraints. Moreover, the essay format offers a time-limited
                  value, as many students will enter a workplace that requires them to communicate in
                  multimedia formats. Our increasingly diverse media landscape, amplified by the accessibility
                  of digital technologies, has established an urgent educational need for multiple and
                  integrated media literacies, transmedia awareness, and a working, hands-on knowledge
                  of comparative media and cultural studies ideas and practices. Although consuming
                  and thinking about class material is important, the productive and creative energies
                  generated in response to such material should not have to be exclusively limited to
                  traditional paradigms. Although the novelty of inserting a game development process
                  into an upper-level undergraduate course disconcerts many students who feel that they
                  have already mastered the algorithms at the heart of undergraduate assignments, it
                  is in essence a refreshing opportunity for students to reconsider exactly what an
                  essay does and how it accomplishes its persuasive argumentation in comparison to a
                  playable space in which players need to be directed toward an acceptance of the same
                  ideas as essay readers.</p>
               <p>At the beginning of January, students receive the project briefing and the required
                  development timeline (see figure 4).</p>
               <figure class="figure"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/pedagogies/romantic_education/images/sak_image4Thumb.jpg" alt="A sample project timeline schedule." class="inline" style=" width:16.51cm; height:8.604622222222222cm;"/></figure>
               <p>Fig. 4 A sample project timeline schedule.</p>
               <p>Early on, students are reminded that “Your players will not be playing a game based
                  on a poem, play, or novel, but will progress through an experiential architecture
                  that performatively exposes them to an argument relating to that literary work.” In
                  other words, these games possess the same argumentative function as a traditional
                  essay, but students need to import and adapt familiar forms and functions of rhetorical
                  communication to a radically different environment. While part of rhetorical writing
                  is to encourage one’s reader to keep reading, and while the act of reading implies
                  at least a willingness to engage with the author’s ideas, the reading process is not
                  as participatory (or as potentially powerful) as a player’s progress: whereas readers
                  (in most cases) simply watch the author build a rhetorically sound argumentative structure
                  and populate it with proof, players are asked to build the structure and gather the
                  proof themselves, as directed by the game designer. Such participatory preconditions
                  offer an advantage to game designers who are trying to encourage certain actions,
                  behaviors, or beliefs in their players. As a result, games have the potential to be
                  an extremely effective rhetorical medium: staging a convincing argument by leading
                  a player through an active and concrete construction process, rather than—as is often
                  done in essay writing—abstractly narrating such construction to a largely passive
                  but still critical observer. </p>
               <p>The grading rubric for this assignment calls attention to tensions and reconciliations
                  between independent and interdependent work, expanding the thematic explorations from
                  the gameplay that students experienced in the first term by putting students in situations
                  where they must accommodate their individual differences to a collaborative working
                  environment. Individual student assessment is based on a combination of individual
                  contributions and group grades. This approach is specifically designed so that students
                  must depend equally on their own abilities and their group’s performance (preventing
                  an over-reliance on either). Productively, it allows students who might feel restrained
                  by their group’s performance to augment such shortcomings by asserting their individual
                  abilities, and conversely allows students who might lack such individual genius to
                  assert their competency in group-related activities. In this way, collaboration, co-operation,
                  and selfless reliance are fundamentally encouraged by this project: no one student
                  could possibly complete the requirements on their own, so groups are responsible for
                  self-organization and the delegation and management of roles and responsibilities
                  (with guidance and mentorship from me during the process). Over the four years of
                  incorporating this into my curriculum, I have discovered that letting go of individual
                  control is very difficult for some of these students, as many have never been exposed
                  to substantial collaborative, graded work at the university level. Actively confronting
                  complexities together through building and making things (rather than just reacting
                  to already-built things) while avoiding reductive and idealistic activities performatively
                  reinforces the model of creative and critical networking at the heart of Romantic-period
                  invention.</p>
               <p>This assignment in which players become part of a community of builders who collaboratively
                  work towards the same goal involves individualistic capabilities in a co-operative
                  sphere, performatively engaging students in a synthesis of independent thinking and
                  interdependent practice. In this way, students are more directly exposed to the opportunities
                  and difficulties that arose during Romantic period collaborations fuelled by independent
                  energies, such as the invention of the <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> or the creation of the French <em>Declaration of The Rights of Man and of the Citizen.</em> Such an experience does not just provide students with a chance to learn about the
                  connection between independence and interdependence during this historical period;
                  it <em>involves</em> them in experiential situations (as players/classroom citizens and as builders/authors)
                  that allow them to more directly understand the intersections between collaborative
                  challenges and individual inspirations experienced by Romantic period writers.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Extensions: Golgonooza will never be finished</span></h2>
               <p>In the first year that I introduced gameplay to the class, student groups could choose
                  to focus on creating a critical interpretative argument relating to Byron’s “Manfred,”
                  Jane Austen’s <em>Northanger Abbey</em>, or Coleridge’s “Kubla Khan” or “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.” Notably, the “Kubla
                  Khan” group used their gamespace to question Coleridge’s imaginative theories and
                  visions through unsettling situations and unpredictable NPCs while still allowing
                  the player to indulge in them. Their game expanded on and also offered a critical
                  perception of “Kubla Khan”’s thematic possibilities, its drug-fuelled origins, and
                  its fragmentary nature. While certain groups and individuals performed more strongly
                  and effectively in this assignment’s first iteration, all students were able to bring
                  individual strengths to bear on their collaborative creations, resulting in richly
                  realized environments, characters, and narratives.</p>
               <p>In an effort to create an opportunity for idea exchanges between groups (not just
                  within them), the second year of this assignment’s implementation focused on a single
                  author. I asked students to select one of Keats’s 1819 odes and to create a persuasive
                  gamespace that allowed the player performatively to engage with a critical argument
                  made by the design group about their chosen ode. Additionally (unlike the previous
                  year’s selections), the odes that students chose for their projects were not part
                  of the course curriculum and were not taught or discussed in class, thus offering
                  the students a greater level of independence in the interpretative process. </p>
               <p>During the 2012-2013 academic year and inspired by the conference version of this
                  paper presented at NASSR 2011, I further refined the assignment beyond a focus on
                  individual literary works, asking student groups to establish an argument in gamespace
                  that asserted a conclusive thesis about the thematic tensions between independence
                  and interdependence in Romantic-period writing, choosing literary examples from the
                  course syllabus. Unifying all of the student groups under this thematic banner allowed
                  for a post-mortem that related more specifically to the larger course themes and also
                  allowed students to draw from on their own experience during the assignment’s creation
                  and completion to inform their in-game argument. </p>
               <p>Last year, I drew from class discussions that questioned the absence of specifically
                  targeted “duties” and responsibilities within the National Assembly of France’s 1789
                  <em>Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</em> by asking students to create a game-based argument that explored the tension between
                  rights and duties during the Romantic period. This year, I have asked students to
                  extend the debate between Thomas Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, William Godwin, and Edmund
                  Burke relating to the distinction between people and principles. After this year’s
                  work is complete, the Golgonooza 2.0 MOO will host five years’ worth of student projects.
                  Unlike essay assignments that generally trace a single line of communication between
                  professor and student in a very specific and limited temporal frame, all of the student
                  work in the MOO remains archived and publically accessible.</p>

               <h2><span class="head"><span class="foreign">Sturm und Drang</span>: Revealing resistance</span></h2>
               <p>Some students vehemently oppose the nature of this assignment, as well as the requirement
                  that they work in groups (thus subjecting their course grades to the influence of
                  variable group dynamics). During the first year’s assignment one student, who consistently
                  refused to work as a member of a team, complained to my Department Chair that this
                  non-traditional assignment was threatening to disrupt his accrued GPA and was not
                  why he was taking English literature courses. During the second year of the assignment,
                  another student decided to disappear for the duration of the project, but continued
                  to log into the gamespace toolkit and re-design (or vandalize) his teammates’ efforts
                  with ideas that he had not discussed with his group. This vandalism became so disruptive
                  that I removed him from the team, and he dropped the course soon after. These extreme
                  reactions are exceptions, but are also a reminder that issues relating to collaboration
                  in creative and social contexts during the Romantic period remain relevant to young,
                  creative minds in the twenty-first century. The MOO and the assignments constructed
                  around the use of such a gamespace allow students to become performatively involved
                  in the thematic issues that they are studying. Their varying reactions (excitement,
                  curiosity, resistance, and discomfort) to new experiences near the end of an undergraduate
                  career resist the abstraction and depersonalization at the heart of much academic
                  work while at the same time allowing them to experience collaboration before confronting
                  it in a professional setting post graduation. </p>
               <p>Student feedback has convinced me of the overall value and necessity of this sort
                  of experience for the Romanticism classroom. Without fail, all participants (even
                  those who enjoy game-based narratives) chronicle an initial discomfort related to
                  the unfamiliar nature of the assignment and technology that is slowly replaced by
                  engagement with their group and project. Since university learning should be safe
                  yet uncomfortable (as student comfort indicates that education is merely reinforcing
                  their accepted and habitual subject position rather than challenging it), it appears
                  that working in groups is a necessary, supportive, and helpful antidote to students’
                  individual discomfort. While some students—such as those mentioned in the above paragraph—consistently
                  have problems with giving up total control of the assignment to others, most students
                  express a significant amount of satisfaction with the process, the product, and the
                  way that this world-building exercise resonates with Romantic-period preoccupations
                  and projects. One student commented that the unique nature of this project “shook
                  up the university slump” she felt that she had been in during the final years of her
                  program and was thankful that it allowed her to express herself “in a different way.”
                  This cleansing of blunted perceptions via unsettling and unfamiliar situations that
                  call for revolutionary and imaginative processes exposes students to the ways and
                  means that a number of Romantic period “builders” creatively reacted to the tumultuous
                  here and now of England in the late eighteenth century.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Technological Obsolescence: Game Over?</span></h2>
               <p>Many instructors who are reluctant to integrate digital apparatuses into their pedagogical
                  toolkit cite the short-lived nature of hardware, software, and compatibility. Investing
                  a considerable amount of time in the development of a tool or exercise, only to discover
                  that it is incompatible with many students’ machines within a few years of implementation,
                  understandably discourages enthusiastic innovation. However, this risk is worth taking,
                  as using writing to reflect on writing can easily become an insular and uncritical
                  process. As Jerome McGann suggests in <em>Radiant Textuality: Literature After the World Wide Web</em> (2004), “We no longer have to use books to study other books or texts” (168). The
                  enCore Xpress platform was selected for flexibility and longevity, given its web-based
                  delivery and its relative stability as a database, and our modified versions have
                  successfully been migrated across servers at Acadia during infrastructure reconfigurations.
                  Nonetheless, the MOO is no Grecian Urn—the “chat” frame of the webpage that the MOO
                  generates relies on Java, which is becoming less common and thus less supported (and
                  usually blocked by default) by most web browsers. As a result, students have had increasing
                  technical difficulties using the MOO platform on their laptop computers over the past
                  two years. Most of the time these issues can be solved by adding exceptions for certain
                  websites within the Java configuration program and within particular browsers.</p>
               <p>While rapid obsolescence is a constant problem for digital tools and resources, there
                  are potential ways to work around this problem. We are currently looking into ways
                  either to convert the MOO's Java-based frame into HTML, or—in the worst case scenario—to
                  create a Virtual Machine “wrapper” (that is, to allow students to easily boot and
                  run an older version of Linux with better compatibility with Java on their computers
                  as a virtual machine). However, it is likely that the MOO will soon need to be retired
                  and replaced. The crucial thing is not to abandon the ideas and methods that the technology
                  enables. Unlike the now-defunct <em>Villa Diodati</em> MOO that has fallen into inaccessible ruins, with only its vast and trunkless introductory
                  page standing as a reminder that there was ever something there, Golgonooza will never
                  truly be a ghost town: it will continue to be an activated complex, an organic archive
                  of the fruits of exceptional student motivation and imagination and a valuable record
                  of a learning process that will continue to grow until more effective alternatives
                  emerge. One possible extension of this idea beyond the computer screen and classroom
                  walls that I am currently exploring is open source game-based narrative platforms
                  for mobile devices that work by tethering game content to actual geographies in an
                  augmented reality layer. When such alternatives become feasible, and as computer hardware,
                  software and networks continue to evolve, I will continue to ensure that both versions
                  of the Golgonooza MOO remain archived and accessible to the broader scholarly community.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Revolutionary returns: Teaching nightingales to harmonize and socialize</span></h2>
               <p>Attempting to engage students with the complexities, advantages, and difficulties
                  faced by the intersection of independent and interdependent approaches to creativity,
                  communication, and action during the Romantic period is not an easy task. Showing
                  and telling methods are easy, but they leave learners disconnected from the ideas
                  that are presented to them. Exposing them to historical contexts and thematic intricacies
                  via interactive, participatory learning environments offers a uniquely involved opportunity—akin
                  to a humanities “lab” space where controlled experimentation and exploration can take
                  place. Making use of this technology for the specific assignments mentioned above
                  has an additional benefit: students learn to innovate, create, share, and play together
                  and are thus professionalized for a collaborative career. Involving them in team-based
                  work that respects individual differences demonstrates an integrative approach to
                  such apparent opposition without watering down the difficulty associated with both
                  poles. These examples of technologically-enabled pedagogy ask students to be less
                  “romantic” about the Romantic period and to recognise the interplay and tension between
                  individual genius/independence and collaborative practice/interdependency at the heart
                  of the lives and texts of the period’s authors.</p>
               <p>Finally, to get students to reflect on the nature of the academic essay and argument
                  by exposing them to an unfamiliar variation of this process is an invaluable lesson
                  to learn in the latter years of an undergraduate education, when many of the paradigms
                  of higher education have become habitual and naturalised. In doing so, students are
                  able to reconsider the essay’s form and function, perceive its limitations and advantages,
                  and better understand their authorial, critical roles in relation to the abilities
                  of their readers. If my goal as an educator is to mentor students toward a thoughtful,
                  perceptive, and critical lucidity regarding literary expression, communication, creativity,
                  cultural production, and critical dialogue, then—whether or not students emerge from
                  this experience hating the assignments (in which case an appreciation for the strengths
                  of the essay form is renewed) or loving this alternative to essay argumentation (in
                  which case an awareness of the limitations of the essay form is revealed)—the careful
                  use of these gamespaces in the university-level classroom allows me to reach these
                  goals, confront the challenges associated with effective teaching and specific course
                  material, and “win” the pedagogical game by encouraging individual student players
                  to level-up and become lucid, collaborative builders in the spirit of the Romantic
                  period authors that they study. </p>
