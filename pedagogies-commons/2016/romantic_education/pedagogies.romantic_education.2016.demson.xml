          <p rend="noCount">The design of this course is to introduce students to the influence that Digital Humanities is having on our organization of the study of Romanticism. To that end, the course shifts from the traditional survey of major authors, to a survey of Romantic-era publishers, whose publications have only recently become widely available through digitization. While there are opportunities for the close reading of major Romantic texts authored by these publishers, emphasis is placed in the assignments on distant reading of periodicals. Moreover, the course prompts student to reflect on the diverse politics of publication, both in the Romantic era, when independent individuals acquired printing presses and began to advocate for freedom of the press, as well as in the present day, with its diverse concerns over freedom of information, copyrights, privacy, and so on.

                <p>Digital resources are transforming the study of Romanticism, and Romantic
                    pedagogy must keep pace with these changes. Archived materials that have long
                    been inaccessible to students, such as newspapers, diaries, correspondences, are
                    now readily available online; databases of high resolution images scanned are
                    now free; new analytical tools including word searches and image comparisons
                    (see the “Compare” button on the <ref
                        target="http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/public/about/tour/tour.html">Blake
                        Archive</ref> for an example) are proliferating with each passing year,
                    prompting new approaches. In response to these developments, my graduate-level,
                    four-week, online, research seminar on Romanticism takes full advantage of
                    innovations in Digital Humanities that enable and accelerate archival research.
                    A student today can use <title level="a">The Times Digital Archive 1785-2008
                    </title>to quickly identify the first reference to a skylark in the newspaper
                    during the Romantic period (April 20, 1786, 413, pg. 3), how many times it
                    appeared that year in the paper (twice), and whether or not references to
                    skylarks fell off or proliferated in subsequent years (they nearly doubled every
                    following year). This student can then read the articles in which those
                    references appear to achieve a sense of the contemporary attitudes toward that
                    celebrated avian. This sort of brief research assignment was not possible ten
                    years ago, and it has the potential to revolutionize the way students
                    contextualize Romantic literature. My course challenges students to break the
                    habits of reading that traditional anthologies promote and ultimately to expand
                    their sense of who the culturally significant figures in the Romantic era were.
                    More specifically, the aim of this course is to draw attention to the careers of
                    those people who were producers and directors of culture but who have been long
                    neglected because their creations were beyond reproduction in traditional print
                    anthologies. </p>
                <p>I designed my course, <title level="m">Revisiting the Radical Republican
                        Publishers of the Romantic Era in the Digital Era</title>, as an online,
                    summer-intensive workshop for graduate students who have completed introductory
                    graduate coursework as well as courses in English literature. Rather than being
                    an introductory survey of Romantic literature, it can serve as an introduction
                    to the period in a manner that does not include the traditional canon of
                    readings or criticism. My aim is to push students to explore new websites such
                    as: <lg>

                    >WorldCat</ref>, as well as subscription databases. The course challenges the
                    tendency to decontextualize and thereby depoliticize Romanticism by asking
                    students to use digital resources to explore the tumultuous culture of radical
                    publishers, principally in the 1810s and early 1820s, and to discover how those
                    publishers interacted with the poets and fiction writers.</p>
                <div type="section">
                    <head>Course Overview</head>
                    <p>“Why crush a starving bookseller?” Percy Shelley furiously wrote Leigh Hunt
                        after Peterloo, because in doing so, he explained, “tyrants […] strike in
                        his person at all of their political enemies” and “divert the attention of
                        the people from obtaining a Reform in their oppressive Government” (<title
                            level="m">Letters </title>73-4). In the wake of the government massacre
                        of reform-seekers in Manchester,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For
                            overviews, see Donald Read for Peterloo and Iain McCalman for radical
                            print culture.</note> the Home Office, in 1819, intensified its campaign
                        of prosecutions to shut down the domestic reform movement and focused their
                        efforts on those who sought to publicize their radical agenda. Despite this
                        crackdown, republican publishers including John Cahuac, Richard Carlile,
                        William Cobbett, Thomas Dolby, William Hone, and Leigh Hunt, fought back.
                        Veterans of government prosecutions, they rallied together to educate the
                        public about the imperative of reform and published their political agenda
                        in diverse forms: nursery rhymes, satirical essays, news reports, lyrical
                        poetry, open letters, lists of corrupt jurors, and caricatures of nearly
                        everyone in the government, including King George IV. They were convinced
                        that if enough people were educated about the need for reform, actual reform
                        would be inevitable. This radical campaign, however, did not survive for
                        long because publishers were divided, imprisoned, transported, or coerced
                        into silence. Because much of the print culture produced was prolific and
                        too costly to republish in an accessible format, it has remained neglected
                        in archives—until these materials were recently digitized.</p>
                    <p>The volatility and passion of the republican publishers in the Romantic
                        period exemplify the vibrancy of radical culture of the era, and this
                        political culture exerted a profound influence on contemporary literary
                        productions. I use Percy Shelley’s <title level="m">The Mask of
                            Anarchy</title> to demonstrate how various aspects of radical culture in
                        1819—politics, philosophy, and rhetoric—permeate the Romantic poetry of that
                        and subsequent years. By exploring the print culture of the era, as Michael
                        Scrivener has done in <title level="m">Radical Shelley</title> (1982), the
                        craft of its major poets becomes more apparent. To reach a broader audience
                        for his 1819 lyrical satire, for example, Shelley deployed ideas, phrases,
                        and particular figures drawn from contemporary sources including Hone’s
                        pamphlets and Hunt’s <title level="m">Examiner</title>. Through such
                        examples, I raise theoretical questions about Romantic poetics,
                        concentrating on originality, genius, invention, combination, and craft by
                        asking students to compare caricatures in <title level="m">The
                            Examiner</title>, <title level="m">Black Dwarf</title>, and the <title
                            level="m">Political Register</title> of such figures as Lords
                        Castlereagh and Sidmouth in relation to Shelley’s caricatures in <title
                            level="m">The Mask of Anarchy</title>. This activity tracks how
                        rhetorical strategies move between popular print culture and high
                        literature. With the new digital resources available to students, it now is
                        possible to explore these questions of poetics in very material ways, by
                        textual comparisons made feasible by digital resources rather than
                        theoretical speculation.</p>
                    <p>It is presently more feasible to explore the practical concerns involved in
                        publication in the late Romantic period. Using <title level="m">The Mask of
                            Anarchy</title> as an example, we discuss Shelley’s request that Leigh
                        Hunt publish in London, although Shelley was in Italy at the time, and
                        Hunt’s decision to suppress the ballad because of threats of government
                        prosecution. Students read the news, follow which publishers were fined,
                        arrested, imprisoned or transported, and thereby gather a sense of the
                        dangers of publication. By studying Romantic publishers, students begin to
                        see past the Romantic disdain for commerce and pragmatism to some of their
                        underlying concerns about their audiences, self-image, government
                        censorship, and financial autonomy, among other considerations.</p>
                    <p>While the major poets of the period drew from contemporary print culture and
                        negotiated with their publishers, a study of the era’s publishers open up
                        deeper issues still. Blake expresses the significance of the link between
                        authorship and publishing in a letter from 1808, having acquired by this
                        time his own press: “I call myself now Independent. I can be Poet Painter
                        &amp; Musician as the Inspiration comes” (“Letter To George Cumberland, 1
                        September 1880,” <ref

                                ><title level="m">The William Blake Archives</title></ref>). Blake’s
                        press gave him freedom, a Romantic concept that regularly conflated the
                        political with the artistic. This course introduces students to the careers
                        and life projects of four English republican publishers of the late
                        eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries who, like the major poets of the
                        period, meditated on political and artistic freedom and were forerunners in
                        the struggle for the freedom of the press: William Blake, Leigh Hunt,
                        William Hone, and William Cobbett. Other significant figures are considered,
                        such as Hannah Moore, Charlotte Smith, the Wordsworths, the Shelleys and
                        Byron, and John Clare, but the aim here is to spotlight a representative
                        group of publishers of the era who fought for a free press. Their
                        convictions prompted them to write, and when their productions were deemed
                        too dangerous for established publishers, all four began personally to
                        publish their writings, often at great personal hazard. It is a tragedy,
                        then, that while historians, literary critics, and teachers have
                        acknowledged the influence of radical publishers in the Romantic era, the
                        careers and publications of these figures have been largely neglected or
                        only mentioned in passing.</p>
                    <p>My summer intensive online course introduces students to Romanticism, print
                        culture studies, and the emergent field of Digital Humanities; a variety of
                        daily tasks are therefore required. Each day, students are check an online
                        for course announcements and instructions, complete required readings (many
                        of which are online), review assignments and conduct database research,
                        write a blog entry, participate in our online seminar discussion threads,
                        and contribute to our shared webliography (identifying and reviewing new
                        digital resources). All of these activities along with my lectures return to
                        three core questions. <lg>
                            <l>1. What is the relationship between journalism and literature? </l>
                            <l>2. How did self-publishing affect the literary and non-literary
                                productions of those Romantics who worked closely with a publisher
                                or, better still, published their own works?</l>
                            <l>3. How is the postmodern digital era reconfiguring our understanding
                                of the Romantic era (its canon, its poetics, its enduring
                                relevance)?</l>
                        </lg> These questions serve as prompts for the students’ blog posts
                        (suggested three hundred words per day), in which they respond to readings
                        and make connections (20% of the course grade, 5% per week). They guide our
                        online discussions (30% of the course grade, 5% per week for participation,
                        10% for impromptu research-question responses), serve as the weekly exam
                        question prompt (30% of course grade, dropping the lowest of four), and are
                        starting points for their final papers (a three thousand-word research paper
                        that makes use of digital archives, databases, and other online resources is
                        20% of the course grade). In addition to the daily required readings, I
                        suggest that students work online from two to four hours daily; however,
                        once they are engaged with online research and discussion, they tend to
                        spend much more time online than this guideline proposes. It is not unusual
                        for threads of student discussions to carry on for days, even when we have
                        moved on to subsequent units.</p>
                    <p>There are four units to the course: (a) “William Blake: The Recluse with a
                        Printing Press;” (b) “Leigh Hunt: <title level="m">The Examiner</title>, the
                        Cockney School Romantics, and Peterloo;” (c) “William Hone: The Treason
                        Trials, Peterloo, and Pamphleteering;” and (d) “William Cobbett: The <title
                            level="m">Political Register</title> and <title level="m">Rural
                            Rides</title> after Peterloo.” In each unit, students read a biography,
                        explore the publisher’s career, analyze both literary and non-literary
                        texts, discuss a variety of theoretical questions, and take an essay exam.

                    <head>Unit One: William Blake: The Recluse with a Printing Press</head>
                    <p> The first unit of the course introduces students to William Blake, to print
                        culture studies, and to Digital Humanities. Students read G. E. Bentley,
                        Jr.’s <title level="m">The Stanger from Paradise: A Biography of William
                            Blake </title>(2003), selections from Northrop Frye,<title level="m">
                            The William Blake Archives</title>, and <title level="m">The Georgian
                            Index </title>of early British newspapers. I introduce students to
                        Blake’s mythology, to radical culture of the Romantic era, to Digital
                        Humanities, and to key aspects of Blake’s thought, including his creed of
                        radicalism and roots in Dissenting Enthusiasm. </p>
                    <p> Students explore Blake’s self-published works, analyze the relationship of
                        image to text, and compare different manuscripts of the same text. They
                        discuss Blake’s “Enthusiasm” and the influence it has in his productions
                        (specifically, his parents’ rejection of public worship in preference for
                        private prayer and introspection), and the more generic connections between
                        literature and religion (specifically, in questions relating to inspiration,
                        epiphany, and the aura of scripture). My lectures (which I post as text
                        documents, usually between six- to twelve-hundred words in length) focus on
                            <title level="m">The First Book of Urizen</title> and take students
                        beyond the Blake that typically appears in anthologies, and I encourage my
                        students to explore later works as well.</p>
                    <p> At the end of each unit, students are given a two-hour open-book, take-home
                        exam in which they answer the following question: “Considering that Blake
                        had near complete control over his artistic productions—from their
                        conception, through their composition and publication, to their
                        distribution—how did Blake’s self-publication affect his artistic
                        productions?” Students are required to focus on a specific passage from a
                        text and to work with <title level="m">The William Blake Archive</title>.

                    <head>Unit Two: Leigh Hunt: <title level="m">The Examiner</title>, the Cockney
                        School Romantics, and Peterloo</head>

                    <p> The second unit introduces students to Leigh Hunt and the Cockney School.
                        Students read Anthony Holden’s <title level="m">The Wit in the Dungeon: The
                            Remarkable Life of Leigh Hunt: Poet, Revolutionary, and the Last of the
                            Romantics</title> (2005) and browse issues of Hunt’s <title level="m"
                            >The Examiner.</title> Rather than reading whole issues, they find an
                        event or story and follow Hunt’s coverage of it over several issues. My
                        example is Hunt’s coverage of Peterloo in the fall issues of 1819. During
                        this week, students also read selections from Jeffrey Cox’s <title level="m"
                            >Poetry and Politics in the Cockney School: Keats, Shelley, Hunt and
                            Their Circle</title> (1998), several poems by Keats, including
                        “Dedication to Leigh Hunt, Esq.,” “Written On the Day That Mr. Leigh Hunt
                        Left Prison,” and poems by Percy Shelley, including <title level="m"
                            >Adonaïs</title>.</p>
                    <p> Student discussion topics range widely as they draw comparisons between
                        Blake’s and Hunt’s biographies and their activities as publishers. We
                        discuss literary circles and the central role that publishers often play and
                        survey contemporary literary reviews and the politics that inform them,
                        particularly in relation to Shelley’s response to reviewers of Keats in
                            <title level="m">Adonaïs</title>. I ask students to think in broader
                        terms about the relationship between newspapers and poetry. Hunt was often
                        accused of spur-of-the-moment overproduction at the cost of quality (a
                        typical criticism of newsprint prose), yet spontaneity was lauded by most
                        Romantics as an essential trait of poetic genius. Though not traditionally
                        conserved as a genre of literature, to what extent can we say that <title
                            level="m">The Examiner</title> is literary? As several of the critics we
                        have read point out, Keats owed much to the paper—if Hunt had not published
                        his poetry, it is hard to imagine how Keats would have reached reviewers
                        around the nation. My question, however, is a large one: Is the sum of each
                        issue greater than the whole? Or, in other words, what are some of the
                        effects of reading poetry next to drama reviews next to bankruptcy notices,
                        etc.? I urge students to work with specific examples. These questions tend
                        to produce much speculation, so it is helpful to intervene in the discussion
                        with guiding quotes from Wordsworth’s prefaces to <title level="m">Lyrical
                            Ballads</title> and/or from Shelley’s <title level="m">A Defence of
                            Poetry</title>. </p>
                    <p> In the second unit I also introduce students to Peterloo as a defining event
                        in the Romantic period. Students read selections from James Chandler’s
                            <title level="m">England in 1819 </title>(1999) and reports in various
                        newspapers, including Hunt’s reporting. I ask students whether Hunt’s
                        reports of Peterloo are reliable or inflammatory, seditious propaganda, or
                        Romantic. The exam question at the end of this unit is: “If Hunt fostered a
                        coterie of radical authors and a culture of political defiance, how did this
                        culture permeate the literary and/or non-literary productions from the
                        Cockney School?”</p>

                <div type="section">
                    <head>Unit Three: William Hone and the Popular Reform Movement</head>
                    <p> The third unit continues reading on Peterloo and also introduces students to
                        William Hone’s political pamphlets and the caricatures of George Cruikshank.
                        Students read the following: <lg>

                        beginning in the 1790s and carried through to the 1830s. In <title level="m"
                            >The Political House that Jack Built</title> (1819), a pamphlet that
                        articulates a core conviction of radicals of the era, Hone lays out his
                        faith in the power of an independent press. Unlike Cruikshank, Hone rages
                        with indignation: “This is THE THING, that in spite of new Acts, / And
                        attempts to restrain it, by Soldiers or Tax, / Will <emph>poison</emph> the
                        Vermin, / That plunder the Wealth, / That lay in the House, / That Jack

                        interact in the era’s political pamphlets and to assess the political
                        rhetoric of Shelley’s 1819 poetry. This week ends with a broad discussion of
                        radical and Romantic attitudes toward money and economic ambition. The third
                        unit exam asks students to explore a comparative analysis of different
                        rhetorical strategies or modes that radicals and Romantics adopted in the
                        battle for the freedom of the press after Peterloo. They focus on specific
                        passages and/or images from Hone’s publications, the writings of the Cockney
                        School, and/or John Cahuac, and their responses should include digital texts

                    <p>In the fourth unit of the course, students explore William Cobbett’s
                        writings. Whereas Bentley was dense and slow-going, Richard Ingrams’s <title
                            level="m">The Life and Adventures of William Cobbett</title> (2006) is
                        lively and a quick read. Students browse issues of <title level="m"
                            >Political Register</title>, read selections from his <title level="m"
                            >Rural Rides</title> online, and evaluate Kevin Gilmartin’s assessment
                        of Cobbett in “Reading Cobbett’s Contradictions” (1996). At this point, I
                        begin to help students define their final paper project and our discussion
                        questions tend to be comparative and reflective in kind. I ask students, for
                        example, to compare Cobbett’s early years to those of other radical
                        publishers whose biographies we have read. This allows us to appreciate how
                        Cobbett, whose career runs across the entirety of the Romantic period, had
                        little interaction with literary figures and is usually not thought of as a
                        Romantic at all. Nevertheless, we can draw interesting connections with his
                        contemporaries: Cobbett’s critiques of the English prison system, of the
                        need for public education, of rapid urbanization and the expansion of global
                        commerce, as well as his celebrations of the independent cottage as the
                        English ideal (John Bull appears throughout his writings), of the freedom of
                        the press, and of greater governmental transparency are not dissimilar to
                        the convictions expressed by his contemporaries. </p>

                    <p>As the course concludes, I ask students for reflections. One of the great
                        advocates for the freedom of the press, Cobbett repeatedly returns in his
                        papers to the struggle not only for a free press but also for a press
                        independent of Government control: <quote>If ever there was in the world a
                            thing completely perverted from its original design and tendency, it is
                            the press of England; which, instead of enlightening, does, as far as it
                            has any power, keep the people in ignorance which, instead of cherishing
                            notions of liberty, tends to the making of the people slaves; and which,
                            instead of being their guardian, is the most efficient instrument in the
                            hands of all those who oppress, or wish to oppress, them. (Qtd. in Jones
                            1-3) </quote> I take this further with a final thought on the course:
                            <quote>The activity of publishing runs counter to Romanticism’s
                            celebration of solitude, introspection, and the reclusive poet;
                            publication, a very practical activity, assumes an interested public and
                            demands a market, requires broadcast expression rather than private
                            reflection or meditation, and rarely can be accomplished without a
                            circle or network of suppliers and distributors. In other words and
                            perhaps more simply put, its concern for being timely run counter to
                            aspirations for transcendence. Even Blake, whose most dear publications
                            were limited to a very select audience, wrestled with contradictions
                            between his artistic vision and his work as a publisher. For this
                            reason, the study of Romantic publishers allows us to see through the
                            ideology of Romantic poetics and to appreciate better those that made
                            possible, often at great personal hazard, Romantic
                        literature.</quote></p>

                    <head>Conclusion</head>
                    <p>New digital resources offer students the ability to research and analyze
                        print culture of the Romantic period in ways that were not previously
                        possible outside of archives. Today students have an unprecedented level of
                        access to self-publication; they may blog, maintain a website, read and post
                        reviews, comment on news stories, and participate in forum discussions
                        online. Throughout my course, I ask students to reflect on possible
                        analogies between the rise of the popular press in England during the
                        Romantic era and the rise of the Internet in our present digital era. What
                        is perennially at stake is our freedom of speech and of the press, that what
                        we learn from the radical publishers of the Romantic era is that there is a
                        political if not ethical (as radicals often conflate the two) mandate to use
                        the Internet to enable and enfranchise others through the open dissemination
                        of information. </p>
                    <p>Understanding the publication history of the Romantic literature is integral
                        to understanding the literature itself; the title of Percy Shelley’s early
                        sonnet, “On Launching some Bottles filled with Knowledge into the Bristol
                        Channel,” reveals one of many ways the poet found to disseminate his work,
                        and Leigh Hunt and Mary Shelley fought to publish Percy Shelley’s poetry
                        after his death despite pressures to suppress it. This struggle to publish
                        was an essential aspect not only of Percy Shelley’s career but also is
                        apparent throughout Romantic literature. His troubled relationship with
                        publication is already figured in his poetry, much as Blake’s hard-won
                        artistic independence, won through securing his own printing press, is
                        figured in his later works. </p>
