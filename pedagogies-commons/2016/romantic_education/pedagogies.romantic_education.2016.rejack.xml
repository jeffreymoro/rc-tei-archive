            This essay chronicles my experience teaching a course outside of the realm of Romanticism (a first-year writing course focused on digital media), an experience which occasioned reflection on the lessons that Romanticism can offer us about contemporary new media, and in particular how we approach new media pedagogically. The essay begins with an overview of new media scholarship which seeks to redress the tendency to view new media as always immaterial, the scholarship that informed much of the focus of the course in question. I next discuss some of the tools and methods adopted in teaching the course. And the final move in the essay turns toward Romanticism, and specifically to theories of and scholarship on the Romantic imagination. My final contention is that the Romantic imagination offers ways to resist the ideology of immateriality which characterizes so much of new media discourse.

                <p>In the spring of 2011, I taught a first-year writing seminar focused on fictional
                    and non-fictional representations of the internet and digital culture.<note
                        place="foot" resp="editors"> I’d like to thank the students of my course for
                        all the enthusiasm and insight they brought to our investigations of digital
                        culture. Their hard work helped shape my thinking in ways that I couldn’t
                        have imagined beforehand. </note> As a devoted Romanticist, I envisioned
                    such an opportunity as a chance to step outside my usual nineteenth-century base
                    and see what effects the time spent in unfamiliar terrain might produce. My goal
                    was to help students approach critically various aspects of technological life,
                    and, in so doing, encourage them to reflect on the relation between college
                    writing and the twenty-first-century media landscape. The connection between my
                    initial conception of the course and Romanticism was tangential at most. I
                    titled the course “Imagining the Internet” because I wanted students to see
                    digital culture from a shifted intellectual perspective, specifically through
                    the logic of defamiliarization that imagination enables. In particular I wanted
                    to counter the reigning digital rhetoric, one which privileges immateriality as
                    if it were actually the ontological condition of computing. From its beginnings
                    cyberculture has represented the digital realm as one free from materiality, as
                    in the emblematic early example of the hackers in William Gibson’s <title
                        level="m">Neuromancer</title> (1984) who long to escape into cyberspace and
                    away from their bodies, which they derisively term “meat.” That immaterial
                    ideology persists in our contemporary practices like cloud computing and syncing
                    between devices, both of which give the impression that the data accessed has no
                    fixed material basis, but merely exists as eternally mutable zeroes and ones. As
                    such, “imagination” may have seemed an odd choice, given that it tends to be
                    understood as the mental faculty capable of transporting us out of embodied
                    experience, in a manner akin to what cyberspace purportedly enables. Instead, I
                    wanted students to discover some of the complex material exchanges that make
                    possible digital culture’s aura of immateriality, and to do so by imagining the
                    materiality that so easily eludes our grasp of the digital. Although I began the
                    course assuming that it would take me into new territory, I quickly found myself
                    in a space eerily familiar to me as a Romanticist, a space where imagination,
                    ideology and materiality exist in fraught relation to one another. In this essay
                    I recount that experience as a way to reflect on the overlapping domains of
                    teaching and research, new and old media, and the frameworks that help us place
                    their iterative connections. </p>
                <p>In what follows, then, I demonstrate how I presented my students with the digital
                    rhetoric of immateriality, how we attempted to resist that rhetoric with the aid
                    of digital tools, and how that process illuminated what it means to
                    imaginatively embody Romantic texts, an illumination that additionally cast
                    light back on new media. Romantic theories of imagination offered a conceptual
                    framework for students to intellectually and creatively rematerialize the
                    seemingly immaterial nature of digital objects. As Lori Emerson argues
                    concerning interface design trends in contemporary computing, new media
                    interfaces are now “steadily making their way toward invisibility,
                    imperceptibility, and inoperability” (1), characteristics which become equated
                    rhetorically with “naturalness” and the devices’ seemingly “magical” properties
                    (4–19). When dealing with technologies of such complexity, when, as Percy
                    Shelley claims, “our calculations have outrun conception,” the imagination can
                    effectively make strange the perceived naturalness of computing and bring
                    materiality back into view.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> While my focus in
                        this essay rests on how these issues played out in the classroom (and how
                        that experience subsequently helped me see anew the connections between my
                        scholarship and pedagogy), I’m indebted to the work of several other
                        scholars who have imagined various digital futures for Romanticism through
                        their practices. I’m thinking of course of the many digital resources, like
                            <ref target="http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/"><title level="m">The
                                Blake Archive</title></ref> and <ref target="http://www.nines.org/"
                                ><title level="j">NINES</title></ref>, that have invigorated
                        nineteenth-century scholarship in the digital era. But also I have in mind
                        work like Paul Youngquist’s playful and incisive “Techno-Prosthetic Romantic
                        Futurism,” an essay in the mold of hypertext fiction, in which he suggests,
                        among other things, imagining <ref
                            target="http://www.erudit.org/projspec/article/013157ar/950.html"
                            >“criticism of Romanticism as a field of digital possibility,”</ref> a
                        realm where the <ref
                            target="http://www.erudit.org/projspec/article/013157ar/190.html">hacker
                            is the hero of “digital resistance” just as the Romantics hacked
                            textuality before the advent of cyberspace</ref>. Similarly compelling
                        is Andrew Stauffer’s insistence that, in the digitizing and archiving of
                        nineteenth-century texts, we ought to “use the digital environment not to
                        supplant the paper record, but to develop a more nuanced critical method for
                        understanding the physical forms and features of the papers that the
                        Romantics left behind” (17). </note> Now more than five years after the
                    teaching experience I relate in this article, I have taught Romanticism several
                    more times, in different contexts (as part of a survey, in seminar form devoted
                    wholly to Romanticism, as part of a genre-based course) and to different
                    audiences (undergraduate English majors and non-majors, MA and PhD students),
                    and as a result I am more confident in my conviction that when we teach
                    Romanticism, we teach a form of media studies. Imagining a medium (old or new)
                    just is doing Romanticism. In that sense, the habits of mind and practice
                    outlined here signify a pedagogy <emph>of</emph> Romanticism as much as one
                        <emph>for</emph> Romanticism.</p>

                    <head>I. “There is no matter here”: The Illusions of Medial Ideology</head>
                    <p>The intellectual kernel that led me to develop the course, and which began to
                        solidify in my mind the productive connections between Romanticism and new
                        media studies, was Matthew Kirschenbaum’s identification of a “medial
                        ideology” pervading the study of electronic media. Acknowledging his debt to
                        Jerome McGann’s notion of “Romantic ideology,” Kirschenbaum defines his
                        related ideology as “one that substitutes popular representations of a
                        medium […] for a more comprehensive treatment of the material particulars of
                        a given technology” (36).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> McGann’s
                            argument in 1983 that Romanticist scholarship suffered from “an
                            uncritical absorption in Romanticism’s own self-representations” (1)
                            transfers remarkably well to the realm of media studies. Kirschenbaum
                            was not the first to resist such uncritical absorption in the context of
                            new media. For instance, a decade prior, Katherine Hayles attempted as
                            much by identifying and challenging what she calls an “ideology of
                            disembodiment” which has its roots in early communications theory and
                            computational practices. She contends that “[t]he body’s
                            dematerialization depends in complex and highly specific ways on the
                                <emph>embodied</emph> circumstances that an ideology of
                            dematerialization would obscure” (193). Kirschenbaum extends the work of
                            recapturing embodied circumstances by focusing on the forensic level of
                            digital materiality (i.e. down to the bit level of the hard drive) as
                            well as the formal level of its appearance in various software and
                            hardware configurations (i.e. a blinking cursor on the screen).</note>
                        Kirschenbaum demonstrates how the representations of digital culture portray
                        new media as divorced from the material aspects of its existence—we treat
                        zeroes and ones as if they were merely abstractions, not as metaphors to
                        signify particular material processes. To establish some of the course’s
                        foundational assumptions about new media, then, I introduced my students to
                        a variety of “popular representations of [the] medium.” We aimed to read
                        these texts through a conventional humanities practice: ideology critique.
                        The specific aspect of digital ideology we examined was the assumption that
                        bodies do not matter, and that material concerns disappear in the purely
                        disembodied flow of data. One can witness that assumption’s most extreme
                        form in the desire to translate the human brain into binary code and thereby
                        achieve digital immortality (by now a common science fiction trope as well
                        as an <ref target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uIzS1uCOcE">actual goal
                            of many technological enthusiasts</ref>), but it also persists in the
                        banal versions one encounters regularly in the practice of everyday digital
                        life. The first example discussed here, and one of the first texts I
                        presented to my students, falls squarely in the former category: John Perry
                        Barlow’s “<ref
                            target="https://projects.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html">A
                            Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</ref>,” first published in
                        February 1996 through the <title level="m">Electronic Frontier
                            Foundation</title>, an internet advocacy group co-founded by Barlow. In
                        what became a widely copied and disseminated document of the early Web,
                        Barlow addresses the “Governments of the Industrial World,” the “weary
                        giants of flesh and steel” who have no sway over “the new home of Mind,”
                        rhetorical figures which pose industry as the evil cyborg enemies of the
                        pure spirit of humanity. Cyberspace is posed as “an act of nature […]
                        [which] grows itself through our collective actions,” and that such growth
                        “consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a
                        standing wave in the web of our communications.” With freedom from the
                        trappings of industry, politics, capitalism and other material concerns,
                        Barlow insists of cyberspace, “there is no matter here.” The social
                        reorganization promised by cyberspace extends to individual subjectivity as
                        well, with a similar stripping away of matter. Barlow claims that “our
                        identities have no bodies,” and that, like the discrete packets of bits that
                        zoom across the globe from one computer to another, they are endlessly
                        mutable and mobile. These bodiless identities, without the limitations of
                        material existence inhabit a world of pure imagination: “whatever the human
                        mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost.”
                        Or, we might say, channeling Gene Wilder’s Willy Wonka, “If you want to view
                        paradise, simply look around and view it. Anything you want to, do it. Want
                        to change the world, there’s nothing to it.” </p>
                    <p>So says another representative example that my students and I analyzed: <ref
                            target="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZMZoy3rrlM&amp;">an AT&amp;T
                            advertisement</ref> from 2010 which uses “Pure Imagination” as its
                        backing music. The ad co-opts the rhetoric of early techno-utopian
                        manifestos like Barlow’s, but it drastically changes the kind of “freedom”
                        on offer. Freedom in the ad means life in a corporate world with the promise
                        of escape through the internet, even as the network itself becomes more
                        corporatized and centrally controlled through seemingly ubiquitous points of
                        access and handy “tethered devices.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                            Jonathan Zittrain uses the term “tethered devices” to refer to products
                            like smartphones, iPods, and gaming consoles, the uses of which are
                            restricted by the companies that produce them (as opposed to personal
                            computers, which users can open, modify, and install third-party
                            software on without the parent company’s approval). Zittrain argues that
                            the prevalence of such devices will enact “a wholesale shift of our
                            information ecosystem away from generativity” (102) and towards greater
                            control (from regulators, the hardware companies, service providers,
                            etc.). </note> The ad shows various young urbanites navigating through a
                        post-industrial world, still one of flesh and steel, and yet they seem
                        unaware of the magical world that pulses around them (like a wireless
                        network), here pictured in the form of childlike drawings brought to life
                        amidst the cityscape. Toward the commercial’s end, the drawings all
                        collapse, suggesting the end of imagination precisely at the moment that the
                        objects become fully material (a train crashes into a wall; a three-eyed
                        monster drapes over the side of a bridge; a giant robot falls to the ground,
                        along with his attendant cloud shapes). After the figures disappear, the ad
                        cuts to an isolated man sitting on a bench perched on a concrete overlook,
                        his head downcast, his shirt unbuttoned and tie loosened, his briefcase,
                        coffee and lunch next to him—all helpful details suggesting his
                        post-industrial ennui, presumably the cause of the imaginary figures’
                        departures. But suddenly, the man remembers his smartphone, and its
                        unearthly glow lights up his now smiling face, as one of the imagined
                        figures return to the scene. Once again he lives in a world of pure
                        imagination.</p>
                    <p>In addition to introducing the ideology of cyberspace as a disembodied,
                        immaterial realm free from politics, class, and matter itself, I used these
                        two texts to reflect on the way we access and interpret such materials.
                        YouTube, the site on which we watched the ad, is a vastly useful collection
                        of visual materials, but not a transparent one. Our class discussed, for
                        example, YouTube’s (then current, now defunct) motto, “Broadcast
                            yourself,”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For most of its existence,
                            YouTube’s title (as displayed in the title bar of a web browser) has
                            read “YouTube – Broadcast Yourself.” After October 24, 2012, the title
                            appears only as “YouTube.” As the site’s emphasis has shifted from
                            producing to consuming, the devaluing of individuals doing the
                            “broadcasting” by and of themselves is unsurprising.</note> as an
                        intentional alignment with the history of amateur broadcasting in the early
                        twentieth century, which has repeatedly followed the pattern of innovation,
                        amateur development, and corporate appropriation described in <title
                            level="m">The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information
                            Empires</title> (2010) by Tim Wu. With the AT&amp;T ad, the self that is
                        broadcasted is named “<ref target="https://www.youtube.com/user/attoffer"
                            >attoffer</ref>,” and when you click on “his” personal website, it
                        unsurprisingly directs you to offers for a subscription to AT&amp;T’s
                        various network services. What begins as an open service, a place where
                        anyone can post videos for free without limitations on access and ownership,
                        becomes increasingly closed, regulated and centrally controlled. While
                        peddling immaterial ideology to the extent that the “self” is the message
                        being broadcast, as Barlow hoped identities without bodies might do, YouTube
                        suggests, through its specific medial transactions, a contradictory set of
                        ideas about what pure imagination through a network might entail. Here the
                        freedom of cyberspace comes at a cost, one that “attoffer” will happily
                        specify, even as its parent company’s rhetoric obscures the material
                        interactions through which the network functions.</p>
                    <p>After introducing this particular awareness of digital materiality, I hoped
                        to help students to see immaterial ideology <emph>as </emph>ideology.
                        Discussing texts like Barlow’s “Declaration” and the AT&amp;T advertisement
                        certainly began that process, but those methods were firmly rooted in an old
                        method: ideologically attuned close reading. I wanted also to use digital
                        tools to demonstrate the ways in which our experience of digital culture
                        comes back to materiality. Text analysis software, for instance, offers a
                        particularly striking way to reflect on textual materiality and to imagine
                        what it might mean to reintroduce material specificity to digital objects.
                        By demonstrating a text’s mutability as it moves from one material medium to
                        another, the complexities of textual signification become newly
                            visible.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This recognition is similar
                            to McGann’s point about the theoretical and conceptual value gained from
                            encoding literary texts into digital environments: “Because our computer
                            tools are models of what we imagine we know—they’re built to our
                            specifications—when they show us what they know they are reporting
                            ourselves back to us” (<title level="m">Radiant Textuality</title>
                            143).</note> When the class read Rudy Rucker’s classic cyberpunk novel
                            <title level="m">Software</title> (1982), we put the novel’s entire text
                        into a web-based program called <ref target="http://voyant-tools.org"
                                ><title level="m">Voyant</title></ref>, which analyzes the number of
                        occurrences of distinct words, and allows the manipulation of them in
                        various ways. One can view a word cloud (the larger words representing
                        visually their higher relative frequency), chart one word against another,
                        track a word’s appearance at different times throughout the book, and
                        otherwise manipulate the textual “corpus” as a dataset. With <title
                            level="m">Software</title>, for example, one can track “software” and
                        “hardware,” the two terms around which the novel dramatizes its main
                        concerns regarding identity and embodiment. Early on a character opines that
                        “the soul is the software” (62). Cobb Anderson, the inventor of the
                        intelligent robots called “boppers,” gets rewarded by his creatures, who
                        translate his soul into new “hardware,” a robot body that looks exactly like
                        his human one, and which negates the pesky problem of mortality. By
                        isolating the two words, one can view them in context across all their
                        instances in the novel in different visual and linguistic representations. </p>
                    <p>Of course, one can accomplish a similar task, but more slowly, using
                        traditional reading methods. The usefulness of a digital tool like this one
                        rests on the altered presentation of information that we might alternatively
                        access through print. I foregrounded this particular realization for my
                        students by focusing on the manipulation of the text required to produce
                        such a representation, a process that reinforces the material specificity of
                        texts, and the variations that occur between digital and print. Rucker
                        published, in 2010, the entire <title level="m">Ware Tetralogy</title>
                            (<title level="m">Software</title> and its three follow-ups) in a
                        single-volume print edition, which my students purchased for use in the
                        course. Students could alternatively read the novel in digital form, which
                        Rucker simultaneously published for free as a PDF made available through his
                        website and distributed under a Creative Commons license. Even with most of
                        the remediation already done for us, the process of transporting the digital
                        text into another software environment allowed us to reflect on how we might
                        understand “text” in relation to the novel’s interest in software and
                        hardware. The novel’s linguistic data became akin to code that we could run
                        on the different software and hardware configurations of a print book, a PDF
                        reader, or a web-based text analysis program.<note place="foot"
                            resp="editors"> McGann offers another useful model for this approach to
                            textuality, when he writes, in <title level="m">Radiant
                                Textuality</title>, that “Any given textual form represents a
                            complex set of transactional codes written for simultaneous and/or
                            sequential execution” (150).</note> One particular problem, however,
                        demonstrated how the process of textual migration itself, like the
                        transmission of Cobb’s “software” (the data that makes up his “soul”) into
                        new “hardware” (a fresh robot body), reoriented the nature of the novel’s
                        print and digital materialities. When copying and pasting the text from the
                        PDF, the running header, reading “<title level="m">Rudy Rucker</title>” and
                            “<title level="m">The Ware Tetralogy: Software</title>” respectively on
                        the verso and recto (terms complicated by the typical single-page display of
                        PDFs), becomes part of the “corpus” analyzed by <title level="m"
                            >Voyant</title>. When tracking the instances of the word “software,” the
                        numbers get significantly skewed (since it appears seventy-three times in
                        the header). The result of witnessing this material negotiation of a
                        print-based text simultaneously published in digital format and then
                        transported into another instantiation was that my students had to consider
                        the text “as a laced network of linguistic and bibliographic codes” (<title
                            level="m">Textual Condition</title> 13). Do we count those seventy-three
                        instances of “software” that occur in the header? Or rather,
                            <emph>how</emph> do we count them and account for their meaning? Such
                        questions become relevant when manipulating the text with an awareness of
                        the particular transactions that make such manipulation possible. Like the
                        novel itself, which skeptically regards the transmission of one’s “soul” via
                        software implemented in new “hardware,” our treatment of the digital text in
                        relation to its print forms helped us see the processes of transmission not
                        as transparent, but rather as contingent upon specific material factors. </p>
                    <p>In addition to analyzing print-based materials with the aid of digital tools,
                        the class also examined born-digital texts to see further the obscuring
                        effects of immaterial digital ideology. Students took a particular shine to
                        a project by Leonardo Solaas, a programmer and new media artist who created
                            <title level="m">Google Variations</title>, a net-art installation that
                        re-presents Google in altered states. Most of the variations present a
                        functional Google homepage with only slight tweaks. <ref
                            target="http://turbulence.org/Works/google/pond/">“The Google
                            Pond,”</ref> for example, creates a visual ripple effect when moving the
                        cursor over the page. Similarly, <ref
                            target="http://turbulence.org/Works/google/painter/">“Paint it
                            Google”</ref> transforms the cursor into a paint tool, and the page into
                        a color palette and canvas. Others have a more programmatic purpose and a
                        lesser degree of functionality. <ref
                            target="http://turbulence.org/Works/google/god/1.htm">“Google is
                            God”</ref> displays six separate pages, designed to look like individual
                        search results from Google, all of which present quotations regarding the
                        correspondence between Google and divine power. The final result, however,
                        gestures outside of Solaas’s pre-programmed response, and opens an actual
                        Google results page for the query, <ref

                        without signal and as such works toward Solaas’s goal of destabilizing and
                        denaturalizing what has become such a dominant feature of internet use. The
                        final variation, titled <ref
                            target="http://turbulence.org/Works/google/some/day/google/will/not/be/there/"
                            >“The Future,”</ref> reinforces the contingency of Google, and of all
                        such digital objects. It displays a typical “HTTP 404,” or “Page Not Found,”
                        error message, a standard code to indicate when communication with the
                        server is intact, but the requested page could not be found. The title of
                        the requested page in this case is “some/day/google/will/not/be/there/.” The
                        implication, of course, is that Google’s server has no such page because
                        Google does not anticipate such an eventuality. The “missing” page
                        nonetheless speaks by virtue of its absence. Solaas’s presentation reminds
                        us that Google will not exist for all eternity (an obvious truth), but
                        furthermore that the nature of its existence is contingent upon the
                        particularities of our material interfaces and programming and always
                        experienced in relation to the larger culture of computing. </p>

                        perspective in their own productions. All students were required to write
                        for our course blog, a forum in which they could reflect on and treat
                        critically (and playfully<note place="foot" resp="editors"> One student, for
                            example, wrote his brief bio on our “Users” page as a series of 1s and

                        particular communicative modes enabled by the blog form. As is typical of
                        the form, students regularly used media in their posts, linked outside the
                        blog, referenced other peers’ posts, and perhaps most useful for the
                        course’s writing instruction goals, self-consciously adopted a tone more
                        informal than that employed in their academic papers. We specifically
                        discussed that difference in our conversations about academic writing in
                        multiple class sessions devoted to peer review. I also asked students to
                        contemplate the particularities of expression enabled by their word
                        processing software when writing their academic essays. For their second
                        paper, I assigned students a relatively conventional comparison paper
                        (analyzing texts from two different media), but with the additional
                        stipulation that they manipulate their medium with something in addition to
                        text. For most students this meant embedding images or video in their
                        essays, but even this simple task helped them reflect on the content of
                        their papers: rematerializing and denaturalizing digital objects. For
                        example, one student writing about William Gibson’s <title level="m"
                            >Agrippa</title> (1992) and Solaas’s <title level="m">Google
                            Variations</title> argues through an analysis of the two works “whether
                        a user is forced to submit to a medium or is granted options, the mechanism
                        through which one receives information dictates the interpretation of that
                        information.” She writes that <title level="m">Google Variations</title>
                        “reminds users of their role on a search engine since every movement creates
                        a new effect,” which in turn helps to erase the influence of Google itself:
                        namely, that because of Google’s ubiquity, “the user forgets the mechanism,
                        allowing the mechanism to have an influence without the user’s awareness.”
                        By embedding in her essay screenshots of her manipulation of <title
                            level="m">Google Variations</title>, the student reinforced her argument
                        visually and methodologically (Figure 1). In effect, her image of “Paint it
                        Google” represents the kind of awareness of “the mechanism” she describes in
                        the paper. Not only has she altered the page by using the cursor to deform
                        Google’s logo, she has also typed in the search box, obscured but still
                        legible, “Vanderbilt University First Year Writing Seminars,” of which our
                        course was one. This moment of textual and visual play gets “captured” by
                        her computer’s screen capture software, and then redeployed in its modified
                        form by conscious manipulation of the software that enables her to compose
                        her essay. The essay itself, a product of the course being queried in her
                        altered Google, becomes another digital object subject to the conscious
                        manipulation of media she describes in the paper’s argument and analysis.

                        I assumed that it would be valuable to adopt digital methods and tools since
                        the course content was focused on new media. I came to realize more
                        strikingly what I had only intuited to be true before: that such tools are
                        valuable for the kinds of insight they produce, not simply because they
                        exist and so must be worth adopting. Objects like <title level="m"
                            >Voyant</title>’s text analysis software, Wordpress’s blog platform, and
                        even Microsoft Word as a basic—and, some would say, poor—multi-media
                        compositional tool all encouraged students to see their own practices with
                        digital technologies in relation to the intellectual stance we were taking
                        toward computational practices more broadly. Our discussions of digital
                        culture’s ideology of disembodiment and immateriality helped to reorient the
                        way students looked at digital objects, including their own work. The tools
                        we used in producing and reflecting on that reorientation continued the
                        process of rematerializing the digital that we began by close reading. Of
                        course, such tools do not inherently encourage an awareness of
                        materiality—they can just as readily obscure computational processes. Tools
                        do not function transparently, and most of us lack the technological
                        expertise required to conceive fully of their mechanisms. However, using the
                        tools can produce understanding of a different sort. The re-presentation of
                        digital objects in altered forms allows for and encourages imaginative
                        knowledge of the relation between virtual and material. Romantic notions of
                        imagination prove particularly useful to support this stance precisely
                        because such theories of imagination insist on the material forms that
                        communicate the seemingly immaterial nature of imaginative experience. </p>

                    <p>To connect more directly digital ideology with Romantic imagination, let me
                        offer one further example of that ideology’s emphasis on immateriality. “The
                        cloud” has become a ubiquitous term in the past few years, thanks in no
                        small part to Apple’s honorific christening of its cloud-based service with
                        the obligatory prefixed “i.” Essentially, cloud computing refers to the
                        practice of remotely storing data which can be accessed through a network,
                        as opposed to storing data on a local hard disk (like the one in a personal
                        computer). Apple announced their iCloud service at the Apple Worldwide
                        Developers Conference in June 2011.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> A clip
                            from the talk during which Jobs discusses iCloud can be found <ref

                                YouTube</ref>.</note> In the keynote address, Steve Jobs playfully
                        remarked, “Some people think the cloud is just a hard disk in the sky […] We
                        think it’s way more than that, and we call it iCloud.” What distinguished
                        iCloud from other cloud services (such as Dropbox), is that iCloud promised
                        automatically to integrate storage across multiple devices and within
                        various applications without the user having to make such changes actively
                        (in Dropbox, for example, the user stores data through the same logic of
                        files and folders that governs storage on a local disk). iCloud, in the
                        words of Jobs at the keynote, “just works.” The implications for this
                        development meant that computational devices would no longer function
                        primarily as storage receptacles, but rather as access portals to data
                        stored elsewhere and managed largely by someone (or something) else. As Nick
                        Bilton put it on the <title level="m">New York Times’ Bits </title>blog in
                        response to Jobs’s keynote, with iCloud, “Apple is reiterating the
                        irrelevance of the personal computer.” Furthermore, it is forwarding that
                        irrelevance through immaterial rhetoric relating to digital data storage and
                            retrieval.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This kind of rhetoric has
                            only increased as cloud computing has become increasingly prevalent in

                            >As Apple’s iCloud promotional materials explain</ref>, photos, music,
                        or other documents created or edited on one device get stored in the cloud,
                        which then automatically “pushes” the objects to all other devices. The
                        “push” is visually represented by Star Trek-esque blue rays, which connect
                        the moment of inscription on one device, subsequent storage in the cloud,
                        and the journey back to other devices. This is digital data unmediated by
                        the old metaphors of computing, the now naturalized files, folders, and
                        desktops—those pesky reminders that even digital objects are material (at
                        both the “forensic” and “formal” levels, in Kirschenbaum’s schema).<note
                            place="foot" resp="editors"> With “forensic materiality,” Kirschenbaum
                            refers to the material changes wrought at the level of “micron-sized
                            residue of digital inscription,” and at the human-readable level, as
                            with “the contours of the keyboard and mouse that make their bodily
                            marks felt in the ongoing pandemic of repetitive strain and white-collar
                            work injuries” (10-11). “Formal materiality” refers to “the imposition
                            of multiple relational computational states on a data set or digital
                            object” (12). In other words, formal materiality includes not only the
                            digital object, but also data about the object (for instance, data that
                            indicates to a particular piece of software how the object will be
                            presented to the user). Kirschenbaum’s aim is to move away from what
                            Nick Montfort terms “screen essentialism,” and instead to analyze new
                            media through the formal processes that naturalize digital objects at
                            their visible instantiations (31). </note> Yet even as the cloud
                        metaphor dematerializes the physical, political, and economic exigencies
                        that make possible remote storage and retrieval (“it just works”), the sleek

                            seemingly more warm and inviting sky-blue logo. The original images

                        transactions that elide material considerations—like the mining of bauxite
                        needed to produce the aluminum that makes the device possible. </p>
                    <p> The cloud, then, is a medium that erases its presence, even if we think of
                        ontology in terms of “commands, addresses and data,” as Friedrich Kittler
                        argues we should when concerned with technical media. Doing so eliminates,
                        or at least deemphasizes, the material negotiations behind the transactions
                        that occur between processes, transmission and storage. With cloud
                        computing, for instance, storage still occurs on a physical server
                        somewhere, typically in large data centers like the one Apple is <ref

                        Prineville, Oregon, which it built to help accommodate the storage demands
                        of iCloud when it debuted in late 2011. The Oregon storage center neighbors
                        a similar facility owned by Facebook, another company that stores massive
                        amounts of data. Both companies benefit from a recent property tax law
                        passed by the Oregon state legislature (SB 1532), which Senator Mark Haas
                        claims “will allow the state to stay competitive while attracting additional
                        high tech companies to Oregon” (“Oregon Senate OKs Facebook Tax Fix”).
                        Similarly, the Apple data center in Nevada will benefit from 88 million
                        dollars in tax exemptions (Harkinson). The representations of cloud

                            energy gathered on site. As Steven Levy points out, 98% of Apple’s
                            carbon footprint comes from its manufacturing processes, so its
                            self-congratulatory publicity (“We’re still the only company in our

                            exhibiting symptoms of what Timothy Morton calls “beautiful soul
                            syndrome” (140-150), particularly given that, since 2007, I have owned
                            two MacBooks, three iPhones, and one iPad. Following Morton’s argument,
                            I hope to resist said syndrome by recognizing that Apple’s carbon
                            footprint is my carbon footprint, and that in order to act with
                            environmental responsibility, we must dive deeper into the acceptance of
                            our own intimate culpability for the ongoing ecological
                            catastrophe.</note></p>
                    <p>I focus on the “cloud” here since it is an image invoked frequently in the
                        Romantic period, thanks largely to Luke Howard’s 1803 <title level="m">Essay
                            on the Modifications of Clouds</title>, the basis of our modern cloud
                        classification system. Goethe wrote enthusiastically about Howard’s system,
                        claiming that it “bestow[s] form on the formless and a system of ordered
                        change on the boundless” (qtd. in Slater 120). In a poem praising Howard,
                        Goethe writes that “He grips what cannot be held, cannot be reached, / He is
                        the first to hold it fast” (qtd. in Badt 12). Howard, in other words,
                        connects the material and immaterial realms, and through his systemic model
                        encourages further imaginative insight through aesthetic representation. As
                        John R. Williams writes in his biography of Goethe, the poet saw Howard’s
                        work as demonstrative proof that “the disparate, the inchoate, the ephemeral
                        and the apparently unstable can be grasped, intuited, and shaped by the
                        ‘living gifts’ of the creative imagination” (119). Howard’s accomplishment,
                        according to Goethe, was providing a systematic model through which
                        imaginative thinking could operate on and reveal the matter of clouds.
                        Similar to how digital tools helped my students reorient their understanding
                        of what constitutes digital materiality, Howard’s scientific system enabled
                        the further imaginative understanding of natural phenomena. </p>
                    <p>The cloud, which in the Romantic period provides evidence of the
                        imagination’s capacity to act on external matter, gets translated back into
                        a figure of immaterial communication in the rhetoric of digital technology.
                        This turn is unsurprising given the long history of equating Romanticism
                        more largely, and Romantic imagination in particular, with escape from
                        social and material history. Recent scholars on imagination, however, have
                        focused on the way that it operates in relation to materiality. Alexander
                        Schlutz, for example, ascribes imagination’s problematic status in the
                        history of philosophy to its “peculiarly liminal position,” poised between
                        “mind and body, self and world, the ideal and the real” (5). Imagination
                        challenges Enlightenment accounts of subjectivity precisely because of its
                        connection to the senses and the body, and its mediation of the external
                        world to internal understanding. In short, imagination exposes the illusion
                        of “the mind’s freedom and autonomy from the vicissitudes of its physical
                        embodiment” (4). Richard Sha similarly rematerializes imagination by
                        situating it in the context of Romantic-era medical discourse. Sha notes
                        that in Romanticist scholarship, imagination has been long maligned as a
                        tool of ideology, the escapist faculty “on the side of the immateriality of
                        consciousness” (198-9). His argument, however, suggests that imagination
                        held such appeal to the Romantics because it was understood physiologically.
                        Even though medical discourse warned of the imagination’s ability to disease
                        the mind and body, that recognition paradoxically “made unassailable the
                        imagination’s ability to transform matter” (199).</p>
                    <p>What the course’s attention to imagination in new media discourse revealed
                        was that another way to rematerialize the imagination is to conceive of it
                        as a medium.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Seb Franklin similarly
                            approaches the cloud as medium, as a figure that “oscillate[s] between
                            the realms of transcendent ethereality and complex materiality,” in his
                            reading of “the political character of cloud computing” (452). He argues
                            that the ideology of cloud computing offers the ideal of “connectivity
                            with no nodes (or individual subjects), only a shapeless bundle of edges
                            throughout which communication can occur and thus be captured, parsed,
                            measured, and defined. The ubiquitous, immaterial connectivity and
                            processing emblematized by cloud computing promises mediation, but of
                            what? It promises nothing less than to mediate the entirety of the
                            social through the indifferent logic of computation” (461). Srinivasan’s
                            article in <title level="m">Wired</title>, mentioned above, represents a
                            good example of a celebratory version of that imagined future; in his
                            formulation, the cloud becomes an immaterial space for utopian social
                            and political reorganization.</note> Shelley’s poem “The Cloud,” for
                        example, uses it as an image, like Apple’s, of storage and transmission.
                        Similar to his “balloon laden with knowledge,” and to the west wind carrying
                        “dead thoughts over the universe” (“Ode to the West Wind,” 63), Shelley’s
                        cloud is a channel through which information may travel.<note place="foot"

                        showers for the thirsting flowers;” she “bears light shade for the leaves
                        when laid / In their noon-day dreams” (“The Cloud,” 1, 3-4). Like the
                        iCloud, she has a tenuous materiality, and can “pass through the pores, of
                        the oceans and shores” (75). At the same time, she is “daughter of Earth and
                        Water, / And nursling of the Sky,” and so unites heaven and earth, mind and
                        body (73-4). Like imagination, she mediates between matter and spirit,
                        functioning as a channel through which historical actors can “hold an
                        unremitting interchange / With the clear universe of things around” (“Mont
                        Blanc,” 39-40). In “A Defence of Poetry,” the job of imagination is to
                        manage the “materials of external life” (531), which have been multiplying
                        through developments in science and technology, like the classification of
                        clouds, to the extent that “our calculations have outrun conception; we have
                        eaten more than we can digest” (530). Instead of enabling escape from
                        matter, imagination puts the body and spirit into proper relation to one
                        another. Without the poetic, imaginative power, the “body […] become[s] too
                        unwieldy for that which animates it” (531). For Shelley, language is an
                        originary product of imagination, but the “materials, instruments and
                        conditions of art” give us only secondary access, such that unmediated
                        language is a “mirror which reflects” while expression through physical
                        forms is “as a cloud which enfeebles.” Both unmediated conception and
                        mediated expression, however, whether mirror or cloud, cast rays of light
                        which are “the mediums of communication” (513). Shelley attempts to idealize
                        language, poetry, and imagination apart from matter but keeps returning to
                        the necessity for “portals of expression from the caverns of the spirit”
                        (532). In other words, imagination functions only by manipulating the
                        materials of existence, the dead leaves of thought, the enfeebling clouds
                        that render our calculations conceivable, and of course the texts that come
                        down to us. Even if they fail to some extent, the mediated forms of
                        imagination provide the best and only way to communicate the experience of
                        unmediated imaginative experience. Imagination is such a treasured mode of
                        thought precisely because of its ability to link the realms of mind and
                        matter, spirit and body, innocence and experience, and furthermore to
                        communicate those relations through materialized forms of expression.
                        Perhaps this view of the cloud, and of electronic media more broadly, as a
                        material negotiation between processes, transmission and data storage helps
                        “thicken the medium” (McGann <title level="m">Textual Condition</title> 14)
                        even as it represents itself as the absence of mediation.</p>
                    <p>John Keats’s thoughts on imagination posit it as a similarly mediating force,
                        bridging the mind and body. A key word in his thinking is “ethereal,” which
                        seemingly refers to immateriality but nonetheless often registers in the
                        material realm.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Stuart Sperry, for
                            instance, has noted the contemporary usage of ethereal in chemistry as
                            an important reference point for Keats: “The notion of an ethereal
                            matter forever at work in the world’s atmosphere and bringing about
                            continual changes in its elements offered Keats a useful and suggestive
                            parallel to the operation of the spirit of poetry” (40). Through various
                            chemical metaphors, Sperry claims, “Keats is able to conceive of verse
                            in terms that are substantial and material and, more abstractly, as a
                            kind of supernatural energy” (51).</note> Take, for instance, his
                        statement of poetic purpose at the beginning of his tour of northern England
                        and Scotland in the summer of 1818: “I shall learn poetry here and shall
                        henceforth write more than ever, for the abstract endeavour of being able to
                        add a mite to that mass of beauty which is harvested from these grand
                        materials, by the finest spirits, and put into etherial existence for the
                        relish of one’s fellows” (I, 301).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> As
                            readers of his letters well know, Keats’s orthography is delightfully
                            idiosyncratic. All of the quotations are reproduced as they appear in
                            Rollins’s transcriptions. If misspellings are present, <emph>sic</emph>
                            should be assumed.</note> The work of poetry involves material processes
                        like harvesting and increasing beauty’s “mass,” while also transforming that
                        material into new forms that hover between mind and matter—the “etherial”
                        things are “relished” in the mind and body. In a playful letter to Benjamin
                        Bailey from a few months earlier, Keats divides “Ethereal things” into three
                        divisions: “Things real—things semireal—and no things” (I, 242-3). Those of
                        the second category, “Love, the Clouds &amp;c […] require a greeting of the
                        Spirit to make them wholly exist.” The sonnet he produces as an elaboration
                        on his ideas represents “the mind of Man” following the progression of
                        seasons, beginning in “lusty spring when fancy clear / Takes in all beauty
                        with an easy span.” Like Coleridge’s distinction between secondary
                        imagination and fancy, Keats puts the next stage of thinking into the
                        creative realm: in summer the mind “chews the honied cud of fair spring
                        thoughts, / Till, in his Soul dissolv’d they come to be / Part of himself”
                        (I, 243). The more active role of imagination is to transform the materials
                        of the external world into a part of the self, understood through the
                        material processes of ingestion and digestion. As Coleridge elaborates his
                        system, quoting from the Elizabethan poet, John Davies, “As we our food into
                        our nature change,” so too does the imagination act upon physical materials
                        (496).</p>
                    <p>The imagination, in these reflections, does not transport identity outside
                        the body but rather reinstantiates it in a newly altered but still embodied
                        presence. Keats’s anecdote about embodying a sparrow is instructive here:
                        “if a Sparrow come before my Window I take part in its existince and pick
                        about the Gravel.” He means this as an illustration of his constant focus on
                        the present—“nothing startles me beyond the Moment”—but it comes in a letter
                        reflecting on imagination (I, 186). In this letter he makes his well-known
                        comparison of imagination to “Adam’s dream—he awoke and found it truth” (I,
                        185). Keats also suggests that imagination is the basis for what an
                        afterlife might resemble, or “the redigestion of our most ethereal Musings
                        on Earth” (I, 186). The ability to occupy another body, like the sparrow’s,
                        is a product of imagination as a meeting of spirit and body. The poet
                        fulfills this “negative capability,” of “being in uncertainties” (I, 193) of
                        “continually […] filling some other Body” (I, 387). In this sense we can
                        conceive of Keats’s embodied identity as virtual, as produced through an
                        imaginative relation between experience, thought and sensation. Such
                        virtuality does not erase materiality, but rather revises one’s felt
                        experience of embodiment.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Jonathan
                            Mulrooney makes these seemingly contradictory claims: “In Keats all
                            subjects are virtual. In Keats all subjects are bodily” (313). His point
                            is that virtual identity comes to be through an embodied experience
                            attuned to “a cognition of what passes in the affective mode of
                            perception” (314). From this perspective, he suggests that for Keats
                            “‘Mind’[…] is not a shelter from the frailties of embodied life; rather,
                            mind could be said to be for Keats always the idea of the body—the
                            body’s changing idea of itself” (315). In his recent book, <title
                                level="m">Multiplying Worlds</title>, Peter Otto proposes a
                            different version of Romantic subjectivity in relation to theories of
                            the virtual. He argues that Romantic visual culture “suggested that
                            reality itself was an indeterminate combination of the actual and
                            virtual,” thereby creating a space in which the viewer could construct a
                            self in relation to those interlacing actual and virtual realms (15).
                            Otto, like Mulrooney, maintains the significance of embodied experience
                            in this process, though he emphasizes the social, commercial element of
                            the experience, given that the blending of actual and virtual occurs in
                            the public spaces of the panorama, phantasmagoria and other popular
                            entertainments. </note></p>
                    <p>The imagination, then, as formulated by Shelley and Keats, offers a renewed
                        conception of what it means to inhabit a body in a materially-bound
                        existence. This insight, I realized from my experience teaching about
                        digital culture, could apply as well to how we study new media and to how we
                        ask our students to understand digital tools through classroom practice and
                        critical orientation. Both the concepts and the practices renew our sense of
                        materially embodied experience in the world, which is what digital tools
                        should do for our students—help them come to know the ways in which they
                        live as historical bodies in and of the world. To do so we brought
                        imagination—rendered immaterial in new media discourse—back to matter.</p>

                    <p>When we rematerialize imagination through media, we necessarily reimagine
                        texts. In one of his long journal letters to his brother George and
                        sister-in-law Georgiana, Keats writes: <quote>our friends say I have altered
                            completely—am not the same person—perhaps in this letter I am for in a
                            letter one takes up one’s existence from the time we last met—I dare say
                            you have altered also—evey man does—Our bodies every seven years are
                            completely fresh-materiald […] We are like the relict garments of a
                            Saint: the same and not the same: for the careful Monks patch it and
                            patch it: till there’s not a thread of the original garment left. (II,
                            208)</quote> The letter becomes a textual body that Keats fills with his
                        imaginatively produced, virtual identity. And like the physical body
                        continually “fresh-materiald,” or like the holy patchwork garment, the
                        reimagined textual self undergoes transformation through the negotiation of
                        imagination and matter. This recognition disturbs as well as excites. Keats
                        reflects that “’T is an uneasy thought that in seven years the same hands
                        cannot greet each other again” (II, 209), a thought which can potentially
                        threaten the stability of identity. Imagination, however, enables texts (or
                        bodies) to communicate effectively: “All this may be obviated by a willful
                        and dramatic exercise of our Minds towards each other” (II, 209). The
                        imaginative “exercise” of mind relocates embodied identity in the shifting
                        matter of existence: alternatively, in Keats’s formulation, bodies and texts
                        across time and space. </p>
                    <p>In focusing on the imaginary processes Keats links with forms of mediation, I
                        share Yohei Igarashi’s recent contention that “communicative mediation
                        constitutes a significant, although still largely unremarked, concern of
                        Keats’s poetry and letters” (173). And like Igarashi and several other
                        Romanticists writing in the last decade or so, I also conceive of the
                        Romantic era more broadly as crucially shaped and defined by its privileged
                        place in “the history of mediation.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In
                            the introduction to <title level="m">This is Enlightenment</title>,
                            Siskin and Warner offer the “history of mediation” as an alternative
                            approach to the “history of ideas.” Instead of seeking to recover the
                            “ideas” that comprise what Enlightenment is, they propose reassembling
                            the medial transactions employed to convey those ideas, “and thus more
                            readily identify patterns in those interactions” (11). In shifting their
                            focus to Romanticism, Siskin and Warner argue that, understood in
                            relation to their history of mediation, “the Romantic subject is the
                            self on the platform of Enlightenment” (“What Is Romanticism?” 288). In
                            short, “Enlightenment is an event in the history of mediation,” which
                            involves radical transformations in “cardinal mediations,” including
                            infrastructure (postal system, coffee houses), genres and formats
                            (periodical essays, magazines), practices (clubs, societies), and
                            protocols (copyright, publishing practices) (“This Is Enlightenment” 1,
                            12-15). The Romantic subject, then, comes into being by operating on the
                            platform that these mediations establish.</note> Jerome McGann and Alan
                        Liu have, in different ways, argued for the capacity of new media to help us
                        “imagine what we know” about old media, as McGann puts it, borrowing from
                            Shelley.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> McGann argues as much in
                                <title level="m">Radiant Textuality</title>. Drawing on Lisa
                            Gitelman’s argument that “new media are less points of epistemic rupture
                            than they are socially embedded sites for the ongoing negotiation of
                            meaning as such” (6), Alan Liu suggests more of a bi-directional flow
                            between old and new. He calls for “a <foreign>poiesis</foreign> of
                            digital literary studies able to imagine how old and new literary media
                            together allow us to imagine.” My shift is merely to emphasize that the
                                <foreign>poiesis</foreign> on display in Romantic-era texts can
                            accomplish similar productive insights about relations between old and
                            new media. </note> But we’ve also seen an increasing number of scholars
                        attempt to recover “the conceptual breadth of early discussions of media,”
                        as James Brooke-Smith describes some of the insights articulated by Kevis
                        Goodman in <title level="m">Georgic Modernity and British
                            Romanticism.</title><note place="foot" resp="editors"> Brooke-Smith adds
                            to our understanding of early discussions of media by claiming we can
                            find in the work of William Wordsworth and Charles Babbage a “media-less
                            media theory” (4), or “media theory in the absence of a
                                <emph>technological</emph> media concept,” an intellectual position
                            which would not fully emerge until toward the end of the century
                            (2).</note> Celeste Langan and Maureen McLane locate in Romantic poetry
                        such a sophisticated sensitivity to issues of mediation that they posit,
                        “Romantic poetry might even serve as a synonym for what we mean by
                        multimedia” (239). My experience of teaching new media suggested to me a
                        similar reversal of the usual linear narratives of media history. As
                        Siegfried Zielinski poses the issue in calling for a media archaeological
                        method: “do not seek the old in the new, but find something new in the old”
                        (3). To do so requires an openness to being in uncertainty about Romanticism
                        and the history of mediation. My ultimate contention, then, is that the
                        materiality of the Romantic imagination is that of a medium. Mediums imagine
                        for us, and we imagine through them. Imagination communicates between mind
                        and body, matter and spirit, and by doing so makes possible the affects of
                        aesthetic experience that come through material forms like texts. Writing
                        about Keats’s “La Belle Dame,” McGann claims that “Romantic imagination
                        emerges with the birth of an historical sense, which places the poet, and
                        then the reader, at a critical distance from the poem’s materials” (<title
                            level="m">Romantic Ideology</title> 79). By “materials” McGann means the
                        ballad and romance traditions, mythological figures, and the particular
                        perspective through which Keats revives them. I would add that the
                        imagination emerges with a self-consciousness about the poem’s physical
                        materials, its production, and the distance between conception, expression
                        and reception. In imagining what a medium can do, Romantic writers mine the
                        ontology of media, always aware in the end of the ineluctable limitations of
                        communication. As Alexander Galloway, Eugene Thacker, and McKenzie Wark
                        argue in their collaborative volume: “Every communication evokes a possible
                        excommunication that would instantly annul it. Every communication harbors
                        the dim awareness of an excommunication that is prior to it, that conditions
                        it and makes it all the more natural” (10). For the Romantic writers,
                        mediums function when they fail, as with Keats’s claim that in our embodied
                        and textual forms, “We are like the relict garments of a Saint: the same and
                        not the same” or Shelley's recognition that we necessarily rely on imperfect
                        “portals of expression from the caverns of the spirit.” In an era of
                        perpetual triumphalism for each new and improved shiny happy media machine,
                        perhaps we need now to look to broken forms, dysfunctional devices, and the
                        faultures of other decrepit things. </p>
                    <p> I’d like to conclude by sharing a final example of student work from the
                        course, since this student demonstrated the kind of knowing, critical
                        playfulness toward the history of mediation that can help to rematerialize
                        our relation to the digital, and especially since he embraced the breaking
                        points of media. I’ll call this student “Neo” since he was writing about
                            <title level="m">The Matrix</title> (1999) and showed some programming
                        skill. As described above, the assignment asked students to write a
                        comparison paper about two texts from different media, and to use multiple
                        media forms in their papers. To meet the latter criteria, many students
                        creatively employed video and image in their papers (as with the screenshots
                        of <title level="m">Google Variations</title> mentioned earlier). For his
                        multimedia component, Neo wrote a computer program. He gave me instructions
                        on how to compile the Java program on my computer, and when I eventually
                        managed it, it produced the following. (Figure 2). <figure n="2">

                        </figure> The program asks you to enter your name, and once you do, it
                        produces this narrative, inspired by and loosely adapted from <title

                        the form of a red pill. Prompted again to type “red” of “blue,” the input
                        “red” outputs the rudimentary image of a book, with Neo’s essay title on it.
                        The final line of the narrative reads: “The figure hands you an old dusty
                        book with a beaten spine. ‘Read,’ he says. ‘Read and be free.’” The program
                        that has produced the narrative, also produces the content of the essay, the
                        “book” that will lead to freedom. After the introductory narrative, the
                        program outputs the entire essay text. (Figure 3). <figure n="3">

                        </figure> With this creative representation, Neo recognized his remediated
                        paper as part of a history of mediation. The green text on black screen
                        recalls an earlier era in computing, inspired by <title level="m">The
                            Matrix</title>’s popularization of the green on black image, while the
                        textual interface gestures toward text adventure games, or interactive
                        fiction. The presence of his paper in the metafiction as “an old dusty
                        book,” both suggests that old media continue to hold value (precisely
                        because of their anachronism), and belies the separation of old and new
                        (since the old book is being delivered simultaneously as Word document and
                        script in a Java program). But even more significantly, as Neo wrote in his
                        instructions to me, “the original manifestation of the piece [the essay as a
                        word document with all its formatting details] is limited by the ASCII
                        interpretation by the specific computer.” As a result, before the essay text
                        is a long string of unreadable characters (for instance,
                        “{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf1038\cocoasubrtf350…”). These characters
                        fail to signify to (most) human eyes, but also to the Terminal program,
                        which cannot render the formatting instructions from Word into sensible
                        form, and instead leaves them as inert code. Neo’s insight reminds us that
                        all electronic media are not one, that we continue to experience new media
                        through engagements with the old, and that the material specificities of
                        such engagements can be rendered visible through informed representation.
                        The mediated, mediating Romantic imagination, which appears so frequently
                        disembodied in the evolution of digital discourse, can help us see the
                        materials that make up that history. </p>
