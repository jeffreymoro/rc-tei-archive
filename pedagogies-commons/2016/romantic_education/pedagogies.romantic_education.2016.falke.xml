            Byron´s engagement with Romantic discourses of education in his closet drama <title level="m">Cain</title> has been overshadowed by critical discussions of the work´s theology. This essay repositions <title level="m">Cain</title> within period debates about the goals and possibilities of pursuing knowledge. Falke suggests that although <title level="m">Cain</title> appears to endorse the epistemology implied in many discussions of elite education, it ultimately undermines the dichotomies of knowledge vs. action and mind vs. body upon which these discussions relied.

                <head>Byron’s <title level="m">Cain </title>and Romantic Education</head>

                </byline>
                <p>In the words of Byron’s contemporaries, his character Cain is a “hideous
                    blasphemy,” an “off-scouring of […] Voltaire” and a “heinous offense to society”
                    “embalm[ed] in verse” (“Three Orthodox” 219-220). But, he is also what we might
                    call a pioneer of knowledge. Cain is a solitary hero of Romantic learning—a type
                    variously imagined by Shelley in <title level="m">Alastor</title> and <title
                        level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, by Wordsworth in <title level="m">The
                        Excursion</title>, and by Byron again in <title level="m">Manfred</title>.
                    As a learner, he is individualistic, adventuresome, and like many pioneers,
                    wayward. In Byron’s version of the myth from Genesis, Lucifer claims to possess
                    the supernatural knowledge that Cain craves, and Cain follows the trouble-making
                    angel on a tour of the universe. He encounters pre-Adamantine beings. He sees
                    worlds “full of life” and thick with potential Edens (II: ii, 168, 183).
                    Nevertheless, Cain wants to know more. In his desire to know more, he
                    exasperates even the devil, who finally chides, “Dust! Limit thy ambition” (II:
                    ii 406). </p>
                <p>Much has been written about <title level="m">Cain’</title>s (1821) disputation of
                    theological orthodoxy. Criticism by Byron’s contemporaries centered attention on
                    the play’s theological concerns, and critics remain interested in the theology
                    of the play. In her biography of Byron, Fiona MacCarthy summarizes the play’s
                    reception as “the greatest outcry yet against the poet and his work, with
                    accusations of willful, dangerous iconoclasm that reverberated for the remainder
                    of the nineteenth century” (414). Byron’s publisher, John Murray, dismissed the
                    fuss as “a humbug row” (qtd. in MacCarthy 414), but the poet’s supposed
                    iconoclasm set the terms of the play’s immediate critical reception to such a
                    degree that even critics who found it theologically limp felt it necessary to
                    say so in public. For example, Francis Jeffrey concludes his consideration of
                    Cain’s theodicy with the inconclusive remark that Byron had “neither thrown any
                    new light upon [the origin of evil], nor darkened the previous knowledge which
                    we possessed” (235). The questions surrounding the play’s implicit theology have
                    continued to give rise to interesting scholarship, positioning it in relation to
                    Byron’s own shifting religious concerns and in relation to the broader questions
                    about the representation of theological matter in art. Alan Rawes finds in
                        <title level="m">Cain</title> evidence of “Byron’s Romantic Calvinism,”
                    arguing that in the play, “yet another individual quest after freedom […]
                    activates and enacts a predestined damnation” (137). Trevor Hart engages the
                    text anew as a means for performing theological meditation through art. Wolf
                    Hirst contests the nineteenth-century impression of the play by arguing that
                    because of its irony and structure, the play is “closer to a conventional
                    justification of God’s ways to men than to the iconoclastic attacks voiced by
                    its protagonists” (152). </p>
                <p>In the flurry of concern over the play’s theological implications, its engagement
                    with the discourse on education, another dominant and highly contentious topic
                    of the day, has been overlooked. But the play returns repeatedly to the theme of
                    the pursuit of knowledge, a pursuit that <title level="m">Cain</title> argues
                    should be boundless. Speaking of the tree of knowledge, Cain says “It was the
                    tree of life: Knowledge is good, / And truth is good; and how can both be evil?”
                    (I: i, 36-38). For him the desire to learn is innate, a physical need bound
                    inextricably with life itself. He tells Lucifer, “Thou canst not / Speak aught
                    of knowledge which I would not know. / And do not thirst to know” (I: i,
                    247-249).</p>

                <div type="section">
                    <head>Placing <title level="m">Cain</title> in Romantic Period Discourses of
                        Learning</head>
                    <p>Byron’s <title level="m">Cain</title> does not fit tidily into any of the
                        period’s discourses about learning because it appears to fit into so many of
                        them. The character dramatizes many of the assumptions inherent in
                        upper-class education during the Romantic period. First, the knowledge that
                        Cain most desires is, like that pursued at the universities and the most
                        traditional public academies, metaphysical in nature. He wants to “learn to
                        anticipate [his] immortality” (I; i, 137) through the study of topics that
                        transcend mere usefulness. Lucifer characterizes the knowledge he offers
                        Cain as being metaphysical in contrast to other angels’ empirical knowledge.
                        God’s angels, he says, know “nought beyond their shallow senses” in spite of
                        their immortality (II, i, 9). Secondly, the knowledge Cain hungers for is
                        only desired by and only appropriate for select individuals, “Souls who dare
                        use their immortality” in Lucifer’s words. Implicitly, the acquisition of
                        knowledge does not confer privilege on Cain; his desire to learn
                        demonstrates an innate superiority over the rest of his family. Finally, as
                        a learner, Cain repudiates his body and the toil it can perform, deeming
                        them inconsequential when compared to the power of his mind. He “feel[s] the
                        weight […] Of daily toil and constant thought” (I; I, 174-75). Toil and
                        thought, for him, are incompatible. He complains that his physical self
                        seems “nothing” in comparison with what he sees, but that the “thoughts that
                        arise” in him seem as if they “could master all things”(I: i, 167-68). The
                        dichotomies here—between empirical and metaphysical knowledge, between the
                        privileged learner and the ignorant mass from which he has escaped, between
                        mental and physical exertion—echo the conceptions of education being
                        deployed in debates about England’s elite public schools and the increasing
                        numbers of dissenting academies and mechanics’ institutes.</p>
                    <p>Assumptions about upper-class learners were being solidified through
                        discourses about the publically endowed grammar schools and universities
                        (Richardson 46-47, Aries 313) as well as through heroic learners in
                        literature. In 1820, Henry Brougham, a Whig MP remembered for liberal
                        reforms related to the slave trade and education, proposed a bill that would
                        allow trustees “to use grammar school trusts for the instruction of the poor
                        in reading, writing, and arithmetic” (Sanderson 28). Headmasters and dons
                        recoiled from the idea and defended the exclusivity of their student body by
                        maintaining the exclusivity of the subjects they taught. This conflation
                        between subjects studied and learners seems almost seamless. Students elite
                        enough to study at Shrewsbury and Tonbridge manifested their elitism by
                        mastering classical languages and literature. Endowed school students were
                        to become refined metaphysicians, proudly carrying forward the traditions of
                        Renaissance humanism. This curriculum was clearly unfit, they thought, for
                        the lower classes. As the governors of Harrow were already arguing by 1810,
                        “the school is a school for classical leaning; […] however wise the
                        intentions of the founder might have been, the school is not now adapted
                        generally for persons of low condition, but better suited to those of a
                        higher class” (“Harrow” 81). Moreover, through this schooling, endowed
                        school students were supposedly rendered incapable of living working-class lives. As
                        Leigh Hunt phrases it, “scholarship […] unfits a man for activity” (37). </p>
                    <p>But, even as this defense of leisure-class traditions was going on, literacy
                        and schooling were becoming more widely available to the rest of the English
                        population. The spread of education in the early nineteenth century has
                        become a familiar story, but recalling it enforces how pervasive the pursuit
                        of knowledge must have seemed. The Sunday School Movement had begun in
                        earnest in the 1780s. By 1819, two years before<title level="m">
                            Cain</title> was published, Parliamentary reports record over 5,000
                        schools in operation. Andrew Bell’s and Joseph Lancaster’s monitorial
                        systems of education had led to the creation of another 1,520 schools
                        between 1800 and 1819. Adding these schools to the over 4,000 endowed
                        schools and the almost 14,000 other “unendowed” schools, we end up with a
                        country awash in pedantry. In 1819, England had no desire for the
                        million-plus pupils enrolled in these schools to become heroic learners.</p>
                    <p>They were not pursuing metaphysical truth, they were not exploring their
                        individual uniqueness, and they were not encouraged to think their learning
                        would not go with physical work. Whereas Cain hopes his intellectual
                        activity will free him from labor, the children reached by unendowed schools
                        of the period were taught that their education prepared them for labor.
                        Reading the Parliamentary Papers that precede the passage of the 1870
                        Education Act, we find Sir Charles Adderly reflecting as follows on the
                        education offered the poor earlier in the century: “Education was not so
                        much the imparting of knowledge as the training that would fit a child for
                        the work to which his station would probably call him” (National Education
                        Union 114). Speaking before the House of Commons in 1819, the Earl of
                        Harrowby similarly advocates educating the poor to make them “useful members
                        of society” (Great Britain Parliament 1515).</p>
                    <p>In contrast to Byron’s characterization of an individualistic heroic learner,
                        the manuals that provide guidance for teaching the lower classes
                        characterize learners as socio-political contributors who could either
                        enhance public stability by creating wealth or damage public stability
                        through criminality and rioting. As educational historian Michael Sanderson
                        writes, by the 1830s education was seen as “an agent of social control”
                        (12). Discussions of educating “the poor” (usually not George or Henry)
                        prioritized “useful science” over metaphysics (Wilderspin ix). The founding
                        of the aptly named Society for Useful Knowledge in 1826 suggests the
                        educational impetus behind most middle class reform. For children from
                        working-class families, instruction began with basic literacy, writing, and
                        math although some Sunday School advocates, such as Hannah More, famously
                        excluded writing from the curriculum. More common than lists of subject
                        areas were lists of virtues that poor children were supposed to attain
                        through the discipline of schools. Designed to promote “industry, sobriety,
                        honesty, benevolence, and mutual kindness” (vi), schools did not encourage
                        long trips with the devil. Samuel Wilderspin, whose manual I have just
                        quoted, was not a conservative voice in the debates surrounding education
                        when his 1823 <title level="m">Remarks on the Importance of Educating the
                            Poor</title> was published. The inventor of the playground, he was more
                        permissive than most. His sense that working-class learners needed moral
                        containment more than intellectual adventure was typical.</p>
                    <p>Byron’s <title level="m">Cain </title>collides with these ideas. It violently
                        flouts the possibility that learning leads to moral discipline, useful work,
                        or the other oft-cited goal of Romantic-period education, happiness. In her
                        description of “Educational Prose” for the recent <title level="m"
                            >Encyclopedia of Romantic Literature</title> (2012), Catherine Ross
                        notes that for all of their disagreements, the writers of educational prose
                        during the romantic period espoused or implied “the belief that the proper
                        ends of education are ‘happiness’ and ‘usefulness,’” that “both of these
                        conditions, while variously defined, are dependent upon virtue,” and finally
                        that “virtue can be taught” (390). An example of this alignment among
                        knowledge, happiness, and virtue may be seen in William Godwin’s claim that
                        “the true object of education, like that of every other moral process, is
                        the generation of happiness” (qtd. in Silver 72). Byron addresses each of
                        these possible goals for learning, but denies them all. Cain tells Lucifer
                        that he seeks knowledge as “The road to happiness” (II: ii 229-230). Lucifer
                        initially upholds the pairing of knowledge and happiness as a logical
                        proposition, saying “If truth be so [happiness], / Then though hast it” (II:
                        ii, 231-232), but Cain has declared himself unhappy just a few lines before
                        (II; ii, 217-218), and Lucifer foretells a “doubled wretchedness” to come
                        (II; ii, 222). The liberal, humanist discourse of education so dominant
                        among the romantic period’s educational reformers may have yoked knowledge
                        and happiness together, but here they are unhinged. Good and evil are
                        disengaged from knowledge in this same scene: “[I]gnorance from evil doth
                        not save / From evil” (II: ii, 236-7). </p>
                    <p>These contrasts between Byron’s presentation of knowledge and what we see in
                        Romantic period pedagogy for the working classes are significant because the
                        separate assumptions about what kind of education is good for different
                        classes have persisted. We see it in the disjunctions between the teleology
                        of liberal arts classes and that of vocational classes. There is a long and
                        intricate genealogy that I cannot untwine in the length of this essay. On
                        Byron’s side of the family we find Matthew Arnold with his mellifluous
                        learners gleaning sweetness and light from the best that has been thought
                        and written. Arnold asserts that it is part of our innate desire to perfect
                        ourselves through the pursuit of knowledge. We find also John Henry Newman, whose
                        1865 <title level="m">Idea of a University</title> articulates so eloquently
                        why we should pursue knowledge with the same unconscious consistency with
                        which we pursue our physical health. There is a comparable genealogy through
                        our other line of educational heritage. On the opposite side of the family,
                        we find W. E. Forster, for whom England’s 1870 Education Act was named,
                        telling The House of Commons that “the speedy provision of elementary
                        education” is essential for “our industrial prosperity […] [I]f we leave our
                        work-folk any longer unskilled […] they will become overmatched in the
                        competition of the world” (18). For Forster, education must be practical
                        because it must serve the projected growth of a national economy. England’s
                        future “work-folk” get to learn to read between the ages of five and twelve,
                        but what they need to do after twelve is make money. Contemporary
                        educational policy makers in the United States seem to be descended from
                        this side of the family. When United States Secretary of Education Arne
                        Duncan offered his 2014 report to the House Appropriations Committee, he
                        extended the discourse of Forster, and Brougham, and the Sunday Schools,
                        figuring education not in heroic but in economic terms. “Falling behind
                        educationally now,” he warned, “will hurt our country economically for
                        generations.” </p>

                    <head>Byron and Working-Class Readers</head>
                    <p>Although the play appears to suggest that the pursuit of knowledge is
                        incompatible with a life of labor,<title level="m"> Cain</title>, like other
                        works by Byron, was circulated enthusiastically among networks of
                        working-class readers where it would have been interpreted with great
                        freedom, just as Shakespeare and scripture were (Rose 15-16). After Murray
                        famously failed to secure the text against piracy, it was absorbed into
                        radical political and theological discourses. Byron’s name was linked to Tom
                        Paine and Richard Carlile. Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that the
                        contemporary critic who talks most about knowledge in relation to Byron’s
                            <title level="m">Cain</title> discusses his anxiety about the
                        dissemination of the play<emph> as</emph> knowledge, rather than the play’s
                        treatment of knowledge as a concept. In his 1822 essay for the <title
                            level="j">Quarterly Review</title>, Reginald Heber worries that “by
                        circumstances which Lord Byron himself could not foresee, - those
                        speculations which he designed for the educated ranks alone, are thrown open
                        to the gaze of the persons most likely to be influenced by them, and
                        disseminated, with remorseless activity, among the young, the ignorant, and
                        the poor” (238). Writing for the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title>,
                        Jeffrey frets that <title level="m">Cain</title> will trouble “hundreds of
                        minds that might never otherwise have been exposed to such dangerous
                        disturbance” (233). Jeffrey appears to assume, with Heber, that “the poor”
                        who are likely to purchase the illicitly published <title level="m"
                            >Cain</title> will also be “the ignorant,” that they will never have
                        thought about the origins of evil without the help of a noble author.
                        Similarly, the anonymous reviewer for the <title level="m">Eclectic</title>
                        posits that the “difficulties” of the first family’s story will be “new to a
                        large proportion of [Byron’s] readers” and that “the young and inexperienced
                        are ill able to grapple” with these questions (219). This reviewer
                        distinguishes between working-class readers, whom he assumes will passively
                        accept Lucifer’s and Cain’s logic, and leisure-class readers capable of
                        weighing these characters’ ideas against reasoning they have already
                        performed. </p>
                    <p>Jeffrey’s review came out in the <title level="j">Edinburgh</title> in April;
                        the <title level="j">Eclectic</title> ran theirs in May. In June, Leigh Hunt
                        published a letter about <title level="m">Cain</title> “To the Readers of
                        the <emph>Examiner,</emph>” and although he does not say much about the
                        play’s presentation of knowledge, he does make an implicit claim about the
                        equality of intellectual potential among readers of all classes by crediting
                        the play’s imagined reader with an equal capacity to contemplate the
                        questions Byron raises. He acknowledges that the play privileges Lucifer’s
                        and Cain’s critiques of divine wisdom, but says that this lopsidedness is
                        Byron’s “hint” for readers to “work out the conclusion for themselves”
                        (225). He later credits readers with the ability “to draw the united
                        conclusions of his heart and understanding.” Hunt makes no distinction
                        between “inexperienced” readers who may have purchased the 6d. version and
                        readers of the <title level="j">Edinburgh</title> and <title level="j"
                            >Quarterly </title>who more likely purchased the 15 s. 5 d. first
                        edition (St. Clair 588). </p>
                    <p>In his discussion of <title level="m">Byron and the Victorians</title>
                        (2004), Andrew Elfenbein points out that “working-class literacy introduced
                        a [...] possibility for reading Byron” that was “more subversive” than the
                        appropriation of his work into debates about the beneficence of God or the
                        propriety of certain sexual behaviors because it was more difficult to
                        contain (85, 87). It swelled and surged outside of the purview of the
                        cultural elite. One enthusiastic Byronist suggests the breadth of Byron’s
                        influence in an 1825 letter to Carlile’s <title level="j">The
                            Republican</title> where he writes that that Byron had “influenced
                        millions in the cause of liberty” (162). This was precisely the influence
                        that orthodox critics of <title level="m">Cain</title> feared. Lucifer’s
                        arguments associate him with “the spirit of free thought and stern
                        endurance, unbrokenly contending against the bondage which makes nature
                        miserable” (Heber 243). Although Byron’s popularity among working-class
                        readers, in general, is well-documented, since we have no records of the
                        sales of pirated copies of <title level="m">Cain</title> and no
                        working-class recollections of reading <title level="m">Cain</title> in
                        particular, it is impossible to judge what role the play may have had in
                        this popularity.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For discussion of Byron’s

                        which Byron advocates for a pursuit of knowledge freed from communally
                        imposed boundaries would have resonated with working-class autodidacts’
                        energy and longing for freedom. </p>

                        nineteenth century, David Vincent discusses the astounding commitment some
                        men and women had to learning. A few examples will suggest the extent of the sacrifice
                        of time and resources these individuals made in order to pursue knowledge.
                        Yorkshire weaver William Heaton recalls that on the Sabbath, he would
                        “wander forth” at around four in the morning with a group of like-minded
                        naturalists in order to collect and study bird’s eggs or fossils. They would
                        return at sundown “often having never tasted food all the day.”
                        Nevertheless, they found resources to create a shared library (qtd. in
                        Vincent 173). Some of his fellow weavers managed to “place books before them
                        [on the loom] to read whilst at work,” but he confined himself to
                        “ruminat[ing]” on his reading during work and recording his thoughts “in a
                        memorandum book […] kept by the side of [his] loom for the purpose” (125).
                        Thomas Cooper, recalling his apprenticeship as a shoemaker, records how
                        strategically he had to plan his reading in order to attain the breadth of
                        education he desired: <quote>Historical reading, or the grammar of some
                            language, or translation, was my first employment on week-day mornings,
                            whether I rose at three or four, until seven o’clock, when I sat down to
                            the stall. A book or a periodical in my hand while I breakfasted, gave
                            me another half-hour’s reading, I had another half-hour, and sometimes
                            an hour’s reading or study of language at from one to two o’clock, the
                            time of dinner – usually eating my food with a spoon, after I had cut it
                            in pieces, and having my eyes on a book all the time. (qtd. in Vincent
                            124).</quote> During his remaining six hours at work, he recited <title

                        (124), quite possibly Byron. In 1818, when he was thirteen years old, he
                        learned to love poetry by reading <title level="m">Childe Harold</title> and

                        and parsing verbs before their breakfast:

                        “habitation is the heart”—was only one kind of freedom that working-class
                        readers sought. Vincent lists the freedom from non-rational beliefs and from
                        non-rational behaviors (especially drunkenness) as common goals as well. He
                        mentions the freedom to pursue scientific learning, philosophy, and literary
                        occupations, which included writing for political and occupational
                        organizations (166-177). And perhaps most importantly for considering <title
                            level="m">Cain</title> in light of working-class discourses of learning
                        is the prospect of freedom from “the world view of the educated” (174). It
                        is in his advocacy for individual questioning that Byron most appealed to
                        working-class readers. Cain reports that labour itself does not interfere
                        with learning:

                      He sees his parents and their religion as a barrier to knowledge in a
                        way that many working-class learners must have sympathized with. The rest of
                        his family has “but / One answer to all questions,
                        “’Twas <emph>his</emph> will, / And <emph>he</emph> is good’” (I; i, 74-76). </p>
                    <p>Working-class autobiographers often expressed frustration with precisely this
                        alignment of community members’ lack of curiosity and religion’s one
                        serve-all answer. For example, when Christopher Thomson began to read beyond
                        the small collection of books that his local Methodist congregation had
                        collected, he confronted his community’s opposition to unsanctioned learning
                        as an ultimatum. He recalls being told that “if I did not at once, and
                        unconditionally, renounce all books, except such as they should approve of,
                        I was for ever lost!” Therefore, he “renounced [his] connection with all
                        bodies which would prescribe the free range of thought in matters of such
                        vital importance” (Thomson 66, qtd. in Vincent 179). John Bezer’s discontent
                        with his local school was less combative. Yet, it reveals that he faced
                        barriers to learning similar to those faced by Thomson. Bezer reports that
                        he “yearned for” his time at school, but the picture of Sunday School
                        education that he portrays makes it clear that the school met a social more
                        than an intellectual need. He regrets that “school did not even learn me to
                        read; six hours a week, certainly not <emph>one</emph> hour of useful
                        knowledge; plenty of cant, and what my teachers used to
                            call <emph>explaining</emph> difficult texts in the Bible, but little,
                        very little else” (Bezer Ch. 2). </p>
                    <p>In <title level="m">Cain</title>, Act I portrays the protagonist struggling
                        against complacency and religion in terms that recall the struggles of
                        growing romantic period counter-culture of working-class autodidacts. In Act
                        III, we see that Cain’s search for knowledge excludes him from his community
                        because his limited learning has only strengthened the curiosity that others
                        cannot understand. His wife Adah remarks his change after Cain returns from
                        his lesson with Lucifer:

                      By contemplating the insignificance of his race and the confinement of
                        his mortal subject position, Cain has isolated himself further from Adah and
                        the rest of the family. Within his intellectually complacent community,
                        Cain’s isolation is made more profound by the threatening prospects of
                        nihilism and damnation. He has no means of answering the questions he is
                        just learning to ask. “Gazing on eternity,” he says:

                        personal and communal identities now seem insignificant.</p>
                    <p> The lonely hero is already ringed-round and isolated by his unconscionable
                        longing for knowledge, and he becomes more isolated as he realizes that his
                        experiences are at once incommunicable and unnecessary to communicate.
                        Communication in his family has always been more luxury than necessity.
                        Except for him they lived external lives. They involve themselves in sense
                        like the angels. These external lives were held in common—everyone ate,
                        worshiped, and worked together. Now, he has wandered off. He has lived his
                        pursuit of knowledge alone, and the tale of his journey proves unspeakable.
                        Abel asks his brother where he has been. “I know not” replies Cain. “Nor
                        what thou has seen?” inquires Abel. In response, Cain lists things he has
                        seen: “The dead - / The Immortal - the Unbounded - the Omnipotent - / The
                        overpowering mysteries of space” (III; i, 177-180). But, he despairs, these
                        sights have rendered him “Unfit for mortal converse” (III; i, 184). Cain can
                        list the categories of beings that he has now experienced seeing, but these
                        “overpowering mysteries” cannot be communicated to one who has not
                        experienced them for himself. Temporal-spatial description (Where have you
                        been?) and categorical identification (What kinds of things have you seen?)
                        can locate personal experience within a known and shared world, but they
                        cannot indicate anything meaningful about an experience from outside the
                        world that Abel and Cain inhabit together. If the isolation resulting from
                        the incommunicability of his new knowledge were not enough, Cain is further
                        isolated by his exile at the play’s end. During his exile he does not need
                        to communicate to people. His mark announces his past and his uniqueness for
                        him. Whereas communication had been, because of its superfluous nature, a
                        luxury held in common with his family, it is now, because of its
                        superfluity, a curse. </p>
                    <p> In an era when new knowledge was being produced rapidly, Byron creates a
                        character who is timeless in his mythical origins, but also particularly
                        well-suited for dramatizing the pursuit of knowledge in the 1820s. The
                        dislocation of a quest for knowledge into classless, mythic territory also
                        allows <title level="m">Cain</title> to function within a growing
                        working-class discourse of self-directed learners as well as in the
                        privileged discourse of the quarterlies. The magnitude of Cain’s desire to
                        know inspires a discourse about his hubris and Byron’s blasphemy, but
                        underneath the scandalous theology lies a subtle inquiry into the
                        possibility and limits of knowledge.</p>

                    <p> However silent contemporary voices may be about the play’s treatment of
                        knowledge, the subject dominates <title level="m">Cain</title> both
                        structurally and linguistically, and as the play progresses the burden of
                        inquiry becomes not only God’s injustice in offering and then forbidding
                        moral knowledge, but also the possibility of attaining knowledge at all.
                        Throughout the first two acts, the desire to know more provides Cain’s chief
                        motivation. In the third and final act, when Cain realizes that he has
                        killed his brother, he describes this most dramatic of the play’s events to
                        himself as primarily cerebral where the “thought” of death, which
                        “Empoison’d” his life has now been replaced by knowledge (III: I, 371-379).
                        Refocusing the conflict of the Cain and Abel story on the search for
                        knowledge, instead of an originary act of violence, is largely Byron’s
                        innovation. The biblical account, brief enough to quote in full, mentions
                        the themes of envy, anger, and divine approval, but not knowledge.

                      Sin is pictured as aggressive, “lurking at the door,” and Byron might
                        have found in this (and clearly also in his reading of Milton) inspiration
                        for making Lucifer a dominant character as a kind of personification of this
                        lurking power. However, the Bible offers no hint that Cain has sinned by
                        demanding knowledge. The emphasis seems to be placed on action, to “do
                        well,” rather than on thought. </p>
                    <p>The only mention of knowledge that occurs in Genesis Chapter Four comes after
                        the murder itself. The Lord asks Cain “Where is your brother Abel?” and Cain
                        replies, “I do not know; am I my brother’s keeper?” (Gen. 4:9). For the sake
                        of the play, Byron treats Cain’s protestation of ignorance as plausible. He
                        did not know where his brother had gone because Abel was the first in the
                        world to die. The question of responsibility for his brother is also treated
                        as genuine, even as a realization of what Cain does not know. “Where is my
                        brother?” he seems to wonder. Or in other words, “What is the nature of
                        mortality?” “Am I my brother’s keeper?” follows from this question as an
                        inquiry into the responsibility toward others that the condition of
                        mortality might imply. By interpreting Cain’s questions as genuine rather
                        than evasive, Byron transforms Cain from an object of contempt to a figure
                        of identification. By rendering the realization of his ignorance a cause,
                        rather than an effect of Cain’s murderous act, he opens the play to more
                        direct connections with the larger Edenic narrative.</p>
                    <p>The structural emphasis that Byron places on Cain’s search for knowledge
                        frustrated both Heber and Jeffrey because it slows the pace of the narrative
                        and eliminates any sense that the murder follows predictably from Cain’s
                        nature and situation. Heber notes that “Two acts and half the third are
                        passed without advancing a single step towards the conclusion” (241-242).
                        Jeffrey laments that the debate of why God had placed the tree of the
                        knowledge of good and evil in the garden is no “incidental deformity” in an
                        otherwise sound dramatic structure. Rather, it “forms […] the great staple
                        of the piece” (234). If Abel’s death is intended to form the climax of the
                        play as it forms the climax of the biblical story, then Byron has failed
                        adequately to develop this plotline. Judging from the play’s plot
                        development, Heber asserts, Abel could just as well have “been made to drop
                        down in an apoplexy, and Cain to die of grief over his body” (242). Byron
                        represents Abel’s death as motiveless. There is no logic that can contain a
                        murder. He directs our attention to the act’s incomprehensibility, and thus
                        ties the murder to the conflict of Act II, but recognizing this depends on
                        seeing knowledge rather than envy as the primary site of Cain’s internal
                        struggle. </p>
                    <p>Envy implies need. Byron writes in a letter to Moore that such a motive makes
                        the biblical Cain “contemptible.” In his eagerness to free his rebellious
                        and questioning Cain from his contemptuous biblical precedent, Byron devotes
                        seventeen lines of the play (II: ii, 337-354) to differentiating Cain’s
                        fondness for his brother from the biblical Cain’s envy. Lucifer tempts Cain
                        to feel envy for his brother. “Thy father loves him well,” he says, “so does
                        thy God” (II: ii 340). “And so do I” replies the unruffled Cain (II:ii 341).
                        “He is the second born of flesh, / And his mother’s favourite” presses
                        Lucifer, but Cain still resists. Even in the moment where Cain kills Abel,
                        his anger is against God and not his brother. He has determined to overthrow
                        Abel’s altar so that it will not “stand in the sun, to shame creation!”
                        (III: I, 304, 309-311). Byron clarifies to Moore the manner in which he
                        hoped to reshape Cain’s intentions: <quote>the object of the Demon is
                                to <emph>depress</emph> him still further in his own estimation than
                            he was before, by showing him infinite things and his own abasement,
                            till he falls into the frame of mind that leads to the catastrophe, from
                            mere <emph>internal</emph> irritation, <emph>not</emph> premeditation,
                            or envy of Abel (which would have made him contemptible), but from the
                            rage and fury against the inadequacy of his state to his conceptions,
                            and which discharges itself rather against Life, and the author of Life,
                            than the mere living. (<title level="m">Life,</title> <title level="m"
                                >Letters and Journals</title> 541) </quote> The demon that Byron
                        describes in the letter is Lucifer, external to Cain the learner, but is
                        also tied to the demon of knowledge that Lucifer describes as lying latent
                        in both Cain and Eve. Byron’s Lucifer declaims having tempted Eve to
                        knowledge. Nor does he initiate the conversation about knowledge with Cain.
                        The desire to know is rather represented as innate in both mother and son.
                        It is “a demon” that the serpent awoke in speaking to Eve (I: i, 228-229).
                        Lucifer has only to mention knowledge in passing, as part of a casual
                        sarcastic sneer, for the desire to flare up in Cain. Lucifer says there was
                        nothing for spirits “to envy in the narrow bounds / Of Paradise […] but I
                        speak to thee of what though know’st not / With all thy tree of knowledge”
                        (I: i, 241-245). Cain jumps in before the line is metrically complete: “But
                        though canst not/ Speak aught of knowledge which I would not know” (I. i,
                        246-247). </p>
                    <p>In addition to modifying the structure of the plot and the protagonist’s
                        motivation to highlight questions of knowledge, Byron also highlights
                        knowledge linguistically. Cognates of the word “to know” dominate the play,
                        recurring over one hundred times. “Knowledge” sometimes so crowds the
                        dialogue that the word itself becomes oppressive.

                      </quote> Five lines in a row mention knowledge, and the sound of the lines
                        encourages readers to take note of the repetition. The pairing of “now know”
                        and “know not” turns the lines into such a sonic bog that it is difficult
                        not to be slowed down. Byron repeats the pairing of “know” and “not”
                        throughout the play. Of the dead Abel, Cain says, “what thou now art / I
                        know not!” (III: i, 530-531). In making his offering before God, he says the
                        he “know[s] not” if it be “good or ill” (III: I, 274-276). Enoch “know’st
                        not” that he is naked (III: I, 23), and Cain “know[s] not” if God smiles
                        (II: ii, 350). The constant positing of the absence of knowledge makes Cain
                        seem like an ideal learner in the Platonic tradition. He knows what he does
                        not know. But it also hints at an impossibility of acquiring knowledge. Cain
                        denies having knowledge about himself, denies having knowledge about God,
                        and denies having knowledge of the pure materiality to which his brother is
                        reduced at the play’s end. In short, he denies the possibility of attaining
                        knowledge even as he repeatedly tries to seek it. </p>
                    <p>The language in these “know-not” pairings reinforces the play’s more general
                        questioning of rational knowledge. As Leonard Goldberg puts it, “Cain, whose
                        acts effectively deny that mind can, should or need have anything to do with
                        its objects, catastrophically defies rationality as the way toward
                        autonomous life” (207-208). But, even more radically, the play provides no
                        indication that rationality could provide a way to autonomous life for
                        anyone. Jerome McGann argues that Byron’s Lucifer is himself limited in what
                        he knows. Because he is pure spirit, he can neither sympathize with Cain,
                        nor offer Cain the knowledge of mortality and embodied ethical
                        responsibility that he seeks (260). Being unable to enact death, Lucifer
                        cannot know it. Cain attains this knowledge by performing Abel’s murder.
                        Such knowledge cannot be achieved by witnessing another’s death or looking
                        at “dead things” (II; ii, 191). It requires action for its attainment.
                        Similarly, by not performing acts of love toward anyone, Lucifer excludes
                        himself from any knowledge of love. According to him, the contemplation of
                        love leads to the destruction of love’s potential objects. In one passage,
                        Lucifer describes both the impossibility of knowing love by observing
                        someone else and the impossibility performing love as an abstract
                        contemplation. “[T]hou canst not see if <emph>I</emph> love / Or no” “except
                        some vast and general purpose, / To which particular things melt like snow”
                        (II; ii 313-315). In <title level="m">Cain’</title>s textual world, learners
                        are doomed to seek knowledge through contemplation but find it through
                        action.</p>

                <div type="section">
                    <head>Knowledge in Action</head>
                    <p>The long discussion of knowledge, the action-less first two scenes and the
                        increasing focus on the incompatibility of contemplation and action prepare
                        the way for the violence of Act III, not by creating a structure that
                        assimilates the murder and makes it an object of understanding, but by
                        diminishing the expectation that knowledge can account for any action.
                        Following the murder, Abel and Cain’s exchange confirms the separation of
                        knowledge and action. Abel, alluding to Christ’s final words, asks God to
                        forgive Cain on the basis that he “knew not what he did” (III; i, 319), but
                        the nature of this knowing or not knowing deserves investigation. Cain says
                        after Abel’s death that he is now “awake” (III; i, 378). This, and Abel’s
                        use of the past tense “knew” indicate a change in Cain’s state of knowledge;
                        he “knew not” what death was until he enacted it. In the association of
                        knowledge with action, <title level="m">Cain </title>forms the darker
                        counterpart to a similar argument in <title level="m">Don Juan</title>—that
                        education cannot come through Donna Inez’s abstractions got by rote but only
                        through experience. </p>
                    <p>The murder in Act III can be read several ways in terms of its treatment of
                        knowledge and the failure of knowledge to promote either happiness or
                        virtue. The play may be seen as confirming leisure-class anxieties about the
                        connections between working-class access to education and violence. After
                        all, it is only after Cain’s education that he kills his brother. As much as
                        Lucifer counsels Cain to not let his reason “be over-sway’d” (II: ii, 460),
                        Cain does not return to his family a more reasonable man in the commonplace
                        use of the term “reasonable.” When he and Abel are offering their
                        sacrifices, he points to the injustice of shedding innocent blood. Only
                        twelve lines later, he unjustly sheds the blood of his brother. And yet,
                        Cain’s angry expostulations do make sense according to a purely abstract logic.
                        God loves lives, he concludes, since Abel’s sacrifice met God’s pleasure.
                        “Take thy life unto thy God,” he says upon striking him, “Since he loves
                        lives” (III: i, 316-317). Byron portrays here, it might be argued, what pure
                        logic leads to, when it is exercised outside of the guidance of church
                        (suggested by the ritual religious practice of sacrifice) and state
                        (suggested by Adam, the paternal authority Cain resists throughout the
                        play). Neither the present, priest-like Abel, nor the absent father coerces
                        Cain into making a sacrifice. The only expression of authority in the scene
                        is the fire sent to consume Abel’s sacrifice and the whirlwind sent to
                        scatter Cain’s. Cain’s anger is kindled primarily at God for a rejection
                        that he does not understand. His violence results from the displacement of
                        this anger onto his brother, who might be read as standing in for both
                        church and state through his connections to both the sacrifice and Adam.
                        Read this way, Cain resembles a worker, enraged by his divine lot and
                        empowered by justifying logic, displacing his anger onto the nearest emblem
                        of authority. However, the problem here does not really seem to be logic
                        having escaped cultural bounds, but logic failing as an epistemic
                        system.</p>
                    <p>Scholars have approached Cain’s transition into knowledge following the
                        murder and his preceding epistemic failure in at least two ways. For Leonard
                        Goldberg, the incompatibility of Cain’s rational “knowledge” of what God
                        wants and Abel’s claim that Cain “knew not” what he was doing arises from a
                        failure of language. Cain refuses “to accept that others have meaningful
                        words to say to him,” and refuses to admit there is more than “one story to
                        account for the rejection of his offering” (220). Goldberg opens his article
                        with the assertion that Cain resists the need of the mind to strive after
                        objects instead of just ideas (207), and this assertion could be read as
                        implying that Cain’s enactment of murder shows the tragic climax of Cain’s
                        treating his brother like the consequence of an argument that he needs to
                        deny. This implication is not inconsistent with Goldberg’s reading of Act
                        III, but I think he is right to focus on the scene as a crisis of
                        communication between people rather than a crisis of phenomenological access
                        to knowledge of the objective world. The language of the murder scene shifts
                        from the language of knowledge that dominates the play, to a language of
                        life and love:

                      The stage directions here are the second most extensive ones in the
                        entire play, and they are followed by one of the few moments of physical
                        contact between characters. “[G]ive me thy hand” says Abel (III; i, 320).
                        Shifting to physical activity after two acts of only argument, Byron shows
                        the point at which language and logic fail. The boggy alliteration of “know
                        not” is here replaced with “loves lives.” The constant intrusion of the
                        negative into sentences about knowledge yields place to “more” – a
                        comparison of plentitudes. “More” love for God, “more” blood on the altar
                        (III; i, 315, 311). When the epiphany about death that Cain has sought
                        throughout the play finally, ironically, arrives, it arrives through action
                        and explodes the tidy dichotomies of language (know, know-not) with
                        plentitude. The good and evil that Lucifer had described as “essence” at the
                        end of Act II are suddenly revealed to be connected to desires reaching to
                        objects outside the self and materials whose essential connection to life
                        can be neither seen nor explained.</p>
                    <p>The scene highlights the consequences of Cain’s failure to strive for the
                        life-giving knowledge of another person through love and physical
                        engagement, but it also draws our attention to the gap between materiality
                        and abstractions that has persisted in Byron’s language throughout the play.
                        In the second interpretation of this play as an exploration of knowledge,
                        Jerome McGann sees Cain as torn between “material and spiritual Principles”
                        (259). This material-spiritual conflict is also highlighted in the murder
                        scene, as the protagonist suddenly awakens to the physicality of his own
                        body. “My hand,” Cain says “after a moment of stupefaction” (322). Cain
                        tries one more time after Abel’s death to re-align his world with the way
                        his reason tells him it should be. He begins with the fatalist claim “that
                        which I am, I am; I did not seek / For life, nor did I make myself” implying
                        that Abel’s death is logically the fault of the Creator and he only the
                        mechanism (III; i, 509-510). But his love for his brother drives him into
                        agency. He expresses the same willingness to sacrifice himself that Abel had
                        made for the sake of God, still not submitting himself to God, but to the
                        love of his brother:

                      Logically, this proposition functions perfectly. If God loves Abel and
                        he is omnipotent, then he will restore Abel to life. But, this syllogism
                        fails to account for the shattered materiality of Abel’s body. The knowledge
                        Cain finally achieves is the awareness that knowledge itself is the product
                        embodied action as well as purely cerebral thought. As violent as the play’s
                        ending is, it does not imply that the action through which a learner attains
                        this epiphany about knowledge must be violent or immoral. Abel attains this
                        knowledge though the act of dying.</p>
                    <p> Cain’s questioning remains heroic, but I agree with Leonard Michaels that
                        Byron is ultimately critical of his character. Michaels argues that it is
                        not Cain’s search for knowledge that Byron critiques but his “simple refusal
                        to identify with the human condition,” a refusal that Michaels dubs
                        “quintessentially aristocratic” (74-75). While Byron seems, at first, to
                        redeploy aristocratic assumptions about education upheld by public schools
                        and universities, the play destabilizes these assumptions as it progresses.
                        In particular, Byron undermines the dichotomy between knowledge and action
                        that was frequently assumed in distinguishing the “practical education” fit
                        for workers from the “classical education” fit for leisure-class pupils. I
                        would like to conclude that Byron advocates for the kind of free, desperate,
                        heroic pursuit of knowledge exemplified by romantic period autodidacts, that
                        his tiller of fields is, murder aside, in solidarity with the tillers,
                        weavers, and shipwrights that loved to read him. But, if <title level="m"
                            >Cain </title>can be said to advocate for anything, it does so through
                        layers of negation and irony.</p>
                    <p> The play engages contemporary discourses of knowledge more through critique
                        than advocacy. Cain critiques the boundaries placed on inquiry, and Byron
                        leads us to sympathize with him by painting the play’s other characters
                        (Adah somewhat excepted) as flat and unsympathetic. And in the play’s
                        implied critique of Cain, Byron problematizes the assumptions that underlie
                        the kind of education he received at Harrow. To offer any resolution to the
                        problem of attaining knowledge that forms the structural center of the play
                        would undermine the nihilism that provides the play’s only pathos.
                        Additionally, such a resolution would imply that the mortal knowledge Cain
                        and Abel gain through murder and death could be contained in one of Cain’s
                        logical syllogisms. Instead, Byron leaves us facing the opposition between
                        the logical metaphysics for which Cain feels his immortal birth has fitted
                        him and the logic-defying corporeality that leads to death. Byron strikes at
                        this opposition like one striking the skin of a drum. The sound caused,
                        re-sounds, its echo manifested in our search for knowledge that we cannot
                        harness in use.</p>
