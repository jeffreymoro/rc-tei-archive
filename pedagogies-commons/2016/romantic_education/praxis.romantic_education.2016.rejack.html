            <p class="noCount">This essay chronicles my experience teaching a course outside of the realm of Romanticism
               (a first-year writing course focused on digital media), an experience which occasioned
               reflection on the lessons that Romanticism can offer us about contemporary new media,
               and in particular how we approach new media pedagogically. The essay begins with an
               overview of new media scholarship which seeks to redress the tendency to view new
               media as always immaterial, the scholarship that informed much of the focus of the
               course in question. I next discuss some of the tools and methods adopted in teaching
               the course. And the final move in the essay turns toward Romanticism, and specifically
               to theories of and scholarship on the Romantic imagination. My final contention is
               that the Romantic imagination offers ways to resist the ideology of immateriality
               which characterizes so much of new media discourse. </p>

            </header><br/><div class="wrapper">
               <p>In the spring of 2011, I taught a first-year writing seminar focused on fictional
                  and non-fictional representations of the internet and digital culture.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>I’d like to thank the students of my course for all the enthusiasm and insight they
                           brought to our investigations of digital culture. Their hard work helped shape my
                           thinking in ways that I couldn’t have imagined beforehand. </span></div>
                  </div> As a devoted Romanticist, I envisioned such an opportunity as a chance to step outside
                  my usual nineteenth-century base and see what effects the time spent in unfamiliar
                  terrain might produce. My goal was to help students approach critically various aspects
                  of technological life, and, in so doing, encourage them to reflect on the relation
                  between college writing and the twenty-first-century media landscape. The connection
                  between my initial conception of the course and Romanticism was tangential at most.
                  I titled the course “Imagining the Internet” because I wanted students to see digital
                  culture from a shifted intellectual perspective, specifically through the logic of
                  defamiliarization that imagination enables. In particular I wanted to counter the
                  reigning digital rhetoric, one which privileges immateriality as if it were actually
                  the ontological condition of computing. From its beginnings cyberculture has represented
                  the digital realm as one free from materiality, as in the emblematic early example
                  of the hackers in William Gibson’s <em>Neuromancer</em> (1984) who long to escape into cyberspace and away from their bodies, which they derisively
                  term “meat.” That immaterial ideology persists in our contemporary practices like
                  cloud computing and syncing between devices, both of which give the impression that
                  the data accessed has no fixed material basis, but merely exists as eternally mutable
                  zeroes and ones. As such, “imagination” may have seemed an odd choice, given that
                  it tends to be understood as the mental faculty capable of transporting us out of
                  embodied experience, in a manner akin to what cyberspace purportedly enables. Instead,
                  I wanted students to discover some of the complex material exchanges that make possible
                  digital culture’s aura of immateriality, and to do so by imagining the materiality
                  that so easily eludes our grasp of the digital. Although I began the course assuming
                  that it would take me into new territory, I quickly found myself in a space eerily
                  familiar to me as a Romanticist, a space where imagination, ideology and materiality
                  exist in fraught relation to one another. In this essay I recount that experience
                  as a way to reflect on the overlapping domains of teaching and research, new and old
                  media, and the frameworks that help us place their iterative connections.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In what follows, then, I demonstrate how I presented my students with the digital
                  rhetoric of immateriality, how we attempted to resist that rhetoric with the aid of
                  digital tools, and how that process illuminated what it means to imaginatively embody
                  Romantic texts, an illumination that additionally cast light back on new media. Romantic
                  theories of imagination offered a conceptual framework for students to intellectually
                  and creatively rematerialize the seemingly immaterial nature of digital objects. As
                  Lori Emerson argues concerning interface design trends in contemporary computing,
                  new media interfaces are now “steadily making their way toward invisibility, imperceptibility,
                  and inoperability” (1), characteristics which become equated rhetorically with “naturalness”
                  and the devices’ seemingly “magical” properties (4–19). When dealing with technologies
                  of such complexity, when, as Percy Shelley claims, “our calculations have outrun conception,”
                  the imagination can effectively make strange the perceived naturalness of computing
                  and bring materiality back into view.

                           (and how that experience subsequently helped me see anew the connections between my
                           scholarship and pedagogy), I’m indebted to the work of several other scholars who
                           have imagined various digital futures for Romanticism through their practices. I’m
                           thinking of course of the many digital resources, like The Blake Archive and NINES,
                           that have invigorated nineteenth-century scholarship in the digital era. But also
                           I have in mind work like Paul Youngquist’s playful and incisive “Techno-Prosthetic
                           Romantic Futurism,”…</span></div>
                  </div> Now more than five years after the teaching experience I relate in this article, I
                  have taught Romanticism several more times, in different contexts (as part of a survey,
                  in seminar form devoted wholly to Romanticism, as part of a genre-based course) and
                  to different audiences (undergraduate English majors and non-majors, MA and PhD students),
                  and as a result I am more confident in my conviction that when we teach Romanticism,
                  we teach a form of media studies. Imagining a medium (old or new) just is doing Romanticism.
                  In that sense, the habits of mind and practice outlined here signify a pedagogy <em>of</em> Romanticism as much as one <em>for</em> Romanticism.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The intellectual kernel that led me to develop the course, and which began to solidify
                     in my mind the productive connections between Romanticism and new media studies, was
                     Matthew Kirschenbaum’s identification of a “medial ideology” pervading the study of
                     electronic media. Acknowledging his debt to Jerome McGann’s notion of “Romantic ideology,”
                     Kirschenbaum defines his related ideology as “one that substitutes popular representations
                     of a medium […] for a more comprehensive treatment of the material particulars of
                     a given technology” (36).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>McGann’s argument in 1983 that Romanticist scholarship suffered from “an uncritical
                              absorption in Romanticism’s own self-representations” (1) transfers remarkably well
                              to the realm of media studies. Kirschenbaum was not the first to resist such uncritical
                              absorption in the context of new media. For instance, a decade prior, Katherine Hayles
                              attempted as much by identifying and challenging what she calls an “ideology of disembodiment”
                              which has its roots in early communications theory and computational practices. She
                              contends that “[t]he body’s dematerialization depends in complex and highly sp…</span></div>
                     </div> Kirschenbaum demonstrates how the representations of digital culture portray new media
                     as divorced from the material aspects of its existence—we treat zeroes and ones as
                     if they were merely abstractions, not as metaphors to signify particular material
                     processes. To establish some of the course’s foundational assumptions about new media,
                     then, I introduced my students to a variety of “popular representations of [the] medium.”
                     We aimed to read these texts through a conventional humanities practice: ideology
                     critique. The specific aspect of digital ideology we examined was the assumption that
                     bodies do not matter, and that material concerns disappear in the purely disembodied
                     flow of data. One can witness that assumption’s most extreme form in the desire to
                     translate the human brain into binary code and thereby achieve digital immortality
                     (by now a common science fiction trope as well as an <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uIzS1uCOcE">actual goal of many technological enthusiasts</a>), but it also persists in the banal versions one encounters regularly in the practice
                     of everyday digital life. The first example discussed here, and one of the first texts
                     I presented to my students, falls squarely in the former category: John Perry Barlow’s
                     “<a class="link_ref" href="https://projects.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html">A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</a>,” first published in February 1996 through the <em>Electronic Frontier Foundation</em>, an internet advocacy group co-founded by Barlow. In what became a widely copied
                     and disseminated document of the early Web, Barlow addresses the “Governments of the
                     Industrial World,” the “weary giants of flesh and steel” who have no sway over “the
                     new home of Mind,” rhetorical figures which pose industry as the evil cyborg enemies
                     of the pure spirit of humanity. Cyberspace is posed as “an act of nature […] [which]
                     grows itself through our collective actions,” and that such growth “consists of transactions,
                     relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our
                     communications.” With freedom from the trappings of industry, politics, capitalism
                     and other material concerns, Barlow insists of cyberspace, “there is no matter here.”
                     The social reorganization promised by cyberspace extends to individual subjectivity
                     as well, with a similar stripping away of matter. Barlow claims that “our identities
                     have no bodies,” and that, like the discrete packets of bits that zoom across the
                     globe from one computer to another, they are endlessly mutable and mobile. These bodiless
                     identities, without the limitations of material existence inhabit a world of pure
                     imagination: “whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed
                     infinitely at no cost.” Or, we might say, channeling Gene Wilder’s Willy Wonka, “If
                     you want to view paradise, simply look around and view it. Anything you want to, do
                     it. Want to change the world, there’s nothing to it.”</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>So says another representative example that my students and I analyzed: <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZMZoy3rrlM&amp;">an AT&amp;T advertisement</a> from 2010 which uses “Pure Imagination” as its backing music. The ad co-opts the rhetoric
                     of early techno-utopian manifestos like Barlow’s, but it drastically changes the kind
                     of “freedom” on offer. Freedom in the ad means life in a corporate world with the
                     promise of escape through the internet, even as the network itself becomes more corporatized
                     and centrally controlled through seemingly ubiquitous points of access and handy “tethered
                     devices.”
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Jonathan Zittrain uses the term “tethered devices” to refer to products like smartphones,
                              iPods, and gaming consoles, the uses of which are restricted by the companies that
                              produce them (as opposed to personal computers, which users can open, modify, and
                              install third-party software on without the parent company’s approval). Zittrain argues
                              that the prevalence of such devices will enact “a wholesale shift of our information
                              ecosystem away from generativity” (102) and towards greater control (from regulators,
                              the hardware companies, service providers, etc.). </span></div>
                     </div> The ad shows various young urbanites navigating through a post-industrial world, still
                     one of flesh and steel, and yet they seem unaware of the magical world that pulses
                     around them (like a wireless network), here pictured in the form of childlike drawings
                     brought to life amidst the cityscape. Toward the commercial’s end, the drawings all
                     collapse, suggesting the end of imagination precisely at the moment that the objects
                     become fully material (a train crashes into a wall; a three-eyed monster drapes over
                     the side of a bridge; a giant robot falls to the ground, along with his attendant
                     cloud shapes). After the figures disappear, the ad cuts to an isolated man sitting
                     on a bench perched on a concrete overlook, his head downcast, his shirt unbuttoned
                     and tie loosened, his briefcase, coffee and lunch next to him—all helpful details
                     suggesting his post-industrial ennui, presumably the cause of the imaginary figures’
                     departures. But suddenly, the man remembers his smartphone, and its unearthly glow
                     lights up his now smiling face, as one of the imagined figures return to the scene.
                     Once again he lives in a world of pure imagination.</p>

                  <p>In addition to introducing the ideology of cyberspace as a disembodied, immaterial
                     realm free from politics, class, and matter itself, I used these two texts to reflect
                     on the way we access and interpret such materials. YouTube, the site on which we watched
                     the ad, is a vastly useful collection of visual materials, but not a transparent one.
                     Our class discussed, for example, YouTube’s (then current, now defunct) motto, “Broadcast

                              appears only as “YouTube.” As the site’s emphasis has shifted from producing to consuming,
                              the devaluing of individuals doing the “broadcasting” by and of themselves is unsurprising.</span></div>
                     </div> as an intentional alignment with the history of amateur broadcasting in the early

                     development, and corporate appropriation described in <em>The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires</em> (2010) by Tim Wu. With the AT&amp;T ad, the self that is broadcasted is named “<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/attoffer">attoffer</a>,” and when you click on “his” personal website, it unsurprisingly directs you to
                     offers for a subscription to AT&amp;T’s various network services. What begins as an open
                     service, a place where anyone can post videos for free without limitations on access
                     and ownership, becomes increasingly closed, regulated and centrally controlled. While
                     peddling immaterial ideology to the extent that the “self” is the message being broadcast,
                     as Barlow hoped identities without bodies might do, YouTube suggests, through its
                     specific medial transactions, a contradictory set of ideas about what pure imagination
                     through a network might entail. Here the freedom of cyberspace comes at a cost, one
                     that “attoffer” will happily specify, even as its parent company’s rhetoric obscures
                     the material interactions through which the network functions.</p>

                  <p>After introducing this particular awareness of digital materiality, I hoped to help
                     students to see immaterial ideology <em>as </em>ideology. Discussing texts like Barlow’s “Declaration” and the AT&amp;T advertisement
                     certainly began that process, but those methods were firmly rooted in an old method:
                     ideologically attuned close reading. I wanted also to use digital tools to demonstrate
                     the ways in which our experience of digital culture comes back to materiality. Text
                     analysis software, for instance, offers a particularly striking way to reflect on
                     textual materiality and to imagine what it might mean to reintroduce material specificity
                     to digital objects. By demonstrating a text’s mutability as it moves from one material
                     medium to another, the complexities of textual signification become newly visible.

                              value gained from encoding literary texts into digital environments: “Because our
                              computer tools are models of what we imagine we know—they’re built to our specifications—when
                              they show us what they know they are reporting ourselves back to us” (Radiant Textuality
                              143).</span></div>
                     </div> When the class read Rudy Rucker’s classic cyberpunk novel <em>Software</em> (1982), we put the novel’s entire text into a web-based program called <a class="link_ref" href="http://voyant-tools.org"><em>Voyant</em></a>, which analyzes the number of occurrences of distinct words, and allows the manipulation
                     of them in various ways. One can view a word cloud (the larger words representing
                     visually their higher relative frequency), chart one word against another, track a
                     word’s appearance at different times throughout the book, and otherwise manipulate
                     the textual “corpus” as a dataset. With <em>Software</em>, for example, one can track “software” and “hardware,” the two terms around which
                     the novel dramatizes its main concerns regarding identity and embodiment. Early on
                     a character opines that “the soul is the software” (62). Cobb Anderson, the inventor
                     of the intelligent robots called “boppers,” gets rewarded by his creatures, who translate
                     his soul into new “hardware,” a robot body that looks exactly like his human one,
                     and which negates the pesky problem of mortality. By isolating the two words, one
                     can view them in context across all their instances in the novel in different visual
                     and linguistic representations.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Of course, one can accomplish a similar task, but more slowly, using traditional reading
                     methods. The usefulness of a digital tool like this one rests on the altered presentation
                     of information that we might alternatively access through print. I foregrounded this
                     particular realization for my students by focusing on the manipulation of the text
                     required to produce such a representation, a process that reinforces the material
                     specificity of texts, and the variations that occur between digital and print. Rucker
                     published, in 2010, the entire <em>Ware Tetralogy</em> (<em>Software</em> and its three follow-ups) in a single-volume print edition, which my students purchased
                     for use in the course. Students could alternatively read the novel in digital form,
                     which Rucker simultaneously published for free as a PDF made available through his
                     website and distributed under a Creative Commons license. Even with most of the remediation
                     already done for us, the process of transporting the digital text into another software
                     environment allowed us to reflect on how we might understand “text” in relation to
                     the novel’s interest in software and hardware. The novel’s linguistic data became
                     akin to code that we could run on the different software and hardware configurations
                     of a print book, a PDF reader, or a web-based text analysis program.

                              in Radiant Textuality, that “Any given textual form represents a complex set of transactional
                              codes written for simultaneous and/or sequential execution” (150).</span></div>
                     </div> One particular problem, however, demonstrated how the process of textual migration
                     itself, like the transmission of Cobb’s “software” (the data that makes up his “soul”)
                     into new “hardware” (a fresh robot body), reoriented the nature of the novel’s print
                     and digital materialities. When copying and pasting the text from the PDF, the running
                     header, reading “<em>Rudy Rucker</em>” and “<em>The Ware Tetralogy: Software</em>” respectively on the verso and recto (terms complicated by the typical single-page
                     display of PDFs), becomes part of the “corpus” analyzed by <em>Voyant</em>. When tracking the instances of the word “software,” the numbers get significantly
                     skewed (since it appears seventy-three times in the header). The result of witnessing
                     this material negotiation of a print-based text simultaneously published in digital
                     format and then transported into another instantiation was that my students had to
                     consider the text “as a laced network of linguistic and bibliographic codes” (<em>Textual Condition</em> 13). Do we count those seventy-three instances of “software” that occur in the header?
                     Or rather, <em>how</em> do we count them and account for their meaning? Such questions become relevant when
                     manipulating the text with an awareness of the particular transactions that make such
                     manipulation possible. Like the novel itself, which skeptically regards the transmission
                     of one’s “soul” via software implemented in new “hardware,” our treatment of the digital
                     text in relation to its print forms helped us see the processes of transmission not
                     as transparent, but rather as contingent upon specific material factors.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In addition to analyzing print-based materials with the aid of digital tools, the
                  class also examined born-digital texts to see further the obscuring effects of immaterial
                  digital ideology. Students took a particular shine to a project by Leonardo Solaas,
                  a programmer and new media artist who created <em>Google Variations</em>, a net-art installation that re-presents Google in altered states. Most of the variations
                  present a functional Google homepage with only slight tweaks. <a class="link_ref" href="http://turbulence.org/Works/google/pond/">“The Google Pond,”</a> for example, creates a visual ripple effect when moving the cursor over the page.
                  Similarly, <a class="link_ref" href="http://turbulence.org/Works/google/painter/">“Paint it Google”</a> transforms the cursor into a paint tool, and the page into a color palette and canvas.
                  Others have a more programmatic purpose and a lesser degree of functionality. <a class="link_ref" href="http://turbulence.org/Works/google/god/1.htm">“Google is God”</a> displays six separate pages, designed to look like individual search results from
                  Google, all of which present quotations regarding the correspondence between Google
                  and divine power. The final result, however, gestures outside of Solaas’s pre-programmed
                  response, and opens an actual Google results page for the query, <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+is+god">“google is god.”</a> The movement from “net art” to genuine web page occurs without signal and as such
                  works toward Solaas’s goal of destabilizing and denaturalizing what has become such
                  a dominant feature of internet use. The final variation, titled <a class="link_ref" href="http://turbulence.org/Works/google/some/day/google/will/not/be/there/">“The Future,”</a> reinforces the contingency of Google, and of all such digital objects. It displays
                  a typical “HTTP 404,” or “Page Not Found,” error message, a standard code to indicate
                  when communication with the server is intact, but the requested page could not be
                  found. The title of the requested page in this case is “some/day/google/will/not/be/there/.”
                  The implication, of course, is that Google’s server has no such page because Google
                  does not anticipate such an eventuality. The “missing” page nonetheless speaks by
                  virtue of its absence. Solaas’s presentation reminds us that Google will not exist
                  for all eternity (an obvious truth), but furthermore that the nature of its existence
                  is contingent upon the particularities of our material interfaces and programming
                  and always experienced in relation to the larger culture of computing.</p>

                  <p>The denaturalizing of digital objects performed by a work like <em>Google Variations</em> enabled students to adopt a similar perspective in their own productions. All students
                     were required to write for our course blog, a forum in which they could reflect on

                     </div>) the particular communicative modes enabled by the blog form. As is typical of the
                     form, students regularly used media in their posts, linked outside the blog, referenced
                     other peers’ posts, and perhaps most useful for the course’s writing instruction goals,
                     self-consciously adopted a tone more informal than that employed in their academic
                     papers. We specifically discussed that difference in our conversations about academic
                     writing in multiple class sessions devoted to peer review. I also asked students to
                     contemplate the particularities of expression enabled by their word processing software
                     when writing their academic essays. For their second paper, I assigned students a
                     relatively conventional comparison paper (analyzing texts from two different media),
                     but with the additional stipulation that they manipulate their medium with something
                     in addition to text. For most students this meant embedding images or video in their
                     essays, but even this simple task helped them reflect on the content of their papers:
                     rematerializing and denaturalizing digital objects. For example, one student writing
                     about William Gibson’s <em>Agrippa</em> (1992) and Solaas’s <em>Google Variations</em> argues through an analysis of the two works “whether a user is forced to submit to
                     a medium or is granted options, the mechanism through which one receives information
                     dictates the interpretation of that information.” She writes that <em>Google Variations</em> “reminds users of their role on a search engine since every movement creates a new
                     effect,” which in turn helps to erase the influence of Google itself: namely, that
                     because of Google’s ubiquity, “the user forgets the mechanism, allowing the mechanism
                     to have an influence without the user’s awareness.” By embedding in her essay screenshots
                     of her manipulation of <em>Google Variations</em>, the student reinforced her argument visually and methodologically (Figure 1). In
                     effect, her image of “Paint it Google” represents the kind of awareness of “the mechanism”
                     she describes in the paper. Not only has she altered the page by using the cursor
                     to deform Google’s logo, she has also typed in the search box, obscured but still
                     legible, “Vanderbilt University First Year Writing Seminars,” of which our course
                     was one. This moment of textual and visual play gets “captured” by her computer’s
                     screen capture software, and then redeployed in its modified form by conscious manipulation
                     of the software that enables her to compose her essay. The essay itself, a product
                     of the course being queried in her altered Google, becomes another digital object
                     subject to the conscious manipulation of media she describes in the paper’s argument
                     and analysis.</p>

               <p>Entering into this assignment, and into the course more generally, I assumed that
                  it would be valuable to adopt digital methods and tools since the course content was
                  focused on new media. I came to realize more strikingly what I had only intuited to
                  be true before: that such tools are valuable for the kinds of insight they produce,
                  not simply because they exist and so must be worth adopting. Objects like <em>Voyant</em>’s text analysis software, Wordpress’s blog platform, and even Microsoft Word as a
                  basic—and, some would say, poor—multi-media compositional tool all encouraged students
                  to see their own practices with digital technologies in relation to the intellectual
                  stance we were taking toward computational practices more broadly. Our discussions
                  of digital culture’s ideology of disembodiment and immateriality helped to reorient
                  the way students looked at digital objects, including their own work. The tools we
                  used in producing and reflecting on that reorientation continued the process of rematerializing
                  the digital that we began by close reading. Of course, such tools do not inherently
                  encourage an awareness of materiality—they can just as readily obscure computational
                  processes. Tools do not function transparently, and most of us lack the technological
                  expertise required to conceive fully of their mechanisms. However, using the tools
                  can produce understanding of a different sort. The re-presentation of digital objects
                  in altered forms allows for and encourages imaginative knowledge of the relation between
                  virtual and material. Romantic notions of imagination prove particularly useful to
                  support this stance precisely because such theories of imagination insist on the material
                  forms that communicate the seemingly immaterial nature of imaginative experience.</p>

                  <p>To connect more directly digital ideology with Romantic imagination, let me offer
                     one further example of that ideology’s emphasis on immateriality. “The cloud” has
                     become a ubiquitous term in the past few years, thanks in no small part to Apple’s
                     honorific christening of its cloud-based service with the obligatory prefixed “i.”
                     Essentially, cloud computing refers to the practice of remotely storing data which
                     can be accessed through a network, as opposed to storing data on a local hard disk
                     (like the one in a personal computer). Apple announced their iCloud service at the
                     Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2011.

                     </div> In the keynote address, Steve Jobs playfully remarked, “Some people think the cloud
                     is just a hard disk in the sky […] We think it’s way more than that, and we call it
                     iCloud.” What distinguished iCloud from other cloud services (such as Dropbox), is
                     that iCloud promised automatically to integrate storage across multiple devices and
                     within various applications without the user having to make such changes actively
                     (in Dropbox, for example, the user stores data through the same logic of files and
                     folders that governs storage on a local disk). iCloud, in the words of Jobs at the
                     keynote, “just works.” The implications for this development meant that computational
                     devices would no longer function primarily as storage receptacles, but rather as access
                     portals to data stored elsewhere and managed largely by someone (or something) else.
                     As Nick Bilton put it on the <em>New York Times’ Bits </em>blog in response to Jobs’s keynote, with iCloud, “Apple is reiterating the irrelevance
                     of the personal computer.” Furthermore, it is forwarding that irrelevance through
                     immaterial rhetoric relating to digital data storage and retrieval.

                  <p>The cloud, then, is a medium that erases its presence, even if we think of ontology
                     in terms of “commands, addresses and data,” as Friedrich Kittler argues we should
                     when concerned with technical media. Doing so eliminates, or at least deemphasizes,
                     the material negotiations behind the transactions that occur between processes, transmission
                     and storage. With cloud computing, for instance, storage still occurs on a physical
                     server somewhere, typically in large data centers like the one Apple is <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.wired.com/2014/04/green-apple/">currently building outside of Reno, Nevada</a> or the recently completed one in Prineville, Oregon, which it built to help accommodate
                     the storage demands of iCloud when it debuted in late 2011. The Oregon storage center
                     neighbors a similar facility owned by Facebook, another company that stores massive
                     amounts of data. Both companies benefit from a recent property tax law passed by the
                     Oregon state legislature (SB 1532), which Senator Mark Haas claims “will allow the
                     state to stay competitive while attracting additional high tech companies to Oregon”

               <p>I focus on the “cloud” here since it is an image invoked frequently in the Romantic
                  period, thanks largely to Luke Howard’s 1803 <em>Essay on the Modifications of Clouds</em>, the basis of our modern cloud classification system. Goethe wrote enthusiastically
                  about Howard’s system, claiming that it “bestow[s] form on the formless and a system
                  of ordered change on the boundless” (qtd. in Slater 120). In a poem praising Howard,
                  Goethe writes that “He grips what cannot be held, cannot be reached, / He is the first
                  to hold it fast” (qtd. in Badt 12). Howard, in other words, connects the material
                  and immaterial realms, and through his systemic model encourages further imaginative
                  insight through aesthetic representation. As John R. Williams writes in his biography
                  of Goethe, the poet saw Howard’s work as demonstrative proof that “the disparate,
                  the inchoate, the ephemeral and the apparently unstable can be grasped, intuited,
                  and shaped by the ‘living gifts’ of the creative imagination” (119). Howard’s accomplishment,
                  according to Goethe, was providing a systematic model through which imaginative thinking
                  could operate on and reveal the matter of clouds. Similar to how digital tools helped
                  my students reorient their understanding of what constitutes digital materiality,
                  Howard’s scientific system enabled the further imaginative understanding of natural
                  phenomena.</p>
               <p>The cloud, which in the Romantic period provides evidence of the imagination’s capacity
                  to act on external matter, gets translated back into a figure of immaterial communication
                  in the rhetoric of digital technology. This turn is unsurprising given the long history
                  of equating Romanticism more largely, and Romantic imagination in particular, with
                  escape from social and material history. Recent scholars on imagination, however,
                  have focused on the way that it operates in relation to materiality. Alexander Schlutz,
                  for example, ascribes imagination’s problematic status in the history of philosophy
                  to its “peculiarly liminal position,” poised between “mind and body, self and world,
                  the ideal and the real” (5). Imagination challenges Enlightenment accounts of subjectivity
                  precisely because of its connection to the senses and the body, and its mediation
                  of the external world to internal understanding. In short, imagination exposes the
                  illusion of “the mind’s freedom and autonomy from the vicissitudes of its physical
                  embodiment” (4). Richard Sha similarly rematerializes imagination by situating it
                  in the context of Romantic-era medical discourse. Sha notes that in Romanticist scholarship,
                  imagination has been long maligned as a tool of ideology, the escapist faculty “on
                  the side of the immateriality of consciousness” (198-9). His argument, however, suggests
                  that imagination held such appeal to the Romantics because it was understood physiologically.
                  Even though medical discourse warned of the imagination’s ability to disease the mind
                  and body, that recognition paradoxically “made unassailable the imagination’s ability
                  to transform matter” (199).</p>

                  <p>What the course’s attention to imagination in new media discourse revealed was that

                              of “the political character of cloud computing” (452). He argues that the ideology
                              of cloud computing offers the ideal of “connectivity with no nodes (or individual
                              subjects), only a shapeless bundle of edges throughout which communication can occur

                     the leaves when laid / In their noon-day dreams” (“The Cloud,” 1, 3-4). Like the iCloud,
                     she has a tenuous materiality, and can “pass through the pores, of the oceans and
                     shores” (75). At the same time, she is “daughter of Earth and Water, / And nursling
                     of the Sky,” and so unites heaven and earth, mind and body (73-4). Like imagination,
                     she mediates between matter and spirit, functioning as a channel through which historical
                     actors can “hold an unremitting interchange / With the clear universe of things around”
                     (“Mont Blanc,” 39-40). In “A Defence of Poetry,” the job of imagination is to manage
                     the “materials of external life” (531), which have been multiplying through developments
                     in science and technology, like the classification of clouds, to the extent that “our
                     calculations have outrun conception; we have eaten more than we can digest” (530).
                     Instead of enabling escape from matter, imagination puts the body and spirit into
                     proper relation to one another. Without the poetic, imaginative power, the “body […]
                     become[s] too unwieldy for that which animates it” (531). For Shelley, language is
                     an originary product of imagination, but the “materials, instruments and conditions
                     of art” give us only secondary access, such that unmediated language is a “mirror
                     which reflects” while expression through physical forms is “as a cloud which enfeebles.”
                     Both unmediated conception and mediated expression, however, whether mirror or cloud,
                     cast rays of light which are “the mediums of communication” (513). Shelley attempts
                     to idealize language, poetry, and imagination apart from matter but keeps returning
                     to the necessity for “portals of expression from the caverns of the spirit” (532).
                     In other words, imagination functions only by manipulating the materials of existence,
                     the dead leaves of thought, the enfeebling clouds that render our calculations conceivable,
                     and of course the texts that come down to us. Even if they fail to some extent, the
                     mediated forms of imagination provide the best and only way to communicate the experience
                     of unmediated imaginative experience. Imagination is such a treasured mode of thought
                     precisely because of its ability to link the realms of mind and matter, spirit and
                     body, innocence and experience, and furthermore to communicate those relations through
                     materialized forms of expression. Perhaps this view of the cloud, and of electronic
                     media more broadly, as a material negotiation between processes, transmission and
                     data storage helps “thicken the medium” (McGann <em>Textual Condition</em> 14) even as it represents itself as the absence of mediation.</p>

                  <p>John Keats’s thoughts on imagination posit it as a similarly mediating force, bridging

                              at work in the world’s atmosphere and bringing about continual changes in its elements
                              offered Keats a useful and suggestive parallel to the operation of the spirit of poetry”
                              (40). Through various chemical metaphors, Sperry claims, “Keats is able to conceive
                              of verse in terms that are substantial and material and, more abstractly, as a kind

                     add a mite to that mass of beauty which is harvested from these grand materials, by
                     the finest spirits, and put into etherial existence for the relish of one’s fellows”

                     </div> The work of poetry involves material processes like harvesting and increasing beauty’s
                     “mass,” while also transforming that material into new forms that hover between mind
                     and matter—the “etherial” things are “relished” in the mind and body. In a playful
                     letter to Benjamin Bailey from a few months earlier, Keats divides “Ethereal things”
                     into three divisions: “Things real—things semireal—and no things” (I, 242-3). Those
                     of the second category, “Love, the Clouds &amp;c […] require a greeting of the Spirit
                     to make them wholly exist.” The sonnet he produces as an elaboration on his ideas
                     represents “the mind of Man” following the progression of seasons, beginning in “lusty
                     spring when fancy clear / Takes in all beauty with an easy span.” Like Coleridge’s
                     distinction between secondary imagination and fancy, Keats puts the next stage of
                     thinking into the creative realm: in summer the mind “chews the honied cud of fair
                     spring thoughts, / Till, in his Soul dissolv’d they come to be / Part of himself”
                     (I, 243). The more active role of imagination is to transform the materials of the
                     external world into a part of the self, understood through the material processes
                     of ingestion and digestion. As Coleridge elaborates his system, quoting from the Elizabethan
                     poet, John Davies, “As we our food into our nature change,” so too does the imagination
                     act upon physical materials (496).</p>

                     anecdote about embodying a sparrow is instructive here: “if a Sparrow come before
                     my Window I take part in its existince and pick about the Gravel.” He means this as
                     an illustration of his constant focus on the present—“nothing startles me beyond the
                     Moment”—but it comes in a letter reflecting on imagination (I, 186). In this letter
                     he makes his well-known comparison of imagination to “Adam’s dream—he awoke and found
                     it truth” (I, 185). Keats also suggests that imagination is the basis for what an
                     afterlife might resemble, or “the redigestion of our most ethereal Musings on Earth”
                     (I, 186). The ability to occupy another body, like the sparrow’s, is a product of
                     imagination as a meeting of spirit and body. The poet fulfills this “negative capability,”
                     of “being in uncertainties” (I, 193) of “continually […] filling some other Body”
                     (I, 387). In this sense we can conceive of Keats’s embodied identity as virtual, as
                     produced through an imaginative relation between experience, thought and sensation.
                     Such virtuality does not erase materiality, but rather revises one’s felt experience
                     of embodiment.

                              are virtual. In Keats all subjects are bodily” (313). His point is that virtual identity
                              comes to be through an embodied experience attuned to “a cognition of what passes
                              in the affective mode of perception” (314). From this perspective, he suggests that
                              for Keats “‘Mind’[…] is not a shelter from the frailties of embodied life; rather,
                              mind could be said to be for Keats always the idea of the body—the body’s changing
                              idea of itself” (315). In his recent book, Multiplying Worlds, Peter Otto proposes

               <p>The imagination, then, as formulated by Shelley and Keats, offers a renewed conception
                  of what it means to inhabit a body in a materially-bound existence. This insight,
                  I realized from my experience teaching about digital culture, could apply as well
                  to how we study new media and to how we ask our students to understand digital tools
                  through classroom practice and critical orientation. Both the concepts and the practices
                  renew our sense of materially embodied experience in the world, which is what digital
                  tools should do for our students—help them come to know the ways in which they live
                  as historical bodies in and of the world. To do so we brought imagination—rendered
                  immaterial in new media discourse—back to matter.</p>

               <p>When we rematerialize imagination through media, we necessarily reimagine texts. In
                  one of his long journal letters to his brother George and sister-in-law Georgiana,
                  Keats writes: <span class="quote">‘our friends say I have altered completely—am not the same person—perhaps in this
                     letter I am for in a letter one takes up one’s existence from the time we last met—I
                     dare say you have altered also—evey man does—Our bodies every seven years are completely
                     fresh-materiald […] We are like the relict garments of a Saint: the same and not the
                     same: for the careful Monks patch it and patch it: till there’s not a thread of the
                     original garment left. (II, 208)’</span> The letter becomes a textual body that Keats fills with his imaginatively produced,
                  virtual identity. And like the physical body continually “fresh-materiald,” or like
                  the holy patchwork garment, the reimagined textual self undergoes transformation through
                  the negotiation of imagination and matter. This recognition disturbs as well as excites.
                  Keats reflects that “’T is an uneasy thought that in seven years the same hands cannot
                  greet each other again” (II, 209), a thought which can potentially threaten the stability
                  of identity. Imagination, however, enables texts (or bodies) to communicate effectively:
                  “All this may be obviated by a willful and dramatic exercise of our Minds towards
                  each other” (II, 209). The imaginative “exercise” of mind relocates embodied identity
                  in the shifting matter of existence: alternatively, in Keats’s formulation, bodies
                  and texts across time and space.</p>

                  <p>In focusing on the imaginary processes Keats links with forms of mediation, I share
                     Yohei Igarashi’s recent contention that “communicative mediation constitutes a significant,
                     although still largely unremarked, concern of Keats’s poetry and letters” (173). And
                     like Igarashi and several other Romanticists writing in the last decade or so, I also
                     conceive of the Romantic era more broadly as crucially shaped and defined by its privileged
                     place in “the history of mediation.”

                              to recover the “ideas” that comprise what Enlightenment is, they propose reassembling
                              the medial transactions employed to convey those ideas, “and thus more readily identify
                              patterns in those interactions” (11). In shifting their focus to Romanticism, Siskin
                              and Warner argue that, understood in relation to their history of mediation, “the

                     media to help us “imagine what we know” about old media, as McGann puts it, borrowing
                     from Shelley.

                              “new media are less points of epistemic rupture than they are socially embedded sites
                              for the ongoing negotiation of meaning as such” (6), Alan Liu suggests more of a bi-directional
                              flow between old and new. He calls for “a poiesis of digital literary studies able
                              to imagine how old and new literary media together allow us to imagine.” My shift
                              is merely to emphasize that the poiesis on display in Romantic-era texts can accomplish
                              similar productive insights about relations between old and new media.</span></div>

                     breadth of early discussions of media,” as James Brooke-Smith describes some of the
                     insights articulated by Kevis Goodman in <em>Georgic Modernity and British Romanticism.</em><div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note21" id="Note21_return"><sup class="super">

                              theory” (4), or “media theory in the absence of a technological media concept,” an
                              intellectual position which would not fully emerge until toward the end of the century
                              (2).</span></div>
                     </div> Celeste Langan and Maureen McLane locate in Romantic poetry such a sophisticated sensitivity
                     to issues of mediation that they posit, “Romantic poetry might even serve as a synonym
                     for what we mean by multimedia” (239). My experience of teaching new media suggested
                     to me a similar reversal of the usual linear narratives of media history. As Siegfried
                     Zielinski poses the issue in calling for a media archaeological method: “do not seek
                     the old in the new, but find something new in the old” (3). To do so requires an openness
                     to being in uncertainty about Romanticism and the history of mediation. My ultimate
                     contention, then, is that the materiality of the Romantic imagination is that of a
                     medium. Mediums imagine for us, and we imagine through them. Imagination communicates
                     between mind and body, matter and spirit, and by doing so makes possible the affects
                     of aesthetic experience that come through material forms like texts. Writing about
                     Keats’s “La Belle Dame,” McGann claims that “Romantic imagination emerges with the
                     birth of an historical sense, which places the poet, and then the reader, at a critical
                     distance from the poem’s materials” (<em>Romantic Ideology</em> 79). By “materials” McGann means the ballad and romance traditions, mythological figures,
                     and the particular perspective through which Keats revives them. I would add that
                     the imagination emerges with a self-consciousness about the poem’s physical materials,
                     its production, and the distance between conception, expression and reception. In
                     imagining what a medium can do, Romantic writers mine the ontology of media, always
                     aware in the end of the ineluctable limitations of communication. As Alexander Galloway,
                     Eugene Thacker, and McKenzie Wark argue in their collaborative volume: “Every communication
                     evokes a possible excommunication that would instantly annul it. Every communication
                     harbors the dim awareness of an excommunication that is prior to it, that conditions
                     it and makes it all the more natural” (10). For the Romantic writers, mediums function
                     when they fail, as with Keats’s claim that in our embodied and textual forms, “We
                     are like the relict garments of a Saint: the same and not the same” or Shelley's recognition
                     that we necessarily rely on imperfect “portals of expression from the caverns of the
                     spirit.” In an era of perpetual triumphalism for each new and improved shiny happy
                     media machine, perhaps we need now to look to broken forms, dysfunctional devices,
                     and the faultures of other decrepit things.</p>
               </div>
               <p>I’d like to conclude by sharing a final example of student work from the course, since
                  this student demonstrated the kind of knowing, critical playfulness toward the history
                  of mediation that can help to rematerialize our relation to the digital, and especially
                  since he embraced the breaking points of media. I’ll call this student “Neo” since
                  he was writing about <em>The Matrix</em> (1999) and showed some programming skill. As described above, the assignment asked
                  students to write a comparison paper about two texts from different media, and to
                  use multiple media forms in their papers. To meet the latter criteria, many students
                  creatively employed video and image in their papers (as with the screenshots of <em>Google Variations</em> mentioned earlier). For his multimedia component, Neo wrote a computer program. He
                  gave me instructions on how to compile the Java program on my computer, and when I
                  eventually managed it, it produced the following. (Figure 2).</p>
               <figure class="figure"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/pedagogies/romantic_education/images/rej_image2Thumb.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing the narrative produced by my student’s Java program." class="inline" style=" width:15.24cm; height:15.432272222222222cm;"/></figure>
               <p>Fig. 2 A screenshot showing the narrative produced by my student’s Java program.</p>
               <p>The program asks you to enter your name, and once you do, it produces this narrative,
                  inspired by and loosely adapted from <em>The Matrix</em>. A mysterious figure offers you truth in the form of a red pill. Prompted again to
                  type “red” of “blue,” the input “red” outputs the rudimentary image of a book, with
                  Neo’s essay title on it. The final line of the narrative reads: “The figure hands
                  you an old dusty book with a beaten spine. ‘Read,’ he says. ‘Read and be free.’” The
                  program that has produced the narrative, also produces the content of the essay, the
                  “book” that will lead to freedom. After the introductory narrative, the program outputs
                  the entire essay text. (Figure 3).</p>

               <p>With this creative representation, Neo recognized his remediated paper as part of
                  a history of mediation. The green text on black screen recalls an earlier era in computing,
                  inspired by <em>The Matrix</em>’s popularization of the green on black image, while the textual interface gestures
                  toward text adventure games, or interactive fiction. The presence of his paper in
                  the metafiction as “an old dusty book,” both suggests that old media continue to hold
                  value (precisely because of their anachronism), and belies the separation of old and
                  new (since the old book is being delivered simultaneously as Word document and script
                  in a Java program). But even more significantly, as Neo wrote in his instructions
                  to me, “the original manifestation of the piece [the essay as a word document with
                  all its formatting details] is limited by the ASCII interpretation by the specific
                  computer.” As a result, before the essay text is a long string of unreadable characters
                  (for instance, “{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf1038\cocoasubrtf350…”). These characters
                  fail to signify to (most) human eyes, but also to the Terminal program, which cannot
                  render the formatting instructions from Word into sensible form, and instead leaves
                  them as inert code. Neo’s insight reminds us that all electronic media are not one,
                  that we continue to experience new media through engagements with the old, and that
                  the material specificities of such engagements can be rendered visible through informed
                  representation. The mediated, mediating Romantic imagination, which appears so frequently
                  disembodied in the evolution of digital discourse, can help us see the materials that
                  make up that history.</p>

         </div>
         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">I’d like to thank the students of my course for all the enthusiasm and insight they
               brought to our investigations of digital culture. Their hard work helped shape my
               thinking in ways that I couldn’t have imagined beforehand. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">While my focus in this essay rests on how these issues played out in the classroom
               (and how that experience subsequently helped me see anew the connections between my
               scholarship and pedagogy), I’m indebted to the work of several other scholars who
               have imagined various digital futures for Romanticism through their practices. I’m
               thinking of course of the many digital resources, like <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/"><em>The Blake Archive</em></a> and <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.nines.org/"><em>NINES</em></a>, that have invigorated nineteenth-century scholarship in the digital era. But also
               I have in mind work like Paul Youngquist’s playful and incisive “Techno-Prosthetic
               Romantic Futurism,” an essay in the mold of hypertext fiction, in which he suggests,
               among other things, imagining <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.erudit.org/projspec/article/013157ar/950.html">“criticism of Romanticism as a field of digital possibility,”</a> a realm where the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.erudit.org/projspec/article/013157ar/190.html">hacker is the hero of “digital resistance” just as the Romantics hacked textuality
                  before the advent of cyberspace</a>. Similarly compelling is Andrew Stauffer’s insistence that, in the digitizing and
               archiving of nineteenth-century texts, we ought to “use the digital environment not
               to supplant the paper record, but to develop a more nuanced critical method for understanding
               the physical forms and features of the papers that the Romantics left behind” (17).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">McGann’s argument in 1983 that Romanticist scholarship suffered from “an uncritical
               absorption in Romanticism’s own self-representations” (1) transfers remarkably well
               to the realm of media studies. Kirschenbaum was not the first to resist such uncritical
               absorption in the context of new media. For instance, a decade prior, Katherine Hayles
               attempted as much by identifying and challenging what she calls an “ideology of disembodiment”
               which has its roots in early communications theory and computational practices. She
               contends that “[t]he body’s dematerialization depends in complex and highly specific
               ways on the <em>embodied</em> circumstances that an ideology of dematerialization would obscure” (193). Kirschenbaum
               extends the work of recapturing embodied circumstances by focusing on the forensic
               level of digital materiality (i.e. down to the bit level of the hard drive) as well
               as the formal level of its appearance in various software and hardware configurations
               (i.e. a blinking cursor on the screen).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Jonathan Zittrain uses the term “tethered devices” to refer to products like smartphones,
               iPods, and gaming consoles, the uses of which are restricted by the companies that
               produce them (as opposed to personal computers, which users can open, modify, and
               install third-party software on without the parent company’s approval). Zittrain argues
               that the prevalence of such devices will enact “a wholesale shift of our information
               ecosystem away from generativity” (102) and towards greater control (from regulators,
               the hardware companies, service providers, etc.). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">For most of its existence, YouTube’s title (as displayed in the title bar of a web
               browser) has read “YouTube – Broadcast Yourself.” After October 24, 2012, the title
               appears only as “YouTube.” As the site’s emphasis has shifted from producing to consuming,
               the devaluing of individuals doing the “broadcasting” by and of themselves is unsurprising.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">This recognition is similar to McGann’s point about the theoretical and conceptual
               value gained from encoding literary texts into digital environments: “Because our
               computer tools are models of what we imagine we know—they’re built to our specifications—when
               they show us what they know they are reporting ourselves back to us” (<em>Radiant Textuality</em> 143).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">McGann offers another useful model for this approach to textuality, when he writes,
               in <em>Radiant Textuality</em>, that “Any given textual form represents a complex set of transactional codes written
               for simultaneous and/or sequential execution” (150).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">This kind of rhetoric has only increased as cloud computing has become increasingly
               prevalent in the past few years. A more recent example can be found in <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.wired.com/2013/11/software-is-reorganizing-the-world-and-cloud-formations-could-lead-to-physical-nations/">Balaji Srinivasan’s opinion piece in <em>Wired</em></a>, in which he writes, sounding rather like Barlow in 1996, “With our bodies hemmed
               in, our minds have only the cloud—and it is the cloud that has become the destination
               for an extraordinary mental exodus.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">With “forensic materiality,” Kirschenbaum refers to the material changes wrought at
               the level of “micron-sized residue of digital inscription,” and at the human-readable
               level, as with “the contours of the keyboard and mouse that make their bodily marks
               felt in the ongoing pandemic of repetitive strain and white-collar work injuries”
               (10-11). “Formal materiality” refers to “the imposition of multiple relational computational
               states on a data set or digital object” (12). In other words, formal materiality includes
               not only the digital object, but also data about the object (for instance, data that
               indicates to a particular piece of software how the object will be presented to the
               user). Kirschenbaum’s aim is to move away from what Nick Montfort terms “screen essentialism,”
               and instead to analyze new media through the formal processes that naturalize digital
               objects at their visible instantiations (31). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">Since the original roll-out of iCloud in fall 2011, the visual design has changed
               (along with other Apple visual interface designs), leaving behind the emphasis on
               the cold aluminum for a seemingly more warm and inviting sky-blue logo. The original
               images discussed here can be viewed via the <a class="link_ref" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110808042738/http://www.apple.com/icloud/features/photo-stream.html">Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine</a>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">Coinciding with Earth Day in April 2014, Apple began a new <a class="link_ref" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140729215146/https://www.apple.com/environment/">ad campaign called “Better,”</a> which aims to highlight its commitments to environmental responsibility. Part of
               the media rollout included <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.today.com/video/today/55025951#55025951">a story on <em>Today</em></a> showing a tour of the company’s Maiden, NC data center, touted for running entirely
               on solar energy gathered on site. As Steven Levy points out, 98% of Apple’s carbon
               footprint comes from its manufacturing processes, so its self-congratulatory publicity
               (“We’re still the only company in our industry whose data centers are powered by 100
               percent renewable energy” [“Apple—Environmental Responsibility”]) ought to be viewed
               skeptically. In (perhaps cynically) drawing attention to this fact, I admit exhibiting
               symptoms of what Timothy Morton calls “beautiful soul syndrome” (140-150), particularly
               given that, since 2007, I have owned two MacBooks, three iPhones, and one iPad. Following
               Morton’s argument, I hope to resist said syndrome by recognizing that Apple’s carbon
               footprint is my carbon footprint, and that in order to act with environmental responsibility,
               we must dive deeper into the acceptance of our own intimate culpability for the ongoing
               ecological catastrophe.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">14. </span><span class="noteBody">Seb Franklin similarly approaches the cloud as medium, as a figure that “oscillate[s]
               between the realms of transcendent ethereality and complex materiality,” in his reading
               of “the political character of cloud computing” (452). He argues that the ideology
               of cloud computing offers the ideal of “connectivity with no nodes (or individual
               subjects), only a shapeless bundle of edges throughout which communication can occur
               and thus be captured, parsed, measured, and defined. The ubiquitous, immaterial connectivity
               and processing emblematized by cloud computing promises mediation, but of what? It
               promises nothing less than to mediate the entirety of the social through the indifferent
               logic of computation” (461). Srinivasan’s article in <em>Wired</em>, mentioned above, represents a good example of a celebratory version of that imagined
               future; in his formulation, the cloud becomes an immaterial space for utopian social
               and political reorganization.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               as an important reference point for Keats: “The notion of an ethereal matter forever
               at work in the world’s atmosphere and bringing about continual changes in its elements
               offered Keats a useful and suggestive parallel to the operation of the spirit of poetry”
               (40). Through various chemical metaphors, Sperry claims, “Keats is able to conceive
               of verse in terms that are substantial and material and, more abstractly, as a kind
               of supernatural energy” (51).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note18"><span class="noteLabel">18. </span><span class="noteBody">Jonathan Mulrooney makes these seemingly contradictory claims: “In Keats all subjects
               are virtual. In Keats all subjects are bodily” (313). His point is that virtual identity
               comes to be through an embodied experience attuned to “a cognition of what passes
               in the affective mode of perception” (314). From this perspective, he suggests that
               for Keats “‘Mind’[…] is not a shelter from the frailties of embodied life; rather,
               mind could be said to be for Keats always the idea of the body—the body’s changing
               idea of itself” (315). In his recent book, <em>Multiplying Worlds</em>, Peter Otto proposes a different version of Romantic subjectivity in relation to
               theories of the virtual. He argues that Romantic visual culture “suggested that reality
               itself was an indeterminate combination of the actual and virtual,” thereby creating
               a space in which the viewer could construct a self in relation to those interlacing
               actual and virtual realms (15). Otto, like Mulrooney, maintains the significance of
               embodied experience in this process, though he emphasizes the social, commercial element

         <div class="note" id="Note19"><span class="noteLabel">19. </span><span class="noteBody">In the introduction to <em>This is Enlightenment</em>, Siskin and Warner offer the “history of mediation” as an alternative approach to
               the “history of ideas.” Instead of seeking to recover the “ideas” that comprise what
               Enlightenment is, they propose reassembling the medial transactions employed to convey
               those ideas, “and thus more readily identify patterns in those interactions” (11).
               In shifting their focus to Romanticism, Siskin and Warner argue that, understood in
               relation to their history of mediation, “the Romantic subject is the self on the platform
               of Enlightenment” (“What Is Romanticism?” 288). In short, “Enlightenment is an event
               in the history of mediation,” which involves radical transformations in “cardinal
               mediations,” including infrastructure (postal system, coffee houses), genres and formats
               (periodical essays, magazines), practices (clubs, societies), and protocols (copyright,
               publishing practices) (“This Is Enlightenment” 1, 12-15). The Romantic subject, then,
               comes into being by operating on the platform that these mediations establish.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note19_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note20"><span class="noteLabel">20. </span><span class="noteBody">McGann argues as much in <em>Radiant Textuality</em>. Drawing on Lisa Gitelman’s argument that “new media are less points of epistemic
               rupture than they are socially embedded sites for the ongoing negotiation of meaning
               as such” (6), Alan Liu suggests more of a bi-directional flow between old and new.
               He calls for “a <span class="foreign">poiesis</span> of digital literary studies able to imagine how old and new literary media together
               allow us to imagine.” My shift is merely to emphasize that the <span class="foreign">poiesis</span> on display in Romantic-era texts can accomplish similar productive insights about
               relations between old and new media.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note20_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               can find in the work of William Wordsworth and Charles Babbage a “media-less media
               theory” (4), or “media theory in the absence of a <em>technological</em> media concept,” an intellectual position which would not fully emerge until toward
               the end of the century (2).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note21_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
