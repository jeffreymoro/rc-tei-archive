            <p class="noCount">This article examines the connection between Tom Wedgwood’s pedagogical theories and
               his materialist theories of mind, which emphasized the importance of emotion in character
               formation. Wedgwood hoped to open an experimental school for infants with the goal
               of producing a generation of politically radical geniuses. This article situates Wedgwood’s
               ideas within the context of Romantic theories of cognition, debates about the mind-body
               relationship, and social reform, and points to a growing trend that connected bodily
               health and moral virtue. It argues for the significance of his largely ignored or
               undervalued contributions to Romantic thinking about the mind, body, and education.

               <p>Tom Wedgwood is commonly relegated to a footnote in the more fascinating histories
                  of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth. Aside from a few admiring late
                  nineteenth and early twentieth-century accounts of his brief life by members of the
                  extended family, there is but a smattering of scholarship that examines his role in
                  the intellectual circles in which he moved.

                  </div> Beginning with David Erdman’s two-part series “Coleridge, Wordsworth, and the Wedgwood
                  Fund,” published in 1956, critics generally examine Wedgwood’s relationship with Coleridge
                  and Wordsworth. For example, Erdman credits Wedgwood with influencing the shape of <em>The Prelude</em>’s exploration of the relationship between childhood experiences and the development
                  of genius, a topic that Wedgwood’s pedagogical plan takes up. Even if Wordsworth found
                  Wedgwood’s ideas about education so repugnant that he struck off in the opposite direction,
                  “Tom’s educational Plan had a stimulating effect on his thinking” (Erdman I: 434).
                  Erdman also discusses Wedgwood’s role in convincing his brother Josiah to provide
                  half of the 150₤ annuity that freed Coleridge from becoming a Unitarian minister and
                  enabled him to pursue a career in poetry and metaphysics.</p>
            </div>
            <p>With varying degrees of sympathy, scholars such as Francis Doherty (1987), Neil Vickers
               (1999, 2001), and John Beer (2001, 2010) look at Wedgwood’s influence on Coleridge’s
               “abstruse research” (“Dejection” 89). Each examines him as “a shaping force in Coleridge’s
               intellectual development” (Vickers 90), but not as a significant contributor to the
               critical conversations in which Wedgwood participated. To my knowledge, Francis À
               Court’s “<em>Magnifique, mais ce n’est pas Daguerre</em>: Some Notes on the Life of Tom Wedgwood” (2003) is the only contemporary account
               that presents Wedgwood’s life as a whole, viewing his relationship to Coleridge and
               Wordsworth as just one part of a bigger picture. He argues that to historians of the
               Wedgwoods—an interesting family in its own right—“Tom’s chief interest lies in his
               exceptional gifts as a scientist, and they tend to speculate on what he <em>might </em>have achieved, had he not been ill, rather than with his <em>actual</em> connection with Coleridge” (79). From my perspective, his relationship with these
               two poets is an important aspect of his history, but his contribution the debates
               about cognition and about educational practice, particularly the way in which he combined
               these two interests, is just as intriguing. Consequently, Tom Wedgwood’s role in the
               intellectual history of the early Romantic period deserves closer scrutiny.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Wedgwood’s intellectual energies were divided between two issues that preoccupied
                  many Romantic thinkers—the workings of the human mind and theories of education. “Education,”
                  Alan Richardson claims, “was one of the most hotly contested and frequently discussed
                  topics of [. . .] the Romantic age” (2). Yet, Beer characterizes Wedgwood’s participation
                  in this discussion as a simple obsession with the latest craze. He argues that Wedgwood
                  was under “the strong hold of the necessitarian doctrines of the day, and the rage
                  for educational experiments” (Beer 26). This account of Wedgwood’s theoretical commitments,
                  with its use of terms such as “the rage” and “fashionable,” implies that his interest
                  in these subjects was uncritical, nothing more than a desire to fit in with his friends.
                  Wedgwood, in this view, is not seen as a serious thinker in his own right, but as
                  a hanger-on who spouted the modish opinions of the day, presumably because of his
                  dearth of original thought. While not all critics dismiss Wedgwood, the general consensus
                  can be summed up by two comments by Beer. The first is that Wedgwood needed to be
                  “argued into a subtler view of the human mind, no longer taking for granted the fashionable
                  doctrine of its explicability simply through the association of ideas” (Beer 27).
                  In other words, Wedgwood is nothing more than a jejune associationist. Second, Beer
                  claims that it is impossible to determine if Wedgwood had any original thought because
                  he left no published corpus. He gives little credence to Wedgwood’s ideas, which are,
                  admittedly, difficult to access in their fragmented and incomplete form.

                  </div> While James Mackintosh, the Scottish lawyer and Wedgwood’s brother-in-law, was ostensibly
                  helping him prepare a manuscript of metaphysical speculations in 1802, it was not
                  completed by the time Wedgwood died. According to various letters, Coleridge was also
                  involved in this project, having committed to write “a preface on the history of metaphysical
                  opinions” (Beer 29).

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>On 19 February 1802, Coleridge wrote to Thomas Poole that he was “finishing the History
                           of the opinions concerning Space &amp; Time for Mackintosh” (CL II: 787). Earlier that
                           month Southey informed William Taylor that Wedgwood was working on a book with Mackintosh
                           as “the man midwife” (qtd. in Beer 29).</span></div>
                  </div> After Wedgwood’s death, his brother Jos charged Mackintosh and Coleridge with publishing
                  his brother’s legacy posthumously. He asked Mackintosh to complete the manuscript
                  for publication and Coleridge to write Wedgwood’s biography. Both men, we know, were
                  afflicted with the same character flaw—procrastination—and neither produced what he
                  had promised. Thus, Wedgwood’s substantial but unorganized archive of notebooks was
                  never synthesized into publishable form. “In the absence of this promised work,” Beer
                  asserts, “it remains hard to say exactly what was distinctive about Tom Wedgwood’s
                  ideas” (30). I disagree with this assessment of his work.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Though Wedgwood’s work remains largely unpublished and somewhat fragmentary, it is
               distinctive because of the way in which he applied his cognitive theories to his educational
               programme. Where critics such as Beer or Vickers might characterize his views in terms
               of a “naïve commitment to the idea of man as machine” (Vickers 89), I claim that Wedgwood’s
               pedagogical plan is worthy of notice because it is based on his materialist theories
               of cognition. Wedgwood was not a mere neophyte who mindlessly parroted the “fashionable
               doctrines” of the day (Beer 27), but put thought into his metaphysical researches.
               He used a methodology similar to Coleridge’s (or perhaps Coleridge used a methodology
               similar to his) that involved self-scrutiny, sensory experiments such as those proposed
               by Erasmus Darwin in <em>Zoonomia</em> (1794), and observation of his nieces and nephews in their infancy and early childhood.</p>
            <p>Wedgwood participated in a vibrant intellectual community that included not only the
               poets, but men of science, such as Darwin, Thomas Beddoes, and Humphry Davy, all of
               whom were interested in embodied theories of cognition as well as theories of education.
               He corresponded with William Godwin and, through him, was in contact with Mary Wollstonecraft.
               He was also related by marriage to the Edgeworths, who are known for <em>Practical Education</em> (1798). Many of these figures, like Wedgwood, were interested in applying Hartley’s
               associationist ideas to education. Yet, Wedgwood’s theories go further in some respects
               because they are predicated on his own research and reading, which extend beyond Hartley’s
               <em>Observations on Man</em> (1749). “[R]aised in the laboratories of his father’s potteries in Etruria” (Beer
               26), Wedgwood was a scientific-minded young man who turned his attention to the concerns
               that interested his mentors, peers, and, indeed, many thinkers—cognitive science and
               education. His carefully reasoned application of the principles of materialist cognition
               to the education of children as a way to usher in a new era of political justice is
               a significant contribution to intellectual history, even if, like Jeremy Bentham’s
               panopticon, it was never implemented.</p>
            <p>In this article, my goal is to explicate Tom Wedgwood’s cognitive theory and to situate
               it within the larger context of the late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century
               mind-matter debates. In doing so, I draw on archival material as well as on the snippets
               of his work that have been published by scholars and by family members. I also interrogate
               the relationship between his theory of mind and his pedagogical programme, showing
               how the former led into and buttressed the latter. Wedgwood’s work is significant
               because it gathered together several strands of Romantic philosophical thought, from
               Hartley’s theory of association (divested of its theology) to Godwin’s doctrine of
               perfectibility, in an attempt to formulate a practical plan of education that would
               bring about a society of geniuses committed to the principles of liberty, equality,
               communitarian values, and social justice. It was, as Wedgwood wrote to Godwin, his
               “master stroke which should anticipate a century or two upon the large-paced progress
               of human improvement” (qtd. in Erdman I: 430). </p>
            <p>Though an associationist and a committed materialist, he did not unquestioningly adhere
               to Hartley’s theories, as Beer and Vickers suggest. In addition to his own insights,
               derived from observations of himself and others, he took into account the materialist
               theories of cognition advanced by Darwin and, to an extent, Davy. These theories posit
               an active mind in contrast to Hartley’s theory (and Locke’s before him) that advances
               an empirical account of the mind that is necessarily passive, “a lazy Lookeron on
               an external World” (Coleridge, <em>CL</em> II: 709). Similar to Darwin, he saw free will as circumscribed, yet Wedgwood’s pedagogical
               plan has some depth. Unlike those who adopted “the new rational approach to education,
               with its emphasis on method and factual knowledge” (Richardson 4), Wedgwood was primarily
               concerned with educating the mind by educating the body. He emphasized the importance
               of feeling, which for him was an embodied phenomenon, in educating infants into well-adjusted,
               emotionally stable adults (in contrast to Coleridge and himself).</p>
            <p>Wedgwood was interested in ameliorating the human condition, and with the receipt
               of “a considerable trust” inherited from his father, the famous potter, he thought
               that an experimental school would prove to be “the most profitable mode of beneficial
               expenditure” (qtd. in Erdman I: 430). Aside from the vast fortune, in this respect
               he was no different than Coleridge or Davy, both of whom had outlined educational
               plans designed to produce a particular type of enlightened being. Yet, though Coleridge
               was, for a time, considering opening a school as a means of supporting his family
               (a plan that was put to rest when the Wedgwoods convinced him to take the unencumbered
               annuity), neither he nor Davy developed their plans as thoroughly and in as much detail
               as Wedgwood. So, where many critics dismiss Wedgwood as unoriginal, significant only
               in respect to his connection to Coleridge and Wordsworth, I contend that his application
               of materialist cognitive theory to education offers insight into both Romantic period
               debates and brings to light new connections between Romantic cognitive science and
               theories of education.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Tom Wedgwood’s interest in theories of cognition, I argue, was not merely the result
                     of his intellectual environment, but also driven by his personal torment. He suffered
                     from a mysterious illness for most of his life, a life characterized by “ceaseless
                     struggle with bodily suffering” (Litchfield 91). His pain was “so severe that he would
                     sometimes throw himself to the ground screaming” (Wedgwood and Wedgwood 101). Scrawled

                     </div> This brief, undated observation reveals the way in which Wedgwood conceived of the
                     mind-body relationship and gives us a glimpse into his theory of cognition. For Wedgwood,
                     mental well-being and bodily health were intimately and inextricably connected. He
                     was convinced that his physical ailments were directly caused by his poor mental state,
                     which he characterized as a “wavering &amp; superficial examination of future urgencies
                     &amp; conducts” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40-28515/14), or to put it more simply, an unhealthy
                     obsession with the future. Influenced by his father’s Lunar Society friends, who held
                     varying versions of Hartley’s Doctrine of Association, Wedgwood saw his mental state
                     not as a bad attitude, but as the result of bad habits.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>According to Associationism, ideas in the mind are formed by concurring bodily sensations.
                     These sensations become associated with ideas, either linearly or in clusters, such
                     that they are able to be recalled even in the absence of the original objects or stimuli.
                     For example, if a person sees or hears a bird chirping in a tree the objects will
                     associate together in the mind. Consequently, any time that person hears (or sees)
                     a bird, she will automatically think of a tree. In this way, objects, experiences,
                     and ideas connect in trains that are later recalled and remembered together. Despite
                     its long history beginning with Aristotle, Association rose to prominence in the eighteenth
                     and nineteenth centuries through Locke’s fourth edition of <em>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em> (1700), Hume’s <em>A Treatise of Human Nature</em> (1739), and Hartley’s <em>Observations</em>.

                     first introduced to the theory by his father’s forward-thinking friends. He grew up
                     in a progressive environment under an educational plan designed by Darwin, an Associationist
                     and founder of the Lunar Society (Meteyard 18). Primarily men of science and industry,
                     members of this informal group met monthly to discuss their latest theories, ideas,
                     and experiments. The theories debated by his father’s friends posited the mind as
                     an embodied, material phenomenon rather than an attribute of an immaterial soul. In
                     addition to Darwin, Joseph Priestley was particularly interested in theories of cognition.</p>

                  <p>Priestley, a noted physicist, chemist, theologian, Dissenting clergyman, and most

                     when he was a student at Davenport Academy.

                              Priestley was a Unitarian. Dissenters, Hartley included, were barred from becoming
                              clergy in the Anglican Church because they refused to subscribe to the Thirty-Nine
                              Articles.</span></div>
                     </div> Where Locke’s account of association remains largely unconcerned with the role of
                     the body in cognition, Hartley explicitly addresses the reciprocity between body and
                     mind. <em>Observations</em> offers a detailed physiological account of Locke’s theory that proposes the Doctrine
                     of Vibrations as a method of neural transduction, that is, the way in which the body
                     converts sensory stimuli into neural signals that are communicated to the brain and
                     nervous system. Priestley popularized Hartley’s work by publishing <em>Hartley’s Theory of Mind </em>(1775), an abridged edition that omitted the theory of vibrations and the entire second
                     volume in which Hartley explained the theological implications of his theory. As Priestley
                     recognized, and I agree, the most significant and radical part of Hartley’s theory
                     is its materialist account of cognition that locates the mind in the body. Priestley
                     used Hartley’s observation that physical substances, such as “Poisons, spirituous
                     Liquors, Opiates, Fevers, Blows upon the Head <em>&amp;c.</em> all plainly affect the Mind” (Hartley 9), to argue for materialist monism, both in
                     the prefatory essays to Hartley’s work and in his own <em>Disquisitions Relating to Matter and Spirit</em> (1777).</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Wedgwood’s notebooks indicate that he was familiar with “Priestley’s Hartley, including
                     the memorable injunction to Philosophers” and may also have read the first volume
                     of <em>Observations</em> (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). He boasts in 1796 that “without having read Hartley
                     [...] [i]t is a considerable confirmation of many of my observations formed from the
                     closest scrutiny of my own changes of state, that they coincide very exactly with
                     many of the most important ones of this author” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451).
                     Upon reading Hartley, it seems, Wedgwood found confirmation for the conclusions he
                     had drawn based on self-observation of his emotional and physical states. This memo
                     is followed by some notes on Hartley and a list of other philosophers (including Hume,
                     Berkeley, and Locke), which give us some idea of his reading during this period. Yet,
                     the fact that Wedgwood was familiar with materialist theories of cognition “without
                     having read Hartley” indicates how widespread these ideas were amongst a certain segment
                     of the English reading public. This was due in no small part to Priestley, who sparked
                     the mind-matter debates that raged throughout the Romantic period.

               <p>Traditionalists and conservatives reacted violently against Hartley’s and Priestley’s
                  materialist theories, in part because the thinkers who held these views tended to
                  be political radicals who supported the ideals of the French Revolution. More importantly,
                  though, Hartley’s theory threatened neo-Platonic Christian doctrine by dissolving
                  the mind-body dichotomy and abolishing free will by making association an entirely
                  passive process. While many people found the idea of the passive mind repugnant, men
                  such as Priestley and Darwin did not. Rather than turning away from materialism altogether,
                  Darwin accepted the basic premise of Hartley’s and Priestley’s theories—that cognition
                  is an embodied, physiological, process—and attempted to formulate a more active account
                  of the mind than theirs provided.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Prior to reading Hartley, Wedgwood had already read <em>Zoonomia</em>, which offers Darwin’s account of neural transduction. Trying to overcome the mental
                     passivity inherent in the Doctrine of Vibrations, Darwin theorized that the body produces
                     a substance that he called “the spirit of animation or sensorial power” that translates
                     sensory stimuli into mental ideas (61). He uses these two terms interchangeably, and
                     while “spirit of animation” seems to imply an immaterial principle, Darwin clearly
                     identifies this mutable and highly active substance as a “secretion” of “the brain
                     and spinal marrow” (57).

                     </div> That is, sensorial power is an organic substance produced by the body, making cognition
                     a decidedly material phenomenon. As a medical practitioner, Darwin was not interested
                     in the philosophical debate about materialism and dualism. Instead, like Wedgwood,
                     he wanted to discover how the mind and body affected each other for practical purposes,
                     so that he could better diagnose and treat disease. In fact, <em>Zoonomia</em> is a two-volume nosology that offers a systematic theory of how to treat bodily and
                     mental disorders based on Darwin’s organic theory of mind. Significantly, in contrast
                     to his predecessors’ theories, Darwin’s model is not based on mechanical principles.
                     Rather, he posits a mind that obeys the laws of organic life. That is, the mind, in
                     his view, is subject to the same laws as all other animate matter, but these laws
                     are substantively different than Newton’s laws of physics, which govern the inanimate
                     world.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>While critics are correct to trace Wedgwood’s ideas back to Hartley, in fact, Darwin
                     had a greater influence. Wedgwood believed that the principles of the human mind could
                     be explained by the Doctrine of Association, but he did not uncritically accept Hartley’s
                     passive account, as Beer and Vickers assert. He acknowledged that “Association” was
                     “one of the original principles of mechanical Philosophy,” but thought that it was
                     “perhaps capable of resolution into other principles which are already presumed as
                     indispensible” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). These “other principles” refer
                     to Darwin’s laws of organic life. Wedgwood accepted that “the activity, the versatility
                     of the mind” was “deducible from the principle laid down by Darwin as the origin of
                     all muscular motion” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). Though Wedgwood occasionally
                     referred to the mind as “yet a mere transcript” that is “formed by external circumstances
                     alone, without ever [. . .] exercising any volition in adapting itself to them” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                     Collection E40–28476A), for the most part he seemed to follow Darwin's account.

                              and undated. In the quoted passage, which is just a few jotted notes, he was considering
                              “pure reasoning” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28476A). His stance seemed to be that
                              the mind begins as a “mere transcript” and becomes active as it develops. This difficulty
                              determining which views represent Wedgwood’s most developed or recent line of thought
                              is part of the problem of working with archival material.</span></div>
                     </div> Darwin's theory of cognition is an interesting mix of Hartleyean Associationism and
                     his own organic principles. While he saw the mind as active, he still considered free
                     will to be circumscribed by external circumstances.</p>
               </div>
               <p>It appears, then, that Wedgwood viewed cognition as an organic, active process, but
                  not a process that is entirely unconstrained, as in dualist theories of the mind.
                  He believed, in keeping with his materialist approach, that human beings are subject
                  “to simple and universal laws” (Doherty 309), like any other natural object. His driving
                  passion in the first several years of his adulthood was to answer the question: “From
                  how few &amp; how simple original principles can all the functions of the Mind be derived?”(V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                  Collection E40–28515/107). He wanted, like many of his peers, to discover the routines,
                  procedures, and details of the mind’s physiological functioning, not least so that
                  he could understand himself and his ailments better and, hopefully, to rectify his
                  miserable physical and mental condition.</p>
               <p>The physical fact of Wedgwood’s suffering, along with his early exposure to radical
                  theories of mind, motivated him to pursue research into the materialist theories of
                  cognition that were being advanced by late eighteenth-century thinkers. If the cornerstone
                  of this empirical theory is that a person’s character is a direct result of his or
                  her habits, the good news for Wedgwood was that habit could be changed. Human beings,
                  according to Hartley, “have a Power of suiting our Frame of Mind to our Circumstances,
                  of correcting what is amiss, and improving what is right” (Hartley 84). This must
                  have given Wedgwood hope, at least in the early years, that his miserable physical
                  and mental condition could be reversed. In the undated note that lists the physical
                  pains that he attributed to his mental state, Wedgwood resolves to stop worrying about
                  the future. He vowed to “Give myself over the present moment—Oh grand, inestimable
                  secret of human happiness!!” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40-28515/14). This exclamation
                  indicates his mental plan of action. Physically, he resolved to “Still the rising
                  tumult—Press down the throbbing heart” and to “Practise this with unshaken constancy”
                  (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40-28515/14). For Wedgwood understanding the mind-body connection
                  and how to influence it was an immensely personal concern. It was also a concern that
                  was deeply intertwined with emotional feeling. Association, according to Wedgwood,
                  is not just a process whereby sensations are linked together to create trains of ideas.
                  It is a process by which pleasurable or painful sensations are joined together to
                  create ideas that are associated with particular feelings. Cognition, in Wedgwood’s
                  view, is an emotionally charged, embodied process.</p>

                  <p>One of Wedgwood’s most significant contributions to Romantic cognitive science was
                     the elaboration of the relationship between emotion, cognition, and association. Wedgwood
                     qualifies and extends materialist theories of cognition, building on those advanced
                     by Hartley and Priestley, by considering the role of affective feeling in the process
                     of association. In setting out their terminology, both Hartley and Priestley equate
                     ideas with feeling. Hartley states that “<em>Sensations</em> are those Feelings of the Mind, which arise from the Impressions made by external
                     Objects on the several parts of our Bodies. All our other internal Feelings may be
                     called <em>Ideas</em>” (ii). Likewise, Priestley claims that ideas, no matter how abstract, are “<em>mental feelings</em>, occasioned by the impression of external objects” (xliv). For the most part, Hartley
                     and Priestley use the term <em>feeling</em> to refer to “experiences such as touch as when we appreciate the shape or texture
                     of an object,” rather than to affective experience (Damasio 3).

                              to reunion with God. Pleasure and pain are, thus, important to his theory of character
                              formation with respect to virtue and vice. When he uses the word feeling it sometimes

                  painful idea left in the mind by the remembrance of hurt becomes associated with the
                  idea of the circumstance in which he received the hurt” (xxxi). At this point, the
                  child develops a fear of the hurtful object. Yet, while feeling is central to both
                  Hartley’s and Priestley’s theories, neither elaborates the implications of so closely
                  aligning thought with emotion. The consequence of intertwining cognitive processes
                  with sensation clearly signals the mind’s dependence on the body, but as sensation
                  is always accompanied by pleasure or pain, which is transformed into love or fear,
                  there is an affective dimension that neither Hartley nor Priestley fully explores.
                  Wedgwood, on the other hand, tormented by his own unstable emotions, investigates
                  the relationship between sensory and affective feeling as a fundamental aspect of
                  mentation.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>When Wedgwood claims that “all thinking is a matter of feeling” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                     E40–28478), he means affective, or emotionally-charged, feeling. Seeing an intimate
                     connection between sensory and affective feeling, Wedgwood conflates the two senses
                     of the word. He argues that when we receive a physical sensation from an object in
                     the world, it is always accompanied by an affective experience before it is associated
                     with an idea that correlates to the object of sensation. He asks, “May not the origin
                     of the faculty of Association be illustrated with greater success by [. . .] fixing
                     our attention upon simple feeling?” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28478). Accordingly,
                     Wedgwood argues that affective experience drives the process of association. In his
                     view, “muscular action is associated with Feeling &amp; not with Idea” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                     E40–28451). In other words, objects in the world become associated more powerfully
                     with a person’s emotional experience of them than with the sensory, or physical, experience
                     of them. Thus, associated ideas do not call up other ideas, but rather emotional states.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In an 1803 letter to Robert Southey, Coleridge expresses a similar idea. He writes,
                              “association depends in much greater degree on the recurrence of resembling states
                              of Feeling, than on Trains of Idea [. . .] Ideas never recall Ideas . . . it is the
                              Soul, the state of Feeling” that recalls ideas (CL II: 961).</span></div>
                     </div> The consequence of this assertion is that if an object or idea associates under pleasant
                     circumstances, subsequent experiences of it will be positive. If it associates under
                     negative conditions, it will later be experienced negatively. For example, Wedgwood
                     noted that any time he heard bells tolling during the day he automatically felt dejected.
                     He traced this response back to an experience in Germany. He realized that when he
                     heard any bells chime in daytime “there was a striking resemblance between the tone
                     &amp; that of the Hamburg bell with which I had several unpleasant association &amp; amongst
                     the rest, a sensation of melancholy” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28452). Because
                     his original experience of hearing bells during the day was associated with unpleasant
                     feelings, any repetition of this stimulus triggers an analogous emotional response.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Often this associative process happens on an unconscious level. For example, Wedgwood
                  observed that when he “views a beautiful object in nature without Emotion,” the “next
                  moment on reviewing it, I feel Emotion” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). Or, as
                  with the Hamburg bells, when he heard bells chime during the day he involuntarily
                  fell into a state of dejection even though he did not consciously remember the initial
                  event that established this mood-stimulus relationship. As with the twentieth-century
                  theory of the mood-state dependency effect, the emotional state of the perceiver “may
                  become associated with otherwise neutral” sensory data at the time that it is neurophysiologically
                  encoded (Lewis and Critchley 432). That is, sensory data that have no particular affective
                  quality attached to them can become linked to an emotional state through association.
                  For whatever reason, the chiming bells in Hamburg were painful to Wedgwood because
                  of some other unknown, negative circumstance related to them. This neutral stimulus
                  had been associated with an unpleasant emotion, and, henceforth Wedgwood was prey
                  to despondency and despair whenever he was exposed to similar stimuli. The implication
                  of this observation is that, according to Wedgwood, mood is induced by memory, often
                  unconsciously: “feeling often remains without any idea to what it owes its birth”
                  (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28515). Feeling, then, rather than ideas, drives habit
                  and character formation. More important than the stimuli to which human beings are
                  exposed is their affective response to them. </p>
               <p>Another implication of Wedgwood’s hypothesis is that emotion is embodied. “All our
                  feelings,” he claimed, are “different modifications of central nerves” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                  Collection E40–28515/47). In other words, when people experience emotions, there is
                  movement in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Wedgwood did not specify if
                  the movement is caused by vibrations, as in Hartley’s theory, or sensorial power,
                  as in Darwin’s. Though, similar to Davy’s speculation in early notebooks, Wedgwood
                  thought neural transduction might be a phenomenon corresponding to “electric activity”
                  or some “analogous activity of our nerve, assuming that Light, Heat, Electricity is
                  the same matter differently elicited” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28478). The inference
                  is clear that affective feeling, like sensory feeling, is physiological. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The idea that emotion is embodied is important for Wedgwood because it allowed him
                     to speculate that infants are not born with any particular temperament, but that it
                     develops over time in response to their environment.

                              of humours held that a person was born with a sanguine, choleric, melancholic, or
                              phlegmatic temperament.</span></div>
                     </div> Thus, education and upbringing could drastically influence a child’s character as
                     a consequence of Association. In essence, Wedgwood took Locke’s theory of <span class="foreign">tabula rasa</span> and extended it beyond the acquisition of ideas and knowledge and beyond even the
                     development of virtue and vice as in Hartley’s theory, claiming that feeling is also
                     involved in the process of association.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Wedgwood came to his conclusions, in part, by reading <em>Zoonomia,</em> in which Darwin theorizes that infants acquire the capacity for emotion through muscular
                     action. This could happen mimetically by imitating the facial expressions of others.
                     By smiling, frowning, scowling, and so forth, they stimulate the emotional feelings
                     associated with each of these muscular actions.

                              affect [. . .] peoples [sic] felt emotions” (Glenberg et al. 121). Individuals experienced
                              “strong physical sensations when they contracted muscles that produced facial configurations
                              that resembled the universal facial expressions for certain emotions” (Levenson, Ekman,
                              and Friesen 364).</span></div>
                     </div> It could also occur as by-products of other kinds of actions. For example, Darwin
                     notes that infants experience pleasure when breastfeeding. Since sucking naturally
                     causes the corners of the infant’s mouth to pull upward into a smile, later in life
                     people smile when they feel happy as a result of muscular association and habit. Wedgwood
                     noted that “Darwin’s hypothesis of our ideas of sensations being repetitions of original
                     impressions [...] appears to me capable of substantial proof” and was “greatly confirmed
                     by the general analogy of the gradual acquirement of perfection of all our functions,
                     from which it would be strange to exclude our <em>feelings</em>” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28452). Simply put, Wedgwood observed that muscular
                     and sensory acuity develops as infants grow and mature. He reasoned by analogy that
                     this same process must apply to emotions as well.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Wedgwood considered it “[i]nstructive to consider with what labour &amp; unceasing effort
                  [...] muscular trains are formed in infancy” because it provided evidence that people
                  are not born with fully formed cognitive faculties, but that they develop over time
                  (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). The observations that “Trains of Ideas are, evidently,
                  from the imbecility of children, formed with the same expense of time and exertion”
                  validated the hypothesis that cognition is a material phenomenon, not the function
                  of a fully formed, immaterial soul (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). Wedgwood took
                  early childhood developmental processes as proof that the mind and body are formed
                  together, and so, together shape temperament. He applied this theory of association
                  to knowledge acquisition and to emotion. While an excess of negative emotion in childhood
                  could debilitate a person for life, these emotional experiences are also related to
                  bodily comfort or discomfort as well.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>For Wedgwood, “Our own body is the centre &amp; measure of all our acquirements” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood

                     and magnitude, but it is the locus of all our affective experience (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                     E40–28515/515). That is, we understand spatial concepts, generally considered to be
                     abstract ideas, through our senses.

                              ideals or transcendental abstractions was a matter of intense debate amongst materialist
                              and dualist cognitive theorists, such as Darwin, Beddoes, Davy, Thomas Brown, and

                     </div> At the same time, the body is also the foundation for character, emotional temperament,
                     and all our future happiness or misery. “The Happiness of Man,” he claimed, “is comprised
                     entirely in <em>Sensation</em> &amp; <em>Emotion</em>; Imagination &amp; Action are only deemed important from being observed immediately to
                     antecede pleasurable &amp; painful Sensation &amp; Emotion” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28457).
                     In keeping with the intellectual atmosphere of his politically radical mentors, Wedgwood
                     saw “the great end of Existence [as] Individual happiness,” which he associated with
                     “Self regulation” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28480). Self-regulation refers to a
                     balanced state of mind and of body that prevents a person from falling too far into
                     dejection, vacillating between emotional extremes, and suffering unduly from physical
                     complaints.</p>
               </div>
               <p>“[F]rom repeated experiments,” he discovered that “the same events which will make
                  you miserable by anticipation [. . .] will hardly disturb your equanimity for a moment
                  in better health” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28480). He recognized that one’s state
                  of mind is greatly affected by one’s phenomenological experience of the world, and
                  he believed that this could be controlled through more careful attention to the process
                  of association, particularly in children. Therefore, to discover how to train the
                  mind (imagination) and the body (action) in order to increase happiness and decrease
                  misery became his primary concern. He tried to record the “Incidents, Thoughts, Feeling,
                  &amp;c of my early life” so that he could discover and “illustrate the composition of
                  Feeling, its growth &amp; maturation” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28490). He hoped “to
                  display in my own history some of the errors &amp; perhaps some of the advantages of my
                  education—to unravel the web of my ideas &amp; sensations—to trace my present habits to
                  their origins” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28490). He did not, however, get far.
                  His memoirs consist of a page and half of events that occurred when he was between
                  five and seven years old. Like Wordsworth, who was not satisfied enough with <em>The Prelude</em> to publish it during his lifetime, Wedgwood found the task daunting, noting “the
                  difficulty [...] in investigating the origin of different feelings” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                  Collection E40–28478). He notes: <span class="quote">‘One is obliged to decompound one’s present feelings into their component sensations
                     and take for granted that the components are much the same as they were in our earliest
                     infancy—But it is impossible to make just allowance for the growth to perfection of
                     each ingredient of sensation in the long interval between infancy &amp; manhood—still
                     more impossible to recollect their first development and earliest natures. (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                     Collection E40–28478)’</span> A better plan of action, then, was to try “to ascertain the truth of any hypothesis
                  of the association of the Powers of Mind by experimenting with children” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                  Collection E40–28451). Thus, Wedgwood’s theory was also formed by observing his nieces
                  and nephews, as he turned his attention to formulating a pedagogical theory that took
                  into account his materialist theories of cognition.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Wedgwood’s Materialist Pedagogy</span></h2>
               <p>Wedgwood’s plans for an experimental school, with its emphasis on the importance of
                  affective feeling in association, are predicated on his materialist theory of cognition.
                  The most complete outline of his plan appears in a letter to William Godwin dated
                  1797, printed in the first part of Erdman’s article. His theory of education, on which
                  his plan for the school was based, however, exists mostly in unpublished notebooks,
                  though some of his insights have been summarized by Boole in an essay that precedes
                  Tremayne’s selection of excerpts from Wedgwood’s notebooks. The majority of his notes
                  on education and pedagogy are interspersed with his notes on cognition and on association,
                  more generally. The proximity of the notes on cognition to the “Hints &amp; speculation
                  on Education” throughout the archival notebooks reveals how intertwined these two
                  projects were (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28451). Wedgwood’s goal was to understand
                  human cognition from a materialist perspective and apply those insights to rearing
                  and educating children. </p>
               <p>His approach relies on Hartley’s assumption that it was possible for “the Affections
                  and Passions” to “be analysed into their simple compounding parts, by reversing the
                  Steps of the Associations which concur to form them” (81). Hartley claims that by
                  analyzing the steps of association “we may learn how to cherish and improve the good”
                  characteristics and qualities and “check and root out such as are mischievous and
                  immoral;” we may also learn “how to suit our Manner of Life, in some tolerable Measure,
                  to our intellectual and religious Wants” (81). Wedgwood believed he had arrived at
                  certain insights through his reading and observations that would allow him formulate
                  a plan that would produce certain types of adults. Wedgwood, “devoid of any religious
                  sense” (Doherty 305), adapted Hartley’s theory to a secular context. While he did
                  not believe that right association would lead people to God, or theopathy in Hartley’s
                  theory, he did think it dictated behaviour, health, and affect. </p>
               <p>From Wedgwood’s perspective the “great business of human education lies in correcting,
                  often in the most arbitrary manner, pleasurable and painful feelings with a multitudinous
                  variety of objects &amp; events, which, as yet wholly indifferent to him [the child] are
                  afterwards to become the principle means &amp; instruments of all his pleasures &amp; pain”
                  (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28482). The problem for Wedgwood was the “arbitrary manner”
                  in which “a multitudinous variety of objects &amp; events,” that are in and of themselves
                  neutral, become associated with different states of feeling. These associations determine
                  the whole course of a person’s life, but particularly his or her emotional and physical
                  dispositions. Wedgwood’s aim was to direct early childhood experiences “with the view
                  of creating <em>agreeable</em> feeling” in children so that that they would mature into healthy, well-adjusted adults
                  (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28482).</p>
               <p>He began his investigation into pedagogy with the assumption that “Before entering
                  upon any of the principles of a regular plan of education, we should decide upon the
                  kind of being we wish to produce” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28463). In order to
                  formulate a pedagogical plan, educators first need to determine not what they want
                  their pupils to learn, but how they want them to <em>be</em> when they reach adulthood. The type of beings that Wedgwood wished to produce were
                  benevolent geniuses, who would be capable of bringing to fruition the sort of just
                  and equitable society described in various philosophical treatises such as Godwin’s
                  <em>Political Justice</em> (1793). Referring to Godwin and other intellectuals whom he admired, he noted that
                  “there are a dozen men in this kingdom whom their own exertions, a good education,
                  or fortunate circumstances, have raised to such a pitch of moral excellence as to
                  be enabled to resist the ruinous temptations of wealth, power, &amp; sensual pleasure”
                  (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28515/28). This temperament, in his opinion, was a crucial
                  part of genius. Wedgwood’s goal was to use the principles of materialist cognitive
                  science in order to consistently provide “a good education” that would produce human
                  beings of this kind.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Wedgwood’s experimental educational programme, which was designed to form emotionally
                     stable geniuses, had two primary objects: <span class="quote">‘(I) To produce a being possessing the largest possible means of affecting his own
                        happiness ’</span> <span class="quote">‘(II) the happiness of others. (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28486)’</span> These two attributes—the ability to make oneself happy and the desire to make others
                     happy—are, in this view, the foundation of a citizenry capable of and motivated to
                     enact an equitable society. For this reason, “<em>Emotion</em> is the chief subject of Education,” for, emotionally healthy adults are “best adapted
                     to produce individual happiness; &amp; to call forth an activity which shall have the
                     widest influence upon the happiness of others” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28486).
                     Because, for Wedgwood, emotion is an embodied phenomenon that is closely tied to cognition
                     and drives association, <span class="quote">‘Education, consists in ’</span> <span class="quote">‘1 Sensation’</span> <span class="quote">‘2 Emotion ’</span> <span class="quote">‘3 Idea, thought, notion, &amp;c ’</span> <span class="quote">‘4 Muscular motion, or activity. (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28486)’</span> By attending to these four interrelated physiological phenomena, Wedgwood hoped to
                     educate infants and children into adults who would be able <span class="quote">‘to subdue those useless &amp; harassing emotions of sympathy with the unretrievably [<em>sic</em>] unfortunate whom he is unable to relieve—to extract the agreeable from every situation
                        &amp; pay little attention to its opposite—in cases of danger, extreme distress, instead
                        of sinking under fear or unavailing grief, to summon the energies of his mind, preserve
                        tranquillity &amp; equilibrium that shall enable him to act so as to afford the greatest
                        possible relief—to keep their eyes invariably fixed on the great standard of human
                        conduct, the production of Happiness. (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28515/28)’</span><div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note17" id="Note17_return"><sup class="super">

                              out “whom he is unable to relieve.” I, uncharacteristically, included the crossed
                              out material because it was unlike Wedgwood to discourage sympathy for “the unfortunate.”
                              He generally encouraged benevolence and charitable acts. The fact that these individuals
                              cannot, for whatever reason, be helped is the important defining attribute that makes
                              sympathy for them detrimental rather than desirable.</span></div>

               <p>Wedgwood valued the qualities noted in this passage, most likely because he, in his
                  estimation, lacked them himself. Thus, the characteristics that he hoped to cultivate
                  in his pupils were freedom from “useless &amp; harassing emotions,” a positive outlook
                  that refuses to focus on the negative in “every situation,” and “tranquillity and
                  equilibrium” in all circumstances. If these attributes could be cultivated in childhood
                  not only would education produce emotionally stable adults, but given the link between
                  emotion and the body, they would also be physically healthy, free of the debilitating
                  pain and chronic ill-health from which he suffered. In this way, they would be able
                  to make themselves and others happy, thus creating a contented, and therefore just,
                  society.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In order to achieve this goal, Wedgwood emphasized the physical and emotional wellbeing
                     of his hypothetical pupils, whom he envisioned as infants. In order to attend to “Sensation,”
                     his first proposition was to create an environment that would “simplify &amp; render intense
                     the first affections of Sense &amp; [. . .] excite those affections under every possible
                     favorable circumstance of pleasure” (qtd. in Erdman I: 431). Simplification, intensity,
                     and pleasure, in his view, are the three necessary ingredients for controlling and
                     manipulating a baby’s bodily experience. Simplicity—or introducing objects, sounds,
                     scents, and so forth incrementally rather than all at once—would reduce the chaos
                     of sensory perception that he surmised infants, with their undeveloped senses, must
                     experience when thrust into an uncontrolled environment of sensory stimuli. This manner
                     of “administering impressions” would solve the problems caused by having “their attention
                     [. . .] vaguely solicited by a thousand objects at once” (qtd. in Erdman I: 431).

                              nature of association as “an unintelligible affrightful Riddle, […] a chaos of dark
                              tailless dark limbs &amp; trunk, tailless, headless, nothing begun &amp; nothing ended” (CN
                              III: 4057).</span></div>
                     </div> He conjectured that “if supplied too rapidly with impression,” the infant would become
                     overwhelmed, but “if [impressions are supplied] too slowly, stupidity &amp; limited conception”
                     would result (qtd. in Erdman I: 431). Sensory stimuli must be controlled so that strong
                     connections would be formed between external objects and the ideas that result from
                     association. Furthermore, the infants’ superintendents must be careful to ensure that
                     all stimuli associate under the most pleasurable conditions possible. Otherwise, negative
                     associations would be made, thus making the child susceptible to bad temper and poor
                     health.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Wedgwood noted that educators and parents readily “instruct the <em>eye &amp; ear</em>, in teaching language;” however, “Sight &amp; Touch are the two important Senses” and
                  should be given equal attention (qtd. in Erdman I: 431). A child’s body should be
                  educated with as much care as its mind. Because sight and touch are so closely interrelated,
                  “they must be taught together” (qtd. in Erdman I: 431). To educate the senses, Wedgwood
                  proposed a “nursery” with “plain grey walls with one or two vivid objects for sight
                  &amp; touch” (qtd. in Erdman I: 431). He suggested that “hard bodies be hung about them
                  so as to continually irritate their palms as they happen to come in contact” in order
                  to encourage digital “manipulation” (qtd. in Erdman I: 431). Slowly introducing infants
                  to the external world after their long confinement in the womb would reduce the shock
                  of birth trauma, which is compounded, according to Wedgwood, by the riotous assault
                  of sensation on the infant’s <em>tabula rasa</em> body. Properly attending to the child’s bodily needs would, in Wedgwood’s theory
                  of embodied cognition, necessarily improve its mind.</p>
               <p>Careful attention to the child’s surroundings was, as Richardson observes, common
                  to most associationist theories of education. While Wedgwood’s ideas resemble those
                  of other rationalist educators, there are some significant differences. Lunar Society
                  member Richard Lovell Edgeworth and his daughter Maria Edgeworth, co-authors of <em>Practical Education</em>, proposed a “sanitized, carefully superintended version of the upper-class home,
                  with every detail arranged” (Richardson 54). In contrast to Wedgwood’s hypothetical
                  seminary, they “prefer[red] ‘domestic’ education to boarding school” (55). The Edgeworths
                  also recommended a series of “practical experiments that children can perform,” while
                  discouraging certain types of literature that could potentially disorder their imagination
                  (53). Along similar lines, Beddoes designed a set of “rational toys” to inculcate
                  mathematical principles (Erdman II: 491). Wedgwood, however, was less concerned with
                  lessons and reading material than he was with ensuring that the bodily needs of children
                  would be met. He wanted to make sure that they would not be subjected to distressing
                  situations and that they would be diverted from painful emotional states. Where the
                  Edgeworths’ pupil would be “carefully inculcated [with] habits of rational thought”
                  (Richardson 57), Wedgwood’s pupil was to be carefully cultivated to be physically
                  and emotionally robust.</p>
               <p>In addition to providing suggestions for controlling and manipulating an infant’s
                  initial sensory data, Wedgwood also considered “how to connect high degrees of pleasure
                  with these impressions” (qtd. in Erdman I: 432). The cultivation of pleasure and avoidance
                  of pain is closely connected to the fourth point on Wedgwood’s list, that is, “Muscular
                  motion, or activity” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28486). Bodily discomfort, in his
                  theory, leads directly to poor health and low spirits. If a child is forced to “remain
                  torpid &amp; inert for some time, the health is deranged” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28452).
                  Furthermore, “Pains of the body, whether from hunger, sickness or external injury,
                  when long continued, induce a depression of spirits, or painful Emotion which endures
                  a considerable time after the painful Sensation has ceased” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                  E40–28457). “<em>Stretching</em>,” on the other hand, “augments pleasure” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28457). Emotion
                  originates in the pleasurable or painful states of the infant body. “Consider[ing]
                  the early states of being in infancy,” Wedgwood conjectured that breastfeeding, or
                  the satiation of hunger, is a “most agreeable state” in which the baby is “using muscular
                  exertion” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28457). During this activity of nursing, the
                  child’s “body is thrown into action, kicks &amp; stretching” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                  E40–28457). Thus, movement is pleasurable and restraint painful.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As pleasure and pain are always accompanied by the basic emotions of fear and love
                     in Wedgwood’s materialist theory of cognition, these bodily states lead to affective
                     states. If a child suffers from excessive bodily pain by being forcibly restrained,
                     not having its basic needs met, or from being neglected when in distress, the long-term
                     consequences can lead not only debility and depression, but even to wickedness or
                     malevolence. Wedgwood theorized that the unsatisfied desire to have pain relieved
                     leads, <span class="quote">‘Perhaps in this kind of progress [to] ’</span> <span class="quote">‘Impatience’</span> <span class="quote">‘Disappointment’</span> <span class="quote">‘Anger’</span> <span class="quote">‘Resentment’</span> <span class="quote">‘Revenge. (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28457)’</span> Unrelieved pain, in Wedgwood’s conception of affective stages, causes individuals
                     to pass through the abovementioned phases until eventually they want to seek revenge
                     for the hurt caused them. Continued exposure to uncomfortable situations results in
                     bad tempered adults and even violence. After being freed from restraint, for example,
                     a child moves “with <em>more</em> violence than he would otherwise do &amp; then a habit of violent Muscular Exertion when
                     under provocation, is daily strengthened” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28457), leading
                     a child to respond with violence when provoked. The response to pain in childhood
                     becomes a habit that is not only carried into adulthood, but forms the basis of a
                     person’s emotional character. “Hence, children, from rudely pushing each other, come
                     to repeat the pushes, or in other words, to beat each other;” they develop the “mechanical”
                     habit of responding with violence even when there is no pain present, “as in the case
                     of a choleric man” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28457). The “muscular energy” that
                     accumulates in painful circumstances “must expend itself on something;” hence, “Choleric
                     men stamp the ground, tear their hair, grind their teeth, break furniture” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                     Collection E40–28457).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Here we see Wedgwood drawing on the theory of humours, but making the assumption that
                              these character types are not innate but formed through association.</span></div>
                     </div> Thus, children should not be “left to fight out their own battles [or] settle their
                     own disputes” for “[w]hat can result from such a method but tyranny &amp; injustice on
                     the one hand &amp; dejection and cunning on the other” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467).
                     The implications of this observation are that an unjust society is made up of violent
                     and “cunning” individuals.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Wedgwood urged “every parent [to] conceive of himself as one of the Trustees of a
                  benevolent power that wishes the happiness of Mankind, and of his children as the
                  instruments of its production” (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole 82). To create a society
                  founded on equality and justice, parents and educators must rear children who literally
                  embody these principles. That is, they should not merely claim to value democratic
                  ideals such as liberty and equality but must enact them with their whole beings, which
                  includes both the actions they take and their emotional natures. In addition to disallowing
                  children to hit each other, Wedgwood argued that “no violence should be done to the
                  feelings of the child” (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole 82). Teasing children, abruptly
                  disrupting their pleasure, startling them, or using insensitive methods to get them
                  to comply with parents’ wishes creates youngsters who are timid and easily frightened.
                  Washing and dressing them against their wills while “they supplicate for liberty and
                  a cessation to their pain” (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole 78) or “feigning to set out”
                  while pretending not to care if the child follows as a way to get them to leave a
                  place desensitizes them to the sufferings of others (79). If a parent or caregiver
                  ignores children’s pleas to stop hurting them, they learn to disregard others’ pain.
                  Likewise, feigning indifference teaches them indifference. Wedgwood described these
                  standard parenting tactics as “a picture of brutal insensibility” that is “set before
                  children who are afterwards expected to sympathise in the distresses and attend to
                  the complaints of all about them!” (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole 78). “Children,” he
                  exhorted, “must be kept happy” if they are to grow up into benevolent adults (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                  Collection E40–28525/116).</p>
               <p>Wedgwood also advised not allowing children to have toys of their own. Instead, with
                  “regard to Property, it would be advisable that children should have everything perfectly
                  in common” to abolish the notion of private property (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole 89),
                  which he saw as the root of many social ills. “The moral error of these notions is
                  fully exposed,” he claimed, “by our attempt to answer a child’s questioning of ‘What
                  does <em>mine</em> mean?’” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467). There is “[n]o reply [that] can be made
                  that does not directly inculcate selfishness &amp; injustice” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                  E40–28467). Personal possessive pronouns, in Wedgwood’s view, are necessarily predicated
                  on self-interest and promote self-seeking and personal gain at the expense of others
                  because conceptually they refer to private ownership. He advocated the “extirpation”
                  of these words from children’s vocabulary—“those mischievous particles, <em>My</em>, <em>Mine</em>, <em>His</em>, <em>Yours</em>,<em>Hers</em>, must never be pronounced in their hearing” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467).
                  For “children [who] have already imbibed the corrupt notion of property to the evident
                  risk of injuring their temper,” he recommended “mak[ing] common presents to the whole
                  nursery” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28515/34). To further abolish the notion of
                  individual ownership and to reinforce the notion of shared property, children “shou’d
                  have all articles of dress in common that their different sizes will admit of” and
                  “[a]ll Playthings” should “be common—the same of chairs, beds, &amp;c &amp;c” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood
                  Collection E40–28467). The goal, again, was to mould children to grow into adults
                  who espouse ideals of social equity.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Wedgwood drew his conclusions, in part, from his observations of his nieces and nephews.
                     In a plain grey notebook with the words “Baby Wedgwood [...] her faults &amp; the associated
                     habits” written lightly in pencil across the front, Wedgwood makes the following observations: <span class="quote">‘B—subject to occasional dejection of spirits &amp; frequent fits of peevishness—These
                        often arise from want of food—And often from very slight provocations—the origin of
                        her extreme irritability must be searched for in the method of her education. [...]
                        When B. is vexed by any trivial provocation, &amp; dejection of spirits strongly marked
                        in her countenance is associated with the events, wholly disproportionate to the real
                        nature. (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467)
                        <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note20" id="Note20_return"><sup class="super">
                                 (20)
                                 </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The excerpted words are “with Bessy Wedgwood,” which presumably references Elizabeth
                                 Allen Wedgwood, Josiah’s wife and mother to the child in question. Baby Wedgwood was
                                 most likely Charlotte Wedgwood, Jos and Bessy’s second daughter born in 1797, though
                                 Wedgwood and Wedgwood suggest that it might have been Elizabeth, their first daughter
                                 born in 1793 (111).</span></div>
                        </div>’</span> These remarks synthesize Wedgwood’s thoughts about the relationship between the body,
                     pleasure and pain, emotions, and pedagogy. Characterizing his niece’s temperament
                     as peevish, irritable, and prone to “dejection,” he theorized that “One part of the
                     mischief done to B’s temper arises from the strong notions infused into her of <em>exclusive property</em>” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467), which he saw as adding to her misery by increasing
                     her desire for things belonging to her brother and by causing anxiety when he played
                     with her toys. Equally notable, however, he observed that her distemper often arose
                     from physical causes, such as “want of food.” Her tendency to overreact to “any trivial
                     provocation” and “her feebleness of spirits &amp; irritability of temper” are “[o]wing
                     partly to a weak frame, &amp; partly to injurious treatments” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                     E40–28467). Though Wedgwood did not consider his brother and sister-in-law abusive
                     parents, he believed that even mild physical mistreatment, neglect of her basic needs,
                     and the inculcation of incorrect principles were responsible for B’s disordered personality.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The typical childrearing strategies of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries,
                  which failed to carefully heed the needs of the child’s body, were to blame for sickly,
                  distempered children. These practices were implicitly based on the common belief that
                  the soul and the mind are immaterial principles that inhabit, but exist separately
                  from, the material body. If the mind and body are separate entities, then the body
                  needs little attention because it has little bearing on a child’s temperament. Or,
                  conversely, this view of the mind-body relationship could lead to a theory in which
                  the body must be mortified so that children do not become tempted by sensual pleasures
                  or the enjoyments of the flesh. With the emergence of materialist theories of mind
                  that privileged the body’s role in cognition, thinkers such as Wedgwood looked more
                  closely at how children were treated physically, mentally, and emotionally. </p>
               <p>In addition to outlining the flaws in B’s “method of education” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection
                  E40–28467), Wedgwood also offered suggestions for rectifying the flaws in his niece’s
                  character, which he also applied more generally to his theory of education. To correct
                  B’s tendency towards temper tantrums, “[o]ne mode of cure, derived from medical analogy
                  seems to promise, at least <em>alleviation</em> consisting in shortening &amp; mitigating the fit[s]” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467).
                  He proposed an “experiment” for increasing B’s capacity to “bear [...] sudden privations
                  with little discomposure” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467). In “this experiment
                  it wou’d be worth while to prepare some new &amp; diverting toys—the more striking the
                  better” to divert her from her “suffering” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467). To
                  cure her of the invitiating effects of “<em>exclusive property</em>,” Wedgwood suggested that “Playthings shou’d be given which require assistance from
                  another &amp; being left alone with her brother, she wou’d naturally be led to associate
                  him with her amusements [...] If left much together, they wou’d soon become necessary
                  to each other” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28467). The purpose of these suggestions
                  and experiments was to train B to become more capable of bearing hardship cheerfully,
                  to increase her ability to make herself happy, and to encourage a sense of cooperation
                  and fellowship with her siblings. These qualities would allow her to mature into a
                  healthy and benevolent adult.</p>
               <p>Wedgwood’s propositions for educating children at home or in an institutional setting
                  were similar. He recommended attention to children’s bodily and emotional wellbeing
                  by attending to diet, physical examinations, and exercise so as to encourage children
                  to develop characteristics and qualities that allow them to succeed in life. The qualities
                  that would produce benevolent beings of genius included: </p>

               <p> This list gives insight into the ideal subject that Wedgwood hoped to produce through
                  the process of education. This being would hypostatize the social ideals of the political
                  radicals with whom he consorted and be free of the physical and emotional debilities
                  from which Wedgwood, himself, suffered.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Conclusion</span></h2>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Wedgwood’s pedagogical goal was to “form by education” individuals who would not ignore
                     the social ills found in “our jails, hospitals, [...] our Bridewalls [<em>sic</em>] and Poor Houses,” but would “hunt out and expose that misery in its gloomiest recesses
                     and combat those fatal prejudices which have chiefly occasioned it by splitting society
                     into subordinate classes” (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole 70). In order to create these
                     concerned and motivated future citizens, he argued that educators should determine
                     which qualities they wished to cultivate in their pupils then implement a plan of
                     education based on the principles of materialist cognitive science, which privileged
                     the body by making it necessary to cognition. He held that it is “important [. . .]
                     in Education [. . .] [t]o implant as early as possible habits of real industry and
                     serious occupation, such as will exercise the body and [. . .] furnish that happiness
                     of pleasure for which alone we live” (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole 69).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>While Wedgwood's discussions of education often assume male pupils, here, as with
                              his discussion of B's temperament, he is discussing the benefits of exercise for women
                              and girls. He argues, along the lines of Wollstonecraft, that women are “delicate,
                              feeble, and sickly” because, unlike men, they do not exercise their bodies (qtd. in
                              Tremayne and Boole 68).</span></div>
                     </div> Thus, he believed that attending to the body was the way to properly form the mind.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Wedgwood’s theory is wonderfully idealistic, but aspects of it are extreme. For example,
                  in the interest of controlling early association he cautioned that “the child must
                  never go out of doors or leave his own apartment,” as the “explication of Nature would
                  be attended to with great difficulty” (qtd. in Erdman I: 431). This was an idea that
                  Wordsworth and Coleridge, with their idealized concept of the child of nature, found
                  repugnant, as Erdman notes. Furthermore, it is highly impracticable. Elsewhere, Wedgwood
                  suggested that in order to instil fortitude and tranquillity in the face of danger
                  <span class="quote">‘the parent might invite an attack of a fierce bull, stand with perfect composure
                     till the animal be within two or three paces of him, then suddenly expand an umbrella,
                     hold his hat before his face, or somehow contrive to amuse or terrify the foe; whilst
                     his child, on the other side of the stile, shall witness his intrepidity and address,
                     and by degrees, practise the same feat himself in company with his parent. Or the
                     child might begin his triumph with a raging turkey-cock. (qtd. in Tremayne and Boole
                     85)’</span> More realistically perhaps, but radical for his day, was his suggestion that “Hospitals,
                  prisons, madhouses should be visited, but in so cautious a manner that the mind might
                  experience no shock, but be gradually familiarised with their horrors” (qtd. in Tremayne
                  and Boole 85). Though Wedgwood spent time with his nieces and nephews, clearly he
                  had no children of his own or he may not have made such far-fetched suggestions. Nonetheless,
                  his goal was to inculcate children with steady emotional character, physical health,
                  and moral fortitude—characteristics that could not be taught, but must be embodied.</p>
               <p>“Moral sensibility [could be] nicely cultivated during education,” but only because
                  “Feeling connects copiously with due notions of things, [and] creates a species of
                  intuition in conduct” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28470). Thus, Wedgwood proposed
                  an educational programme that educated children’s emotions by focusing on their bodies.
                  In keeping with his mentors and his contemporaries, Wedgwood theorised that cognition
                  is an embodied phenomenon. Like the Edgeworths, Beddoes, and other rationalist educators
                  he drew upon the principles of association as he formulated his plan. Unlike these
                  thinkers, however, he emphasized the importance of feeling, not just in association
                  but also in education. Writing from his own experience of mental, physical, and emotional
                  torment, Wedgwood strove to formulate a plan that would not only free individuals
                  from depression and ill health, but would also create citizens capable of enacting
                  the ideal society of which he and his radical associates dreamed. Had he been healthier
                  or lived longer perhaps his experimental school would have made it beyond the hypothetical
                  stage; or perhaps he would have been able to have children of his own on which to
                  experiment. As it stands, his legacy remains in primarily archival form, but gives
                  us rich insight into the interconnections of the mind-matter debates, theories of
                  pleasure and pain, and pedagogy in the early Romantic period.</p>

               of the opinions concerning Space &amp; Time for Mackintosh” (<em>CL</em> II: 787). Earlier that month Southey informed William Taylor that Wedgwood was working
               on a book with Mackintosh as “the man midwife” (qtd. in Beer 29).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Wedgwood frequently used abbreviations in his notebooks (e.g., “consq<sup>t</sup>” for consequent). For the sake of readability, I have silently provided the full
               word for abbreviations as necessary. In other quotations from archival material, I
               have silently included additions and removed crossed out words, again for ease in

         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">Dissenters were Christians of various beliefs (Anabaptists, Diggers, etc.) who broke
               with the Church of England in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries.
               Priestley was a Unitarian. Dissenters, Hartley included, were barred from becoming
               clergy in the Anglican Church because they refused to subscribe to the Thirty-Nine
               Articles.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">Elsewhere, I argue that Darwin deliberately uses obfuscating philosophical language
               in order to protect himself from the sort of persecution that Priestley experienced
               when his laboratory was destroyed in the Church and King Riots of 1791.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">Determining Wedgwood's exact stance is sometimes difficult because his notes are fragmentary
               and undated. In the quoted passage, which is just a few jotted notes, he was considering
               “pure reasoning” (V&amp;A/Wedgwood Collection E40–28476A). His stance seemed to be that
               the mind begins as a “mere transcript” and becomes active as it develops. This difficulty
               determining which views represent Wedgwood’s most developed or recent line of thought
               is part of the problem of working with archival material.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">Hartley offered his physiological account of cognition as part of a larger theological
               theory about the perfectibility of humankind and cultivation of virtue and vice. He
               sets out a moral taxonomy that will lead humanity, both ontogenetically and phylogenetically,
               to reunion with God. Pleasure and pain are, thus, important to his theory of character
               formation with respect to virtue and vice. When he uses the word <em>feeling</em> it sometimes seems to refer to affective experience as well as sensation.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">In an 1803 letter to Robert Southey, Coleridge expresses a similar idea. He writes,
               “association depends in much greater degree on the recurrence of resembling states
               of Feeling, than on Trains of Idea [. . .] Ideas <em>never</em> recall Ideas . . . it is the Soul, the state of Feeling” that recalls ideas (<em>CL</em> II: 961).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">14. </span><span class="noteBody">Though it was declining in popularity in the eighteenth century, the ancient theory
               of humours held that a person was born with a sanguine, choleric, melancholic, or
               phlegmatic temperament.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note15"><span class="noteLabel">15. </span><span class="noteBody">Recent research has shown that “facial configurations” do, in fact “differentially
               affect [. . .] peoples [<em>sic</em>] felt emotions” (Glenberg et al. 121). Individuals experienced “strong physical sensations
               when they contracted muscles that produced facial configurations that resembled the
               universal facial expressions for certain emotions” (Levenson, Ekman, and Friesen 364).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note16"><span class="noteLabel">16. </span><span class="noteBody">The issue of how abstract ideas such as distance, magnitude, shape, and even concepts
               such as benevolence or justice could exist or be perceived if they were not Platonic
               ideals or transcendental abstractions was a matter of intense debate amongst materialist
               and dualist cognitive theorists, such as Darwin, Beddoes, Davy, Thomas Brown, and
               others. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note17"><span class="noteLabel">17. </span><span class="noteBody">In this excerpt from a notebook, Wedgwood added the word “unretrievably” and crossed
               out “whom he is unable to relieve.” I, uncharacteristically, included the crossed
               out material because it was unlike Wedgwood to discourage sympathy for “the unfortunate.”
               He generally encouraged benevolence and charitable acts. The fact that these individuals
               cannot, for whatever reason, be helped is the important defining attribute that makes
               sympathy for them detrimental rather than desirable.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note18"><span class="noteLabel">18. </span><span class="noteBody">As a point of interest, in one of his notebooks, Coleridge refers to the unstructured
               nature of association as “an unintelligible affrightful Riddle, […] a chaos of <span style="text-decoration: line-through">dark tailless</span> dark limbs &amp; trunk, tailless, headless, nothing begun &amp; nothing ended” (<em>CN</em> III: 4057).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note18_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note19"><span class="noteLabel">19. </span><span class="noteBody">Here we see Wedgwood drawing on the theory of humours, but making the assumption that
               these character types are not innate but formed through association.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note19_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note20"><span class="noteLabel">20. </span><span class="noteBody">The excerpted words are “with Bessy Wedgwood,” which presumably references Elizabeth
               Allen Wedgwood, Josiah’s wife and mother to the child in question. Baby Wedgwood was
               most likely Charlotte Wedgwood, Jos and Bessy’s second daughter born in 1797, though
               Wedgwood and Wedgwood suggest that it might have been Elizabeth, their first daughter
               born in 1793 (111).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note20_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note21"><span class="noteLabel">21. </span><span class="noteBody">While Wedgwood's discussions of education often assume male pupils, here, as with
               his discussion of B's temperament, he is discussing the benefits of exercise for women
               and girls. He argues, along the lines of Wollstonecraft, that women are “delicate,
               feeble, and sickly” because, unlike men, they do not exercise their bodies (qtd. in
               Tremayne and Boole 68).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note21_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
