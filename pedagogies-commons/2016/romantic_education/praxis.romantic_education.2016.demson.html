            <p class="noCount">The design of this course is to introduce students to the influence that Digital Humanities
               is having on our organization of the study of Romanticism. To that end, the course
               shifts from the traditional survey of major authors, to a survey of Romantic-era publishers,
               whose publications have only recently become widely available through digitization.
               While there are opportunities for the close reading of major Romantic texts authored
               by these publishers, emphasis is placed in the assignments on distant reading of periodicals.
               Moreover, the course prompts student to reflect on the diverse politics of publication,
               both in the Romantic era, when independent individuals acquired printing presses and
               began to advocate for freedom of the press, as well as in the present day, with its
               diverse concerns over freedom of information, copyrights, privacy, and so on. </p>

            </header><br/><p>Digital resources are transforming the study of Romanticism, and Romantic pedagogy
               must keep pace with these changes. Archived materials that have long been inaccessible
               to students, such as newspapers, diaries, correspondences, are now readily available
               online; databases of high resolution images scanned are now free; new analytical tools
               including word searches and image comparisons (see the “Compare” button on the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/public/about/tour/tour.html">Blake Archive</a> for an example) are proliferating with each passing year, prompting new approaches.
               In response to these developments, my graduate-level, four-week, online, research
               seminar on Romanticism takes full advantage of innovations in Digital Humanities that
               enable and accelerate archival research. A student today can use 
               “The Times Digital Archive 1785-2008 ”
               to quickly identify the first reference to a skylark in the newspaper during the Romantic
               period (April 20, 1786, 413, pg. 3), how many times it appeared that year in the paper
               (twice), and whether or not references to skylarks fell off or proliferated in subsequent
               years (they nearly doubled every following year). This student can then read the articles
               in which those references appear to achieve a sense of the contemporary attitudes
               toward that celebrated avian. This sort of brief research assignment was not possible
               ten years ago, and it has the potential to revolutionize the way students contextualize
               Romantic literature. My course challenges students to break the habits of reading
               that traditional anthologies promote and ultimately to expand their sense of who the
               culturally significant figures in the Romantic era were. More specifically, the aim
               of this course is to draw attention to the careers of those people who were producers
               and directors of culture but who have been long neglected because their creations
               were beyond reproduction in traditional print anthologies.</p>
            <p>I designed my course, <em>Revisiting the Radical Republican Publishers of the Romantic Era in the Digital Era</em>, as an online, summer-intensive workshop for graduate students who have completed
               introductory graduate coursework as well as courses in English literature. Rather
               than being an introductory survey of Romantic literature, it can serve as an introduction
               to the period in a manner that does not include the traditional canon of readings
               or criticism. My aim is to push students to explore new websites such as: </p>

               and thereby depoliticize Romanticism by asking students to use digital resources to
               explore the tumultuous culture of radical publishers, principally in the 1810s and
               early 1820s, and to discover how those publishers interacted with the poets and fiction
               writers.</p>

                  <p>“Why crush a starving bookseller?” Percy Shelley furiously wrote Leigh Hunt after
                     Peterloo, because in doing so, he explained, “tyrants […] strike in his person at
                     all of their political enemies” and “divert the attention of the people from obtaining
                     a Reform in their oppressive Government” (<em>Letters </em>73-4). In the wake of the government massacre of reform-seekers in Manchester,

                     </div> the Home Office, in 1819, intensified its campaign of prosecutions to shut down the
                     domestic reform movement and focused their efforts on those who sought to publicize
                     their radical agenda. Despite this crackdown, republican publishers including John
                     Cahuac, Richard Carlile, William Cobbett, Thomas Dolby, William Hone, and Leigh Hunt,
                     fought back. Veterans of government prosecutions, they rallied together to educate
                     the public about the imperative of reform and published their political agenda in
                     diverse forms: nursery rhymes, satirical essays, news reports, lyrical poetry, open
                     letters, lists of corrupt jurors, and caricatures of nearly everyone in the government,
                     including King George IV. They were convinced that if enough people were educated
                     about the need for reform, actual reform would be inevitable. This radical campaign,
                     however, did not survive for long because publishers were divided, imprisoned, transported,
                     or coerced into silence. Because much of the print culture produced was prolific and
                     too costly to republish in an accessible format, it has remained neglected in archives—until
                     these materials were recently digitized.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The volatility and passion of the republican publishers in the Romantic period exemplify
                  the vibrancy of radical culture of the era, and this political culture exerted a profound
                  influence on contemporary literary productions. I use Percy Shelley’s <em>The Mask of Anarchy</em> to demonstrate how various aspects of radical culture in 1819—politics, philosophy,
                  and rhetoric—permeate the Romantic poetry of that and subsequent years. By exploring
                  the print culture of the era, as Michael Scrivener has done in <em>Radical Shelley</em> (1982), the craft of its major poets becomes more apparent. To reach a broader audience
                  for his 1819 lyrical satire, for example, Shelley deployed ideas, phrases, and particular
                  figures drawn from contemporary sources including Hone’s pamphlets and Hunt’s <em>Examiner</em>. Through such examples, I raise theoretical questions about Romantic poetics, concentrating
                  on originality, genius, invention, combination, and craft by asking students to compare
                  caricatures in <em>The Examiner</em>, <em>Black Dwarf</em>, and the <em>Political Register</em> of such figures as Lords Castlereagh and Sidmouth in relation to Shelley’s caricatures
                  in <em>The Mask of Anarchy</em>. This activity tracks how rhetorical strategies move between popular print culture
                  and high literature. With the new digital resources available to students, it now
                  is possible to explore these questions of poetics in very material ways, by textual
                  comparisons made feasible by digital resources rather than theoretical speculation.</p>
               <p>It is presently more feasible to explore the practical concerns involved in publication
                  in the late Romantic period. Using <em>The Mask of Anarchy</em> as an example, we discuss Shelley’s request that Leigh Hunt publish in London, although
                  Shelley was in Italy at the time, and Hunt’s decision to suppress the ballad because
                  of threats of government prosecution. Students read the news, follow which publishers
                  were fined, arrested, imprisoned or transported, and thereby gather a sense of the
                  dangers of publication. By studying Romantic publishers, students begin to see past
                  the Romantic disdain for commerce and pragmatism to some of their underlying concerns
                  about their audiences, self-image, government censorship, and financial autonomy,
                  among other considerations.</p>
               <p>While the major poets of the period drew from contemporary print culture and negotiated
                  with their publishers, a study of the era’s publishers open up deeper issues still.
                  Blake expresses the significance of the link between authorship and publishing in
                  a letter from 1808, having acquired by this time his own press: “I call myself now
                  Independent. I can be Poet Painter &amp; Musician as the Inspiration comes” (“Letter To
                  George Cumberland, 1 September 1880,” <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/copyinfo.xq?mode=eei_vgroup&amp;group=letters"><em>The William Blake Archives</em></a>). Blake’s press gave him freedom, a Romantic concept that regularly conflated the
                  political with the artistic. This course introduces students to the careers and life
                  projects of four English republican publishers of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
                  centuries who, like the major poets of the period, meditated on political and artistic
                  freedom and were forerunners in the struggle for the freedom of the press: William
                  Blake, Leigh Hunt, William Hone, and William Cobbett. Other significant figures are
                  considered, such as Hannah Moore, Charlotte Smith, the Wordsworths, the Shelleys and
                  Byron, and John Clare, but the aim here is to spotlight a representative group of
                  publishers of the era who fought for a free press. Their convictions prompted them
                  to write, and when their productions were deemed too dangerous for established publishers,
                  all four began personally to publish their writings, often at great personal hazard.
                  It is a tragedy, then, that while historians, literary critics, and teachers have
                  acknowledged the influence of radical publishers in the Romantic era, the careers
                  and publications of these figures have been largely neglected or only mentioned in
                  passing.</p>
               <p>My summer intensive online course introduces students to Romanticism, print culture
                  studies, and the emergent field of Digital Humanities; a variety of daily tasks are
                  therefore required. Each day, students are check an online for course announcements
                  and instructions, complete required readings (many of which are online), review assignments
                  and conduct database research, write a blog entry, participate in our online seminar
                  discussion threads, and contribute to our shared webliography (identifying and reviewing
                  new digital resources). All of these activities along with my lectures return to three
                  core questions. </p>
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">1. What is the relationship between journalism and literature? </div>
                  <div class="l">2. How did self-publishing affect the literary and non-literary productions of those
                     Romantics who worked closely with a publisher or, better still, published their own
                     works?</div>
                  <div class="l">3. How is the postmodern digital era reconfiguring our understanding of the Romantic
                     era (its canon, its poetics, its enduring relevance)?</div>
               </div>
               <p> These questions serve as prompts for the students’ blog posts (suggested three hundred
                  words per day), in which they respond to readings and make connections (20% of the
                  course grade, 5% per week). They guide our online discussions (30% of the course grade,
                  5% per week for participation, 10% for impromptu research-question responses), serve
                  as the weekly exam question prompt (30% of course grade, dropping the lowest of four),
                  and are starting points for their final papers (a three thousand-word research paper
                  that makes use of digital archives, databases, and other online resources is 20% of
                  the course grade). In addition to the daily required readings, I suggest that students
                  work online from two to four hours daily; however, once they are engaged with online
                  research and discussion, they tend to spend much more time online than this guideline
                  proposes. It is not unusual for threads of student discussions to carry on for days,
                  even when we have moved on to subsequent units.</p>
               <p>There are four units to the course: (a) “William Blake: The Recluse with a Printing
                  Press;” (b) “Leigh Hunt: <em>The Examiner</em>, the Cockney School Romantics, and Peterloo;” (c) “William Hone: The Treason Trials,
                  Peterloo, and Pamphleteering;” and (d) “William Cobbett: The <em>Political Register</em> and <em>Rural Rides</em> after Peterloo.” In each unit, students read a biography, explore the publisher’s
                  career, analyze both literary and non-literary texts, discuss a variety of theoretical
                  questions, and take an essay exam.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2">
               <h2><span class="head">Unit One: William Blake: The Recluse with a Printing Press</span></h2>
               <p>The first unit of the course introduces students to William Blake, to print culture
                  studies, and to Digital Humanities. Students read G. E. Bentley, Jr.’s <em>The Stanger from Paradise: A Biography of William Blake </em>(2003), selections from Northrop Frye,<em>The William Blake Archives</em>, and <em>The Georgian Index </em>of early British newspapers. I introduce students to Blake’s mythology, to radical
                  culture of the Romantic era, to Digital Humanities, and to key aspects of Blake’s
                  thought, including his creed of radicalism and roots in Dissenting Enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>Students explore Blake’s self-published works, analyze the relationship of image to
                  text, and compare different manuscripts of the same text. They discuss Blake’s “Enthusiasm”
                  and the influence it has in his productions (specifically, his parents’ rejection
                  of public worship in preference for private prayer and introspection), and the more
                  generic connections between literature and religion (specifically, in questions relating
                  to inspiration, epiphany, and the aura of scripture). My lectures (which I post as
                  text documents, usually between six- to twelve-hundred words in length) focus on <em>The First Book of Urizen</em> and take students beyond the Blake that typically appears in anthologies, and I encourage
                  my students to explore later works as well.</p>
               <p>At the end of each unit, students are given a two-hour open-book, take-home exam in
                  which they answer the following question: “Considering that Blake had near complete
                  control over his artistic productions—from their conception, through their composition
                  and publication, to their distribution—how did Blake’s self-publication affect his
                  artistic productions?” Students are required to focus on a specific passage from a
                  text and to work with <em>The William Blake Archive</em>.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.3">
               <h2><span class="head">Unit Two: Leigh Hunt: <em>The Examiner</em>, the Cockney School Romantics, and Peterloo</span></h2>
               <p>The second unit introduces students to Leigh Hunt and the Cockney School. Students
                  read Anthony Holden’s <em>The Wit in the Dungeon: The Remarkable Life of Leigh Hunt: Poet, Revolutionary, and
                     the Last of the Romantics</em> (2005) and browse issues of Hunt’s <em>The Examiner.</em> Rather than reading whole issues, they find an event or story and follow Hunt’s coverage
                  of it over several issues. My example is Hunt’s coverage of Peterloo in the fall issues
                  of 1819. During this week, students also read selections from Jeffrey Cox’s <em>Poetry and Politics in the Cockney School: Keats, Shelley, Hunt and Their Circle</em> (1998), several poems by Keats, including “Dedication to Leigh Hunt, Esq.,” “Written
                  On the Day That Mr. Leigh Hunt Left Prison,” and poems by Percy Shelley, including
                  <em>Adonaïs</em>.</p>
               <p>Student discussion topics range widely as they draw comparisons between Blake’s and
                  Hunt’s biographies and their activities as publishers. We discuss literary circles
                  and the central role that publishers often play and survey contemporary literary reviews
                  and the politics that inform them, particularly in relation to Shelley’s response
                  to reviewers of Keats in <em>Adonaïs</em>. I ask students to think in broader terms about the relationship between newspapers
                  and poetry. Hunt was often accused of spur-of-the-moment overproduction at the cost
                  of quality (a typical criticism of newsprint prose), yet spontaneity was lauded by
                  most Romantics as an essential trait of poetic genius. Though not traditionally conserved
                  as a genre of literature, to what extent can we say that <em>The Examiner</em> is literary? As several of the critics we have read point out, Keats owed much to
                  the paper—if Hunt had not published his poetry, it is hard to imagine how Keats would
                  have reached reviewers around the nation. My question, however, is a large one: Is
                  the sum of each issue greater than the whole? Or, in other words, what are some of
                  the effects of reading poetry next to drama reviews next to bankruptcy notices, etc.?
                  I urge students to work with specific examples. These questions tend to produce much
                  speculation, so it is helpful to intervene in the discussion with guiding quotes from
                  Wordsworth’s prefaces to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> and/or from Shelley’s <em>A Defence of Poetry</em>.</p>
               <p>In the second unit I also introduce students to Peterloo as a defining event in the
                  Romantic period. Students read selections from James Chandler’s <em>England in 1819 </em>(1999) and reports in various newspapers, including Hunt’s reporting. I ask students
                  whether Hunt’s reports of Peterloo are reliable or inflammatory, seditious propaganda,
                  or Romantic. The exam question at the end of this unit is: “If Hunt fostered a coterie
                  of radical authors and a culture of political defiance, how did this culture permeate
                  the literary and/or non-literary productions from the Cockney School?”</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Unit Three: William Hone and the Popular Reform Movement</span></h2>
               <p>The third unit continues reading on Peterloo and also introduces students to William
                  Hone’s political pamphlets and the caricatures of George Cruikshank. Students read
                  the following: </p>
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">Ben Wilson’s lively biography, <em>The Laughter of Triumph: William Hone and the Fight </em> <em>for the Free Press</em> (2005)</div>

                  <div class="l">Hone’s <em>The Political House that Jack Built </em>(on <em>The William Hone BioText</em>)</div>
                  <div class="l">Shelley’s “England in 1819” and <em>The Mask of Anarchy</em></div>
                  <div class="l"><em>Who Killed Cock Robin?</em> and <em>Letter to Sidmouth</em>, two publications by John Cahuac, a long-forgotten radical publisher transported

               </div>
               <p> We cover the Romantic era battle for the freedom of the press, beginning in the 1790s
                  and carried through to the 1830s. In <em>The Political House that Jack Built</em> (1819), a pamphlet that articulates a core conviction of radicals of the era, Hone
                  lays out his faith in the power of an independent press. Unlike Cruikshank, Hone rages
                  with indignation: “This is THE THING, that in spite of new Acts, / And attempts to
                  restrain it, by Soldiers or Tax, / Will <em>poison</em> the Vermin, / That plunder the Wealth, / That lay in the House, / That Jack built”
                  (published on 
                  “Romantic Circles”
                  in conjunction with <em>The William Hone BioText</em>).</p>
               <p>To prepare students for the third exam, we explore <em>The William Hone Biotext</em> in order to analyze how word and text interact in the era’s political pamphlets and
                  to assess the political rhetoric of Shelley’s 1819 poetry. This week ends with a broad
                  discussion of radical and Romantic attitudes toward money and economic ambition. The
                  third unit exam asks students to explore a comparative analysis of different rhetorical
                  strategies or modes that radicals and Romantics adopted in the battle for the freedom
                  of the press after Peterloo. They focus on specific passages and/or images from Hone’s
                  publications, the writings of the Cockney School, and/or John Cahuac, and their responses
                  should include digital texts from <em>The William Hone Biotext</em>.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Unit Four: William Cobbett: The <em>Political Register</em> and <em>Rural Rides</em> after Peterloo</span></h2>
               <p>In the fourth unit of the course, students explore William Cobbett’s writings. Whereas
                  Bentley was dense and slow-going, Richard Ingrams’s <em>The Life and Adventures of William Cobbett</em> (2006) is lively and a quick read. Students browse issues of <em>Political Register</em>, read selections from his <em>Rural Rides</em> online, and evaluate Kevin Gilmartin’s assessment of Cobbett in “Reading Cobbett’s
                  Contradictions” (1996). At this point, I begin to help students define their final
                  paper project and our discussion questions tend to be comparative and reflective in
                  kind. I ask students, for example, to compare Cobbett’s early years to those of other
                  radical publishers whose biographies we have read. This allows us to appreciate how
                  Cobbett, whose career runs across the entirety of the Romantic period, had little
                  interaction with literary figures and is usually not thought of as a Romantic at all.
                  Nevertheless, we can draw interesting connections with his contemporaries: Cobbett’s
                  critiques of the English prison system, of the need for public education, of rapid
                  urbanization and the expansion of global commerce, as well as his celebrations of
                  the independent cottage as the English ideal (John Bull appears throughout his writings),
                  of the freedom of the press, and of greater governmental transparency are not dissimilar
                  to the convictions expressed by his contemporaries.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Course Conclusion</span></h2>
               <p>As the course concludes, I ask students for reflections. One of the great advocates
                  for the freedom of the press, Cobbett repeatedly returns in his papers to the struggle
                  not only for a free press but also for a press independent of Government control:
                  <span class="quote">‘If ever there was in the world a thing completely perverted from its original design
                     and tendency, it is the press of England; which, instead of enlightening, does, as
                     far as it has any power, keep the people in ignorance which, instead of cherishing
                     notions of liberty, tends to the making of the people slaves; and which, instead of
                     being their guardian, is the most efficient instrument in the hands of all those who
                     oppress, or wish to oppress, them. (Qtd. in Jones 1-3) ’</span> I take this further with a final thought on the course: <span class="quote">‘The activity of publishing runs counter to Romanticism’s celebration of solitude,
                     introspection, and the reclusive poet; publication, a very practical activity, assumes
                     an interested public and demands a market, requires broadcast expression rather than
                     private reflection or meditation, and rarely can be accomplished without a circle
                     or network of suppliers and distributors. In other words and perhaps more simply put,
                     its concern for being timely run counter to aspirations for transcendence. Even Blake,
                     whose most dear publications were limited to a very select audience, wrestled with
                     contradictions between his artistic vision and his work as a publisher. For this reason,
                     the study of Romantic publishers allows us to see through the ideology of Romantic
                     poetics and to appreciate better those that made possible, often at great personal
                     hazard, Romantic literature.’</span></p>

               <h2><span class="head">Conclusion</span></h2>
               <p>New digital resources offer students the ability to research and analyze print culture
                  of the Romantic period in ways that were not previously possible outside of archives.
                  Today students have an unprecedented level of access to self-publication; they may
                  blog, maintain a website, read and post reviews, comment on news stories, and participate
                  in forum discussions online. Throughout my course, I ask students to reflect on possible
                  analogies between the rise of the popular press in England during the Romantic era
                  and the rise of the Internet in our present digital era. What is perennially at stake
                  is our freedom of speech and of the press, that what we learn from the radical publishers
                  of the Romantic era is that there is a political if not ethical (as radicals often
                  conflate the two) mandate to use the Internet to enable and enfranchise others through
                  the open dissemination of information. </p>
               <p>Understanding the publication history of the Romantic literature is integral to understanding
                  the literature itself; the title of Percy Shelley’s early sonnet, “On Launching some
                  Bottles filled with Knowledge into the Bristol Channel,” reveals one of many ways
                  the poet found to disseminate his work, and Leigh Hunt and Mary Shelley fought to
                  publish Percy Shelley’s poetry after his death despite pressures to suppress it. This
                  struggle to publish was an essential aspect not only of Percy Shelley’s career but
                  also is apparent throughout Romantic literature. His troubled relationship with publication
                  is already figured in his poetry, much as Blake’s hard-won artistic independence,
                  won through securing his own printing press, is figured in his later works. </p>
