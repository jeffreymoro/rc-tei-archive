            <p class="noCount">The present volume intervenes in the notion that pedagogy is of a secondary concern
               to Blake scholars by showing how William Blake’s work can invigorate the classroom.
               Contributors use Blake’s inspiration to create new teaching methodologies, propose
               new assignments, engage new public audiences, and critically explore the emergence
               of new technological modalities. Famously difficult, Blake nevertheless constructs
               crucial dialogues in fields from the digital humanities to manuscript history and
               affect theory. This volume shows how teachers can take advantage of his holistic approach
               to pedagogy—his insistence that teaching is entangled with every part of our lives—to
               contest standard approaches to Blake in the literature classroom.</p>

            <p>In his resplendent though often overlooked watercolour <em>Age Teaching Youth </em>(ca. 1785-1790), William Blake crafts a complex visual meditation concerning the nature
               and function of teaching and learning (Figure 1). The scenes of pedagogy depicted
               in this image articulate Blake’s brilliant entanglement of a range of topics and concepts
               that, during the period, become critical for his work: experience and innocence, childhood
               and adulthood, authority and subordination, human society and the natural world. The
               drawing prompts its viewers to ponder one of Blake’s most fundamental questions concerning
               education: where, in what, or in whom does the power and right of pedagogical authorization
               rest? And the image does so by guiding its viewers through a range of much more subtle
               and nuanced queries. The sage, with his open book, looks like the teacher. Yet, the
               student who responds to its leaves by pointing to nature and the firmament beyond
               explicitly recalls the position of one of the most famous teachers of Western history:
               Plato’s gesture to the heavens from Raphael’s fresco <em>The School of Athens</em> (1509-1511). Meanwhile, the youth who wears the luminous flower-print dress in the
               foreground seems to ignore this scene of instruction entirely while intently studying
               his own book. The obscured left hand might suggest that this youth is drawing in a
               pose similar to what Blake would later reserve for the inward posture of his colour
               print <em>Newton</em> (1795), in which the natural philosopher is criticized for ignoring imagination by
               favoring an abstract nature found only within his own scientific representations.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>As with many of Blake’s works, <em>Age Teaching Youth</em> transforms classical figures in order to pose questions about the interplay between
                  reason and imagination. The expansive gesture of the Platonic student is interrupted
                  by the comparatively darker colors and lines of the Newtonian student—perhaps suggesting
                  that the visionary imagination is annihilated all too easily by the spectre of reason.
                  The Platonic student and the sage almost look like ghosts. Neglected entirely by the
                  Newtonian youth, they appear to fade into nothingness, as knowledge marches onward
                  to modernity. If “Age” represents visionary expansiveness and the entanglement of
                  knowledge, then the standardization and disciplining of learning found in the concentration
                  of the modern Newtonian “Youth” suggests a knowledge that learns nothing, as it focuses
                  only on what is in front of its own eyes.

                           Blake’s understanding of radical immanence as the intrusion of the infinite “into
                           all aspects of existence, and its vortical opening from every aspect of the world,”
                           on the one hand, and Gilles Deleuze’s mobilization of the virtual in his reversal
                           of Platonism, on the other (76). “Rather than see the actual world as deriving from
                           static forms,” Colebrook argues while interpreting Deleuze, “the actual world comes
                           into being by contracting all the potential differential relations . . . The world

            <p>The entangled composition of <em>Age Teaching Youth</em> reflects Blake’s complex attitudes toward teaching. Blake’s life is filled with scenes
               of education. G. E. Bentley, Jr. argues in <em>The Stranger from Paradise</em> (2001) that Blake “was clearly a natural teacher” and was probably far more “involved
               with teaching than we have any direct evidence for” (182, 185). Bentley, further,
               recalls several episodes illustrating that—as a teacher—Blake was more concerned with
               inspiration and compassion than technical skill. For instance, when George Richmond
               complains that he is experiencing difficulty in finding inspiration, Blake responds
               by turning to his wife: “It is just so with us, is it not, for weeks together, when
               the visions forsake us? What do we do then, Kate?” To which, Catherine Blake responds,
               “We kneel down and pray, Mr. Blake” (as cited by Bentley, 183). Another fascinating
               pedagogical episode from Bentley involves a young Samuel Palmer, who, upon first meeting
               Blake, is struck by his fixed “grey eyes” as well as a question that Blake asks the
               young artist: “Do you work with fear and trembling?” Palmer responds that he does,
               and Blake remarks: “Then . . . you’ll do” (ibid., 183). Finally, Bentley presents
               a short piece by Frederick Tatham recounting two scenes that reveal the role of social
               class in Blake’s pedagogy. The first involves a “sickly” young man who “passed [Blake’s]
               House daily” and “looked interesting &amp; eager” (ibid., 183). Blake begins to teach
               the young man, but his pupil quickly falls ill. In response, Blake and his wife “never
               omitted visiting him daily &amp; administering medicine, money, or Wine &amp; every other
               requisite until death relieved their adopted of all earthly care &amp; pain” (ibid., 184).
               In the second scene, Tatham recalls a story by Catherine Blake during the years that
               Blake taught drawing to “some families of high rank.” Such employment, Tatham continues,
               was not very profitable <span class="quote">‘for after his lesson he got into conversation with his pupils, &amp; was found so entertaining
                  &amp; pleasant, possessing such novel thoughts &amp; such eccentric notions, together with
                  such jocose hilarity &amp; amiable demeanour, that he frequently found himself asked to
                  stay [to] dinner . . . Thus he stopped whole days from his work at home . . . (ibid.,
                  184)’</span> As Tatham’s story goes, Blake was subsequently “recommended &amp; nearly obtained an
               Appointment to teach Drawing to the Royal Family,” but, of course, this shocked rather
               than delighted Blake, who quickly became worried that “he would have been expected
               to have lived in comparative respectability, not to say splendour, a mode of life,
               as he thought, derogatory to the simplicity of his designs &amp; deportment” (ibid., 184,
               185). As such, Blake is said to have rejected the offer, ended his appointments with
               his other students, and decided to get by on other sources of income. These anecdotes
               really only give us a glimpse of the kind of teacher that Blake might have been, but
               they also reveal a generous but eccentric mentor dedicated to transforming his students
               and making their lives better, not merely giving them marketable skills.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Blake’s approach to education stresses the entangled, holistic scene of teaching against
                  the emergent standardizing logic of nineteenth-century industrial capitalism, with
                  its tendency to devalue formerly-profitable artisanal trades that were becoming increasingly
                  mechanized in factories. As Saree Makdisi argues, Blake’s poetry is concerned with
                  an historical moment when “more and more peoples around the world were being violently
                  yoked together to serve the same system of production and exchange as . . . the nature,
                  cultures, and lifeworlds of England were being altered beyond recognition” (318).
                  The entanglement that Makdisi identifies in Blake’s work reaches into our own time,
                  with the ecological and political crises that Blake resists resonating with our own
                  struggles and questioning of the tidy periods we ascribe to such work in historical
                  criticism. Studying Blake’s refusal of the standardizing logic of capitalist production
                  can inspire us to reject the various ways that the contemporary university “Flog[s]
                  [its members] into following the Style of a Fool”: from the encroachment of market-logic
                  into our universities to the violence done to our students in the guise of standardized
                  testing and the exploitation and even starvation of adjunct labor. We believe that
                  passionate pedagogical reflection doesn’t end with the classroom and instead follow
                  Blake’s example by proposing that it is entangled with every part of our lives. Blake
                  reminds us that any pedagogical stance is political and must therefore come to grips
                  with what Henry Giroux has called “critical pedagogy.” For Giroux, critical pedagogy
                  is concerned with “helping students to ‘read’ the world critically” rather than “helping
                  students to ‘master’ the tools of reading” (2). It also requires that teachers be
                  as active as students in “the pursuit of truth and social change,” meaning that our
                  role as teachers is irreducibly connected to our roles as scholars, advocates, and
                  democratic citizens (198).

                           at the University of Colorado at Denver. To be clear, our account of Blake’s pedagogy
                           and critical pedagogy does not mean that we do not feel that the humanities have a
                           duty to make graduates employable. But we also recognize that our pedagogical role
                           does not end with employability.</span></div>

                  from the transformative work of Robert Gleckner, Mark Greenberg, David Gross, and
                  Thomas Pfau, few have explored Blake’s art and poetry in the context of pedagogy.

                  literary studies today when he argues that “teaching is only art at second hand” (185).
                  Few publications or other resources on teaching Romantic-period literature exist,
                  nor are there many publishing venues for scholars interested in sharing pedagogical
                  research.

                  </div> At best, teaching is presently most often seen in an analogous manner to how Brett
                  Hirsch views pedagogy in the digital humanities, as an “afterthought, tacked-on to
                  a statement . . . after the word ‘research’ (or its synonyms), often in parentheses”
                  (5). The general absence of scholarship in this area is particularly perplexing when
                  it comes to Blake given how difficult it is to teach his work in college courses,
                  as we and a number of our contributors confess. In order to address this and related
                  pedagogical issues, we have solicited and gathered together a range of essays that
                  tackle the most pressing common questions and concerns that both groups and individuals
                  now face when working to understand and discuss Blake’s art and poetry.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Inspired by our contributors’ essays, we have organized the introduction to this collection
               around a cluster of topics that enable explorations of Blake’s work in a variety of
               contexts. We focus on a range of common pedagogical matters: <em>methodologies</em> (Geraldine Friedman and Mark Lussier); <em>audiences</em> (Paige Morgan); <em>modalities</em> (Jason Whittaker); and <em>assignments</em> (Mike Goode and R. Paul Yoder). These clusters are critical for the investigation
               of almost any literary-historical figure or period but are particularly relevant to
               engagement with the multimodal complexities of Blake’s work. While each of the six
               essays addresses all four of the categories, individual contributions focus and elaborate
               primarily upon one of them. Additionally, we mobilize these topics with the intention
               of furthering Kate Singer’s provocation from the first post of <em>Romantic Circles</em>’ pioneering <em>Teaching Romanticism Blog</em>. “[W]hat happens when,” Singer asks, “even momentarily, we envision our praxis, our
               ideas, and our literary theories through the lens of pedagogy? Does pedagogy need
               to have a greater or different role in our thinking, and if so how?” We intend to
               use this issue of <em>Romantic Circles Pedagogy Commons</em> to demonstrate the various possibilities of a Blake Studies invigorated by a greater
               attention to pedagogy—as well as to say, unequivocally, <em>yes</em>: pedagogical scholarship is vitally important to the future of our field.</p>

                  and pedagogical interventions issued to stimulate new conversations about how to teach
                  and discuss Blake’s work. As such, articles in this collection responding most directly
                  to issues of methodology consider how different approaches to exploring Blake’s complex
                  work can provide students with tools for wrestling with the daunting nature of his
                  art and poetry. What diverse approaches, interpretive and explanatory grids, or critical,
                  historical, and theoretical lenses do we primarily adopt (both successfully and unsuccessfully)
                  when we set out to teach Blake’s poetry and art? </p>

                  <p>As a self-described non-expert of Blake’s work, Geraldine Friedman describes “developing
                     a pedagogy of non-mastery”—one in which she uses her “limitations as the basis of
                     a pedagogical methodology rather than seeing them as something simply to be overcome”
                     (par. 2). Turning to the work of Silvan Tomkins and Baruch Spinoza, Friedman relies
                     upon the affective movement in recent scholarship in order to foreground personal
                     stories of affective responses to Blake that serve as entrées into a pedagogical methodology
                     for conveying the profound difficulties that both faculty and students experience
                     when approaching his art and poetry for the first time. There is much to be said about
                     why students often react so strongly to Blake’s work, and this type of affective response
                     is something that Karen Swann and others have noted as well in recent years.

                              the illuminated books. Geraldine Friedman attended Swann’s workshop with us on “Learning
                              to Teach by Teaching Jerusalem” at the 2013 meeting of the North American Society

               <p>Friedman explores some of Blake’s most celebrated works: “All Religions Are One” (comp.
                  ca. 1798), “There is No Natural Religion” (comp. ca. 1788) and especially <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell </em>(1790) and <em>Milton</em> (comp. ca. 1804-1811). She explores these texts in order to create what, drawing
                  from the language of <em>The Marriage</em>, she calls the “improvement of sensual enjoyment” (Erdman 39). She finds this enjoyment
                  enhanced by directing student attention to <em>The William Blake Archive</em>, which, as she notes, provides rich digital editions of Blake’s plates when compared
                  to letterpress versions or even printed editions of his work. Friedman explains that
                  the <em>Blake Archive</em>’s textual transcriptions and magnification functions add to a readerly experience
                  of “sensual enjoyment.” These and related functions of the website help to immerse
                  students in the poetry and art as they zoom in and out, for instance, and are able
                  to appreciate Blake’s plates more intimately—thus breaking inside-outside distinctions
                  or at least blurring them further. Friedman’s analyses of <em>The Marriage</em> are among this collection’s most developed and nuanced—enabling textual and pictorial
                  close readings. She prompts readers to consider why faculty and students alike often
                  seek to read at a distance from rather than inside the Blakean text, and her close
                  readings actively immerse readers of the essay back into the poetry and art as her
                  affective theory of pedagogical response is itself generated out of these close readings
                  of Blakean text and pictorial image.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, as Friedman envisions what she plans to do differently in future courses
                  focusing on Blake, she enacts her essay’s affective theory at the level of its own
                  form and content. Readers will quickly recognize Friedman’s wonderful sense of humor,
                  which is both refreshing and enlivening and which productively fosters new affective
                  approaches to teaching Blake’s work. Teachers need to strive to foster pedagogical
                  methodologies that introduce honesty about our own affective responses to Blake’s
                  complex art and poetry. This type of approach to Blake is one that took some time
                  for Friedman to arrive at and accept during her teaching career, but now that she
                  has paved the way, other faculty need not suffer or struggle in precisely these same
                  ways and can instead choose to adopt similar pedagogical methodologies of “non-mastery.”
                  </p>
               <p>Mark Lussier’s contribution at first appears as if it is the least concerned with
                  giving teachers practical tools for addressing Blake in the classroom. Yet his piece
                  is also a powerful exemplification of what a Blakean approach to teaching might look
                  like in literary studies. Lussier intricately deconstructs Blake’s form of mirror
                  writing as a pedagogical method designed to induce what Alain Badiou has called “infinite
                  thought.” Badiou associates infinite thought explicitly with the transfinite calculus
                  of Georg Cantor and argues that such thinking can only occur with mathematics. Lussier
                  shows how the <span class="foreign">mise-en-abyme</span> of Blake’s mirror writing proves that such thought can be found within illuminated
                  poetry as well because it forces readers “to open the doors of perception” (par. 4)
                  by fusing “the psychological and textual within the meta-textual zone of the pedagogical
                  in the service of cultivating salvific forms of self-annihilation” (par. 5). For Lussier,
                  Blake’s difficulty is the central point for studying him because Blake <em>directly</em> works against the sense of separation and individuation that is a product of Jacques
                  Lacan’s mirror stage. Blake’s mirror shatters Lacan’s mirror.</p>
               <p>In the afterword of <em>Romantic Dharma: The Emergence of Buddhism into Nineteenth-Century Europe </em>(2011), Lussier rejects what he calls the Western pedagogy of compulsion, and its
                  obsession with defining achievement by appealing to external rewards, for the more
                  compassionate approach to teaching signified in Buddhist practice. Lussier’s pedagogy
                  of compassion “establishes and encourages discovery grounded in the present moment
                  of a student’s engagement with the material at hand and the personal growth that results
                  when a student makes the material his or her own” (185). Lussier develops confidence
                  among his students by emphasizing a gradual growth of knowledge, a familiarity with
                  the ethics associated with that knowledge, and a wisdom derived from having to give
                  things up and leave them behind. Lussier sees Blake’s invocation of self-annihilation
                  as a pedagogical tool with a primary outcome: the transformation of the student has
                  to be self-directed because only the individual can choose to enact this subjective
                  activity.</p>
               <p>Lussier’s piece for this collection acts as a textual enactment of his compassionate
                  pedagogy. He focuses on how the notion of a personal reception of Blake’s work is
                  annihilated by the inter-operational textual dynamics of the illuminated books. The
                  Blakean scene of pedagogy is one of profound <em>unlearning</em>, as one interpretation after another is subjected to a powerful machine of contradictory
                  viewpoints and images destroying one subjective perception after another. “The mirrored
                  text provides <em>structure</em>,” Lussier argues, “[and] pursues transformative reception dynamics in an attempt
                  to create a communitarian model capable of addressing all readers without tyrannizing
                  any of them” (par. 14). The double movement of Blakean pedagogy is crucial yet also
                  unendingly complex and thorny. By pointing out these structures and dynamics, Lussier
                  argues that teachers seeking to make Blake more palatable miss the point of his transformational
                  challenge. Self-annihilation is difficult, but the pursuit of wisdom, compassion,
                  and democratic community are well worth the effort. In other words, if Friedman’s
                  piece gives a methodological approach to understand the ways in which students and
                  teachers avoid immersion in Blake’s text, Lussier shows the benefits of facing the
                  Blakean abyss head on.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Audiences</span></h2>
               <p>When considering our audiences as teachers, Friedman and Lussier show us that different
                  students have very different needs when encountering Blake’s work. Paige Morgan’s
                  contribution to this volume dramatically expands upon issues concerning audience and
                  reception in the context of Blake’s various projects. Morgan’s work does so by revealing
                  that ostensibly straightforward questions concerning student audiences or faculty-student
                  pedagogical dialectics quickly snowball into many more complex inquiries: with whom
                  do we talk about Blake when we talk about Blake? </p>
               <p>As Friedman notes, graduate students are much more heavily invested in feeling the
                  need to master Blake’s work, as we often are as faculty members, but this phenomenon
                  quickly becomes meaningfully different from the challenges (as well as the novel opportunities)
                  that open up when discussing Blake outside the academy. The Blake Society is a British
                  non-profit charity organization that, as Morgan explains, is devoted to “working towards
                  greater recognition of Blake” but that, unlike the academy, does not have “a specific
                  argument or narrative about Blake that [they] are trying to advance” (par. 14). Instead,
                  founded and organized upon principles more closely related to Michael Warner’s concept
                  of the “counterpublic” or Michel Foucault’s notion of “heterotopic space” (Morgan
                  par. 24), the Blake Society’s ultimate goal is to create multiple publics who are
                  free to engage and experiment with Blake’s works and their various traditions. Morgan’s
                  essay questions what “pedagogy” means beyond the Ivory Tower while showing the complications
                  of a group of Blake enthusiasts who radically question the role of teaching when no
                  one believes in the pedagogical authority that too many academics take for granted.</p>
               <p>Like many of our contributors, Morgan begins with a story of personal engagements
                  with Blake’s art and poetry. She narrates these experiences through a trajectory that
                  links her work as a student to her career as a teaching faculty member and an Executive
                  Committee Member and Trustee of the Blake Society. Morgan’s story underscores experiences
                  familiar to us and to many of our students. A series of formal engagements revealed
                  to her the need to foster in her own students an escape from the “mind-forg’d manacles”
                  that oftentimes come hand-in-hand with the academy’s burdensome practices (as cited
                  by Morgan par. 5). It is Morgan’s hope that students might break free from those restrictive
                  institutional settings in favor of experiences with Blake far afield from the college
                  campus through opportunities like those offered by the Blake Society. Morgan’s essay,
                  further, describes the type of labor involved in a non-profit charity organization
                  that actively runs on little funding and the types of events that it nonetheless achieves
                  despite apparent financial limitations. Blake Society events are often shockingly
                  antinomian in nature, as in Morgan’s example of a society occasion in which disadvantaged
                  British school children were brought together at the London Zoo to recite Blake’s
                  “The Tyger” to actual tigers living in captivity. Such an example reveals the crux
                  of Morgan’s essay and its major intervention in this volume, as it exposes just how
                  important it is to stress that academics cannot lay an exclusive claim to understanding,
                  appreciating, or engaging with Blake’s poetry and art. </p>

                     transformative manner?</p>
               </div>
               <p>Jason Whittaker opens his essay with a description of the contemporary publishing
                  scene of digital books, expectations about reading habits in the college classroom,
                  and his own general preference for e-books over traditional print modalities. The
                  result of the present move to e-books signals, for Whittaker, that “we have arrived
                  at a crucial stage in the use of Blake in the classroom, where mobile electronic devices
                  will soon be ubiquitous” (par. 2). Whittaker’s anecdotes about the reading habits
                  of his students, who increasingly turn up to class with e-readers instead of traditional
                  books, might signal that we are quickly arriving at the usage of these types of e-readers
                  and other technologies in pedagogical situations as the norm rather than as the exception.
                  However, many students might now be using e-books, but many others still do not—either
                  because they cannot afford them or because they still prefer print books. A further
                  complication is the fact that tablets and mobile devices make it more likely that
                  such technologies will not be provided by universities or colleges but, instead, will
                  need to be purchased by students and their parents for use in the classroom. Noting
                  the economic inequalities of this rapidly complexifying pedagogical situation, Whittaker
                  employs his narratives concerning personal reading habits, teaching, and learning
                  in order to take up an “issue of digital pedagogy that is especially pertinent to
                  Blake studies: what is it that students are actually reading and what role will e-books
                  have in education in contrast to traditional print formats?” (par. 2). Blake is especially
                  pertinent here in raising these questions concerning traditional versus e-book modalities
                  because the plates of his illuminated manuscripts continuously force us to confront
                  the nature and function of reading practices. </p>

                  <p>Whittaker’s goal in raising questions about teaching Blake’s composite art through
                     new electronic devices does not mean a discarding of print in the classroom, as there
                     will continue to be a place for David Erdman’s edition, for example.

                              Archive maintain easily-searchable digital copies of the Erdman edition on their sites.
                              The former also has a concordance that interfaces with their online Erdman edition.</span></div>
                     </div> The role of Blake’s work in relation to print has been questioned for several decades
                     now by scholars precisely because Blake hoped that illuminated printing would become
                     a new media platform that would make obsolete his need for letterpress printing methods.
                     Blake’s process is inherently antithetical to letterpress printing methods, and this
                     is why Blake’s art and poetry have been taken up so often in early digital engagements
                     with his work. Whittaker argues for an analogue approach to Blake, seeing the material
                     originality of the illuminated prints as crucial for understanding them—even despite
                     the fact that most students and scholars of Blake never see these original prints.</p>

                     experiencing digital textuality was the screen of a desktop or laptop computer. For
                     this reason, it is clear why print formats would be preferred for most readers and
                     teachers of the period. Hardware and software technologies have, in the interim decade,
                     increased the ubiquity of e-readers, creating a watershed moment that rivals the invention
                     of the PC or the development of the Web. This change radically challenges the traditional
                     teaching of literature. Further, the scholarly temptations to idealize certain digital
                     projects like the <em>Blake Archive</em> for use in college classrooms can be problematic when they obscure the fact that there
                     are whole sets of academic and institutional speeds associated with these now-aging
                     modalities.

                  <p>R. Paul Yoder’s and Mike Goode’s respective essays represent the pithy, provocative,
                     and playful types of contributions that we requested from our contributors and reflect
                     on assigning Blake’s work in a variety of contexts. In undergraduate institutions
                     focused largely on discussion-based classrooms, the most often taught texts are <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em> (1794), <em>The Marriage</em>, the so-called “Lambeth Books” (e.g., <em>The Book of Los </em>[1795] and <em>The [First] Book of Urizen</em> [1794]), as well as the Continental prophecies, and especially <em>America a Prophecy </em>(1793) and <em>Europe a Prophecy </em>(1794). In fact, faculty are not likely to move beyond these books in introductory
                     survey courses in Romanticism. Yoder notes that <em>Songs </em>is almost certainly Blake’s most often taught work but adds that, because so many
                     different copies of that work exist, there are a range of difficulties in teaching
                     the text in college classrooms. Bentley lists thirty-four different total orderings
                     of the plates of <em>Innocence</em> and the combined <em>Songs</em>, and Yoder explains that faculty almost always assign only one of the orderings,
                     focus on a letterpress edition of the <em>Songs</em>, or use the <em>Blake Archive</em> to show the variety of plates as they teach or have students complete readings (Yoder
                     par. 1). Drawing upon Neil Fraistat’s argument concerning poetic sequencing from <em>The Poem and the Book </em>(1985), Yoder focuses especially on the notion of “contexture,” which, he explains,
                     “results from the poets’ deliberate sequencing of poems in Romantic poetry collections”
                     (par. 3). Yoder’s pedagogical investigation of the <em>Songs </em>complicates Fraistat’s approach, as each different copy has its own contexture that
                     shifts (often significantly) from copy to copy across, for instance, the thirteen
                     different contextures presently offered by the <em>Blake Archive</em>.

                              narrative sequencing in Blake’s work.</span></div>
                     </div> To make matters even more complicated, later owners of individual copies of the <em>Songs</em> would oftentimes reorder their particular copies, as Yoder points out.</p>
               </div>
               <p>To illustrate these issues to students, Yoder envisions a new type of class focusing
                  entirely on the <em>Songs</em>. Such a course would ultimately ask a student or group to be assigned a particular
                  contextural sequence from the <em>Songs</em> and to become the authority of their copy during the rest of the term. For Yoder,
                  this type of assignment would come closest in the classroom to experiencing the <em>Songs</em> in their totality. Blake’s approach to creating the <em>Songs </em>is one in which, as Yoder notes, a certain level of <em>play</em> is built into the design process. Teachers and students alike must embrace play in
                  order to experience the basic nature and function of this work. Such pedagogical approaches
                  to assignments explore the difference between active and passive forms of engagement

                     students to understand how W. J. T. Mitchell’s notion of Blake’s “composite art” decomposes
                     as the Web engages with Blake’s original poetry, painting, and printmaking.

                     art into so many textual and pictorial pieces, “atomic artistic particles much smaller
                     than the unit of the book, poem, plate, or picture” (par. 1). Goode’s essay critiques
                     the reliance of so many scholars on Mitchell’s belief about the composite nature of
                     Blake’s art. Instead of bemoaning the digital atomization of Blake’s work, Goode sees

                     discussion concerning the nature and function of the proverb form and Blake’s proverbs
                     in particular. Goode’s follow-up project, “Re-searching for Blake’s Hellish Wisdom,”
                     is geared for advanced undergraduates or graduate students and requires students to

                  an encounter with Blakean transformative experiences (par. 1). Accordingly, the projects
                  that he offers have the potential for producing a feedback effect in which students
                  as well as professional scholars who had previously been convinced of Mitchell’s composite
                  art might start to consider the viral capabilities of Blake’s artworks. </p>

               <h2><span class="head">Conclusion: Blakean Pedagogy </span></h2>
               <p>In very different ways, the authors of this volume intervene in contemporary education
                  by applying what we call <em>Blakean pedagogy</em>: a style of teaching that has the potential to change both students and teachers.
                  Blakean pedagogy encourages visionary experience, entangled knowledge, and a belief
                  that learning is part of our lives as citizens. Respectively, Blakean pedagogy rejects
                  calculated technique, discrete disciplinary knowledge, and the assumption that education
                  exists only to develop specific, marketable skills. In the spirit of our contributors,
                  who explore how these profound experiences appear in some of the least expected places,
                  we have chosen to conclude this introduction by relating our own transformative scenes
                  of Blakean pedagogy.</p>

               <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">Roger:</span> I love to teach Blake because he frightens me. I never know where the conversation
                  is going to go. I have no idea what students will think as they walk out of the classroom
                  with Blake’s visions of body-horror and hellfire burning in their heads. One of the
                  best evaluations I ever received from a student appeared on RateMyProfessors.com and
                  was associated with a class on Blake: “I’m not sure if I learned anything, but he
                  sure boggled my mind a bit.” The worst response came from a graduate student who,
                  evidently, didn’t realize that I was a Blake scholar. “I don’t get why anyone would
                  write about this guy,” she said off-handedly during our discussion, “he’s too strange.”
                  Robert Early, my colleague and fellow Blakean at Saint Louis University (SLU), first
                  showed me the unpredictable pedagogical potential of <em>Urizen</em> during a session he led in my Spring 2002 “Introduction to Poetry” class. The class
                  was designed to allow students to understand the fundamentals of poetic expression.
                  I adopted Helen Vendler’s <em>Poems, Poets, Poetry</em> (1997), a book that I had studied during my undergraduate years, along with the Dover
                  edition of Blake’s <em>Urizen</em> and T. S. Eliot’s <em>Four Quartets</em> (1943). As Bob entered my classroom, I was skeptical. I’d been a big fan of Eliot’s
                  work and was eager to outline the musicality of his verse. I wanted the Blake session
                  to finish before it began.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Bob asked the class to sit in a circle. I sat directly in front of the crucifix hung
                  in a prominent place in every classroom at SLU. I tried to make a few jokes to start
                  the class, but I looked at Bob and realized that he wasn’t in the mood for levity.
                  There was a strange fire burning in his eyes as I introduced him. He was clearly somewhere
                  else. </p>
               <p class="noCount">“So, let’s take a look at the preludium, shall we?” Bob began his lesson somewhat
                  abruptly, but the students looked eager to begin. “Blake is such an individual thinker.
                  He’s not like most of the people you’ll read in this class.” My brain wandered to
                  Eliot’s essay on Blake, in which the modernist poet praises Blake for the “naked[ness]”
                  of his vision but is ultimately condescending with regards to his lack of poetic education
                  and calls Blake’s work formless (90, 91). “[T]he weakness of the long poems is certainly
                  not that they are too visionary, too remote from the world,” Eliot contends, “It is
                  that Blake did not see enough, became too much occupied with ideas” (91). </p>
               <p class="noCount">Then Bob’s voice started booming. “Lo, a shadow of horror is risen / In Eternity!”
                  (70). The students looked blank-eyed and remained completely silent. “Who is this
                  shadow?” A hand slowly and (I could tell) nervously raised. “Yes?” </p>
               <p class="noCount">“Urizen?” </p>
               <p class="noCount">Bob looked pleased but also disappointed. “Yes, but who is Urizen? The shadow of horror?
                  And who says this?” </p>
               <p class="noCount">More silence. </p>
               <p class="noCount">“Eternals?” The meekness of the students was in a harsh contrast to Bob’s otherworldly
                  enthusiasm. </p>
               <p class="noCount">Still more silence.</p>
               <p class="noCount">“Well, the poem says, ‘Some said / ‘It is Urizen’ but then the poem says that the
                  shadow is unknown” (70). </p>
               <p class="noCount">Bob’s eyes widened. “Yes! That’s right. Why?” </p>
               <p class="noCount">Silence.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Silence.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Silence. </p>
               <p class="noCount">(This was the first time I had invited someone else as a guest speaker in my class.
                  It was only my third semester teaching and my first literature class. During the previous
                  year, I had remarked to someone that the most frightening thing to me about teaching
                  wasn’t grading or lecturing. It was the knowledge that, if I stopped talking, the
                  class would break down. Silence was entropy: eating away at the reality of my classroom
                  and convincing the students that I had nothing real to contribute to their lives).
                  </p>
               <p class="noCount">More silence. Bob was clearly more patient with silence than most people. </p>
               <p class="noCount">“Could it be,” another student seemed to grow a bit with confidence, “that both Urizen
                  and the eternals are brought into existence by naming each other? Meaning: their anxiety
                  creates . . . um . . . themselves?” </p>
               <p class="noCount">“Yeah! Yeah! When does this happen?”</p>
               <p class="noCount">We sat there for quite a while pondering this question. It created a space in the
                  middle of the classroom where time slowed down. The silence started becoming full
                  and substantial, rather than entropic—almost, for a moment, a “universe of starry
                  majesty” (109). Bob’s voice passed through the space like a ghost phasing through
                  a wall: “isn’t it happening now?”</p>
               <p class="noCount">The class ended. I was fascinated by the fact that we spent an entire hour talking
                  about three lines, that these three lines so clearly articulated my own anxieties
                  about teaching literature, and that this anxiety took on a meta-textual resonance
                  that lured the class into further reflection. What I feared the most, the silence
                  of an empty classroom, became the very thing that was most valuable about Bob’s lesson.
                  Blake had anticipated my own response and implicated me in the violence occurring
                  in <em>Urizen</em>. Such experiences, I learned, were common for teachers of Blake, and this sense of
                  entanglement played a large part of my own transformation into a Blake scholar.</p>

               <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">Andrew:</span> On Halloween a few years ago—perhaps an auspicious coincidence—I had scheduled to
                  teach my first rare-books event at Union so that my students, who had been very much
                  struggling with Blake’s work (and especially <em>The Marriage</em>), could investigate his poetry and art in the context of the Trianon Press facsimile
                  editions. My emeritus colleague, mentor, and friend, Jim McCord, who had recently
                  retired from the very tenure line that I had just taken up, kindly took me under his
                  wing and showed me the obvious treasures as well as wonderful secrets of our Romantic
                  rare-book materials. Because our institution was founded during the age of Romanticism
                  in 1795, as I love to remind my students, we have a lot of incredible late-eighteenth-
                  and early-nineteenth-century materials among our rare-books collection and especially
                  for a small liberal arts college. Jim helped me to pull a remarkable set of books
                  to share with my small, advanced-level Romantics seminar: the beautiful Trianon versions
                  of <em>The Marriage</em>, <em>America</em>, <em>Europe</em>, <em>The Book of Los</em>, <em>The Book of Urizen</em>, and the <em>Songs</em>. We placed these books around a long rectangular table at our rare books library
                  and intercalated them with a number of exceedingly rare Romantic-age materials.</p>
               <p class="noCount">I should stress that this was my first term teaching at Union, and I was petrified
                  to be leading undergraduates through our rare books room and particularly with my
                  colleagues from the English department and library joining us that day. Perhaps in
                  order to deal with these fears, I decided to over-prepare for that afternoon by also
                  bringing in my laptop, a projector, and a drop-down screen to display Blake’s “Proverbs
                  of Hell” from an edition of <em>The Marriage </em>available at the <em>Blake Archive</em>. I had hoped to remind my students to seek out the proverbs as they carefully leafed
                  through the Trianon facsimile. As my students moved cautiously around the dimly-lit
                  table, they gradually gained confidence in engaging with the pillowed books in front
                  of them—slowly picking them up, cradling their spines, and opening the Blake facsimiles
                  to reveal their stunning illuminated plates. As they did so the room suddenly went
                  absolutely silent, almost as if we had entered a museum or cathedral instead of a
                  rare books library. For half an hour these young men and women, one of the most engaging
                  and talkative groups of my career thus far, quietly peered into these materials, warily
                  touching their delicate pages while variously gazing at and studying Blake’s plates
                  and other materials with a level of hushed intensity that I had never witnessed before
                  in my teaching.</p>
               <p class="noCount">And then that day’s most interesting moment happened: one of my particularly precocious
                  students stopped to look at the projection of the <em>Blake Archive </em>and apparently gravitated to one of Blake’s proverbs. I asked her what she was doing
                  and gently prompted her to return to the rare books themselves, the class’ obvious
                  focus of attention, or so I had hoped. But out of curiosity, I asked her which proverb
                  she had been reading. “That one,” she said as she began to walk away, pointing to
                  the grainy line’s image on the screen and reading aloud to me her unsurprising choice
                  given the heavily formalized pedagogical scene of that day’s class, “In seed time
                  learn, in harvest teach, in winter enjoy” (35). “What does that mean?,” she asked,
                  “I read that one over a few times last night.” Other nearby students looked up from
                  their materials, and within a few seconds everyone around the table was listening
                  intently to what would be my reply. “Well, I’m not so sure,” I said, “What <em>does</em> this proverb mean? What do <em>you</em> make of it? And why did you pick this one? To be honest, it has never been one of
                  my favorites.” For the next forty minutes, the remainder of our time together that
                  afternoon, my students and I gathered around the humming projector and wobbly drop-down
                  screen in a dark corner of the room to discuss as a group this and other of the proverbs
                  from the <em>Blake Archive</em>’s digital edition.</p>
               <p class="noCount">At first I felt completely defeated, thinking to myself that we could have been anywhere
                  instead of a rare books library to engage in this type of discussion. “We might as
                  well be back in the classroom!,” my mind raced. But then it dawned upon me that all
                  of my recent research concerning the “composite art” and the much-debated differences
                  between the “textual” versus the “physical” versus the “digital” Blake were suddenly
                  playing out around us in the room and right before our very eyes. We <em>could</em> have been just about anywhere in studying and discussing together this version of
                  Blake—and that was precisely the point—because Blake’s art and poetry might certainly
                  live in the rarefied spaces of libraries and museums, but it also lives in print and
                  in readily accessible hardcopies and digital archives as well as far-flung online
                  spaces. Blake lives in all of these places and spaces and many others besides. This
                  is something that I certainly knew to be true in a scholarly sense but that I had
                  never fully appreciated or experienced in a pedagogical way, and this scene of teaching
                  and learning had brought the criticism and theory to life for me and, through me,
                  for my students that afternoon at the rare books room. Indeed, I should have paid
                  a lot more attention to my student’s chosen proverb a long time ago: “In seed time
                  learn, in harvest teach, in winter enjoy.”</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">“Entanglement” in this introduction resonates with Claire Colebrook’s comparison between
               Blake’s understanding of radical immanence as the intrusion of the infinite “into
               all aspects of existence, and its vortical opening from every aspect of the world,”
               on the one hand, and Gilles Deleuze’s mobilization of the <em>virtual</em> in his reversal of Platonism, on the other (76). “Rather than see the actual world
               as deriving from static forms,” Colebrook argues while interpreting Deleuze, “the
               actual world comes into being by contracting all the potential differential relations
               . . . The world we know and live in is composed of actual relations among differences,
               but it is possible to intuit the virtual differential forces from which actuality
               has been contracted” (xiv).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">The scholarship on critical pedagogy is much too vast to review here adequately. For
               a more comprehensive introduction, see the online reading list that Martin Ryder maintains
               at the University of Colorado at Denver. To be clear, our account of Blake’s pedagogy
               and critical pedagogy does not mean that we do not feel that the humanities have a
               duty to make graduates employable. But we also recognize that our pedagogical role
               does not end with employability.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               Boston. Swann’s presentation and the essay that has since emerged from it have been
               centrally motivating factors behind the present volume, precisely because of the types

         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">One of the many reasons why the Erdman edition remains indispensable for contemporary
               Blake scholars is the fact that the Erdman estate keeps his scholarship perpetually
               in the public domain. Both Nelson Hilton’s <em>Blake Digital Text Project</em> and the <em>Blake Archive</em> maintain easily-searchable digital copies of the Erdman edition on their sites. The
               former also has a concordance that interfaces with their online Erdman edition.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">N. Katherine Hayles’ consideration of the <em>Blake Archive</em> in “Translating Media: Why We Should Rethink Textuality” is important here too, as
               she explores the material difference between the bits of the archive and the print
               materiality of Blake’s plates and paper. It might also be worth discussing the place
               of a program like Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in this discussion. OCR takes
               a digital image and then uses probabilistic logic to match that image with the closest
               machine-readable character. One of the problems mentioned by the Santa Cruz Reading
               Group in their 1984 review of the Erdman edition is the difference between printed
               typography and Blake’s etched letters. When we confront a character deemed similar
               by an OCR algorithm, we see a further layer of separation between Blake’s original
               material prints, their pixelated simulation in digital images, and the machine-readable
               algorithmic output of OCR.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
