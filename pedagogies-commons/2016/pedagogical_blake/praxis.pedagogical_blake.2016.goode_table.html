                        (ACES) newsletter. The article refers to the declining economic prospects of journalism,
                        and, with it, copyediting, making reference to the fact that former Society President
                        John McIntyre had been laid off in the past year by <span style="font-style:italic">The Baltimore Sun</span>. The comment is from a copy editor disaffected with the ineffectiveness of ACES.
                        He closes by writing, “A shout out to John McIntyre! Remember: The cut worm forgives
                        the plow!”</td>
                     <td class="Normal_(Web)">This is a complicated citation. It interprets the proverb to mean something like “one
                        can or should accept one’s sacrifice in the service of a greater good” (in this case,
                        the greater good of keeping a failing industry afloat). However, in context, this
                        is clearly a sarcastic invocation of the proverb, implicitly suggesting that the proverb’s
                        “wisdom” is self-serving to supporters of plow-wielders and does not issue from the
                        mouths of cut worms.</td>

                  <li class="item" id="d2466e427">“Worm” can either signify an actual worm or serve as a metaphor for a wide range of
                     things, including a human (either an everyman figure or a more specific person, like
                     a soldier, an employee, or a war-torn people), any animal, any entity that lacks the
                     capability of exacting revenge, and a word.</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d2466e428">The literal meaning of “cut worm” signifies different things to different people,
                     including harmed worms, dead or sacrificed worms, or two live worms. </li>
                  <li class="item" id="d2466e429">“Forgives” signifies different things to different people, including something like
                     “accepts as true” and “accepts as good.” In the case of the latter, some translate
                     “good” as “beneficial to the greater good” and others as “beneficial to oneself.”
                     </li>
                  <li class="item" id="d2466e430">“Plow” or the act of plowing becomes a metaphor for a wide range of things, including
                     a psychological challenge to an individual’s sense of self, a sharp tool of agricultural
                     cultivation, anything that causes individual suffering or pain, the activity of subsistence
                     living, the activity of cultural or national transformation/improvement, a powerful
                     force heedless to anything other than itself, the course of history, the course of

                  <li class="item" id="d2466e431">Some people cite the proverb as if its wisdom is directed to a potential cut worm,
                     whereas others cite it as if its wisdom is for a potential plow or plow-wielder. </li>
                  <li class="item" id="d2466e432">Depending on context, the proverb-citer may be asking her hearer to accept (or, alternatively,
                     to lament others’ acceptance of) a plow that has already come through, to encourage
                     an approach to future plowing that could or inevitably will happen, or actually to
                     engage in plowing.</li>
