            <p class="noCount">This article explores what Blakean pedagogy can be through an examination of the United
               Kingdom’s Blake Society, a non-academic organization. The Blake Society works to promote
               greater recognition of William Blake’s life and activities but eschews the goals of
               scholarly knowledge production that often accompany academic Blake activities. Through
               an exploration of the Blake Society’s pedagogy, this article asks what resources and
               authority are necessary to do things with Blake.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">The Blake Society and Pedagogy Outside the Academy</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>Autumn, 1999: I am an undergraduate at Seattle Pacific University sitting in an 8:00
               a.m. course—a survey of British literature from 1700 to the present day. I have a
               Norton anthology balanced on the tiny desk platform, and the book is open to the section
               of poems by William Blake. The professor is a Victorianist, but today she has invited
               one of her colleagues specializing in Blake to give a guest lecture. The poems included
               in the Norton are culled from the <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em> (1794), and include “The Tyger” and “Introduction.” I do not remember the exact content
               of the guest lecturer’s points. What I remember is feeling quietly nonplussed at the
               apparent simplicity of Blake’s poems. The guest lecturer seems to see them as entry
               points into something rich and vast. I’m not sure how—though I am fiercely determined
               to be a good student—to put all of my energies into studying literature, and so I
               am certain that he is right. I just need to work harder to understand. But when the
               class meets again two days later, we have moved on to William Wordsworth and Samuel
               Taylor Coleridge, as the survey dictates, and I am pouring myself into their work
               and feeling happier because it seems like there is more to analyze and more with which
               to do things. I know that I want to go to graduate school in English and become a
               professor like the professors who have taught me. I am good at close reading and at
               being very, very determined in my work. I want desperately to be part of a community
               that matches my enthusiasms, and the English Department and then graduate school seem
               like my best shot.</p>
            <p>January, 2000: I am starting a senior capstone course on Blake, which was not my plan.
               My plan was to take a senior capstone course on Jane Austen as part of the university’s
               “European Quarter” study-abroad program in the spring. However, that burning determination
               to put all of my energies into my studies has been so successful that I have come
               down with mono. European Quarter no longer feels like an option, and the Blake capstone
               course is the only way of meeting my graduation requirements. I’m sort of okay with
               this, I think, because I’m not actually all that fond of Austen. The professor of
               the Blake capstone is the same guest lecturer from the previous year. Blake doesn’t
               particularly capture my interest but, really, how difficult can it be? </p>
            <p>February, 2000: I am miserable. I don’t understand what to do with Blake, I have no
               idea how I will write the final essay for this course, and I don’t understand what
               is so wrong with me that I cannot produce close readings that go anywhere. I read
               Northrop Frye’s <em>Fearful Symmetry</em> (1947)—or I try to read it at least. I don’t feel like I retain anything from Frye’s
               book or from Kathleen Raine’s or Hazard Adams’s respective books either. I feel like
               a failure, and this results in my sobbing at the professor during his office hours—multiple
               times. My professor is sympathetic and encourages me to take a nap, to sleep more,
               to celebrate Lent by eating a chocolate bar each day (i.e., to try indulging myself
               rather than self-deprivation). I see his point, though I don’t want a chocolate bar.
               I am so frustrated that I hardly know what I do want.</p>
            <p>Thinking back on that miserable February in hindsight, I realize how much of my anguish
               was about being part of a system that I did not understand. I knew, of course, the
               basic components: students, professors, assignments, grades, courses, and degrees.
               I had embraced the system and was within it by my own choice, but I did not understand
               the larger scope beyond those components. What was happening to the frantic energy
               that I was generating? How did the activities of my coursework and of my university
               fit into the larger world?</p>
            <p>Fifteen years and a Ph.D. later—and in my eleventh year of teaching—I still encounter
               students who have found themselves in a mental space much like the one I found myself
               in with my Blake capstone course: striving to make progress and feeling trapped by
               the conventions of the classroom—assignments, deadlines, grades. Often, I can help
               them, and I also ask questions that allow them to help themselves. I can assure them
               honestly that the particular misery that they’re feeling while studying Blake’s work
               is not in any way a sign of ignorance or intellectual inadequacy. I try to show the
               same gentleness and compassion that I was shown as a student. However, the situation
               isn’t a simple question of compassionate pedagogy. My students’ anguish is an example
               of “mind-forg’d manacles” (Erdman 27) and is directly connected with the institutional
               practices of academia. Whatever understanding and compassion I offer might soothe,
               but it won’t unlock the constraints that they’re facing. Only they can figure out
               how to direct their own energies and the significance of channeling those energies
               in one direction versus another. The problem isn’t that academic endeavors aren’t
               worth it. Many difficult things are worthwhile, despite causing pain and anxiety.
               The problem is in understanding <em>how</em> the experience is worthwhile and in the particular context of each student’s individual
               situation. While I reassure my students that, yes, they will get through these difficult
               periods, the occasions make me think about Blake’s harsh words about teachers throughout
               his work.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Of course, teaching and learning are widespread topics in Blake’s writings. Some instruction
                  is beneficial while other instruction is not. Many instructors today would, I suspect,
                  agree with the “wisest of the Ancients [who] considerd [sic] what is not too Explicit
                  as the fittest for Instruction because it rouzes the faculties to act” (Erdman 702).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>All parenthetical page citations for William Blake quotes refer to David V. Erdman’s
                           edition of The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake (1988).</span></div>
                  </div> Clearly, Blake knows that the activity of instruction goes on everywhere and in many
                  and varied forms. On the subject of teachers—in the sense of a professional occupation—there
                  is less ambiguity. The word he uses throughout is “hireling,” and Blake is unambiguously
                  critical (e.g., Erdman 473, 635, 641, etc.). Hirelings are associated with kings,
                  courts, camps, and universities—equating those who teach for money with politicians
                  and soldiers. These hireling instructors are accused of propagating an uncultivated
                  life, being lazy and non-industrious, and participating in corrupt labor practices
                  that build upon Blake’s own advances without giving him proper credit (Erdman 537).
                  Blake’s critique is thus one of institutionalized teaching generally, but there are
                  always particular exceptions. Similar critiques of educators are still being made
                  today of course, and from an academic perspective, these are usually made by people
                  who aren’t fully aware of the academic requirements of teaching and scholarly research
                  or the energy demands that the system makes on its members. Still, if more education
                  isn’t the answer, then what is involved in <em>not teaching</em> Blake’s work?</p>
            </div>
            <p>In this essay, I examine one set of answers to that question and do so by using my
               experiences volunteering as a trustee of the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.blakesociety.org">Blake Society</a>, a non-profit charity organization based in London, England. I first became aware
               of the Blake Society in 2007, when I spoke at the “Blake at 250 Conference” held at
               the University of York, and I became a member of its Executive Committee in 2009.
               Being part of the Blake Society has given me a new perspective on the activity of
               doing things with Blake’s work—in terms not only of the range of things possible but
               also the labor required and the challenges that appear. I investigate these topics
               because they present interesting contrasts with the ways in which academic scholars
               and instructors often work with Blake. Thus, I seek to explore and discuss some of
               the questions that have occurred and continue to arise for the Blake Society and to
               relate its practices in navigating them. This exploration could address many lines
               of inquiry of course, but for the sake of directness, I investigate in this essay
               two interrelated questions: What resources are necessary to do things with Blake?
               And where rests the authority to do things with Blake?</p>
            <p>The current incarnation of the Blake Society, as its website explains, was begun in
               1985 “on the instigation of Donald Reeves, the then rector of St. James’s Piccadilly,”
               where Blake himself was baptized (“Brief History”). <em>Instigated</em> is the operative word; what started has since been passed on, and the Blake Society
               is very much a product of its members and leadership. When it began, it was a society
               constituted by people for whom Blake was somewhere between a luminous presence and
               a lever and fulcrum that could be used to change the world. There was no formal registration
               or declaration of membership because bureaucracy seemed hardly Blakean. From the beginning,
               some members objected to the link with St. James’s Piccadilly, given Blake’s critique
               of organized religion, but these objections were not strong enough to overcome the
               church’s contribution in the form of a space to meet, and the church did not make
               any attempt to exert particular control over the group or make it into the William
               Blake Society of the Church of England.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The earliest records of the society’s activities have been lost, but according to
                  the Blake Society’s current chair, Tim Heath, who became involved with the group in
                  1987, the early meetings were tempestuous, as members sought to develop action from
                  their various interpretations of Blake’s works. In 2004, the society adopted a formal
                  constitution in order to become a charity and to continue growing with an eye towards
                  raising funds and applying for grants and other opportunities open to legal non-profit
                  organizations. This decision caused intense conflict: some members objected that becoming
                  a legal society would violate the spirit of antinomianism that they saw as central
                  to Blake’s arguments while others refused the constitution because they believed that
                  becoming a charity would restrict the society’s ability to engage in political activities.
                  Blakeans have long memories—even eleven years after the constitution and formal membership
                  rules were adopted, some of the original attendees still refuse to join officially
                  but, in the spirit of antinomian disruption, appear at annual meetings to insist that
                  they are still members. The antinomians have a point, as requiring paid membership
                  in order to identify oneself as in society with Blake seems either preposterous or
                  corrupt when considered against the measuring stick of critical interpretation and
                  close reading of the poet’s work. These objections prompt considerations of the types
                  of resources required in order to do things with Blake’s poetry, painting, and printmaking
                  and urge deliberations concerning the channeling of the Blake Society’s energy into
                  the larger systems of the world.

               </p>
            </div>
            <p>One vital component to consider in relation to these questions is that of committed
               labor. Since 2004, ten members have been elected each January to serve one-year terms
               as volunteers on the Blake Society’s Executive Committee. At the end of these terms,
               committee members either step down or stand for election again for another year. Committee
               members then begin bimonthly meetings each February in order to plan out the year’s
               program of events. Generally, these events run from April until the following January,
               with one event per month. The timeline for planning is not only tight, because the
               April events always follow quite quickly behind society elections, but also because
               a full-color program featuring high-resolution images (similar to souvenir programs
               sold at theatrical productions) is sent each year to all members, usually by the end
               of March. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The events hosted by the Blake Society vary widely, depending on what the Executive
                  Committee can imagine and make a reality. In 2007, with the assistance of the British
                  Royal Navy, the society recreated the sketching journey that Blake took in 1780 with
                  Thomas Stothard. In 2008, the committee was able to arrange a tour of the Stationers’s
                  Hall, where Blake was apprenticed, in order to see records relating to his apprenticeship.
                  In 2012, voice specialist Jane Boston led a workshop on reading poetry aloud as the
                  start of a project to increase coverage of <a class="link_ref" href="https://librivox.org/poems-of-william-blake-by-william-blake/">Blake’s poetry on Librivox</a>, an audiobook crowdsourcing website, and throughout that year, the society helped
                  to coordinate new online recordings of many of Blake’s texts.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>During the course of that project, the Blake Society was contacted by a member in
                           Australia who had access to a series of dramatic readings of Blake’s poetry made by
                           an Australian theatre group in the 1960s, and these recordings were able to be added
                           to the online resource, thus making them available to audiences worldwide after they
                           had been packed away for several decades. </span></div>
                  </div> Furthermore, many monthly events are talks given by people who study Blake or who
                  have found him influential on their work or life. While a fair number of these talks
                  are given by working academics and would not be out of place in literature or history
                  departments, other talks have featured filmmakers and cinematographers, composers,
                  musicians, artists, theologians, psychologists, and organizational consultants. The
                  subject matter varies widely: from traditional academic research to artistic projects
                  in process; from discussions of Blake’s work by contemporary artists and writers to
                  investigations of Blake’s writings in the context of John Milton, Emanuel Swedenborg,
                  and Wilfred Owen; and from conversations concerning Blake’s responses to organized
                  religion to various religious traditions, such as Christianity, Paganism, and Buddhism.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Other than the approximate length of talks, speakers are given few boundaries, so
               sometimes even our organizers are surprised by the content of a given presentation,
               as when, for example, one speaker discussed his experiences as a spiritual medium
               in contact with William and Catherine Blake from beyond the grave. Who will speak
               is determined by a number of methods. Sometimes one of the committee or society members
               knows someone who would be appropriate (meaning that they have been in contact with
               an individual who has an interest in Blake, a willingness to speak, and something
               to speak about). Other times, potential speakers contact the Blake Society to offer
               their availability as they are passing through London. Speakers in the recent past
               have included leading Blake scholars and well-known public figures including Anne
               Mellor, Morton Paley, Philip Pullman, Kathleen Raine, Patti Smith, and Rowan Williams.
               The Executive Committee has also made a point of inviting talks from junior and independent
               scholars whose work often goes in new directions and might otherwise be less visible.</p>
            <p>Much of what we do might be summarized as making a <em>space</em> for William Blake. But what sort of a space are we attempting to make? The Blake
               Society Constitution lists our purpose as “educat[ing] the public regarding knowledge,
               understanding and appreciation of the work of William Blake (1757-1827), artist and
               poet, and his life and times and his influences on and relationships with others and
               to encourage studies relating thereto” (“Blake Society Constitution”). This is a fine
               but rather generic goal—precisely the sort of thing one puts into bureaucratic documents.
               More illustrative is the self-description of the society provided on the homepage
               of our website: <span class="quote">‘The Blake Society honours and celebrates William Blake (1757-1827), engraver, poet,
                  painter &amp; prophet. […] We bring together scholars and enthusiasts, amateurs and professionals
                  on equal terms . . . We look for opportunities to continue the work that Blake began:
                  exploring new modes of expression, and awakening the artist and prophet in each individual.
                  (“The Society”) ’</span> Educating is a familiar activity—something that people instinctively recognize when
               they see it. Honoring and celebrating leave more room for experimentation. The society’s
               ethos is thus significantly influenced by Blake’s proverb from <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> (1790): “The most sublime act is to set another before you” (Erdman 36). Today, Blake’s
               work is widely available in print and online editions as well as in an infinite progression
               of excerpted forms—some apt, commercial, eccentric, and even inaccurate. Of course,
               there are scholarly books and essays of critical commentary as well. To complement
               those forms, the Blake Society works to create a physical and temporal space in order
               to listen, discuss, and create, and the society does so while placing as few limits
               as possible on what results, if any, are the outcome of these conversations concerning
               Blake’s poetry and art. As an example, Adriana Diaz-Enciso, a member of the Executive
               Committee, developed in 2013 an idea to have children read Blake’s poem “The Tyger”
               to actual living tigers. Taking the project from idea to reality took nearly two years
               of planning and negotiation, but the final event took place in October 2014 in collaboration
               with the London Zoo and Kids Company, a UK charity that works with at-risk and impoverished
               children in London, Bristol, and Liverpool. Diaz-Enciso’s vision is an example of
               what the Blake Society’s Executive Committee aspires to accomplish when it seeks to
               interpret Blake’s work as broadly as possible. We believe that setting men and women
               before us takes a concerted effort. We also believe that it is worthwhile to exert
               that same energy with tigers.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>There are obviously significant differences in our practice from the way that Blake
                  is handled in academic settings. We are working towards greater recognition of Blake,
                  but we do not have a specific argument or narrative about Blake that we are trying
                  to advance and offer no metric of achievement or credential after a given event. Our
                  audience has no time commitment, and our events do not build on each other, meaning
                  that missing an event has no bearing on the comprehension of future events. As much
                  as possible, we have worked to become something more like a <em>trading zone</em> for Blake, where multiple parties (i.e., publics) meet and where activities are driven
                  by member or executive committee interests, current events, or simply opportunities
                  that become possible.

                           to the objects being exchanged” (“Trading Zone” 138). Even if the parties involved
                           disagree on the significance of the exchange process, the trading zone supports “local
                           coordination despite vast global differences” (“Trading Zone” 138). Galison began
                           working with the idea of trading zones as a way of parsing the interactions and intersections
                           between experimentalists and theorists in scientific fields, and he did so…</span></div>

                  most of our events are held in London. The local UK event audience has a wide age
                  range (from people in their twenties to their eighties) and a diverse set of interests
                  in Blake. While the society is cautious about overusing the question “What would Blake
                  do?,” we do feel strongly that our events ought to be accessible to people working
                  and earning very little money (as Blake did), and so we rarely hold events that charge
                  any admission fees.

            </div>
            <p>The Blake Society is also careful about the measuring stick employed in interpretations
               of Blake’s work because there are so very many different Blakes present in our membership’s
               views: scholarly, obscure, occult, ultra-conservative, etc. The society seeks to be
               as inclusive as possible—partly in deliberate contrast to the exclusivity of academia,
               but also because the group was not founded with the purpose of researching or proving
               the veracity of one version of Blake over another. Our programs are full of arguments,
               but there is no goal of combining all those arguments into a book, for example, or
               making them compete in order to winnow out the “best” interpretation. Additionally,
               while our audiences are full of contrasting views (and not shy about voicing them),
               they tend to be more united and in agreement about rejecting “Corporeal Understanding”
               (i.e., “Reason” or “Ratiocination” to use the terms that are popular at events) in
               favor of <em>mental fight</em>, and this results in a tendency to be fairly skeptical or suspicious of new media
               and digital tools (rather than to embrace them). However, the concerns expressed often
               involve the social injustices associated with technology, the pressures exerted on
               users of technology to conform to social and other customs, and a general unwillingness
               to be dependent on technology (or, in other words, a rejection of the idea that technology
               is in any way necessary for Blakean vision and action). </p>
            <p>Technology isn’t a particular <span class="foreign">bête noire</span> of the Blake Society though. The problem would be if the society were to suggest
               that there were <em>any </em>dominant methods for achieving vision or even that “vision” was something that all
               our members ought to be trying to achieve. Those arguments would put us squarely into
               more academic or outcome-based territories. There are so many skill-acquisition programs
               already in existence that it seems hard to argue that another one is needed. Furthermore,
               even if the Blake Society wanted to introduce such a program, it is difficult to imagine
               such an endeavor being successful, simply because it would require more labor and
               time than such a voluntary executive body is typically able to give without risking
               burnout or event failure. And because, as a literary society, we offer no credentials
               and are under little pressure of accreditation, it is easier for us simply to decide
               not to do things when they seem unmanageable. The exception to this is that for certain
               activities, we must match the general conception of what various people or organizations
               expect a literary society to “look like” or “to do.” For example, the majority of
               our events are sponsored by the Waterstones bookshop in Piccadilly, which provides
               both meeting space and refreshments, and it is easy to imagine how Waterstones’s support
               might be complicated or controversial if, for instance, the Blake Society’s meetings
               were more overtly political or activist.</p>
            <p>As a professional academic, I regularly encounter the question of whether something
               is academic or non-academic, intellectual or anti-intellectual, but as a member of
               the Blake Society, the question never comes up, and if it did, I would probably sidestep
               it or ask why it needed an answer. Must we inscribe the bounds of our activities into
               a particular circle? However, I cannot deny that the Blake Society is responsive to
               academia and academic systems in certain ways. A primary effect of academia is to
               elevate intellectual merit through credentials, publications, and awards and to position
               individuals as teachers or learners. The teachers teach, but what the learners do—or
               what they are meant to do once they have their credential(s)—is not always clear.
               Grades have become an intrinsic part of the academic system, and the grades stick—and
               for some, leave deep impressions. Rectifying the consequences of educational scar
               tissue, however it was acquired, is incredibly difficult because the wounds are particular
               rather than general. As I completed my doctorate and learned to teach, I was aware
               of innovative pedagogical practices being developed to respond better to students’
               changing needs, and I am also aware that there have always been pedagogical innovators
               focusing specifically on teaching—thinking actively about new possibilities and ways
               to combat the occasional tendencies of institutional education to grind individuals
               into uniformity. However, the improvements and intentions of recent educators cannot
               fully cancel out the alienation that might have occurred previously. And the Blake
               Society does not have the recourse of explaining to people that if they would only
               read more about pedagogy and current educational practices, they would understand
               that what we were doing was to their benefit. </p>
            <p>The fact that we are no school for Blake, however, does not mean that we have no pedagogy.
               As a poet and artist, Blake is so challenging that it feels impossible to do <em>anything</em> with him without having some form of pedagogical goal. If I had to sum up the Executive
               Committee’s pedagogy concerning Blake’s work, I would explain that we seek to make
               a Blake-centric community that is not contingent upon members exhibiting any particular
               set of learning behaviors. If one necessary resource for doing things with Blake is
               the labor and energy of the Executive Committee, then another component is <em>need</em>. Some people write to the Blake Society because they need help with school projects.
               Others write to inquire about whether a book signed “William Blake” that they’ve found
               in their attic might belong to <em>the </em>William Blake. In another example, a scholar from an Eastern European country wrote
               in 2009 to ask whether we could provide a grant for travel to London for the purposes
               of researching Blake’s work. Initially, this caused moderate conflict and debate among
               Executive Committee members because of a split on whether it was possible simply to
               give this scholar the funds as an act of radical generosity or whether doing so would
               cause legal problems or alienate other members who didn’t know that they could simply
               ask for funding (thus potentially inundating us with similar requests).</p>
            <p>The Tithe Grant emerged out of that conversation as a commitment to give back 10%
               of our income to an individual “carrying on Blake’s work and art,” an open category
               that the Executive Committee settled on because it was inclusive of multiple sorts
               of activities. We considered organizing the grant to be focused specifically on academic
               research, given the original request for funding, but in the end we rejected such
               a narrow category because other funding sources were available and because the amount
               we had available to give (then, around £300) would be insufficient to offer substantial
               assistance to researchers outside of the UK (our research indicated that such individuals
               had fewer opportunities when compared with researchers within the UK). We were all
               in agreement that, if at all possible, we wanted the Tithe Grant to be a “competition”
               that did not simply replicate existing funding struggles. Specifically, we sought
               to determine whether there was a particular method of designing an application so
               that people like Blake (i.e., autodidacts, those not from wealthy backgrounds, individuals
               possibly but not necessarily embedded in formal training programs, etc.) could locate
               funding for their work. </p>
            <p>The downside of developing an original and uniquely Blakean competition, of course,
               is that one must figure out all the minute particulars, and each year of running the
               Tithe Grant has indeed proven to be a learning experience. The first year, we stuck
               to our commitment not to pre-define what form “carrying on Blake’s work and art” would
               take and chose to publicize the grant chiefly to our members, but we received no applications
               by the set deadline. The second year, we again defined no set form of “carrying on
               Blake’s work and art” but marketed the competition more widely through various newsletters
               and websites listing grant competitions, and we received 16 entries—including a lecture
               series, an exhibition based on an MA thesis, as well as photography, painting, translation,
               and theatrical projects. What we learned that year was that it is difficult to weigh
               the merits of very different projects in different forms. Since then, we have focused
               each year’s Tithe Grant on a particular area: musical composition, photography, and—most
               recently—on writing aphorisms on Twitter. What happens with the competition sometimes
               challenges our own assumptions about doing things with Blake, as when we invited photographs
               interpreting Blake’s poem “The Tyger” in 2013. We hoped for startling juxtapositions
               of Blake’s ideas with contemporary images, but a substantial number of the entries
               were photographs that, while magnificent, were indistinguishable from photos that
               might appear in issues of <em>National Geographic</em>. We are still determining what a Blakean “competition” looks like as we reiterate
               the Tithe Grant each year, but we have been pleased at how it has changed over time.
               In 2011, the winners were a poet and an actress, both in their twenties, while last
               year’s aphorism competition, judged by Stephen Fry, was won by a woman in her eighties.
               The winners thus far have hailed from England, Australia, and America, and since 2011,
               we have gone from receiving 16 to over 700 entries.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Indeed, from “Tyger[s]” to tigers and Twitter, many things are possible with Blake.
                  But in the last year, we have been engaged in a much more difficult project: in September
                  2015, the Blake Cottage Trust (a small group which had emerged from the larger Blake
                  Society)

                           project).</span></div>
                  </div> succeeded in purchasing the cottage at Felpham in Sussex, England where Blake had
                  lived between 1800 and 1803. The cottage is a significant part of Blake’s history
                  for several reasons, and acquiring the cottage was a momentous occasion: of the nine
                  homes that Blake lived in during his lifetime, only two of the original buildings
                  survive. One is 17 South Molton Street, now an upscale shopping avenue near Oxford
                  Street in London. The other is the thatch-roofed cottage at Felpham, on the southeast
                  coast of England, where Blake worked on <em>Milton</em> (comp. ca. 1804-1811), wrote the lyrics to the hymn “Jerusalem,” and where he was
                  arrested for sedition after ejecting a soldier from his yard. Though the building
                  has been added onto, the original architectural structure of the cottage still survives
                  intact. The cottage’s previous owner, Heather Howell, often generously entertained
                  Blake scholars for teatime visits and occasionally allowed individuals to spend a
                  night in what was most likely Blake’s bedroom. The question of what would become of
                  the house was always uncertain. While Howell was interested in Blake and cordial to
                  the Blake Society, her grown children were less so, and as a result there was really
                  no chance of the cottage being simply willed into a public property, for example.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>From Heath’s perspective, as Blake Society Chair, finding a way to acquire the cottage
                  was important for multiple reasons: as a heritage site and a physical artifact of
                  Blake’s life that supplements his surviving books and prints; as a space that could
                  be used for a wider variety of events than are currently possible through our relationships
                  with St. James’s Piccadilly and Waterstones Books; and to embody Blake’s question:
                  “Where shall we take our stand to view the infinite &amp; unbounded” (Erdman 391). Though
                  the South Molton Street residence is in central London, and thus more accessible,
                  its proximity to the trendy upmarket shops around Oxford Street establish its estimated
                  value somewhere over £10,000,000. In contrast, the Felpham residence was bought for
                  £495,000. Even so, raising this sum initially seemed like an impossible task for a
                  literary society whose annual budget in recent years has been less than £5,000. Those
                  of us involved in the process of raising funds thus count the purchase as a major
                  accomplishment, but an accomplishment that we were far from confident would ever happen.
                  Almost certainly, part of the challenge involved assumptions and questions about the
                  purpose of the house. Many people assumed that the cottage was to become something
                  like the “William Blake Museum” or perhaps a specialized lecture hall or retreat for
                  writers. In other words, it was difficult for individuals to imagine what the society
                  might do with the house (or with Blake himself as a cultural figure) if our purposes
                  were not to be academic in nature. Such thinking suggests that although Morris Eaves
                  expressed concern in 1995 about the “white noise” of Blake-related activity diluting
                  the “original message” of Blake’s art and writing (414), the actual problem that friends
                  of Blake face is that of limited vision in which Blake is too closely associated with
                  school and learning—so limited that it is difficult or impossible to imagine a Blakean
                  activity that is <em>not </em>obviously academic in nature.

                           Whittaker have explored in their discussion of the “‘Blake brand’, . . . a particular
                           type of visionary poetics and art that . . . may sometimes be closer to Blake’s original

                           the weighty, canonical interpretations that have been overlaid on him since” (120).

            <p>Thus, there are a number of reasons that could be offered for why we struggled to
               raise the money for the cottage or for areas of the campaign that could have been
               run differently. I would argue, though, that our difficulties were related to the
               question of what the Blake Society does and how it does what it does—in other words,
               how we exert our energy in order to fit into larger systems. It’s a question of authority—where
               it comes from and on what basis it is recognized. Perhaps the authority to do things
               with Blake comes from the Blake Society’s legal and nominal status as a public organization.
               Beyond that status, however, we are a bit eccentric. One needs only to look at Michael
               Warner’s description of the relationships between private/public and interested/disinterested
               to begin to understand why. Warner writes that <span class="quote">‘as private persons came to be seen as driven by self-interest, the public came to
                  be defined as disinterested. Those aspects of people’s lives that particularize their
                  interests came to be seen as inappropriate to public discussion. To be properly public
                  required that one rise above, or set aside, one’s private interests and expressive
                  nature. (40)’</span> In contrast, the Blake Society is specifically about those “aspects of people’s lives
               that particularize their interests,” and if our goal is not directly to make them
               into objects of public discussion (except when individuals specifically choose to
               do so), it is certainly to make the cultivation of those personal interests into a
               subject that is worthy of public dialogue and energy. We are, then, closer to Warner’s
               idea of a “counterpublic,” a space “defined by [its] tension with a larger public”
               and “enabl[ing] a horizon of opinion and exchange” (Warner 56), or as a Foucauldian
               heterotopic space, one that might juxtapose “in a single real place several spaces,
               several sites that are themselves incompatible” (Foucault 25). The possibility of
               such spaces existing is certainly recognized in academic discourse. Actually creating
               such a space, especially one that straddles the border between academic and non-academic
               activities and which tries to circumvent hallmarks of institutional learning in order
               to subvert expectations of public disinterestedness, is more difficult to achieve.
               Producing such a space—doing something with Blake—takes more than labor and energy:
               it requires capital. For an organization like the Blake Society, the challenge is
               finding a way of converting labor and energy into capital and in conjunction with
               the existing systems that surround us.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In <em>The Economy of Prestige</em> (2005), James F. English notes that “cultural practice itself has . . . become ever
                  more dependent on institutions of cultural competition and award. The <em>work</em> of culture, especially the work of producing cultural value, has increasingly been
                  accomplished through these institutions” (256). English’s statement confirms the focus
                  on isolating merit and overemphasizing credentials. In that process, cultural value
                  becomes strongly linked with institutional forms (e.g., books, essays, courses, etc.)
                  that become the trappings of cultural value. And in competitions and awards, it’s
                  usually the output—rather than the process—that matters most.

                           produces little or no cultural value simply by focusing on creating a space for Blake.
                           Does the Blake Society count as the sort of cultural value-producing institution to
                           which English refers? Academia is such an institution (recognizable in most parts
                           of the world) with a mass of institutions of various sizes within it. Some of these
                           institutions are so familiar and dominant that they set many of the standards by which
                           others are measured. Other institutions are less accomplished but draw their own legiti…</span></div>
                  </div> The problem is that when the “work of culture” becomes closely linked with outputs
                  and finished products, it contributes to the devaluing and normalization of a great
                  deal of labor. Academic work becomes invisible, resulting in the perception of academics
                  as ignorant hirelings. This process affects the authority available to organizations
                  like the Blake Society and, at the same time, negatively impacts professional academics.
                  I don’t invoke these challenges in closing here in order to make excuses for the Blake
                  Society and what it has or hasn’t accomplished. I invoke them because they affect
                  the most basic terms and environments in which the Blake Society must continue to
                  intervene.</p>

               Australia who had access to a series of dramatic readings of Blake’s poetry made by
               an Australian theatre group in the 1960s, and these recordings were able to be added
               to the online resource, thus making them available to audiences worldwide after they
               had been packed away for several decades. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Relevant here is Peter Galison’s concept of the “trading zone” as a space where multiple
               groups “can agree on rules of exchange even if they ascribe utterly different significance
               to the objects being exchanged” (“Trading Zone” 138). Even if the parties involved
               disagree on the significance of the exchange process, the trading zone supports “<em>local</em> coordination despite vast <em>global </em>differences” (“Trading Zone” 138). Galison began working with the idea of trading
               zones as a way of parsing the interactions and intersections between experimentalists
               and theorists in scientific fields, and he did so to show that while they might share
               a discipline, their conclusions were “<em>not</em> grounded on the same standards and forms of argumentation” (“Trading with the Enemy”
               26). The Blake Society agrees to work to create a space for the appreciation of Blake,
               academics agree to be participants in that space, and we all agree that Blake is important
               enough to devote our energies to thinking about him. Beyond that point, our perspectives
               diverge significantly. The priorities within academic study of Blake often include
               historical accuracy and discovery, the preservation of the disciplines of literature,
               history, etc., as well as the professions associated with academia. The Blake Society’s
               priorities also include accuracy, yet the priority of simply surviving as an organization
               is nearly as important and is often a far more urgent concern.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               from a combination of their own efforts and from sharing institutional designations
               (e.g., college, university, etc.). Academia often propagates cultural values and rules
               by following them itself. Underneath those rules and designations, however, academic
               institutions are people—instructors (permanent and adjunct), administrators, staff,
               and students. For better or worse, their individual efforts are often subsumed within
               the collective of the institution. Activities that fall within the expected scope
               of the institution often pass with little or no attention, while those that are unexpected
               draw attention and are found to be either outstanding innovations or errors. For an
               institution to change and become something else or something new thus often takes
               substantial work.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
