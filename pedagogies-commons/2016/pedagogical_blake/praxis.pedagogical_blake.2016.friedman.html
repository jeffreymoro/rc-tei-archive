            <p class="noCount">In this essay, I reflect on how my experience of teaching William Blake’s <em>Milton</em> (comp. ca. 1804-1811) to graduate students was retrospectively transformed by reading
               Silvan Tomkins and Baruch Spinoza’s <em>Ethics</em> (1677) in a seminar that I subsequently taught on affect theory. Engaging with Spinoza’s
               and Tomkins’s respective writings on negative affects (such as shame and fear) and
               positive affects (such as joy) allowed me to discover in what I had been thinking
               of as a pedagogical failure an exciting pedagogical opportunity to rethink my unreflected
               assumptions about teaching and what constitutes teaching success. The key breakthrough
               came when, through a shift of perspective, I began to see that the shame and fear
               of not understanding <em>Milton</em> that my students (and on occasion, I) experienced was a version of the affective
               dramas, or “Mental Fight,” in Blake’s works and thus an essential aspect of the reading
               process rather than an obstacle to it.</p>

            </header><br/><p>Chances are that anyone who has ever taught William Blake’s prophecies has at one
               time or another wondered if this Blake is teachable. The answer depends in part on
               what we mean by “teachable.” The word is often assumed to mean “masterable,” first
               by the instructor and then by the students, to whom the instructor has transferred
               his or her mastery. A pedagogy based on this assumption is driven by the desire to
               be correct, to “get it right,” but does not ask what the “it” to be got is, what “getting
               it” means, or if seeking mastery is the way to learn. Such a pedagogy also takes for
               granted that we as readers—teachers and students alike—are positioned outside the
               text, remain at a distance from it, and contemplate it from afar. This approach is
               questionable in general, but, in the case of Blake, it is particularly problematic
               because he profoundly and energetically rejects all the assumptions behind this concept
               of teaching—and nowhere more so than in the prophecies. An approach more in tune with
               Blake would ask not whether he is teachable but how he redefines teachability. How
               does he teach us to teach? This essay focuses on the ways that I have discovered to
               transform my reading and teaching habits by teaching Blake. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I write from the perspective of a Romanticist who is not a Blake scholar and whose
                  graduate training, for various reasons, barely touched on him (my doctoral program
                  was in Comparative Literature rather than English, was not driven by a coverage model,
                  and took William Wordsworth as the paradigmatic Romantic poet).

                           on the undergraduate level, I have included him in large-scale historical surveys
                           (from the Romantics to the Moderns) and introductory classes on poetry, and on the
                           graduate level in broader-based classes on Romanticism and thematically focused seminars
                           in the period. </span></div>
                  </div> As a result, I had to teach myself Blake in order to teach his work in my courses,
                  and I frankly admit that the task was extremely intimidating. All of these things
                  would normally be hindrances to contributing to a volume on teaching Blake, but I
                  have found that they can be turned to advantage in developing a pedagogy of non-mastery
                  that allows for more engaged reading (instead of being an excuse for not reading).
                  In essence, I use my limitations as the basis of a pedagogical methodology rather
                  than seeing them as something simply to be overcome. What has allowed me to reconceive
                  personal limitations as the basis of a pedagogy is the affective turn in the recent
                  critical landscape.

                           cited as a watershed moment in affect theory. Other commonly cited works include Rei

                           owes a great deal to the influence of Gilles Deleuze. Deleuze’s two books on Spinoza
                           are Spinoza: Practical Philosophy (2001) and Expressionism in Philosophy: Spinoza
                           (1992).</span></div>

               <p>Tomkins is especially helpful on the subject of motivation; he calls “the affect system”
                  “the primary motivational system in human beings” (34). We all know <em>experientially </em>that the teaching, learning, and reading processes are affectively driven, but it
                  has taken a new theoretical development to tell us that affect has a legitimate place,
                  one worth discussing in teaching, learning, and scholarship.

                  </div> Blake is in many ways an ideal candidate for such an approach, since affect, especially
                  extreme affect, is writ large in his works. For example, the word “terror” and its
                  related forms, such as “terrors,” “terrible,” “terrifying,” “terrified,” as well as
                  “fear” and “fright” appear frequently in Blake’s poetry in general. The “search” function
                  in <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/"><em>The William Blake Archive</em></a> reveals well over 200 combined occurrences of the “terror” series and over 140 of
                  “fear” and “fright,” and the frequency is especially high in <em>Jerusalem </em>(comp. ca. 1804-1820) and <em>The Four Zoas</em> (comp. ca. 1796-1797), with <em>Milton </em>(comp. ca. 1804-1811) making a respectable showing as well, especially considering
                  that it is about half as long as <em>Jerusalem</em>.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> Since Blake’s oeuvre is so fear filled, is it any wonder that reading Blake frequently
                  makes readers fearful? Once one begins thinking of Blake in these terms, it becomes
                  obvious that readerly affect and textual affect in his works are related, but making
                  that relation a matter for reflection and the motivating impulse of a teaching practice
                  is another thing entirely. Such a teaching practice is precisely what I shall aim
                  to adopt when I teach Blake in the future.</p>
            </div>
            <p>As a result of having long struggled with Blake myself, I am in a good position to
               empathize with students’ distress at not understanding his work. Perhaps more important,
               my experience brings home to me the <em>importance </em>of empathizing with them. I can use myself as an example to help my students see that
               struggling with his prophecies is not a sign of failure but a potentially productive
               reading practice. Most fundamentally, my difficult engagement with the esoteric Blake
               has taught me to shift my relationship to his poetry, and my top priority is to enable
               my students to do the same. Achieving such a fundamental transformation of one’s orientation
               to texts involves a kind of psychotherapy for readers, which most closely resembles
               the desensitization techniques used to treat phobias; yet, it is a desensitization
               that allows for developing a sensitivity of a qualitatively different kind, one that
               gives the reader an alternative to closing herself or himself off from the work in
               self-defense. On the contrary, such a desensitization process allows the reader to
               open up to the work so that it can open up to her or him. It is perhaps an exaggeration
               to say that Blake’s prophetic works were phobic objects for me or that they are phobic
               objects for my students, but in the context of a classroom, they come pretty close.
               Certainly, they can raise a lot of fear or anxiety of being wrong or stupid and shame
               at not understanding.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have arrived at this view and practice of teaching as the result of a long, incremental
                  process, which has not been without detours or serendipity. I tell the longer narrative
                  below; here I would like to note three relatively recent events that suddenly reshaped
                  the way I think of my history with Blake. First, in the Spring Semester of 2013, I
                  taught <em>Milton </em>in a graduate seminar on Romantic natures. Then, in Spring 2014, I assigned readings
                  in the Silvan Tomkins anthology edited by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Adam Frank and
                  the three chapters on affect in Spinoza’s <em>Ethics</em> in a graduate seminar on affect theory, an area in which I had become interested through
                  the work of a doctoral student on whose dissertation committee I was serving. Finally,
                  the combined impact of these factors motivated me to attend Karen Swann’s workshop
                  on teaching <em>Jerusalem </em>(“Learning to Teach by Teaching <em>Jerusalem</em>”) at the 2013 conference of the North American Society for the Study of Romanticism.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">
                           (6)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Karen Swann’s pedagogical essay on Jerusalem begins with a brilliant treatment of
                           readerly affect—her own and that of her students. I attempt to get at some of the
                           same issues in the thread of the present essay on affect.</span></div>
                  </div> Teaching the affect theory class between the two Blake-related events turned out to
                  be transformative. By the strange temporality of mental processes, it retroactively
                  prepared the groundwork for an “aha” moment that I had during the <em>Jerusalem </em>workshop, in which I suddenly saw that affect had been a barrier to reading Blake
                  for me, and affect was my best chance of finding a different—and happier—way of reading
                  him. The reason I single out Tomkins and Spinoza from all the readings in that Spring
                  2013 seminar is that, in very different ways, they both emphasize that affects can
                  become toxic but do not have to remain so; we can transform them by working on them.
                  For Tomkins, when one particular affect comes to monopolize a person’s affective life,
                  that person has developed a strong theory of that affect, such that s/he will find
                  opportunities for experiencing it in a wide range of encounters that would be unlikely
                  to activate it in a different type of person. Tomkins had a powerful impact on me
                  because he paints vivid pictures of the soul-killing suffering that strong theories
                  of negative affects inflict on those who hold them.

                           total affect-shame bind can be produced,” see Shame and Its Sisters (163-165, 172-174).
                           For his account of how a person can develop a strong theory of fear, see (165-168).</span></div>
                  </div> I responded to him on a gut level, as one cannot help responding to Blake, although
                  in a very different register and on a different scale. In short, Tomkins resonated
                  with Blake for me in that they both pack an affective punch. However, when it comes
                  to weakening the hold of negative affects, Spinoza’s analysis is the one I found more
                  effective in helping me shift my relation to Blake.</p>

                           “All Religions Are One” and “There Is No Natural Religion” as akin to the “geometric
                           style” that Spinoza adopts in the Ethics (1677): “I shall consider human actions and
                           appetites just as if it were a question of lines, planes, and bodies” (69).</span></div>
                  </div> and, to be sure, they disagree fundamentally on many fronts. Nonetheless, they both
                  vehemently reject a vision of humanity that rests on the categories of sin and transgression.
                  In the preface to the third part of the <em>Ethics</em>, “Of the Origin and Nature of the Affects,” Spinoza states his opposition to those
                  who “attribute the cause of human impotence and inconstancy . . . to I know not what
                  vice of human nature, which they therefore bewail, or laugh at, or disdain, or (as
                  usually happens) curse.” Rather than “curse or laugh at the affects and actions of
                  men,” he proposes to “understand them” and by a method he acknowledges to be paradoxical:
                  “I should wish to demonstrate by certain reasoning things which are contrary to reason,
                  and which they [those who laugh and curse] proclaim to be empty, absurd, and horrible”
                  (68-69).

                           I understand every kind of joy, and whatever leads to it, and especially what satisfies

                           of sadness, and especially what frustrates longing. For we have shown above (in P9S)
                           that we desire nothing because we judge it to be good, but on the contrary, we call

                  </div> To me, Spinoza holds promise for readers of Blake in that he bases his ethics on affects
                  and does so in a non-moralistic manner. He aims not to set out rules to be obeyed
                  but rather to show how the mind may pass “<em>to a greater perfection</em>,” where perfection is a state in which the mind does things rather than undergoes
                  them; it becomes active rather than passive, where passivity means being dominated
                  by passions (77). This active state Spinoza calls “joy” (77). In a rare pathos-filled
                  sentence, he describes the plight of those who are at the mercy of their passions
                  and thereby suffer many and frequent “vacillations of mind”: “We are driven about
                  in many ways by external causes, and . . . like waves on the sea, driven by contrary
                  winds, we toss about, not knowing our outcome and fate” (103). Hence he calls “man’s
                  lack of power to moderate and restrain the affects” “bondage,” and the fourth part
                  of the <em>Ethics </em>is accordingly called “Of Human Bondage, or the Power of the Affects” (113). The entire <em>Ethics </em>tends toward a demonstration of how the mind can escape this plight and find “the
                  means, or way, leading to freedom,” which depends on “the power of reason” to counteract
                  the affects (160). At this point, Spinoza states that the only and best way of becoming
                  as free as possible is to gain “a true knowledge” of the affects: “Each of us has—in
                  part, at least, if not absolutely—the power to understand himself and his affects,
                  and consequently the power to bring it about that he is less acted on by them” (164).
                  What appeals to me in Spinoza is that he takes affects not as something to be eliminated
                  but as something to be worked on and through. Furthermore, he does not oppose reason
                  to affects or hold that reason negates affects. Rather, affects can arise from or
                  be aroused by reason, and over time such affects can grow to be more powerful than
                  passions (165). In short, through reason, affects counteract affects.</p>

               <p>If ever Spinoza’s definition of “sadness” as “that <em>passion by which it </em>[the mind] <em>passes to a lesser perfection</em>” needed proof (77), it would find it in the classroom, where varieties of sadness
                  (in Spinoza’s sense) such as fear, shame, and anxiety have the capacity effectively
                  to shut down the mind and produce a painful silence. To avoid this result, it is crucial
                  to keep students from feeling so lost that they simply disengage.

               <p>As Morris Eaves notes in his introduction to <em>The Cambridge Companion to William Blake</em> (2003), those print editions served an important historical purpose when they first
                  appeared in the Victorian age, and they continue to do so now, although not in the
                  same way. Deleting the images and regularizing the idiosyncratic aspects of the text
                  were then part of a mission to rescue Blake from the decades of neglect he had already
                  suffered. These simplifications made “his poetry friendlier and more legible,” thereby
                  “prepar[ing] the way for serious study and reflection on a scale previously unthinkable”
                  (Eaves 7).

                           facsimile of Jerusalem (1877), ‘the publication in ordinary book-form, without designs
                           . . . of the Jerusalem and the other Prophetic Books, is highly to be desired. Difficult
                           under any circumstances, it would be a good deal less difficult to read these works

                           like aids to business-like perusal’” (Eaves 7). It’s hard not to imagine Blake turning
                           over in his grave at the word “business-like,” and for this reason it is import…</span></div>
                  </div> The difficulty of parsing Blake’s script is considerable, and perhaps no one has gauged
                  it more aptly than Vincent De Luca, who holds that it poses as much of a challenge
                  to the reader as does Blake’s hermeticism (89-90). My myopic, astigmatic, and presbyopic
                  eyes would be able to sustain the reading effort only as long as I could tolerate
                  the whopping headache it would be sure to bring on, which is to say not very long
                  at all. However, today the availability of conventionally printed editions of Blake
                  and the technological enhancements of the online <em>Blake Archive</em>, including the textual transcriptions it provides, allow us to experience the difficult
                  legibility of Blake as something more and other than a daunting physical obstacle.
                  In particular, the magnification function makes it much more practical to read the
                  facsimiles while also preserving a sense of the resistance they offer to legibility.
                  Slowly tracing out the strokes of Blake’s lettering with our eyes, we can get some
                  idea of the resistance that the physical substrate offers to the engraver; our reading
                  activity approaches to the artisanal character of his production methods. To a certain
                  degree and extent, then, we work along with Blake as we read, and this is one way
                  our relation to his works shifts; we are no longer fully detached readers positioned
                  over and against them.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Most importantly, the <em>Blake Archive</em> offers a viewing pleasure that one completely misses when reading only a verbal transcription,
               and this pleasure can help defuse the anxiety that any new (and I suspect many a veteran)
               reader of Blake experiences when confronted with his prophecies. The reader is then
               more likely to relax enough to begin to relinquish the desire for mastery and assume
               a less defensive, more open disposition toward the text. This is where affect comes
               in. I encourage my students to cultivate and reflect on their affective relationship
               to Blake. Through this process, I strive to help them do two related things: (1) to
               see their reading experience not as outside the text but rather as part of the drama
               of intellectual warfare at the center of so many of Blake’s works; and (2) to perform
               a kind of inner recalibration that allows them to re-experience their fear of not
               understanding him as joyful exhilaration and wild exuberance. This transformation
               can perhaps be thought of as turning intellectual terror into an experience of the
               sublime. One can facilitate this process for students by directing them to places
               in Blake’s <span class="foreign">oeuvre </span>where it is thematized. A prime example is the speaker’s vow to wage “Mental Fight”
               in the famous poem included in some copies of <em>Milton</em> (Erdman 95; see copies A and B, object 2, l. 38). Once students come to think of
               their struggles with the esoteric Blake as a “mental fight” they are obliged to wage
               in their own right, they can also come to see that many aspects of the works that
               bewilder them are those that dramatize or enact this “fight.” There Blake does what
               in the prefatory poem he says he will do. Coming this far can prepare students to
               rethink their acts of reading precisely <em>as</em> acts in the strong sense of the word, or, even better, experience their reading activity
               as dramas on the order of Blake’s poems and/or of Blake’s visionary dramas as unrolling
               within them. Thus, they become, as it were, dramatic characters, the “Visionary forms
               dramatic,” in the poems (Erdman 257; <em>Jerusalem </em>copy E, plate 98, l. 29).</p>
            <p>My story begins with the first time that I taught a course on Romanticism. As an overly
               conscientious new assistant professor, I felt obliged to include some of the esoteric
               Blake in my syllabus despite my discomfort with him. I was worried about my authority
               in the classroom in general, but that worry was nowhere more intense than with this
               Blake. My response at the time was to shore up my authority by developing as much
               expertise as I could in the short time available, and to do so, I set out to read
               Geoffrey Keynes’s <em>The Complete Writings of William Blake </em>(1966) from cover to cover along with a good chunk of the extant criticism. Any reasonable
               person would have realized from the outset that this was an impossible task, and,
               sure enough, it wasn’t long before I was forced to rethink my strategy. I hit a wall
               once I embarked on longer, more complex, and more daunting works, which, I stress,
               I was reading for the first time. I can best illustrate why by recurring to one day
               when I spent ten hours reading such works. By early evening, I was in a mental state
               that was akin to tripping—or to what I imagined tripping was like. I felt as if I
               was having a drug-free psychedelic experience. The feeling was so intense and overwhelming
               that I remember it vividly decades later. Since my reading was in the service of teaching,
               which then meant mastery to me, the experience felt profoundly disabling. However,
               when I managed to bracket the approaching semester and immerse myself in the reading
               experience itself, I felt exhilarated. In fact, I was laughing, and I made everyone
               I met that evening laugh by saying that if the illegal drug trade knew about the cheap
               and perfectly legal high that Blake provided, they would burn every copy, because
               he could put them out of business. For me, the big difference between now and then
               is that at the time it did not occur to me that I could use this response in my teaching,
               and if back then someone had suggested that I try to do so, I would have told that
               person in no uncertain terms that he or she was insane.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Only by virtue of reading, rereading, and teaching Blake year after year and semester
                  after semester did I slowly grow to feel that my personal enjoyment did not have to
                  remain separate from what I did in the classroom. In the course of repeatedly engaging
                  with a number of his texts (at this time I was dealing only with the texts, not the
                  illuminations), I found myself positively warming to some, namely, the manifesto-like
                  ones that I have mentioned above: “There Is No Natural Religion,” “All Religions Are
                  One,” and <em>The Marriage</em>. Over time, I came to discern that these works could be read precisely as Blakean
                  lessons in reading, most obviously through their insistence on other modes of perception
                  beyond those available through the five physical, “bounded” senses. For the purposes
                  of this essay, in the next section I focus on <em>The Marriage</em> to exemplify the pedagogy of non-mastery that teaches with, rather than despite, the
                  instructor’s (i.e., my) limitations. However, before I go any further, let me hasten
                  to add that none of this is to say that I think knowing Blake well is a hindrance
                  to teaching him or that ignorance is the great desideratum of teaching or scholarship.
                  Not only does Blake scholarship, which is particularly vibrant at this moment, disprove
                  any such absurd claim, it also includes voices that speak in a spirit similar to the
                  one that I advocate here.

               <p>For reasons of economy, I choose from the many passages of <em>The Marriage </em>that can be read as lessons for reading three of the “Memorable Fancies”: the narrator’s
                  dinner with Isaiah and Ezekiel (plate 12), the one where the speaker and an angel
                  set out to show each other their eternal lots (plates 17-20), and the one where the
                  Devil and the Angel contend (plates 22-24). In plate 12 where the speaker questions
                  the prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel, I suggest that modes of perception align with interpretive
                  approaches:

                  </blockquote> I understand this exchange to raise one of the basic questions of Biblical hermeneutics:
                  whether to take scripture literally or figuratively, which is to say imaginatively,
                  and I take Isaiah to be challenging the assumption that the default mode of interpretation
                  is the literal one, which is based on “finite organical perception.” To take this
                  point beyond canonical sacred texts and to demonstrate what a different kind of perception
                  might look like, I find it helpful to turn to the poem that Blake includes in his
                  letter to Thomas Butts of 22 November, 1802—a text that elaborates on alternative,
                  expanded modes of sensory experience: among them, the “double vision” that sees with
                  an inward eye in addition to an outer eye (Erdman 721; l. 28). What appears to the
                  “outward” eye merely “a Thistle across my way” is to the “inward Eye . . . an old
                  Man grey” who speaks prophecies to Blake (Erdman 721; l. 30, l. 29).

            <p>Infinite perception is associated with daring: “I cared not for consequences,” Isaiah
               says. I suggest that perhaps we can become the type of reader who rises to Isaiah’s
               challenge by being daring as well, and for a model, I point to the young man who contends
               with the moralizing angel on plate 17. The angel, who would frighten him with a vision
               of his eternal damnation, demands security. His approach is to show the young man
               the abyss while they both remain outside it: they “held by the roots of trees and
               hung over this immensity,” as a frightful apocalyptic scene unrolls below them (Erdman
               41). In contrast, the young man proposes that they throw caution to the winds and
               plunge in: “if you please we will commit ourselves to this void, and see whether providence
               is here also, if you will not I will?” (Erdman 41). When the speaker finally acts
               on this impulse, he finds that the Angel’s fear is what generated the fearsome sight.
               When the angel is gone, the young man is rewarded for his fearlessness with an idyllic
               pastoral vision: “I found myself sitting on a pleasant bank beside a river by moon
               light hearing a harper who sung to the harp” (Erdman 41-42). </p>
            <p>Once we reach this point, I suggest that as readers we might think of the positions
               that the angel and the devil take to this vision as indicating the available relations
               that we as readers can assume to the text. These come down to the alternative between
               reading at a remote distance from the text and immersing oneself in it, where we understand
               the immersion as our own implication in the text. It seems to me that we, professors
               and students alike, habitually read as angels. Eager and sometimes desperate to find
               a firm interpretive foothold, we place ourselves outside the text without considering
               whether or not there are other possible stances. But just as Isaiah showed us an alternative
               to assuming that the default mode of interpretation is literal, the final “Memorable
               Fancy” shows us that we can choose an alternative position, and it does so by showing
               that by the end of the work, the angel becomes a devil and reads like one. This section
               has particular pedagogical value, for, if the angel, who embodies conventional authority,
               can make the leap, can’t anyone, including us? Finally, the wild humor of the entire
               scene aids the process of transformation because the silent or outright laughter it
               provokes is a form of “sensual enjoyment,” and if we give ourselves over to it, it
               can cleanse “the doors of perception” (Erdman 39), as Blake says. </p>
            <p>To turn now to the Angel’s transformation: it occurs through contention, illustrating
               Blake’s axiom that “Opposition is true Friendship” (Erdman 42). The context is that
               the Angel and a Devil argue about the nature of God. The Devil pronounces the heterodox
               conviction that “The worship of God is. Honouring his gifts in other men each according
               to his genius. and loving the greatest men best . . . for there is no other God”:
               <span class="quote">‘The Angel hearing this became almost blue but mastering himself he grew yellow, &amp;
                  at last white pink &amp; smiling, and then replied, “Thou Idolater, is not God One? &amp;
                  is not he visible in Jesus Christ? and has not Jesus Christ given his sanction to
                  the law of ten commandments . . . ?” (Erdman 43)’</span> In tracing the color changes the Angel undergoes, the young man provides a wickedly
               funny genealogy of the anodyne renditions of angels in much religious painting. The
               saccharine, benign pastel images that we have come to expect are exposed as nothing
               but a cover for the suppressed rage of the orthodox when their dogma is challenged.
               I can never refrain from laughing at the incongruity of this rage vis-à-vis typical
               cherubic representations. By giving in to the impulse to laugh, I convey to the students
               that it’s okay for them to laugh too because literature can be funny, and it can be
               funny in order to say something important.</p>
            <p>The Angel holds his ground in the first round of his argument with the Devil, but
               he meets his match when the Devil counterattacks him, asserting: “no virtue can exist
               without breaking these ten commandments: Jesus was all virtue, and acted from impulse:
               not from rules” (Erdman 43). Here the Angel, up to now so cautious, becomes as daring
               as the young man and Isaiah. Apparently no longer caring for consequences or physical
               danger, he “stretched out his arms embracing the flame of fire &amp; he was consumed and
               arose as Elijah” (Erdman 43). This self-immolation effects his transformation, and
               he becomes the young man’s reading buddy: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <p class="noCount">Note. This Angel, who is now become a Devil, is my particular friend: we often read

            </blockquote>
            <p> Here the speaker speaks with exuberant defiance, adopting first the voice of a cajoling
               parent. The Bible in its infernal sense is a reward for good behavior in the logic
               of “be good now, and you’ll get ice cream later” (i.e., deferred gratification) and
               then that of harsh parental authority—you’ll get the Bible of Hell, whether you like
               it or not. In both cases, the speaker mimics the voice of conventional morality to
               defy it. This is one way in which the poem stages a marriage of heaven and hell; here
               it is a marriage of voices in which one parodies or, in Blakean language, “imposes”
               on the other (Erdman 37, 42). More particularly, this passage exposes the <span class="foreign">ressentiment</span> at the basis of moral and religious authority, which it counters through parody.</p>
            <p>I have taught <em>The Marriage </em>to undergraduate and graduate students alike. Now I would like to turn to the challenge
               of teaching the most daunting of Blake’s works to graduate students, and here I draw
               on my recent experience of teaching <em>Milton</em>. I must admit that we did not get very far with the poem in this class, and I did
               not find it a particularly satisfying pedagogical experience. Truth to tell, by any
               usual definition, it was largely a failure, and for that reason, it haunted me, but
               not in a completely negative way. What I could not forget was the intensity of the
               work and of the classroom atmosphere, and, besides, I love a challenge. I am convinced
               that I learned more about teaching the esoteric Blake from this teaching failure than
               I would have if this experience had been what generally passes for successful. The
               fact that I had a graduate student audience defined this pedagogical situation to
               a great extent. The advantages of teaching a difficult text to graduate students rather
               than undergraduates are obvious, but there are particular challenges too. Since graduate
               students are far more invested in achieving mastery, they feel the imperative to understand
               much more intensely than undergraduates do and consequently are more terrified at
               the prospect of not “getting it.” It is as if non-understanding were specifically
               disallowed by the implicit contract they signed on entering graduate school. Other
               defining factors were two decisions that I made because of time limitations: I reluctantly
               decided not to assign <em>The Marriage</em>, despite my conviction of its great pedagogical value, and I dedicated only two,
               three-hour seminar meetings to <em>Milton</em>, which was not nearly enough time. Both of these decisions exacerbated the inherent
               difficulty of the work for my students, and they understandably panicked. Since they
               experienced their panic as failure, their distress threatened to prevent us from doing
               any work at all on the poem. So I had to come up on the spot with some ways of averting
               that outcome.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>First, I suggested that one reason they were so unnerved was that they were each assuming
                  they were the only ones who were struggling, and I assured them that this was not
                  the case; Blake’s late prophecies bewilder everyone who approaches them for the first
                  time. Stating this explicitly may seem trivial, but the students reported that it
                  helped a great deal, and the atmosphere in the room became palpably more relaxed.
                  Second, since I found myself tactically quoting <em>The Marriage</em> to illuminate <em>Milton</em>, I reversed course and made it available to them. Working through these various difficulties
                  made us bond as a group and allowed us to continue with a sense of shared purpose.
                  Finally, I took advantage of the fact that <em>Milton </em>is one of Blake’s most spectacular illuminated books and displayed the various copies
                  of some of the most stunning illustrations side by side, using the invaluable “compare”
                  function on the <em>Blake Archive</em>. Seeing these versions raised some fundamental questions, including ones concerning
                  the definition of what constitutes a “work” by Blake. Is it all the copies? Since
                  the various copies do not all contain the same plates or order the plates in the same
                  way, are they the same work or not? Are they all copies of an original? Are they all
                  originals? Is each one a different work? Is the metal plate the original from which
                  all the copies derive? Is it part of the work, or is the work limited to one or all
                  the printed versions? Is the “real” <em>Milton</em> for Blake and for us perhaps best thought of as mental—that is, the simultaneous totality
                  of all the copies, which we can see only in imagination?

                  </div> apply to Blake’s very different mode of production? Exactly what are we referring
                  to when we refer to <em>Milton</em>?</p>
            </div>
            <p>We did not come to any absolute conclusions about these questions, and there may be
               no definitive answers to them. These questions can, however, make us aware that our
               default ways of thinking about them are not neutral but rather have been formed by
               what has been, until recently, the dominant mode of production of our time. Perhaps
               we need a different conceptual language to talk about Blake’s copies of the illuminated
               texts. Among all these unanswered questions, one thing became clear: now that, thanks
               to the <em>Blake Archive</em>, the illuminated works are readily available and at no cost, we are not really talking
               about <em>Milton </em>or any other of Blake’s illuminated works if we talk only about the words. In fact,
               it may be wrongheaded to see the designs as secondary or supplementary to the written
               text, and we misrecognize the text also if we take a verbal transcription in conventional
               print as equivalent to Blake’s lettering. As De Luca has pointed out, Blake pushes
               the lettering of the illuminated books as close to the visual as possible, with strokes
               of letters curling off into vine-like structures (89-90). More specifically, we talked
               about how the different colorings on versions of the same plate created radically
               different moods or atmospheres, and I suggested that one might think about them in
               relation to the references to atmosphere in the verbal text or “States of the Human
               Soul,” which are in this work more numerous (or more multi-dimensional) than the contraries
               of “innocence” and “experience.” Perhaps most fundamentally, the power and vividness
               of the illuminations can draw students in even when they feel that they have not been
               able to understand much. My ultimate hope is that the attraction that the illuminations
               hold will help students eventually come to question understanding, or at least the
               kind of understanding that rests on “Single vision &amp; Newton’s sleep” (Erdman 722)
               as the goal of reading Blake. I shall say more about this below.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This is where I stood with Blake when I attended the <em>Jerusalem</em> workshop. Participants offered a number of innovative suggestions for teaching <em>Jerusalem</em>, which apply as well to all of Blake’s most challenging works.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note18" id="Note18_return"><sup class="super">

                           create their own mythological character. Drawing on the popularity of video games,
                           Peter Otto said that asking students to think of reading Jerusalem as moving through
                           a virtual space could connect Blake to the world of popular culture they know well.
                           For Milton as itself a virtual space, see Broglio, who offers the Milton MOO as an
                           example of how new media can be performative in the context of literary studies. After
                           detailing the “rich literary elements” that make Blake’s poetry an apt test case for
                           pushing …</span></div>
                  </div> However, my own experience with Blake suddenly crystallized when Swann led the discussion
                  to the subject of forgiveness and the refusal to forgive in <em>Jerusalem</em>. Her example was Albion’s refusal to forgive Jerusalem, and one could also add the
                  spectre of Los’s refusal to forgive Albion. As Swann pointed out, the refusers harden
                  themselves and stand on the rock of the law. When the “Saviour” calls to Albion, “we
                  are One; forgiving all Evil” (Erdman 146), Albion brutally rebuffs him: “here will
                  I build my Laws of Moral Virtue!” (Erdman 147). All of a sudden it occurred to me
                  that we do the same thing when we search for an authoritative interpretation, when
                  we want to be sure we understand, when we seek to stand on solid interpretive ground.
                  In the context of <em>Milton</em>, we act like Satan (who here is not “of the Devils party” and therefore not a “true
                  Poet” [Erdman 35]) when he imposes his code of sin and punishment and declares himself
                  the only God: 
                  <blockquote class="quote">
                     <div class="stanza">

                     </div>
                  </blockquote> Thus, we must enter the same “Mental Fight” that Blake declares in the preface of <em>Milton </em>(Erdman 95; see copies A and B, object 2, l. 38). This fight is the drama that Blake
                  thematizes and enacts in all of the prophecies centering on mythological characters.
                  The enactive aspect is one reason <em>Milton </em>is so challenging. It does not merely say that the title character opens up and falls
                  through multiple dimensions of space and time; it performs those events and forces
                  the reader to experience them. We barely engage with the poem unless we enter its
                  multi-dimensional universe, but when we do so, it engulfs and disorients us. The trick,
                  as Mary Lynn Johnson and Ron Broglio (for example) each point out, is to realize that
                  this is the means by which the poem “helps cleanse the [our] doors of perception”
                  (Johnson 231; Broglio). Blake is about the toxic effects of the desire for mastery,
                  and <em>Milton </em>teaches us to give up the master’s position by giving us no choice but to do so. So,
                  if we do not pass through a moment of the reading process where we feel that we do
                  not and cannot “get it,” we stand little or no chance of “getting it.” This means
                  that undergoing the negative affects in the first place is absolutely necessary. As
                  has often been noted, <em>Milton </em>and <em>Jerusalem</em> contain biographical elements where Blake strikes back at those he considered the
                  enemies of his imagination, such as his well-meaning but hopelessly conventional patron
                  William Hayley. However, as Blake declares in a number of letters, it is most urgently
                  a battle that he was obliged to wage again and again within himself, for he had to
                  contend with his inner Urizenic reasoner in order to keep his visionary imagination
                  alive. For our students and for us, it is a battle of reading and interpretation in
                  which we are called to tolerate uncertainty and confusion in the classroom and put
                  our authority on the line. In <em>Milton</em>, the moment of risking authority occurs when the title character identifies with
                  Satan and turns against the Satan in himself: 
                  <blockquote class="quote">
                     <div class="stanza">
                        <div class="l">I in my Selfhood am that Satan: I am that Evil One!</div>
                        <div class="l">He is my Spectre! in my obedience to loose him from my Hells</div>
                        <div class="l">To claim the Hells, my Furnaces, I go to Eternal Death. (Erdman 108; copy B, object

                     </div>
                  </blockquote> Our professorial “Selfhood” is our desire to have the authoritative reading. If we
                  can relinquish it and dare to admit to our students that we often feel unsure when
                  reading Blake, our self-annihilation can also feel freeing, for the responsibility
                  of always knowing and always having to be right is a heavy burden.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p><em>Milton</em> is the ideal work for such teaching because it pushes the issue of understanding to
                  the crisis point with the refrain that punctuates the Bard’s song: “Mark well my words!
                  they are of your eternal salvation” (Erdman 96; copy B, objects 3, 5 [twice], 7 and
                  9). When “eternal salvation” is the stakes of “mark[ing] well,” could they possibly
                  be any higher? They are certainly higher than feeling or looking stupid, the typical
                  readerly fear with Blake. Eaves wittily remarks that “such ultimate claims on ‘your’
                  devotion can leave you feeling hung out to dry, with only yourself to blame for your
                  failures” (6). For what does it mean to mark the Bard’s words, and how do we know
                  if we are marking them well? We see one consequence of not marking his words well
                  through those who dwelt on the “mild banks” of the river Ololon in Eden (Erdman 115;
                  copy B, object 19). Blake writes:

                                    dwelt those who Milton droveDown into Ulro: and they wept in long resounding song
                                    (Erdman 115; object 19, ll. 15-17)In this passage, the reader likely construes the
                                    dwellers on the river banks as subject and Milton as direct object, but it is equally
                                    possible to read “those who Milton drove” as a poetic inversion, so that subject and

                  that “mov’d Milton, who walkd [sic] about in Eternity . . . To go into the deep .
                  . .” (Erdman 96). Ostensibly, the speaker invokes the Muse to “Say [this] <em>first</em>” so that the reader will not repeat the mistake of the dwellers on the banks of Ololon,
                  who in Blake’s manifold vision, are also the people of Ololon and Milton’s “Sixfold
                  Emanation” (Erdman 96, emphasis mine). The irony is that he has come to redeem them.
                  Apparently, the danger is that we will mistake our redeemer for our enemy and the
                  dire process through which redemption occurs as a grievous error.</p>

            <p>It is possible to puzzle indefinitely over the meaning of the urgent imperative “Mark
               well my words! they are of your eternal salvation.” Perhaps our “eternal salvation”
               is to keep reading and rereading. At any rate, the imperative to “[m]ark” is another
               way that <em>Milton </em>implicates the reader in the text; it makes us actors in the drama that <em>Milton </em>relates. Perhaps <em>marking</em> can also be taken as the engraving and printing process, in which case, as suggested
               above, the reader participates with Blake in producing and printing the words of the
               poem. He calls us to be not only readers but also his co-writers. Talking in general
               about the reader as participant and implicated in the work is easy; the hard part
               is to take up the mind-bending work of seeing how this works specifically in any one
               Blake text. It is a labor that we as readers must perform anew with every reading
               of a Blake work. On one level, they are all the stories of our reading/textual production.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I close with some remarks on how, building on what I learned between the Spring Semester
                  of 2013 and now, I would teach <em>Milton </em>differently in the future. To sum up what I have already stated: I would prepare the
                  ground by using the works mentioned above as providing a relatively user-friendly
                  introduction to Blake’s prophecies, and I would build flexibility into the syllabus
                  so as to be able to adjust the class time according to the needs of the students in
                  any particular group; this is the change that makes all others possible. For all assignments
                  and class discussions, I would integrate attention to the two things I have emphasized
                  in this essay—the affective and visual aspects of the works—into considerations of
                  the verbal texts. I would encourage students to <em>look</em> at all of the plates from first to last before reading. Going from “There Is No Natural
                  Religion” and “All Religions Are One” to <em>The Marriage </em>and then <em>Milton </em>will have the added benefit of providing some sense of Blake’s evolution as a writer
                  and artist. To take full advantage of the <em>Blake Archive</em>, I would devote one class (or as much of it as necessary) to taking the interactive
                  tour of the website (available from the site’s homepage) with my students; now that
                  most of them have laptops and/or tablets, they could play along instead of just watching
                  me do it. I have found the “search” function on the homepage and the “show me” and
                  “compare” buttons for individual plates especially useful. By allowing the user to
                  enlarge the image, see a visual description of it, and read a textual transcription,
                  the “show me” button helps educate the reader’s eye in how to view the plates and
                  in some cases how to make viewing and reading work together. A few dry runs with colleagues,
                  who have all responded with amazement and rapt delight, have convinced me that exploring
                  its capabilities stands a good chance of hooking the viewer on Blake. I would frame
                  our discussion of <em>The Marriage</em> by asking how we get from the various couples on the title page to the “marriage”
                  between the young man and the angel at the end of the work. The illustration description
                  of the title plate with some uncertainty identifies the two large figures at the bottom
                  of the plate as a woman (on the left) and a man (on the right). Yet the figure on
                  the right looks more like another woman to me. Does that figure’s gender make a significant
                  difference? How might we think about going from a marriage between a man and woman
                  or between two women to a marriage between two men? These questions can set up a discussion
                  of the pronounced homo

                  of the title plate of <em>The Marriage</em>. If, as the illustration description suggests, the bottom left of the image is hell
                  and the right heaven, what do we make of the horizontal division about a third of
                  the way down the page? We would normally expect heaven to be above and hell below.
                  This complication of direction and dimension, which participates in satirizing conventional
                  views of good and evil in the work, can set the stage for the more thoroughgoing dislocations
                  of <em>Milton</em>.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>For both <em>The Marriage </em>and <em>Milton</em>, using the “compare” feature allows students to see for themselves that, when colored
                  differently, copies of the same plate can produce startlingly different impressions.
                  It is also important for them to see that not all copies of <em>Milton </em>contain the same plates; for example, the preface on the “Daughters of Inspiration”
                  and the “Daughters of Memory” and the poem “And did those feet,” the best known lines
                  in the poem, appear only in copies A and B (Erdman 95). For <em>Milton</em>, in addition to using the <em>Blake Archive</em>, I would also assign the volume in the Princeton edition of <em>The Illuminated Books of William Blake </em>(1993) for two reasons: the scholarly apparatus of each includes things that the other
                  does not, and the reader/viewer enters the book format and the website in different
                  ways. This is all the more the case given that digital technology advances rapidly
                  and thus also rapidly becomes obsolete. A case in point is the <em>Milton </em>MOO formerly supported by the <em>Romantic Circles </em>website. “Changing servers and configurations and the by-now advanced age of the MOO
                  platform” have made site managers at <em>Romantic Circles</em> unable “to keep up support for it.”

                  </div> When the MOO was up and running, one could turn the pages of the “book” form of <em>Milton </em>with one’s hand in virtual reality, and this possibility had profound implications
                  for the reader’s relation to the work. As Broglio writes: <span class="quote">‘This famous opening page shows Milton naked, having cast off the robes of promise,
                     and pushing with his right hand through the ether as he begins the descent to the
                     vegetative world. The reader upon opening the book and beginning a descent into its
                     pages places a hand over the upper right hand corner to flip the page. Doing so, the
                     reader’s hand is placed over Milton’s hand so that the two perform a descent at the
                     same time. Whose hand it is flipping and descending is up for grabs. Remember that
                     Milton’s hand is drawn with Blake’s hand but Blake has been possessed and commanded
                     to write by Milton who is possessed and inspired by the bard. The reader cannot enter
                     the poem, that is enter <em>Milton</em>, without having Milton enter the reader. The physicality of reading allows Blake
                     to collapse the reader's second position—outside the poem—into part of the first position—being
                     immersed in the poem’s field of play. (par. 12)’</span> Now that the MOO is, unfortunately, no longer accessible, only the <em>Illuminated Books</em> edition of <em>Milton </em>allows the reader’s hand to merge with Milton’s on the title page. Nonetheless, Broglio’s
                  essay, which I would assign only <em>after</em> the class had done a first reading of the poem without secondary material, can still
                  give readers a sense of <em>Milton</em> as an interactive, multi-dimensional virtual space and of Blake himself as a constructor
                  of virtual realities well before digital technology came into being. By the same token,
                  this essay can help students—especially gamers but also digital natives in general—transform
                  their disorientation, confusion, frustration, and fear into a virtual reality experience.

                  </div> The transformation is a crucial part of the process; this is also to say that one
                  completely misses Blake’s visionary rush if one does not lose one’s bearings in the

                  we take as <em>the</em> world, and we need to be forced out of this perspective over and over again. If students
                  do not initially feel lost, they will never realize that their doors of perception
                  need to be cleansed in the first place and therefore never experience the cleansing.
                  Blake is about this transformation.</p>

                  of the work together, I focus on the title plate and the plate where Milton contends
                  with and sculpts Urizen (object 17 in the <em>Blake Archive</em>; plate 15 in the Princeton edition). Under the illustration appears the caption:
                  “To Annihilate the Selfhood of Deceit and False Forgiveness.” Both the “illustration
                  description” of this plate on the <em>Blake Archive</em> and the editorial apparatus of the Princeton <em>Milton</em> point out that Milton’s right foot, which—I add—is associated with poetic inspiration
                  at key moments in the work, visually enacts the annihilation of the Selfhood by splitting
                  the very word into its two constituent syllables.

                           makes a similar point: “With his right foot Milton quite literally breaks the ‘Self-

               <p>As a theoretical support for this queer reading of Blake, I would introduce Leo Bersani’s
                  notion of “shattering” into the discussion, for it is specifically a “shattering”
                  of the “structured self” through sexual acts. In a reading of <em>Civilization and Its Discontents</em> (1930), Bersani argues that for Freud the shattering power of sexual enjoyment can
                  be traced back to the species’ atavistic memory of “the experience, or rather the
                  smell of sex before we adopted an erect posture,” and Bersani characterizes this Freudian
                  speculation as “the fantasy of a mythic, prehistoric convulsing of our physical being
                  in the passionate sniffing of a male on all fours” (17).

                  In any case, the point is not for the commentary to do the work of seeing for the
                  students but to give them examples of how they might proceed on their own. In allowing
                  the user to see as many copies side by side as s/he chooses, the “compare” button
                  exponentially increases the “sensual enjoyment” one experiences by looking at any
                  one copy alone, while also facilitating the all-important but never finally accomplished

               literature that the digital and book editions provide are the indications of scholarly
               disagreement, sometimes on the most basic things. The Princeton <em>Illuminated Books </em>edition of <em>Milton </em>is particularly instructive on this score. For example, its annotations often note
               that different scholars identify figures in some designs differently. Perhaps the
               most telling case is that of the three nude figures in plate 8 of the Princeton edition,
               for whom the editors Robert Essick and Joseph Viscomi find eight extant interpretations
               in the secondary literature, in which even the gender can vary” (22). Awareness of
               the disagreements can helpfully lead students to think of the annotations not as certain
               knowledge but as possible interpretations, which as such do not have absolute or sole
               authority. Or better, they might come to ask whether any one set of identifications
               is sufficient, since much of the action in <em>Milton </em>and the other prophecies is driven by the dissolution, multiplication, and reforming
               of unstable identities. Blake’s manifold vision might demand multiplicitous, simultaneous
               identifications.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, for me the Blake of the prophecies is a poet of radical excess, and
               the most fruitful place to begin in teaching such works is with the thoroughgoing
               confusion that any reader experiences. Our default ways of reading are based on the
               kind of analytic demonstration that is precisely the mindset that Blake is trying
               to disrupt. Feeling lost beyond any possibility of being found again shakes us out
               of our rational reading habits. Confusion is thus not only lack of understanding—nor
               is it the beginning of understanding in the sense of the cliché—it is the beginning
               of a different path that is not the path of understanding at all and does not have
               what we usually conceive of as understanding as its goal. The type of non-understanding
               I am talking about is not a negative but a contrary, in Blake’s sense of those words.
               It is something positive. When I spend a long time at a stretch with any of Blake’s
               late prophecies, a funny thing happens not only with the plates but also with the
               scholarly apparatus, whose ostensible function is to orient us. In tracing much of
               Blake’s mythological world to numerous esoteric traditions, it eventually devolves
               itself into an unmanageable excess of annotations, glosses, and cross-references.
               There is always a point where I want to scream at Blake and his editors: “Stop! Stop,
               it’s already too much; I can’t take anymore.” This is all the more the case when the
               apparatus is particularly full and rich, as in the Princeton <em>Illuminated Books </em>editions. But if, going by the Blakean Proverbs of Hell that it is never “Enough”
               until it is “Too much” and “The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom,” I persevere
               and keep coming back, I finally arrive at the point where I no longer experience being
               overwhelmed and unable to find my bearings as defeat (Erdman 38, 35). I finally say:
               yes, yes, more, more, keep it coming.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">I add that I have never taught a class devoted entirely to William Blake; rather,
               on the undergraduate level, I have included him in large-scale historical surveys
               (from the Romantics to the Moderns) and introductory classes on poetry, and on the
               graduate level in broader-based classes on Romanticism and thematically focused seminars
               in the period. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">The year 1995, which saw the publication of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Adam Frank’s
               “Shame in the Cybernetic Fold” and Brian Massumi’s “The Autonomy of Affect” is often
               cited as a watershed moment in affect theory. Other commonly cited works include Rei
               Terada’s <em>Feeling in Theory</em> (2001); <em>The Affective Turn</em>, edited by Patricia Clough (2007); Sianne Ngai’s <em>Ugly Feelings</em> (2005); Heather Love’s <em>Feeling Backward</em> (2007); and <em>Romanticism and the Emotions</em>, edited by Joel Faflak and Richard C. Sha (2014). The type of teaching that I advocate
               in this essay is close to what Andrew H. Miller explores as “implicative criticism”
               in “Implicative Criticism, or the Display of Thinking.” In their “Introduction: Feeling
               Romanticism” (in <em>Romanticism and the Emotions</em>), Faflak and Sha state: “Once a toxic chemical, emotion now fuels the affective turn
               in humanities and social science research” (1).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Silvan Tomkins has come into literary studies through queer theory and more specifically
               under Sedgwick’s influence. The current visibility of Baruch Spinoza in literary studies
               owes a great deal to the influence of Gilles Deleuze. Deleuze’s two books on Spinoza
               are <em>Spinoza: Practical Philosophy</em> (2001) and <em>Expressionism in Philosophy: Spinoza</em> (1992).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Lisa Ann Robertson made this point in “The Enactive Imagination: William Wordsworth’s

         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Karen Swann’s pedagogical essay on <em>Jerusalem</em> begins with a brilliant treatment of readerly affect—her own and that of her students.
               I attempt to get at some of the same issues in the thread of the present essay on
               affect.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Tomkins’s most poignant examples involve shame and fear. For his account of “how a
               total affect-shame bind can be produced,” see <em>Shame and Its Sisters</em> (163-165, 172-174). For his account of how a person can develop a strong theory of
               fear, see (165-168).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">Reading Blake after Spinoza, I cannot help but think of Blake’s method in the treatises
               “All Religions Are One” and “There Is No Natural Religion” as akin to the “geometric
               style” that Spinoza adopts in the <em>Ethics</em> (1677): “I shall consider human actions and appetites just as if it were a question
               of lines, planes, and bodies” (69).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">In line with this eschewing of moral prescription, Spinoza radically redefines “good”
               and “evil” (in the scholium to proposition 39 of part 3 [IIIP39S]): “By good here
               I understand every kind of joy, and whatever leads to it, and especially what satisfies
               any kind of longing, whatever that may be. And by evil [I understand here] every kind
               of sadness, and especially what frustrates longing. For we have shown above (in P9S)
               that we desire nothing because we judge it to be good, but on the contrary, we call
               it good because we desire it. Consequently, what we are averse to we call evil” (91).
               In his introduction to the Penguin edition of the <em>Ethics</em>, Stuart Hampshire notes that the brackets contain either variant texts or possibly
               the translator’s errors or license (xix).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">In her essay on which her <em>Jerusalem</em> workshop was based, Swann speaks to the desirability of providing students with the
               means to keep from feeling totally at sea.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">Morris Eaves makes this point in “To Paradise the Hard Way” in his introduction to
               <em>The Cambridge Companion to William Blake </em>(2003).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">Unless otherwise noted, all parenthetical page citations for Blake quotations refer
               to David Erdman’s edition of <em>The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</em> (1988). When I refer to or quote from an illuminated plate in a work that is available
               on the <em>Blake Archive</em> website, I also specify the copy I use and provide object numbers (which correspond
               to plate numbers in printed versions). Where appropriate, I supply line numbers as
               well.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">On this point Eaves quotes W. M. Rossetti, who “wrote in reaction to a nineteenth-century
               facsimile of <em>Jerusalem</em> (1877), ‘the publication in ordinary book-form, without designs . . . of the <em>Jerusalem</em> and the other Prophetic Books, is highly to be desired. Difficult under any circumstances,
               it would be a good deal <em>less </em>difficult to read these works in an edition of that kind, with clear print, reasonable
               division of lines, and the like aids to business-like perusal’” (Eaves 7). It’s hard
               not to imagine Blake turning over in his grave at the word “business-like,” and for
               this reason it is important to stress that such a reading is only an early step along
               a path that makes a very different kind of reading possible.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">14. </span><span class="noteBody">For examples, Eaves uses the metaphors of exploration and extreme sports for reading
               Blake (14-15). In a similar spirit, Mary Lynn Johnson declares: “The best way into
               the time-twisting, identity-scrambling otherworld of Blake’s <em>Milton: A Poem</em> (c. 1804-18) is to set aside guidebooks, including this one, take a deep breath,
               and follow the hero as he breaks through the surface of the title page—alone, without
               a ‘companion’ . . . to brave the swirling abyss of the unknown” (231). She goes on
               to liken the process as “a wilderness-survival test” (231). The example of Blake scholarship
               that to my knowledge goes farthest in this direction is Ron Broglio’s “Living Inside
               the Poem: MOOs and Blake’s <em>Milton</em>.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note15"><span class="noteLabel">15. </span><span class="noteBody">The final lines of the poem go on to “threefold” and “fourfold vision,” which contrast
               with “Single vision &amp; Newton’s sleep” (Erdman 722; l. 88), but since they introduce
               “Beulah,” and with it Blake’s mythological geography, at this point they are liable
               to be as confusing as they are to be helpful.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note16"><span class="noteLabel">16. </span><span class="noteBody">Seeing the side-by-side plates on the <em>Blake Archive</em> is not exactly the same thing, but it can be a step toward that impossible total
               feat.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note17"><span class="noteLabel">17. </span><span class="noteBody">See Walter Benjamin’s “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note18"><span class="noteLabel">18. </span><span class="noteBody">For example, Swann suggested having students write their own Proverbs of Hell and/or
               create their own mythological character. Drawing on the popularity of video games,
               Peter Otto said that asking students to think of reading <em>Jerusalem</em> as moving through a virtual space could connect Blake to the world of popular culture
               they know well. For <em>Milton</em> as itself a virtual space, see Broglio, who offers the <em>Milton</em> MOO as an example of how new media can be performative in the context of literary
               studies. After detailing the “rich literary elements” that make Blake’s poetry an
               apt test case for pushing the immersive possibilities of MOOs, he adds: “Blake had
               already thought through the problem of creating immersive environments. His characters
               are continually creating windows and doors into new worlds or falling through space
               and time in such a way that the fall creates both space and time. Through their immersive
               interaction with one another and their surroundings, Blake’s characters forge the
               world upon which the narrative is staged. In like manner, Blake wants the reader to
               immerse him/herself in the poem such that ‘doors of perception’ open for the reader,
               creating new worlds and new possibilities” (par. 7).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note18_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note19"><span class="noteLabel">19. </span><span class="noteBody">See also a similar passage that appears approximately twenty lines earlier: 
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">There is in Eden a sweet River, of mild &amp; liquid pearl,</div>
                     <div class="l">Namd Ololon; on whose mild banks dwelt those who Milton drove</div>
                     <div class="l">Down into Ulro: and they wept in long resounding song (Erdman 115; object 19, ll.
                        15-17)</div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>In this passage, the reader likely construes the dwellers on the river banks as subject
               and Milton as direct object, but it is equally possible to read “those who Milton
               drove” as a poetic inversion, so that subject and object are reversed. Lines 31 and
               32 of this plate fix the syntax: “they had . . . / Driven Milton . . .” One could
               perhaps take the difference between the two passages and/or the ambiguous syntax (ll.

               The annotation in the Princeton edition makes a similar point: “With his right foot

               (compare Milton’s foot breaking his ‘Self- -hood’ on plate 15)” (20). This plate corresponds
