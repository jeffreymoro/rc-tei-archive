            <p class="noCount">William Blake’s mastery of print media long presented a problem for readers of Blake
               who wished to experience the full range of his illuminated books. While <em>The William Blake Archive</em> offered a solution to access to the various copies, the formats for reading digital
               media have been too intrusive for conventional literary pedagogic experiences. As
               such, this paper explores the potential for a new generation of devices for opening
               up Blake’s works in a variety of ways and how that potential is itself affected by
               ecosystems and economic decisions that prevent easy, open access.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">Blake’s Books and Digital Ecosystems </span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>In 2013, at a meal with a poet and senior colleagues, the conversation at our table
               inevitably turned to books that we were reading. Admitting at some point that wherever
               possible I preferred to use a Kindle, I was met with a mixture of confusion and even
               mild horror, while for my part I felt considerable amusement at playing the role of
               devil’s advocate. I certainly do not read every book on such a device: many (particularly
               older ones still in copyright) are not available as e-books; for art books, I prefer
               a glossy hardback with high-quality paper and a resolution that even the latest 4K
               and Retina screens struggle to match; finally, I conceded that sometimes I was as
               interested in typography and layout (where a lot of e-books still falter) as I was
               in ideas and content. Yet, despite these various exceptions, it remains the case that
               the majority of books I read are electronic and that, where possible, I prefer to
               travel with most of my library in one device weighing a few ounces. I still remember
               visiting Rome on a holiday when I had to write an undergraduate dissertation: as my
               holdall passed through an airport X-ray machine, all that could be seen was a dense,
               black mass, and I spent the next half hour worrying that I was about to miss my flight
               while watching a security officer as he retrieved book after book from my bag. Against
               such undoubted convenience, however, my dinner guests fretted that something essential
               was being lost in the transition to electronic formats, and they were particularly
               surprised that someone who has spent so much of his career studying particular <em>books</em> could be so eager to abandon the citadel in favor of a platform better suited (as
               they saw it) for <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> (2011)<em>. </em></p>
            <p>In many respects, it would be easy to bracket off this particular discussion as taking
               place among a group of people of a certain age, ones who did not grow up as digital
               natives. While I do not consider that to be true (just from witnessing reading habits
               on different types of public transport where people of all ages increasingly read
               from electronic devices), we do seem to be approaching a period where the status of
               the printed book is converging with various other media such as DVDs and CDs, ripe
               for digital dissemination. Personally, I have a suspicion that the future role of
               print will be closer to that of vinyl: much loved by cognoscenti—who will laud its
               superior qualities—but not an object for mass consumption. As such, we have arrived
               at a crucial stage in the use of William Blake in the classroom, where mobile electronic
               devices will soon be ubiquitous. In the same year of my dinner discussion with the
               poet and colleagues, I taught classes where more students would turn up with some
               form of tablet or e-reader than a printed copy of the texts set for that week’s discussion.
               As an early adopter, previously I would sometimes elicit polite curiosity from those
               students as I sat in front of them with a Kindle or tablet: now it elicits no response
               whatsoever. As such, this essay is particularly concerned with an issue of digital
               pedagogy that is especially pertinent to Blake studies: what is it that students are
               actually reading and what role will e-books have in education in contrast to traditional
               print formats? While I believe that the electronic formats currently available are
               inadequate for Blake’s work, this inadequacy is based upon the fact that Blake is
               a special case that print has not served well. The issue of e-books is a surprisingly
               recent one for digital pedagogy, for reasons that have more to do with economics and
               distribution than the actual technology. In the illuminating 2007 collection, <em>Rethinking Pedagogy for a Digital Age</em>, for example, e-books are barely mentioned in contrast to e-portfolios and online
               delivery aimed at desktop and notebook computer users. Similarly, in Brett D. Hirsch’s
               edited volume <em>Digital Humanities Pedagogy </em>(2012), the main focus remains on the use of computer mediated technologies that bring
               with them considerable benefits for the processing of data to present it in innovative
               ways, such as Matthew K. Gold’s wonderful account of the project “Looking for Whitman.”
               But the actual experience of reading remains relatively unexplored, perhaps because
               that experience has been rendered apparently transparent by our close encounters with
               print. One of the great virtues of teaching and studying Blake is that the fundamental
               question of what it is we are reading, even how we actually read the pages before
               us, cannot be taken for granted.</p>
            <p>What is important here is not to create or invert hierarchies of print and other media,
               but to return to the objects of reading and transmission as part of a material culture
               that is not simply a crude materialism or technological determinism but instead part
               of an ecology (in Timothy Morton’s sense of the term): the “practice and process of
               becoming fully aware of how human beings are connected with other beings—animal, vegetable,
               mineral” (7). Such an ecology emphasizes, after Graham Harman (2011), Levi Bryant
               (2011), and Manuel De Landa (2009), a flat ontology of objects as the means to understand
               better that practice and process. This is especially important with Blake: most Blake
               readers do not have access to his original artifacts and have instead constantly engaged
               with products of different media and publishing ecosystems. I have written extensively
               with Roger Whitson about how Blake has been created as a virtual object in an archive
               and ecosystem created by publishing companies and academic scholars since the late-nineteenth
               century, and that this virtual Blake is a “plane of consistency” that makes possible
               the organization of particular works—for example the recognition that Blake wrote
               a body of work that we call the “prophetic books” (Whitson and Whittaker 33). What
               I am more concerned with in this essay, however, is the role of those digital ecosystems
               in which Blake—like so many authors and artists—will become increasingly entangled.
               In so many respects, Blake is an exemplar of print culture at its height, and he certainly
               understood the processes of printing much more than the vast majority of writers,
               but we must also accept that for the vast majority of future readers Blake will be
               digital.</p>
            <p>It is almost impossible to think that one of the most technologically-astute writers,
               artists, and self-publishers of his (or, indeed, any age) would have been anything
               other than profoundly concerned with the means of producing, disseminating, and consuming
               digital versions of his own works had he been alive and working today. In addition,
               although Blake, especially in his later life, demonstrated considerable hostility
               towards capitalism, he was deeply concerned with the <em>business</em> of literature and art—whether in his own projects such as printmaking or the illuminated
               books, or as engaged with publishing opportunities for editions of Edward Young’s
               <em>Night Thoughts</em> (1797) or Robert Blair’s <em>The Grave</em> (1808) (Bentley 69-81). With regard to the digital ecosystems in which his work will
               increasingly be encountered, however, it is important to take a critical and more
               properly ecological view than the oft-abused phrase “digital ecosystem” frequently
               allows. Theories of media ecologies have their roots in the work of Marshall McLuhan
               and Gregory Bateson among others, with important developments by theorists such as
               De Landa and Jussi Parikka (2012). Although there is a tendency to slip into media
               and technological determinism among a number of these writers or to emphasize the
               divisions between orality and literacy in ways that cannot always be justified, nonetheless
               such theorists contribute significantly to understanding the practices and processes
               by which we may gain awareness of our connection to other objects. This is very much
               in contrast to the notions of digital ecosystems as bandied around by monopolies such
               as the Big Four (Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook, the latter often interchangeable
               with, or supplemented by, Microsoft), who are attempting to gain control of our relations
               with media in a very deterministic fashion. As Michael deAgonia has written (somewhat
               melodramatically) the contest between tech behemoths is “a war between vast ecosystems
               made up of hardware, software and online services,” one in which the ecosystem is
               very clearly tied to economic imperatives above anything else and in which the aim
               of such a comprehensive market and operational system is intended to obscure users
               to the consequences of their buying decisions. For those interested, deAgonia’s article
               is an extremely good summary of how the big technology groups are seeking to exercise
               monopoly over media consumption, but as with so much current technology writing on
               the subject, the reduction of important agents in these ecosystems to the role of
               consumers offers more blindness than insight.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Blake’s own system of production was, as practice, a trenchant critique of the system
                  of publishing in his time, whereby late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth-century booksellers
                  hardened the barriers between producers and consumers. Morris Eaves has discussed
                  extensively how the <em>Public Address</em> (1810), issued as an advertisement for the engraving of Chaucer’s Canterbury pilgrims,
                  explored the processes of a “rational division of production” that adapted programs
                  of pedagogy and principles to an ideal of a macrosystem capable of unifying all aspects
                  of book production in a system of ideologies (i.e., taste), institutions, technologies,
                  and economics (176). As Blake remarks in the <em>Address</em>: <span class="quote">‘Englishmen rouze yourselves from the fatal Slumber into which Booksellers &amp; Trading
                     Dealers have thrown you Under the artfully propagated pretence that a Translation
                     of a Copy of any kind can be as honourable to a Nation as an Original . . . Be-lying

                     </div>’</span> As Eaves observes, the division of labor into a system whereby journeyman were no
                  more than hired hands employed by publishers to reproduce (and, in Blake’s opinion,
                  botch) designs originating elsewhere was reflected in class terms as the “separation
                  of ruling upper-class minds from working lower-class bodies” (172). William Hogarth
                  lived at that cusp when art was becoming increasingly commercialized, with print forms
                  being displayed as engravings in shop windows frequented by the bourgeoisie rather
                  than paintings restricted to the homes of the aristocracy. Hogarth himself took advantage
                  of this transition in the market to engrave his own works, but by the nineteenth century,
                  the publishing ecosystem had firmly divided the arts of invention and execution. G.
                  E. Bentley, Jr.’s recent exploration of Blake’s activities in the “desolate market”
                  demonstrates the various ways in which Blake sought to prosper (or merely survive)
                  in this fragmentary system that reduced him to the role of a journeyman, as teacher,
                  printer, shop owner, and publisher of works in conventional typography. However, it
                  was through his illuminated books that Blake most actively set himself up in opposition
                  to the interlocking framework of production that sought to bring consumers and publishers
                  together for the highest profit while relegating the engraver to the role of hired
                  hand. As Bentley observes, Blake originally sought to distribute his works conventionally
                  through retailers (most notably Joseph Johnson), writing in 1793 that “the Author
                  is sure of his reward” (as cited by Bentley, 103); by 1818, however, Blake printed
                  his works to order and made the melancholy observation that they were “unprofitable
                  enough to me tho Expensive to the Buyer” (as cited by Bentley, 104). Ultimately, Bentley
                  points out, the works in illuminated printing “provided only a small fraction of his
                  income” (104), and it was only the munificence of patrons such as John Linnell and
                  Thomas Butts, who saved Blake from penury in his later years, as his annual income
                  fell from a high point of some £203 per annum in the 1790s to a low of £68 in the
                  1810s.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Part of the reason for Blake’s commercial failure during his own lifetime, as well
               documented by Bentley, Eaves, Viscomi, and others, is that his technological innovation
               was not sufficient to overcome the economic transformations that took place during
               his lifetime, dividing the roles of book production and promotion into various streams.
               Such commercial failure, however, should not detract from the aesthetic triumphs of
               Blake’s endeavor, which, as Eaves observed, was to employ the technology of the book
               in what was ultimately a pedagogical service: to teach the English public (and also
               the English school of painters) the importance of original creation as opposed to
               imitation, a mission that identifies the divine with the human and as such aims at
               a total transformation of human psychology, religion, and society (Eaves 133-134).
               Blake, who most famously declared that he must create a system or be enslaved by another
               man’s, saw the role of art as far beyond the limits of print and the booksellers of
               his day (for which, as he laments in the <em>Public Address</em>, his contemporaries considered him mad). The publishing ecosystem of the late-eighteenth
               and early-nineteenth centuries had sacrificed what, for Blake, was its most important
               aspect—the illumination and transformation of both reader and author—for the sake
               of retail efficiencies and smoother production cycles. Stephen Behrendt (3-4) compares
               the experience of reading Blake to engaging with <em>Tristram Shandy</em> (1759-1767): our expectations of what to find in the text and our simple assumptions
               of what a text should be are overturned in a highly interactive process of reading.
               The reader is forced to take on a greater responsibility for formulating meaning,
               and as such he or she must reassess their own ideas of how such meaning can be created
               as part of a dialectic with Blake’s books and as part of the process of illumination.
               In <em>Pedagogy of Freedom</em> (2001), Paulo Freire rails against the reduction of education to “a question of training
               a student to be dexterous or competent” (22), arguing instead for the right for education
               to dream of utopia. Blake’s own practice, then, was not to instruct his readers into
               the narrow bounds of correct competence, a variant of what he would have seen as moral
               law via the brass books of Urizen, but rather to lead them to their own discovery
               of utopia via an eternal conversation: </p>

            <p> As technology, the printed book is subject to a whole nexus of production, distribution,
               and economic cycles that we easily recognize with other media formats but that have
               been all too eager to mystify when it comes to the printed word—almost certainly because
               of its early associations with the Word of Gutenberg’s first bestseller. Leaving aside
               the complex issue of Blake’s originals, which are largely inaccessible for the vast
               majority of instances of teaching, there is no longer a privileged position for <em>print</em> when studying his work. The printed book has long demonstrated itself fallible when
               connecting with an audience in the way that Blake so desperately desired. This is
               reflected in the transition in Blake studies in the two decades since Joseph Viscomi’s
               <em>Blake and the Idea of the Book </em>(1993): from discussing Blake’s <em>texts</em> to considering <em>copies</em> of his work. As such, in terms of using Blake in the classroom, we should not assume
               some hierarchy of being when handling Blakean artifacts: if anything, the production
               methods of commercial printing demand a complete disruption of Blakean unity of design
               and execution if the publisher has any hope of financial success. Blake studies have
               long been at the forefront of using digital technologies to disseminate an artist’s
               vision—the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.blakearchive.org"><em>Blake Archive</em></a> being one of the pre-eminent resources in the digital humanities, offering as it
               does the most complete corpus of Blake’s works that would be commercially ruinous
               on paper. Very few authors understood print in a way that Blake—a printmaker—did,
               and yet to read his variant copies in anything approaching the evolving formats in
               which they were published during his lifetime has proved impossible for generations
               of publishers to produce. As such, although Blake may be synonymous with print through
               his craft, if ever there was an author who demanded the reproducibility of digital
               media, it is Blake.</p>
            <p>There is nothing new in this assertion. The editors of the <em>Blake Archive</em> came to this very conclusion in the 1990s, enabling a new generation of Blake scholars
               to have some chance of understanding the corpus completely. What it does mean, however,
               is that we must examine more closely than ever the methods by which his works are
               distributed, and in many ways the advent of new platforms for reading and dissemination
               are an excellent opportunity for this. Although there are plenty of scholars who have
               returned attention to the economics and technology of the book, too often these have
               become invisible to us through familiarity: as such, the current disruption of the
               book publishing industry that we are experiencing provides an excellent opportunity
               to consider once more how we engage with Blake in the classroom. The fallibility of
               the publishing industry meant that for more than a century of reproduction following
               the appearance of Alexander Gilchrist’s biography of Blake in 1863, editors could
               not place before the vast majority of readers anything like Blake’s complete corpus
               of individual copies before the advent of the <em>Blake Archive</em>. Yet if I do not intend to praise print in and of itself, nor do I intend to bury
               it in the classroom. Two of my most treasured possessions remain a very battered copy
               of David Erdman’s <em>The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</em> (1965), annotations penciled across its yellowing leaves, and the hardback facsimiles
               of the illuminated books produced by the William Blake Trust and the Tate in the 1990s,
               both of which regularly make their way into my teaching sessions. The flaws in Erdman’s
               edition of Blake were commented upon widely following publication of the revised edition,
               most notably by the Santa Cruz Blake Study Group (1984), and yet as Andrew Welch observes,
               this remarkable, flawed text remains the academic standard when referring to Blake
               because facsimiles are frequently almost illegible and because it serves as a common
               reference point amidst the potential confusion of multiple copies (2010). Furthermore,
               when we abandon some analogue forms such as the printed book, we also lose a series
               of sensory inputs that digital technologies find it hard to replicate in their current
               forms, as Chris Harrison pointed out recently when comparing the “rich touch” interface
               of something like a guitar to the more limited screen of a smartphone or tablet (as
               cited by Leswing, 2014). This is more than mere nostalgia for the yellowing paper
               of my copy of Erdman: turning pages and scribbling annotations can be an important
               part of the physical act of studying that, as Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer argue
               (2014), is more effective for retaining information in memory.</p>
            <p>Mueller and Oppenheimer’s research deals more with note taking than actual reading,
               but it is important here as a warning to avoid the all-too-common rush in some quarters
               to assume that digital is automatically superior to print, against those such as Sven
               Birkerts, who lamented the loss of the printed book. Some uses are better served by
               print, while others (e.g., the ability to search through large amounts of data in
               ever more convenient devices; the ability to compare multiple copies of a particular
               work) are more easily done via digital devices. Yet the experience of relying on e-readers
               remains, when teaching Blake, a messy one, not least because the attempt to read (and
               teach) Blake in print remains chaotic. Attempts to create standard editions, which
               have their origins in attempts to recover authoritative biblical translations by scholars
               such as Johann Bengel and Johann Griesbach in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
               are complex enough when the primary sources are printed more conventionally. Occasionally,
               controversies can spill into the public domain, particularly when an editor uses unpublished
               manuscripts to produce copy-texts, scandalously so in the case of Walter Gabler’s
               new version of <em>Ulysses</em> (1922) in 1984. Gabler (and others) were responding to the well-understood fact that
               James Joyce’s novel had repeatedly been printed with numerous errors since 1922, but
               as Charles Rossman discovered, the final edition was as much about the conflicts of
               money, copyright law, and critical ideology as the pursuit of a pure ur-text (Brannon
               70-74). In the classroom, the ideal aspiration should always be to direct students
               towards an edition of an author’s works that presents the original text in a form
               that is also convenient to use: add in a technological innovation such as Blake’s
               use of illuminated printing, however, and that process becomes much more complicated.
               If scholars previously had difficulties deciding what the authoritative text of <em>Ulysses </em>should look like, imagine the manifold difficulties of a teacher who should really
               also decide what copy of one of Blake’s illuminated books should be presented to the
               classroom. The printed book was meant to be a solution to a problem, standardizing
               the delivery of text to multiple readers distributed widely across space and time.
               For his own radical purposes, Blake thumbed his nose at the conventions of publishing,
               refusing something as simple as a fixed, authoritative book from which teachers could
               transmit priestly knowledge. In <em>The Four Zoas</em> (comp. ca. 1796-1797), Blake describes Urizen as transcribing the world as a series
               of iron laws, suitably recorded in an enduring format: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">Writing in bitter tears &amp; groans in books of iron &amp; brass</div>
                  <div class="l">The enormous wonders of the Abysses once his brightest joy[.] (Erdman 347)</div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Urizen’s books are fixed, final records, and his brain is one of eternal print, a
               mockery of Blake’s own fluid and experimental approach to the technology of publishing.</p>
            <p>For Richard Nash, the tendency—and temptation—to defend publishing and the printed
               book via an exceptionalist stance is one that undermines the book because it sees
               it as a frail entity threatened by technology. By contrast, he argues, “[t]he book
               is not counter-technology, it is technology, it is the apotheosis of technology—just
               like the wheel or the chair” before concluding: <span class="quote">‘Book culture is in far less peril than many choose to assume, for the notion of an
                  imperiled book culture assumes that book culture is a beast far more refined, rarified,
                  and fragile than it actually is. (Nash 2013)’</span> The disruptive power of book culture has long been evident, and its ability to transform
               education is not something that was restricted to previous times: the book is not
               a bulwark <em>against</em> but an agent <em>of</em> change. Ted Striphas points out that the unsettled and unsettling effects of books
               are nothing new to the current age and that they are always “both in and out of sync
               with the present—whenever the present may be” (x). Nash’s call for book culture to
               lead the charge rather than man the barricades against the barbarians does not dismiss
               the traditions of book publishing that have their roots in the eighteenth century.
               Editors, for example, will clearly have a role to play in making writing better and
               producing books; but as curators of what should be placed in front of the public,
               Nash believes that their abilities to pick the right book is nonsense, a combination
               of money and luck. Rather, their real skills are relational, connecting authors with
               designers, publishers, markets, and, ultimately, audiences. While the marketplaces
               of Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and Apple may have lowered many of the barriers to entry,
               simply launching a title into the world and hoping it will connect (as Blake, bitterly,
               knew far too well) is far from a guarantee of success. Publishing, as Nash observes,
               is developing into areas such as bespoke bureau services, conferences and consultation,
               and educational activities such as the Faber Academy. In such a world, the brand and
               reputation of editors and publishers, rather than an intrinsic value of the content
               of “art,” remains as important as ever: “the business of literature is the business
               of making culture, not just the business of manufacturing bound books” (Nash).</p>
            <p>In many respects, this essay is broadly in agreement with Nash, especially with regard
               to literature as a business, which is probably in more robust shape than many undoubtedly
               suffering from the current disruption of print would care to admit. As Striphas observes,
               the book trade has been on the “brink” of collapse since the 1930s at least (45).
               Nonetheless, this suffering is real, and Nash’s underlying faith in the free market
               should be viewed skeptically. John B. Thompson’s <em>Merchants of Culture</em> (2012) offers an insight into some of the major trends affecting the current book
               trade, most notably the “winner takes more” model of publishing, which does not have
               its origin in the transition to digital but is instead an outcome of publishing conglomerations
               and mergers that began in the 1980s (189-191). It was the demands of the so-called
               “Big Six” in the publishing world, as well as large-scale retailers such as Borders
               and Barnes and Noble, that led to a deterioration of a mythical golden age of publishing—one
               where authors and editors could build upon profound relationships without the necessary
               imperative of turning a fast—and large—buck. Indeed, the fears of monopolization of
               book culture that Amazon is currently felt to represent—quite rightly in many cases—follow
               ironically from the many successes of Random House, Penguin, Hachette, Simon &amp; Schuster,
               HarperCollins, and Macmillan throughout the late-twentieth and early-twenty-first
               centuries. Nonetheless, Laura Miller is right to have called booksellers “reluctant
               capitalists,” although the scenario she described in the 1990s is increasingly looking
               like ancient history—one where acquisitions by companies such Barnes and Noble and
               HMV (which bought out Waterstones in 1998) established precedents for Amazon to become
               the largest retailer in the world.</p>
            <p>The example of HMV is an illustrative one: established as a retail outlet for the
               Gramophone Company in London in 1921, by the early-twenty-first century it had become
               a major retailer for DVDs, consumer electronics, video games, and magazines—as well
               as books. HMV was anything but a reluctant capitalist, seeing books as a valuable
               part of its entertainment business. However, with the rise of e-commerce it found
               itself unable to compete with online retailers and with Amazon in particular. When
               setting up Amazon, Jeff Bezos famously drew up a list of twenty potential products
               he might sell—including CDs and software as well as books—before settling on the latter
               as offering the widest selection of inventory with which no bricks and mortar store
               could compete (Brandt 53-65). From this point, the company would expand into new products
               to such an extent that it would eventually dwarf even giants such as Walmart and become
               what Brad Stone has called “the everything store” (2013). One of the significant factors
               in the rise of Amazon has been the complete transition from book retailers being reluctant
               capitalists to the darling of Wall Street, with Bezos bringing the frequently aggressive
               techniques of large-scale retail to an industry that has generally managed to maintain
               at least a veneer of genteel capitalism alongside ongoing commodification. More significantly,
               its investment in e-books has been the driving force in a much bigger transformation
               of the business of literature.</p>
            <p>The e-book was not invented by Amazon, but until the launch of the Kindle in 2007,
               it would be fair to say that it was a minority concern for publishers. In the late
               eighties and early nineties, companies such as Eastgate Systems, Digital Book, Inc.,
               and Sony were working on delivering books via formats such as floppy disk and CD-ROM,
               all of which were easily surpassed as media for distributing text by the growth of
               the web. As a way of initially transmitting text and then other multimedia content,
               the web quickly surpassed other formats, not least because of its public and open
               protocols and formatting language. Unlike early e-book formats, HTML and HTTP were
               non-proprietary, and the variety of devices upon which web texts could be displayed
               meant that services such as Project Gutenberg (which predated the web by some twenty
               years) could be more widely distributed than ever before. The emphasis at this point
               tended to be on <em>texts</em> rather than books. It is not especially surprising that, during the nineties, the
               theoretical emphasis of much writing about the web—for example George Landow and Paul
               Delany’s <em>Hypermedia and Literary Studies</em> (1994) or Landow’s <em>Hypertext 2.0</em> (1997)—concentrated more on texts than books, as much a condition of the response
               to the poststructuralism that dominated much critical theory at the time. Those writers
               who did focus on the book, such as Birkerts in <em>The Gutenberg Elegies</em> (2006), tended to lament its downfall, and so the stage seemed to be set for a contrast
               and conflict between books and technology.</p>
            <p>What this neglected, of course, was the fact that books are and have always been technology.
               Poststructural discussions of hypertext were not the only critical framework for how
               ways of reading could be considered even in the nineties, although works such as Roger
               Chartier’s <em>The Order of Books</em> (translated in 1994) and Leila Avrin’s <em>Scribes, Scripts and Books</em> (1991) seemed to operate within a non-overlapping magisterium when compared to the
               glamour exercised by the web. Yet even at this early stage there was a recognition
               by what theorists such as David Greetham (<em>Theories</em> 27-63) referred to as the ontology of texts, that the physical medium affected the
               relation between readers and what they read. As Chartier observed, readers “never
               confront abstract, idealized texts detached from any materiality” (50), and while
               the discussion of the ontology of hypertext was rarely discussed, Birkert’s insistence
               that the web would never replace books (a position substantially ceded in the preface
               to the second edition of his own book) semi-consciously echoed the difficulty caused
               by the material reality of reading on a screen when that screen was attached to a
               desktop computer or, at best, a laptop. The experience of absorbing an eighteenth-century
               triple-decker or an epic poem while scrolling through long screeds of text was a daunting
               one for even the most dedicated reader, and to pretend otherwise was to ignore the
               convenience and efficiency that the format of print offered, particularly as cheap,
               easily-transported paperbacks. The technology of the web, while more immediate in
               many ways than the technology of print, was much less amenable to certain types of
               reading than being able to open a book at any time and in any location without waiting
               for a cumbersome computer to boot up.</p>
            <p>As such, the single most important innovation in the development and acceptance of
               e-books has been the object which people use to read them. Such objects, of course,
               are more complex than the plastic, metal, and glass of which they are made. Innovations
               in terms of software (first of all Adobe’s PDF format, followed by others such as
               EPUB and mobipocket, a proprietary variant of which Amazon uses for its own e-books),
               display technologies such as e-ink and Retina displays, and battery life have all
               contributed to the possibilities of e-readers. In addition, the business of electronic
               literature also depends on a commercial environment, the digital or media ecosystems
               that will fund that innovation. It was David Clark, a computer scientist at MIT, who
               first coined the phrase the “post PC internet” in a talk delivered in 1999 to describe
               the future of computing as “inevitably heterogeneous” (as cited by Lohr, 1999), but
               the term was popularized by Steve Jobs in 2007 at the time of the launch of the iPhone.
               In an interview with Bill Gates at the fifth “All Things Digital” conference, he very
               clearly saw (in a way that Gates equally as clearly did not) that consumers were beginning
               to focus on the function of devices rather than the devices themselves (Gates and
               Jobs 2007). With the release of the Kindle in 2007 and the iPad in 2010, such objects
               could finally approach the status of books in the sphere of reading—one in which readers
               tend not to view them as the technological marvels they are but instead focus on the
               content that they deliver. Of course, we are still very far from that stage at present:
               tablets are still (just) too novel to be perceived as anything <em>but</em> technology. Yet as consumer devices—whether for web pages, apps, movies, games, or
               books—it is also clear that their ubiquity means that we are moving into a post-PC
               era that is as significant for our computer-using habits as the invention of the desktop
               PC itself in the seventies or the adoption of the web in the nineties.</p>
            <p>With that observation in mind, a cautionary note will be useful: Greetham has warned
               that the experience of editing electronic texts can be as much a totalitarian one
               as something which is phenomenologically fluid, observing that, contrary to the exhortations
               of what he calls “pomo romanticists and liberation technologists” (“Function of [Textual]
               Criticism” 40), the shift from orality to literacy was much more significant than
               that from print to electronic media. Furthermore, he suggests that it was the transition
               from roll to codex that effected a non-hierarchical, nonlinear understanding of textuality.
               Such an observation is also helpful in terms of what scholars such as Lars Sauerberg
               and Thomas Pettitt have called the “Gutenberg parenthesis”—the five hundred years
               or so of literate, print-based culture that is bracketed by the oral culture of the
               spoken word and the new oral culture of electronic and broadcast media. Pettitt’s
               provocative statement that the history of media has been “interrupted by print” and
               Sauerberg’s insistence that the new oral culture moves from “a metaphorics of linearity
               and reflection to a-linearity and co-production of ‘reality’” (79) are useful in drawing
               attention to certain cognitive factors introduced by different media objects, but
               the distinction is too neat: as any reader of Blake’s prophetic works will know, a-linearity
               can easily be a feature of print as well as oral cultures.</p>
            <p>The long history of print publishing after Blake’s death rarely served him well, particularly
               in the context of a rapidly expanding sphere of higher education in the second half
               of the twentieth century. It took a century for an authoritative collection of Blake’s
               poetry and prose to be published in Geoffrey Keynes’s Nonesuch edition of 1927, which
               separated text and image in the format that publishers could more easily distribute.
               The various Trianon Press facsimiles are beautiful objects in their own right, but
               they are too rare and expensive for everyday teaching, and prior to the appearance
               of the <em>Blake Archive</em>, that tended to mean a reliance on the much cheaper Oxford University Press paperbacks
               that were restricted to <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em> (1794) and <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> (1790). The <em>Blake Archive</em> transformed accessibility to the original illuminated books and yet raises its own
               frustrations when it comes actually to reading Blake in class, which is why I still
               often sit in the classroom with a Kindle as well as a computer projector displaying
               the <em>Blake Archive</em>. Recent improvements to the <em>Blake Archive</em> mean that it does display now on tablets such as the iPad (which was previously not
               the case because of a reliance on Java which, along with Flash, was not supported
               by iOS), but trying to read the frame-based version of Erdman remains a less-than-pleasurable
               experience on such devices. Having committed to the Kindle—more from the folly of
               being a passive consumer who enjoyed having a library of several hundred works on
               one light, plastic object—I can easily access Alicia Ostriker’s Penguin edition of
               Blake’s works. However, the Erdman edition is not currently available, and illustrated
               versions such as that by Lexicos Publishing are of poor quality. The situation is
               slightly better on iBooks, where an edition by e-Art now offers more or less readable
               facsimiles of plates but with an almost complete absence of professional editing that
               makes it dangerous to recommend to students. Faber and Touch Press demonstrated as
               far back as 2011 just what the iPad, in particular, was capable of when they released
               an extremely impressive version of T. S. Eliot’s <em>The Waste Land</em> (1922) as an app, combining audio readings, interviews, and filmed performances alongside
               a carefully prepared edition of the text. I have used the iOS app regularly for the
               past three years in one course that I teach, and it deserves much of the critical
               praise it has earned, drawing attention to the lamentable lack of anything comparable
               for studying Blake.</p>
            <p>Rather than conclude with a simple plea to publishers to create something similar
               for Blake’s works, however, this essay will return to the problem of ecosystems, as
               they are currently conceived by the Big Four technology companies. Rather than being
               a flat system that would allow us to understand our connection to the mineral object
               of the book in our hands, the ecosystems of Amazon, Google, and Apple, in particular,
               are highly vertical systems designed to lock consumers into a particular product and
               operating system. It should never be forgotten that the technology of the printed
               book has its own barriers to access, not least of which are literacy and access to
               books, but at least most of us can borrow a copy from the local library (assuming
               it hasn’t been closed down, as is currently happening in many smaller locations in
               the UK). To read the Faber and Touch Press edition of <em>The Waste Land</em> requires an iPad. This represents the current commercial landscape whereby Amazon,
               Google, and Apple in particular attempt to monopolize a wide range of activities and
               data—which include the classroom. This is not a nostalgic glance backwards to a golden
               age of publishing: as is clear from the introduction, my argument is concerned with
               the business of literature that also exercised Blake during his lifetime. However,
               the mechanisms of distribution and production that emerged over three centuries—while
               flawed in many ways (there is, after all, a reason why the phrase “rare books” flows
               so easily from the tongue)—did not hardwire technological restrictions into reading
               in a way that Google Play, Apple iTunes, and the Amazon store so frequently do. While
               I have argued that the printed book does not automatically deserve a privileged position
               because of its ontological status over digital formats, economically it worries me
               that we are witnessing a possible balkanization of cultural formats into different
               platforms, for example in the recent spat between Amazon and Hachette. Suzanne Tamang
               and Gregory Donovan cite Evgeny Morozov’s phrase “openwashing” to refer to reading
               “openness into situations and environments where it doesn’t exist” (2014), but a more
               immediate threat of “openwashing” could be the removal of relatively open systems
               with monopolistic platforms. One of the great virtues of the use of the book in class
               has been the sheer convenience of referring to the set text; to use a well-worn cliché,
               it can be very much simpler (at least to teach) when we are all reading from the same
               page. If we cannot be sure that everyone can access the text we want to use and if
               readers are excluded from discovering new vistas from being locked out of print, our
               task as educators will become that much harder. Book culture—and its role in the classroom—is
               far from fragile once we recognize just how varied its forms are. What it should never
               become, however, is a privilege for the few, rolling back the gains that relatively
               true openness in digital communications have established over the past two decades
               in the pursuit of short-term profit.</p>
