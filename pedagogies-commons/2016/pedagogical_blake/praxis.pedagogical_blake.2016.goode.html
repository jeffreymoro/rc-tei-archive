            <p class="noCount">This article outlines and models a simple web-browsing assignment and related research
               project designed to help students reflect critically on the propensity for William
               Blake’s illuminated books to break apart and circulate in pieces. The web-browsing
               assignment asks students to track how the present uses of a single Blake proverb call
               forth its potentials to mean different things, while the research project has them
               historicize some of those potentials. Together, the two assignments are designed to
               prompt classroom discussion of the ways that the semantic and situational instability
               of Blake’s proverbs might matter for thinking about the formal properties of the illuminated
               books as a medium, the culture that generated this medium, the cultures that continue
               to converge with it, and the complexity of the artistic project bound up with it.</p>

                  “concubinage,” the history of “hosiery,” and the results of the BBC’s 2002 poll of
                  “the 100 Greatest Britons” (where Blake ranks 38<sup>th</sup>, two places ahead of Henry VIII and just five behind David Beckham).

                           presently grant different degrees of editorial control to different users to produce
                           hyperlinks across encyclopedia entries, thus in effect limiting the number of possible,
                           mechanized, pathways through the site. At the same time, Wikipedia’s external openness
                           as a system (theoretically, there are no limits on the number of new entries that
                           can be added to it) and the sheer abundance of defined intra-site hyperlinks bring
                           it closer…</span></div>
                  </div> Should you opt to bypass Wikipedia, you might instead enter the celebrated <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/"><em>William Blake Archive</em></a>, where the illuminated books are displayed in their composite form. The archive offers
                  a rare oasis, however, before the vast desert of the World Wide Web, where de-composition
                  of literary corpuses is a regular feature of the media ecology. The next hundred results
                  for “William Blake” consist almost entirely of study guides, hack biographies, poetry
                  sites, galleries, and compendia of quotations that, with rare exceptions, strip Blake’s
                  poems of their visual character, extract his pictures from their poetic contexts,
                  or privilege those pictures that have never had a poetic context. Indeed, the pieces
                  of the illuminated books that these sites reproduce usually amount to fragments in
                  their own right in relation to their original verbal or visual contexts. In general,
                  the vast Blake archive searchable through Google is comprised of atomic artistic particles
                  much smaller than the unit of the book, poem, plate, or picture—that is, single lines
                  of text or stanzas excerpted from longer poems, details isolated from page-sized plates,
                  or images cropped from larger pictures.</p>

               <p>Given that the Internet tends to atomize almost everything, even as it also helps
                  to create niches and foster communities, Blake’s fragmentation on the web hardly can
                  come as a surprise. Whether this fragmentation is cause for sadness, interest, or
                  excitement, however, may depend on who is doing the browsing. It presumably has not
                  been a welcome development for those who remain committed to the cult of the artist
                  as Romantic genius, those who privilege the claims of “original” historical contexts
                  to determine texts’ meanings, or those who hold the view that only through understanding
                  the compositeness of Blake’s composite art can we grasp its fullest complexity and
                  most significant meanings.

                           been growing since the publication of Mitchell’s Blake’s Composite Art in 1978, and,
                           before that, of Jean Hagstrum’s William Blake, Poet and Painter (1964). But it was
                           catalyzed in the mid-1990s by Joseph Viscomi’s Blake and the Idea of the Book (1993).
                           Although Viscomi’s analytical conclusions were not without their critics, his attention
                           to the materiality of Blake’s illuminated books made it newly imperative for scholars,
                           especially historicists, to ground their critical analyses in the books’ material

                  </div> For others, however, Blake’s circulation in bits and pieces represents an opportunity
                  both to develop new scholarly methods and also to challenge earlier accounts of the
                  significance of Blake’s art. This has been especially true for a new generation of
                  reception scholars and digital humanities scholars committed to studying texts as
                  media, and to analyzing textual reception less with an eye towards isolating historically
                  discrete reading formations and vectors of individual influence than with an eye towards
                  mapping how certain texts <em>behave</em> and <em>could behave</em>—even in fragmented form—as media across populations and systems.

                           to Blake 2.0: William Blake in Twentieth-Century Art, Music and Culture (2010); Roger

                  </div> For a number of these scholars, the reliance of earlier criticism on conceptual categories
                  like “author,” “text,” and “reader,” can look like idealist abstractions, especially
                  when applied to Blake’s new medium. Thinking in these terms does not mean that such
                  scholars embrace the politics or interpretive prowess of every appearance that Blake
                  makes in any cultural context. What it does mean is that they take seriously every
                  behavior of Blake’s medium in different contexts, approaching any behavior not as
                  an interpretation that merely reflects an interpreter’s historical situation, but
                  as a potential, and possibly unwitting, realization of a Blake that, as Gilles Deleuze
                  might say, had existed only virtually before.

                           Blake, Deleuzian Aesthetics, and the Digital (2012) also makes a case for conceptualizing
                           Blake’s aesthetic project in terms that lend further theoretical justification to
                           many of the approaches pursued by the scholars cited in note 5.</span></div>

            <p>Regardless of how one feels about the atomization of Blake’s illuminated books in
               contemporary culture, however, their atomization, or more generously, their ongoing
               vitality and vibrancy in pieces, also presents tremendous pedagogical opportunities.
               Bringing awareness of Blake’s contemporary fragmentation and circulation into the
               classroom carries the potential to give students fresh insights into the formal properties
               of the illuminated books as a medium, into the culture that generated this medium,
               into the cultures that continue to converge with it, and into the complexity of the
               artistic project bound up with it. This essay outlines and models a web-browsing assignment
               and related research project designed to advance all of these ends and which begins
               by having students perform Google searches to record instances of the appearance of
               a single fragment, or identifiable discrete particle, of Blake’s corpus around the
               web. The assignment requires students to track how the present uses of their chosen
               Blake fragment call forth its potentials to mean different things, with an eye towards
               inspiring them to investigate (in the follow-up research project) how long, or in
               what other situations, certain meaningful potentials might have been there. Which
               have been there all along? Are there any that were once there which are no longer
               available or have gone dormant? As students make visible some part of the illuminated
               books’ fragmentation and circulation, they ideally will become more aware of networks
               and resonances, disconnections and dissonances, within and across times and places.
               This will both heighten their awareness of culture’s and history’s complexity and
               encourage them to think about what it means that the illuminated books—or, rather,
               the movement and mutability of the books’ pieces—enabled this heightened awareness.
               </p>
            <p>The overall assignment could conceivably be based on any number of different kinds
               of textual particles. Indeed, the ability since 2011 to do a <a class="link_ref" href="http://images.google.com/imghp?hl=en">Google image search</a> using JPEGs instead of words as one’s search terms has opened up exciting possibilities
               for tracking the spread of specific digitized copies of Blake’s pictures, including
               the spread of visual details that are smaller than the more macro-units of the plate
               or print. The version I present here, however, focuses on the verbal textual unit
               of the proverb due to the prevalence on university syllabi of the “Proverbs of Hell”
               section of Blake’s <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> as well as to the ease of searching electronically for a proverb’s citation (a proverb
               is a discrete piece of text that tends to circulate syntactically whole and lexically
               unaltered). Aside from its practical advantages, however, focusing on proverbs also
               gives students the opportunity to think critically about the proverb form and its
               apparent privileging within William Blake’s verbal-visual medium, a line of inquiry
               that, for reasons that will become apparent in due course, I take to be especially
               provocative for thinking about that medium’s artistic, philosophical, and political
               significance.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Specifically, the web-browsing assignment (“Searching for Blake’s Hellish Wisdom”),
                  as I have written it, asks students to begin tracking how, as a single Blake proverb
                  circulates today, its regulatory counsel becomes multiple and heterogeneous. The assignment
                  is thus aligned with the media-oriented pedagogy of an earlier generation of poststructuralist
                  scholars like Paul Delany and George Landow, who saw in emergent hypermedia a workshop
                  for testing, among other things, the insights of deconstruction.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> At the same time, the assignment owes much, too, to the recent efforts of formalist
                  literary scholars like Caroline Levine, who have sought to reinvigorate and radically
                  expand the project of doing historicized formalism by employing design theory’s idea
                  of “affordances,” or “the potential uses or actions latent in materials and designs,”
                  to study forms of all kinds, including conceptual forms and the forms of their collisions
                  and intersections.

                  </div> By having each student work outside of the classroom to identify how, why, and where
                  a specific proverb’s regulatory counsel becomes multiple and heterogeneous, the web-browsing
                  assignment ensures that each student will have a unique evidentiary archive when she
                  returns to the classroom from whence to reflect on what proverbs are and what the
                  form affords, whether or not the instabilities of Blake’s proverbs make them special
                  instances of the form, what insights the atomization of the “Proverbs of Hell” might
                  give us into the formal qualities of the illuminated books more generally, and why
                  someone with Blake’s political, theological, and philosophical views might have been
                  attracted to the proverb form.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Finally, the web-browsing assignment also takes up the challenge of media scholars
                  like Gregory Ulmer and Marcel O’Gorman to invent forms of digital pedagogy that, at
                  the same time that they make our students more technologically and informationally
                  literate, also help them to reflect on the sweeping epistemological and ontological
                  changes that result from the proliferation of new electronic and computing media.

                  </div> In my own classroom experience, as the web-browsing assignment has prompted my media-saturated
                  students to consider Blake’s proverbs as forms of viral media or, alternatively, as
                  engines seeking end-users, it has encouraged them to think about the extent to which
                  Blake’s medium might be elucidated by thinking about what viral media and search engines
                  do (and potentially could do). It also has generated productive discussion of what
                  tracking viral proliferation using a non-neutral search engine like Google can and
                  cannot teach us, and has even led to probing insights into what affordances and limitations
                  the idea of “the viral” itself might have as a conceptual form for understanding how
                  media interface with the cultures of which they are also a part. Such discussions
                  go a long way towards helping fulfill O’Gorman’s pedagogical mission to create “discursive
                  practices that are suitable to a culture that has embraced electronic technology and
                  has internalized the primary tenets of postmodern theory, but has done so by way of
                  popular culture and computing techniques.”

            <p>While the web-browsing assignment can be completed effectively by almost any level
               of student, the follow-up assignment (“Re-searching for Blake’s Hellish Wisdom”) is
               geared more towards advanced students, especially those who already have some experience
               doing more traditional forms of academic research. The assignment takes off from the
               premise that the instabilities of a given Blake proverb’s counsel in one time and
               place challenge us to figure out if the potential for these instabilities might have
               been present in other times and places. It offers students a choice of specific, focused
               research prompts, each of which asks them to generate a brief written report that
               highlights some aspect of their chosen proverb’s potential interpretive instability
               in Blake’s own day. Sharing these reports, especially in the context of a graduate
               seminar, becomes a way for students to develop insight into Blake’s project in <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> and perhaps his illuminated books more generally. It also gives them valuable experience
               in how bringing the study of reception and production contexts together can sometimes
               work to open up productive new research directions for each.</p>

                  <p>Proverbs are “words of wisdom” that get repeated in exactly the same form in many
                     different contexts. For this assignment, you will choose <em>one</em> of Blake’s “Proverbs of Hell” from <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> and use Google searches to track down recent citations of the proverb in order to
                     catalog what wisdom people try to make it dispense when they invoke it in different
                     contexts. What wise counsel is seemingly being given in different situations when,
                     for example, someone today states, “The cut worm forgives the plow” (Erdman 35), regardless
                     of whether or not they attribute the line to Blake?

               <p>To present your research, compile a table that includes: (A.) the URL where the use
                  of the proverb occurs; (B.) a brief description of the immediate context for the use;
                  (C.) a summation of what you take the proverb to signify when used in this context
                  (or a direct quote indicating what it signifies, if the author includes this kind
                  of explicit explication). Your table must have a minimum of twenty rows or entries
                  (i.e., twenty citations of the proverb). These twenty entries should reflect <em>a minimum of five different interpretations of the proverb</em> (i.e., not a minimum of five different online contexts where the proverb gets cited
                  to convey essentially the same wisdom but, rather, a minimum of five different online
                  contexts where the nature of the wisdom itself is different).</p>
               <p>NOTE: When you Google your chosen proverb, you should put quotation marks around it
                  so as to weed out partial hits. Your initial search results may be heavily populated
                  by lists of all of the “Proverbs of Hell,” or by e-texts of <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>, and so you may have to dig in order to find instances where your chosen proverb
                  is actually being cited as wisdom or counsel. One way to adjust your search to yield
                  more of the desired kinds of results is to repeat it with the additional term “-Marriage”
                  or “-Blake” (without quotes) in the search field. This will yield only hits that do
                  not identify the proverb’s textual or authorial source and thus a higher percentage
                  of hits where the proverb is actually being cited as something like conventional wisdom.</p>

               <p>Compiling the table (and especially column C) forces students to be attentive to subtle
                  variations in how their chosen proverb gets invoked. It also has the effect of discouraging
                  them from thinking that their proverb has a “right” or “best” meaning, encouraging
                  them instead to think more in terms of the many things the proverb can <em>do</em>. For the purposes of sparking class discussion, however, the table is more a means
                  to the end of having each student identify the specific grounds or causes for the
                  variations she has observed in her chosen proverb’s meaning as it gets invoked in
                  different contexts. You might even require students to append a list of these causes
                  (as I have done at the end of the sample complete table).</p>
               <p>After students compile a list of how and why some of the interpretive variations (in
                  column C) happened, they will be able to contribute real-world examples to a class
                  discussion about the factors <em>in general</em> that produce instabilities in the wisdom of Blake proverbs. When students share these
                  examples, they are bound to notice that variations in the use of Blake’s proverbs
                  tend to be a function of various combinations of the following factors: </p>
               <ol>
                  <li class="item" id="d1913e439"><em>Multiple or ambiguous literal meanings of words or phrases</em>: (e.g., in the case of “The cut worm forgives the plow,” the evidence of the sample
                     table demonstrates that some people today take “cut worm” to mean “dead worm,” whereas
                     others take it to mean “harmed worm,” whereas still others take it to mean “two worms
                     whose missing halves will regenerate”; “forgives” also signifies different things
                     to different people, including “accepts as true,” “refuses to be vengeful,” “accepts
                     as beneficial to the greater good,” and “accepts as beneficial to oneself”).</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d1913e442"><em>Syntactical or grammatical ambiguities in the proverb</em>: (e.g., though the evidence of the sample table suggests this is not presently a
                     common reading, “the cut worm forgives the plow” need not refer to a worm offering
                     retrospective forgiveness for having been cut but could, rather, refer to an already
                     harmed worm proactively forgiving the plow headed towards it to finish it off).</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d1913e445"><em>An unlimited range of situations in which the proverb could be invoked meaningfully,
                        especially because there are an unlimited range of possible figurative applications
                        for the proverb’s words or images</em>: (e.g., the evidence of the sample table shows that while “worm” can signify an actual
                     worm, people tend to invoke it as a metaphor for many different kinds of vulnerable
                     entities, including a human being, a soldier, an employee, a war-torn people, a wild
                     animal, and even a rule of grammar; likewise, “plow” gets invoked as a metaphor for
                     a wide range of things, including a challenge to an individual’s sense of self, anything
                     that causes individual suffering, the activity of subsistence living, the work of
                     cultural or national cultivation, a force heedless to anything other than itself,
                     the course of history, the course of nature, and workplace cutbacks).</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d1913e448"><em>Multiple possible affective responses to the proverb’s wisdom</em>, especially because there are <em>multiple possible subjective identifications one could have with the proverb’s figures</em>: (e.g., as the evidence of the sample table makes evident, the wisdom of “the cut
                     worm forgives the plow” can be invoked in the spirit of tragedy, comedy, or irony,
                     depending on the situation and speaker. Some cite it to admire the worm’s powers of
                     forgiveness, whereas others cite it to critique the worm’s ignorance or helplessness;
                     some quote it to highlight the worm’s selflessness, whereas others view the worm as
                     self-preserving; some invoke the line as a justification to plow, whereas others invoke
                     it as a critique of plowing or a warning about plowing; etc.).</li>
               </ol>
               <p> Having discussed how and why Blake’s proverbs behave as they do in contemporary culture,
                  students will be in a better position to think about the nature of proverbs as linguistic,
                  cultural, and political forms. Prior to this assignment, your students probably will
                  never have paid much mind to the practice of citing proverbs, though all of them are
                  familiar with it and familiar, too, with many proverbs. Tracking the multiplicity
                  and heterogeneity of the wisdom that Blake’s proverbs dispense in a variety of contemporary
                  contexts and situations has the virtue of defamiliarizing what amounts to a customary
                  practice just enough that students can reflect on it, and on the proverb form itself,
                  more critically. The goal is to help your students realize that Blake’s proverbs actually
                  exaggerate instabilities within the proverb form generally, so that they can have
                  a more intelligent discussion of the artistic, philosophical, theological, and political
                  implications of the form’s appearance in <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> or within Blake’s corpus more generally, depending on how much of it you have assigned.
                  The easiest route into such a discussion is to poll the class for examples of other
                  proverbs they know. Then, ask them <em>when</em> they might be inclined to use some of these proverbs (or when they have heard others
                  use them) and, more to the point, <em>why</em> they might be inclined to use them. What is the function of invoking a proverb (as
                  opposed to trying to say the same thing without doing so)? What makes a proverb a
                  proverb? To the extent that proverbs convey something like wisdom, where does this
                  wisdom come from and what is its status or authority in relation to other kinds of
                  knowledge?</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Folklorists who study proverbs do not agree on all points about the nature of the
                     form. They do tend to concur, however, that a proverb constitutes a form of repeated
                     wisdom that remains lexically stable across iterations and that tends to function
                     as conventional wisdom over time.

                     </div> Typically, this conventional wisdom simultaneously serves an epistemological and a
                     regulatory function insofar as it both names a situation and offers strategic counsel
                     in the face of it (though the counsel may not point out a particular course of action
                     so much as ask for acceptance of a general truth about the situation).

                     extension, its auditor’s—internal regulatory desires or regulatory sense.

                     A culture’s proverbs work hegemonically to inscribe customs of conduct, or simply
                     customary approaches to living. As such, proverbs tend to operate alongside, beneath
                     the purview of, and even at times in conflict with the culture’s (and the state’s)
                     actual codified regulations. Though in a few cultures proverbs have held legal authority
                     historically as something like common-law precedents for how to behave, their regulatory
                     power in Western contexts has almost always tended to be extralegal.

                  <p>As students discuss what proverbs are and do, they may not arrive at all of the above
                     points on their own. However, because they have approached the proverb form through
                     Blake, they likely will realize without much prompting that proverbs’ hegemonic regulatory
                     power is incredibly unstable in general and that Blake’s proverbs to some extent just
                     exploit or exaggerate the form’s customary instabilities. A quick in-class experiment
                     can help spark this realization. Have students write down what they take each of the
                     following three well-known English proverbs to mean, along with two situations in
                     which they could imagine someone invoking each: “a little knowledge is a dangerous
                     thing,” “a rolling stone gathers no moss,” and “out of sight, out of mind.” The results
                     will collectively demonstrate that many of the kinds of instabilities they observed
                     online with Blake’s proverbs can be true of proverbs more generally.

                              of proverbs’ interpretive instability across people and situations in “Toward a Theory
                              of Proverb Meaning.”</span></div>
                     </div> As they saw with Blake, proverbs often work by way of analogy (e.g., “a rolling stone
                     . . .”), and the potential for breakdowns in communication can be high as the proverb’s
                     sender and receiver try to trace this analogy to the situation at hand (e.g., is “a
                     rolling stone” an irresponsible stone, or is it one free of corrosive entanglements?).
                     The situation-specific meaning of proverbs also means that the same line’s regulatory
                     counsel can vary markedly across situations (e.g., depending on the context, “out
                     of sight, out of mind” can encourage acceptance of what feels like a tragic truth,
                     or it can function as an exhortation to engage in some opportunistic forgetting).

                     </div> Finally, some proverbs blatantly contradict one another (e.g., “out of sight, out
                     of mind” and “absence makes the heart grow fonder”) and others can be interpreted
                     as contradicting one another (e.g., “absence makes the heart grow fonder” and “a rolling
                     stone gathers no moss”). This makes proverbial regulation as a whole a far from systematic
                     or coherent enterprise. There is no constitution or system of precedents to which
                     one might refer to determine which proverb’s regulatory authority ought to have jurisdiction
                     in a given situation (or have the authority to establish precisely what kind of given
                     situation or case is even at hand).</p>

               <p>Discussing the politics of sharing proverbial wisdom gives students an excellent foundation
                  for sharing their own wisdom about the “Proverbs of Hell” as a project, including
                  how it relates to the rest of <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> or to whatever other Blake texts you may have assigned. Some students will want to
                  call attention to the obvious subversive political implications of particular proverbs
                  (e.g., “Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion” [Erdman
                  36]) and relate these to other moments where Blake makes similar political commentaries.
                  Others may note the Zen riddle-like quality of particular proverbs (e.g., “Eternity
                  is in love with the productions of time” [Erdman 36]) and connect it to Blake’s various
                  calls on individuals to stretch their sensory capacities, imaginations, and powers
                  of perception. But the advantage of having had the class think about the proverb form
                  as a whole, including both the effects of individual proverbs as they circulate and
                  the tendency of Blake’s own proverbs to fragment his corpus (i.e., their propensity
                  to make pieces of larger works circulate on their own), is that it gives them many
                  more challenging angles from whence to approach the issue of the illuminated books’
                  artistic, philosophical, and political project. Grounding the wisdom of individual
                  proverbs in positions expressed elsewhere in the illuminated books is all well and
                  good, but it does run counter to proverbs’ demonstrated propensity to break free from
                  their textual context and to their tendency to spread multiple and sometimes incompatible
                  kinds of wisdom. Are we missing the forest for the trees if we focus on individual
                  proverbs rather than the whole population of them? That is, if we focus on their individual
                  “meanings” rather than on what they are capable of doing to the world as more people
                  find them meaningful?</p>
               <p>Questions you might ask students to provoke their thinking along these lines include:
                  what might the attraction of a hegemonic regulatory form that is extralegal, heterogeneous,
                  and non-systematic be in the context of the other political and philosophical views,
                  beliefs, and positions put forth in <em>The Marriage</em> or in the illuminated books more generally? Are there things that make the proverbs—either
                  singly or collectively—seem incongruous or incompatible with other parts of <em>The Marriage </em>or of the illuminated books generally? Does it make sense to think about the “Proverbs
                  of Hell” as fulfilling some part of the promise that <em>The Marriage</em> makes elsewhere that it will contribute to an “improvement of sensual enjoyment”
                  (Erdman 39) or as fulfilling some part of its promise that the printing techniques
                  whereby it was created constitute a process of burning away blockages that conceal
                  “the infinite” (Erdman 39)? Is there a way to see any single “Proverb of Hell” as
                  improving sensory enjoyment or revealing infinitude? What about the entire collection
                  of proverbs as a whole? What about the act of relief etching? Finally, is the improvement
                  and revelation that <em>The Marriage</em> promises—or, for that matter, the kind of “progression” that <em>The Marriage</em> says requires “Contraries” (Erdman 34)—something that happens to the individual reader,
                  to an audience of readers, or, through this audience as medium, to a population or
                  culture not entirely cognizant that it is happening? What evidence in <em>The Marriage</em>, or elsewhere in Blake’s corpus, complicates our ability to answer this last question?
                  What insight with respect to this question might be offered by the fact that certain
                  Blake proverbs have been released from their original textual contexts and now circulate
                  widely across a massive English-speaking global population? What insight might be
                  offered by the activity of tracking and studying their circulation through a search
                  engine like Google?</p>
               <p>In my own classroom experience, the final question in this series has encouraged students
                  to make an important cognitive leap that might prove provocative, too, even for seasoned
                  Blake scholars. To the extent that the “Searching” assignment prompts students to
                  study individual Blake proverbs as viral media, it encourages them to conceive of
                  the “Proverbs of Hell,” and perhaps the illuminated books in general, not as discrete
                  art objects or a discrete corpus but as a kind of engine networked into a population
                  of users and, through those users, the world. As several decades of Blake scholarship
                  have demonstrated, the internal complexity of and historical context for this engine
                  can repay intensive study, as can its power to rewire the perceptions, thinking, and
                  politics of the individual users who converge with it. But we also need to think about
                  the engine as something that, through its heterogeneous convergences with a large
                  population of users over time, all of them socially and culturally networked in their
                  own ways, manages to make certain pieces of itself go viral through still larger populations.
                  To the extent that these viral fragments circulate not just across media networks
                  and platforms but also through the difference-producing medium of individual users’
                  and populations’ disparate regulatory desires for themselves, the fragments have the
                  effect of complicating and rendering more heterogeneous the world that they also connect
                  and rewire in new ways. A differential engine, indeed. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>At the same time, as we develop better tools—both theoretical and technological—for
                     studying Blake fragments in their complexifying work, we can also begin to look at
                     them as agents for revealing the infinitude of this complex, connected world in ways
                     that they make uniquely possible. When I had my graduate students do the “Searching”
                     assignment recently, the resulting classroom discussion yielded the insight that it
                     may not be exactly apt to conceive of this process of revelation by way of analogy
                     to a computer virus or “worm,” which, through its passage from computer to computer,
                     renders traceable the complexity and interconnectedness of global computing networks.

                     </div> After all, Blake’s proverbs move through culture more rhizomatically than can be mapped
                     through the woven or branching image of interlaced networks. More to the point, in
                     contrast to viruses or worms following programmers’ source codes, they also prove
                     capable of infecting according to new rules. Still, I was able to suggest to students
                     that the analogy becomes more apt if we merge the idea of the digital worm with that
                     of the more earthly, cultivation-friendly variety, the kind that folk wisdom and some
                     scientists tell us can be made more powerful when cut, because cutting does not harm
                     it so much as create new worms with minds of their own. We could do worse as Blake
                     scholars than to encourage our students to approach his proverbs as special kinds
                     of digital worms that respond to and activate a potentially unlimited number of regulatory
                     codes each time a user makes contact with them, recites them, resituates them, retweets
                     them, or even just remembers them. Encouraging such an approach would be one step
                     closer to realizing O’Gorman’s compelling—and self-professedly Blakean—call to develop
                     pedagogies that use new media not “for archival purposes” but “as a means of rousing
                     ourselves from the ‘Single vision &amp; Newton’s sleep’ [Erdman 722] in which print technology

                              interactions in Blake. It involves blanking out the text of Blake’s “Nurse’s Song,”
                              having them write lines to go with Blake’s accompanying images for the poem, and then,

               <p>That said, one of the potential pitfalls of this kind of discussion is that the participants
                  in it must always be on their guard against the tendency to assert a clear demarcation
                  between the world of the internet and “reality,” as such a distinction (implicitly
                  present in concepts like “cyberspace” and even “virtual reality”) reduces the extent
                  to which the web is a part of reality and reality to some extent “realizes” (and forecloses)
                  some of its own virtuality through the web. In discussing this issue with my graduate
                  students who completed the web-browsing assignment, we arrived at the idea that it
                  might be more accurate to describe the web as an ever-shifting, expanding, and interpenetrating
                  archive of a substantial set of the ways and means whereby reality, at present, publishes
                  its efforts and its tools to connect with itself, know itself, sell itself to itself,
                  and even <em>become</em> itself (or, rather, to realize its previous virtuality). We also discussed the importance
                  of never confusing the results of a Google search with some kind of objectively arrived
                  at map of this archive (or of reality), insofar as Google’s search engine not only
                  doesn’t return results from certain parts of the web (and which parts will differ
                  according to the nation in which the user’s IP address is registered) but also relies
                  upon a proprietary algorithm that privileges corporate websites over popular sites
                  and that can vary based on a user’s previous searches. The thing actually being mapped
                  by any given set of Google search results is the present state of Google’s dynamic
                  algorithm itself as applied to the dynamic object of the web by a particular user
                  and machine. Nevertheless, though engines like Google’s might be hopelessly compromised
                  tools if one’s scholarly project were to try to use internet search engines to map
                  the reality of which they are a part, or even simply to map that reality’s online
                  archive and interfaces, what they can do—and do quite well—is give students and scholars
                  alike a vehicle through which to begin to recognize the virtuality and affordances
                  of certain identifiable cultural forms that have become resonant. Though a Google
                  search cannot map this resonance in its totality, or map the degrees to which certain
                  virtualities of given forms are being realized, it can provide sufficient evidence
                  that some virtualities are being realized and perhaps make us aware of others that
                  previously we did not know existed—new messages that different media are becoming.</p>

                     that it does little to historicize the proverb form, especially Blake’s use of it.
                     This can be addressed to some extent by assigning secondary readings that situate

                     also point interested students to other primary texts from the period that Blake’s
                     proverbs can be studied profitably alongside, such as Johann Kaspar Lavater’s <em>Aphorisms on Man</em> (1788), which fueled Blake’s interest in the proverb form.

                     the general insights that the “Searching” assignment delivers, they will not necessarily
                     counteract the tendency of some students to assume that certain instabilities currently
                     made manifest in the application of individual Blake proverbs were possible all along
                     or, alternatively, that the wide range of contemporary online invocations of a single
                     proverb sufficiently captures the full extent of its possibilities in other times

                     of thinking by having them complete the “Re-searching for Blake’s Hellish Wisdom”
                     assignment described below.</p>
               </div>
               <p>This assignment is designed to heighten students’ awareness that every conceivable
                  interpretation or application of their chosen Blake proverb has historical conditions
                  of possibility—that a proverb (and language in general) does not just contain a treasure
                  trove of meanings always there waiting to be activated. The assignment consists of
                  three separate prompts, from which students must select two, charging them to research
                  the historical and interpretive conditions that were in place in Blake’s day for their
                  chosen proverb to become meaningful in particular ways. Admittedly, by refocusing
                  students’ attention on their chosen proverb’s “original” historical and textual contexts,
                  the assignment may seem to run counter to the idea that only by studying what the
                  entire population of Blake’s proverbs does apart from its “original” context can we
                  grasp the full complexity of its significance. But the advantage of doing the “Re-searching”
                  assignment after the “Searching” one is that you can help students recognize that
                  the “Re-searching” assignment need not conflict with this idea. The assignment does
                  not encourage them to privilege “original” historical and textual contexts as placing
                  limits on what their chosen proverb <em>meant once and for all </em>but, rather, challenges them to find evidence of the interpretive instabilities and
                  historical conditions that opened up what it <em>could have done at first</em>. The “Re-searching” assignment also carries the added pedagogical benefits of developing
                  students’ research and close-reading skills, as well as adding to their knowledge
                  of the specificity of Blake’s historical context. To share this knowledge, as well
                  as to reinforce the general lesson that interpretations always have historical conditions
                  of possibility, you might have students share their research reports with each other
                  via a course discussion board, blog, or website.</p>

                  <p>In doing the “Searching for Blake’s Hellish Wisdom” assignment, one thing that I found
                     that causes divergent interpretations today of the proverb “The cut worm forgives
                     the plow” (Erdman 35) is that people sometimes interpret “cut worm” to signify that
                     the worm is dead or irreparably maimed whereas others seem to think that the two halves
                     of a cut worm can regenerate into two new worms. Therefore, I decided to research
                     the state of knowledge in Blake’s era concerning the ability of worms to regenerate.
                     I discovered that worms cut in two might have been less irreparably harmed in the
                     minds of Blake’s contemporaries than for modern readers, though there was no clear
                     consensus on the issue. Worms were a subject of particular interest for eighteenth-century
                     natural philosophers. At the start of the century, worms were at the center of debates
                     over the issue of how species originated, as they were often the main example adduced
                     in favor of the erroneous doctrine of spontaneous generation, which held that some
                     complex creatures are eggless and originate spontaneously out of non-living matter.
                     Though belief in worms’ ability to generate spontaneously quickly waned as the century
                     progressed, new interest focused on their supposed ability to <em>re</em>generate (Roger 256-257, 317).

                     </div> Charles Bonnet, a Genevan philosopher, conducted some influential experiments in the
                     early-eighteenth century wherein he cut some small freshwater worms into various sections
                     and observed that the sections regrew. As the Victorian naturalist George Johnston
                     described it, “The halves became whole worms,—the thirds and quarters also,—and the
                     morsels grew to be complete individuals, not to be distinguishable from the original
                     stock” (318-319). With more terrestrial worms, Bonnet found the regeneration to be
                     slower and more erratic, with more casualties amongst the morsels (Johnston 319).
                     Still, the idea took hold that worms, including earthworms, can regenerate their missing
                     halves when cut. Although some mid-eighteenth-century European scientists, including
                     Carl Linnaeus, expressed skepticism on this point, others, such as René Antoine Ferchault
                     de Réaumur, claimed to have some success regenerating two complete earthworms from
                     cut worms (Johnston 319-320). It seems safe to say that, in the imagination of many
                     in Blake’s day, worms cut by plows were not so much dead or maimed as multiplied.
                     The year after Blake’s death, another prominent scientist—this time, the French zoologist
                     Marie Jules César Lelorgne de Savigny—claimed success in regenerating multiple worms
                     from certain species of earthworms. By 1843, the idea that earthworms could regenerate
                     in this way was widely enough accepted in Britain that it was advanced in anatomy
                     lectures in London by the prominent naturalist Sir Richard Owen (Johnston 321).</p>

                     Report on your findings.):</em></p>
               <p>According to evidence in the <em>OED</em>, “worm” had a more expansive literal connotation in Blake’s day, signifying nearly
                  any creature that crawls along the ground, including snakes [1667 John Milton, <em>Paradise Lost</em> (7.476): “At once came forth whatever creeps the ground, Insect or Worme”; 1820 Percy
                  Bysshe Shelley, <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> (4.1.151): “Ye beasts and birds, Ye worms, and fish.”]. It could also signify “The
                  larva of an insect; a maggot, grub, or caterpillar, esp. one that feeds on and destroys
                  flesh, fruit, leaves, cereals, textile fabrics, and the like,” and, collectively,
                  “The worm” could also signify “a destructive pest” (<em>Oxford English Dictionary Online</em>, s.v. “worm”). According to my findings in the “Searching for Blake’s Hellish Wisdom”
                  assignment, people today who invoke “The cut worm forgives the plow” (Erdman 35) do
                  not tend to regard the worm as a pestilential or potentially destructive creature.
                  Indeed, almost all imply that the worm is a victim or heroic survivor and not a force
                  that could, say, become more powerful (and potentially more violent and destructive)
                  than the plow or plow-operator. But had the proverb gained currency in Blake’s day,
                  many might have heard in it a warning that attempts to stamp out certain ills only
                  multiply those very ills, or, more in line with Blake’s political radicalism, that
                  the act of harming and killing society’s lowest and most oppressed, as if they were
                  worms, only strengthens the cause of resistance or even rebellion. Such an interpretation
                  seems entirely possible given the currency in Blake’s day, according to the <em>OED</em>, of “worm” as a term to signify “A human being likened to a worm or reptile as an
                  object of contempt, scorn, or pity; an abject, miserable creature” (<em>Oxford English Dictionary Online</em>, s.v. “worm”). It is this signification that underlies the Romantic-era proverb “tread
                  on a worm and it will turn” or “even a worm will turn,” which the <em>OED</em> translates as “even the humblest will resent extreme ill-treatment” [e.g., 1818 Shelley,
                  <em>Julian &amp; Maddalo</em> (413): “Even the instinctive worm on which we tread / Turns, though it wound not”].
                  “The cut worm forgives the plow” can be read as a kind of translation of this proverb
                  into other imagery.</p>

                     framework of the poem might affect a reader’s sense of the proverb’s possible meanings
                     or applications.):</em></p>
               <p>Plows and plowing are recurring figures in Blake’s “Proverbs of Hell.” In addition
                  to “The cut worm forgives the plow” (Erdman 35), they appear in three other proverbs:
                  “Drive your cart and your plow over the bones of the dead” (Erdman 35), “As the plow
                  follows words, so God rewards prayers” (Erdman 37), and “Prayers plow not! Praises
                  reap not!” (Erdman 37). To the extent that the four proverbs associate plows and plowing
                  with worms, driving, following, and reaping, they have a tendency collectively to
                  pressure the reader to think of plows/plowing in terms of agricultural cultivation
                  (as opposed to, say, their associations—associations more current in Blake’s day than
                  our own—with paper-cutting and book-making). Despite this stability, however, the
                  images of prayers that “plow not” and a plow that “follows words” already encourage
                  the reader to think of cultivation more figuratively than literally. It is in imagining
                  the four proverbs’ possible figurative and situational applications that they collectively
                  multiply one another’s meaningful possibilities, virtually ensuring that different
                  readers will apply the same proverb very differently. “Drive your cart and plow over
                  the bones of the dead,” for example, would seem to invest plowing with a kind of revolutionary
                  power of revitalization and renewal, turning dead bones into life-sustaining natural
                  fertilizer. Reading “The cut worm forgives the plow” alongside it thus might encourage
                  the reader to merge the two, such that one imagines the cut worm forgiving the plow
                  for the same reason that one is encouraged to drive one’s plow over dead bones—namely,
                  because the worm recognizes that the collateral violence of the act is outweighed
                  by the greater good of the revitalization and renewal it brings. Conversely, “As the
                  plow follows words, so God rewards prayers” would seem, according to one reading,
                  to make plowing into a potentially deluded or misdirected enterprise. Plows follow
                  words in the sense that plow-drivers give orders to teams of oxen, but how many Christians
                  regard God as a plow that does the bidding of those who pray? Perhaps the point is
                  that oxen don’t actually follow verbal orders, just as the other plowing proverb tells
                  us that “Prayers plow not.” Indeed, <em>are</em> there any oxen in this proverb, or just a farmer cursing at his inanimate plow? One
                  reading of the proverb is that God cannot be controlled by prayers, just as a plow
                  does not follow verbal orders. Another is that God rewards not words but correct actions,
                  just as a plow does. Another, more radical, interpretation is that just as there is
                  no plow that words can move, there is no God to reward prayers. While none of these
                  readings explains anything explicitly about the merits of plowing, each does plant
                  the idea that not everyone who wants to plow knows what he is doing. The effect is
                  to make the reader of “The cut worm forgives the plow” less apt to see the proverb
                  as an endorsement of willing self-sacrifice to a greater good than as a critique of
                  the complicity of victims in their own oppression by those who think they know best.
                  All of this would suggest that one of the major kinds of regulatory instability we
                  see operative in this proverb’s use today was potentially present from the time of
                  its publication by Blake. Just as some people today cite the proverb to celebrate
                  the worm’s selflessness and powers of forgiveness, whereas others cite it to critique
                  the worm’s ignorance and self-defeating servility, we can imagine readers of the “Proverbs
                  of Hell” in Blake’s age doing the same.</p>

         </div>
         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">The term “composite art” of course comes from W. J. T. Mitchell’s classic <em>Blake’s Composite Art: A Study of the Illuminated Poetry </em>(1978). I use it here, however, as a stand-in for any conception of Blake’s verbal-visual
               art that emphasizes its integrity as a medium.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Given Google’s complex algorithms, the search results reported throughout this essay
               will likely be different if attempted again at some point in the future. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Admittedly, it is slightly misleading to apply Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s
               idea of a “rhizomatic” form to Wikipedia given that the site’s editorial practices
               presently grant different degrees of editorial control to different users to produce
               hyperlinks across encyclopedia entries, thus in effect limiting the number of possible,
               mechanized, pathways through the site. At the same time, Wikipedia’s external openness
               as a system (theoretically, there are no limits on the number of new entries that
               can be added to it) and the sheer abundance of defined intra-site hyperlinks bring
               it closer to a rhizomatic system than to either the more closed, traceable systems
               that Deleuze and Guattari denote as “radicles” or the more radial, discretely branching
               systems that they denote as “root-trees” (Deleuze and Guattari 5-6). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Scholarly attention to the artistic compositeness of Blake’s illuminated books had
               been growing since the publication of Mitchell’s <em>Blake’s Composite Art </em>in 1978, and, before that, of Jean Hagstrum’s <em>William Blake, Poet and Painter </em>(1964). But it was catalyzed in the mid-1990s by Joseph Viscomi’s <em>Blake and the Idea of the Book</em> (1993). Although Viscomi’s analytical conclusions were not without their critics,
               his attention to the materiality of Blake’s illuminated books made it newly imperative
               for scholars, especially historicists, to ground their critical analyses in the books’
               material and composite form. Reflecting what he took to be a growing scholarly consensus,
               Nicholas Williams wrote in 2006 in overview of the state of Blake Studies that recent
               scholarship had made it imperative to “see the verbal and visual elements of the illuminated
               works as an integral whole, neither taking priority over the other, and both necessary
               for the full impact Blake intended” (3).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               <em>Blake, Deleuzian Aesthetics, and the Digital</em> (2012) also makes a case for conceptualizing Blake’s aesthetic project in terms that
               lend further theoretical justification to many of the approaches pursued by the scholars

               for making students more cognizant of the dynamics of image-text interactions in Blake.
               It involves blanking out the text of Blake’s “Nurse’s Song,” having them write lines
               to go with Blake’s accompanying images for the poem, and then, upon comparing their
               lines to Blake’s, reflecting on the extent to which image and text restrict (and open
               up) ways of seeing each other, as well as ways of seeing vision itself.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note19_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
