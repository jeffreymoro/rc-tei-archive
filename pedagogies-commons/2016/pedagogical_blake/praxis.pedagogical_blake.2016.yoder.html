               <h2><span class="head">The Multiplicity of Blake’s <em>Songs</em></span></h2>
               <p><em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em> (1794) is almost certainly William Blake’s most commonly taught work. Teaching the
                  <em>Songs</em> is complicated by the fact that it exists in so many different forms. According to
                  G. E. Bentley, Jr., “The plates of <em>Innocence</em> and the combined <em>Songs</em> were arranged in thirty-four distinct ways” (386). Inevitably we teach using one
                  of the relatively cheap facsimile editions, or we make do with the letterpress poems
                  in our anthology and supplement that with images online. This is where the fun starts
                  because the best place to get the images for the <em>Songs</em> is the online <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.blakearchive.org">William Blake Archive</a>, where we currently find four different copies of the <em>Songs of Innocence</em> (1789) and thirteen different copies of the combined <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>. This does not give students access to all extant copies of the <em>Songs</em>, but this is a pretty good sample, and the multiplicity itself makes a point to students
                  about what Blake thought about the stability of a “finished” work. While any single
                  copy of the <em>Songs</em> obviously functions as an artistic unity, no copy can claim to be the “last word”
                  on the <em>Songs</em>. The ultimate version of Blake’s <em>Songs</em> is the composite reading of as many copies as possible, and while we may not hope
                  to do that, we can do other things. In the following pages of this essay, I want to
                  suggest why and how we might read “all” the <em>Songs</em> (more or less) in the classroom.</p>
               <p>The multiplicity of the <em>Songs</em> is commonly recognized as both a problem and an advantage to teaching them. In their
                  introduction to the MLA <em>Approaches to Teaching Blake’s <em>Songs</em></em> (1989), Robert Gleckner and Mark Greenberg remark that “the <em>Songs</em> poses the problem of what, for Blake, constitutes a ‘book,’ as distinct from a collection
                  of poems or an anthology” (xiv). They note that “Even ‘complete’ composite editions
                  in color of one copy of the <em>Songs</em> present but one state of a work that Blake altered in color, visual design, and arrangement
                  each time he printed and painted it,” and they commiserate with the “instructor (constrained
                  by the chosen edition of work) [who] thus fixes a text that was continually changing
                  in its author’s hands” (xvi). Nonetheless, in the collection’s essay on “Teaching
                  the Variations in <em>Songs</em>,” Robert Essick extols “the rewards of a historical perspective on Blake’s composition,
                  arrangement, and production of the <em>Songs</em> over a period of more than thirty-five years” because “We lose our sense of the individual
                  copy as an unchanging and completely authoritative icon as it is recontextualized
                  back into its material and temporal origins and seen as only one of many versions”
                  (93). The problem in 1989 was the severely limited access to the basis for that “historical
                  perspective on Blake’s composition” in the designs themselves; indeed, the advice
                  of John Grant and Mary Lynn Johnson in the MLA volume on the availability of reproductions
                  for classroom use suggests a sort of Blakean underground market in which images are
                  available to those who have the right connections or enough money.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The situation has changed since 1989. With the thirteen combined <em>Songs</em> in the <em>Blake Archive</em> and the Blake Trust edition of Copy W ([c. 1825] the “King’s College” copy), students
                     now have ready access to fourteen different versions of the <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>. Each copy is different, but some differences have a greater impact on our interpretation
                     than others, and sequencing—the order of the poems in the collection—is especially
                     important. I teach the combined <em>Songs</em> in four different classes, including a threshold course for English majors, a Romantics
                     survey, a seminar exclusively on Blake, and a course I’ve developed on the <em>Songs</em> and <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (1798). In all these classes, I use an approach to the various sequences adapted from
                     Neil Fraistat’s <em>The Poem and the Book</em> (1985). In this book, Fraistat looks at “Ideas of Poetic Order and Ordering” and “Forms
                     of Coherence in Romantic Poetic Volumes” in the “contexture” that results from the
                     poets’ deliberate sequencing of poems in Romantic poetry collections, and he begins
                     his discussion by noting that Blake’s <em>Songs</em> display “in its most unadulterated form . . . the Romantic urge not only to structure,
                     but to restructure, contextures” (4).
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For related work on this topic, see Neil Fraistat’s edited collection Poems in their
                              Place (1986).</span></div>
                     </div> However, Fraistat does not discuss the <em>Songs</em> at length, focusing instead on William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, John Keats’ <em>Lamia</em> (1820) collection, and Percy Bysshe Shelley’s <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> (1820) collection. For Fraistat, contexture describes the fabric of the book created
                     by the weaving together of the “inner” meaning of a given poem taken separately and
                     the “outer” meaning of the poem considered as part of an ordered sequence. Fraistat
                     lists a number of possible contextural structures based on “subject, theme, image
                     or voice,” noting that the use of titles, epigraphs, or prefaces can also suggest
                     possible relationships or continuities among the poems in a collection (12). Fraistat’s
                     point is that in the original publication, the poet placed the poems in each collection
                     into a particular sequence, and the meaning and significance of a particular poem
                     depends at least in part on its position in that original sequence with other poems.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Fraistat’s focus on the author’s intentional sequencing of the poems in a collection
                  implies a tension between authorial and editorial concerns that I have explored in
                  a class on anthologies (see the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.ualr.edu/rpyoder/AnthologiesS06736001syl.htm">sample syllabus</a>). On the one hand, editorial decisions may be seen as manifestations of certain theories
                  of literary value that may have little to do with the author’s original decisions
                  about organizing his or her book. Fraistat’s approach to authorial concerns, on the
                  other hand, assumes that poets expected readers to read the poems in their poetry
                  collections in the order in which they appear, and that in such a sequential reading,
                  various relationships would emerge for readers. For Blake’s <em>Songs</em>, the authorial concerns reflected in Fraistat’s notion of contexture are rather more
                  complicated than for many writers. In the case of the <em>Songs</em>, what constitutes the contexture? Certainly the sequence of poems in any individual
                  copy provides the foundation for the contexture of that copy. Working with only the
                  <em>Blake Archive</em>, we can now compare the contextures in thirteen different copies. Can we weave these
                  separate contextures into a fluid multi-dimensional setting for each poem? Moreover,
                  in some cases the poems in an extant copy were not sequenced by Blake but by a later
                  owner, so the provenance of a particular copy may be included as part of its larger
                  contexture. As such, these copies come to the reader already encrusted with the traces
                  not only of interpretation but also the values assigned by the historical and commercial
                  processes that led to the copy’s assembly. Finally, we must add Blake’s use of stereotypes
                  of text and design to Fraistat’s list of “subject, theme, image or voice” as possible
                  bases for contexture, opening up questions of visual as well as verbal relations.
                  The object of our study looks less like a sequence of pages than a cluster of intersecting
                  spheres that largely overlap but are nowhere identical.</p>
               <p>I noted that I teach the full <em>Songs</em> in several different classes, but the truth is that I assign the full <em>Songs</em> in several different classes, without ever teaching all of the poems. There is just
                  not enough time to do so. Instead, I try to use poems that give a sense of structure
                  and theme, poems that suggest some point I want to make. I do feel a sense of responsibility
                  to the collection’s critical history, so I make a point to discuss “The Lamb” and
                  “The Tyger” for at least a bit, but the differences in purpose and focus of the various
                  classes mean that I have to approach the <em>Songs</em> differently in each course. Nonetheless, I always try to use the <em>Songs</em> to allow students to explore the various possible lines of continuity as well as
                  the more theoretical questions concerning the stability of the text. What sort of
                  work allows for so many different manifestations? What sort of artist envisions such
                  a work? How does Blake imagine his control over his creation? Even with half a semester
                  devoted to the <em>Songs</em>, these are questions toward which I feel I only gesture.</p>
               <p>But perhaps we can imagine a class I have never actually taught, but which I can begin
                  to see on my horizon. It is a class exclusively on the <em>Songs</em>. With fifteen weeks (more or less) we can deepen our study considerably. Take a week
                  each for the students to read through the <em>Songs of Innocence</em> and the <em>Songs of Experience</em>. Then use a week to introduce them to the <em>Blake Archive</em> and the different copies. Then, depending on class size, assign each student or team
                  of students one particular copy of the <em>Songs</em> to adopt. Their task now is to be the expert on their copy. The course would include
                  regular updates on what each student has learned about his or her copy. Discussions
                  of individual poems would be informed by each student’s different textual and contextural
                  experience, considering placement in a particular sequence as well as coloring, history,
                  or provenance. The history of each book is part of the character of the individual
                  copy and therefore part of the character of the full <em>Songs</em>, the ultimate composite text comprising all copies. In the classroom, this is about
                  as close as we might get to experiencing the <em>Songs</em> for the slippery, protean book it actually is.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Toward a Blakean Pedagogy </span></h2>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The multiple sequences of the <em>Songs</em> demonstrate that Blake accepted a certain amount of play in what constituted a “finished”
                     work as well as in his readers’ reactions to and reconstructions of that work. Teaching
                     the multiplicity of the <em>Songs</em> requires teachers and students to embrace that play as well. Therein lies the key
                     to a Blakean pedagogy. Perhaps Blake’s most famous statement on pedagogy is his remark
                     to Dr. Trusler in a letter dated August 23, 1799: “The wisest of the Ancients considered
                     what is not too Explicit as the fittest for Instruction because it rouzes the faculties
                     to act” (Erdman 702).

                     </div> Blake seems to assume that the typical state of mind is inactive and not conducive
                     to learning; the mind is bound by its own “mind-forg’d manacles” (8) that the poet
                     marks in every face he meets in “London.” The faculties must be roused, released from
                     those manacles, in order to learn, and the “not too Explicit” makes that happen. But
                     how?</p>
               </div>
               <p>The mental lethargy to which Blake responds is clearly evident in “The School Boy”
                  which appears in both <em>Innocence</em> and <em>Experience</em> at different times. The schoolboy states that school, where “I drooping sit” (11),
                  “drives all joy away” (7). The schoolmaster has a “cruel eye” (8), and the oppressive
                  atmosphere is such that “Nor in my book can I take delight” (13). Ironically, school
                  is where mental lethargy sets in; the process is equivalent to caging a bird (16-17),
                  nipping fresh buds, or stripping “tender plants” (21-23). The effects of this stifled
                  mentality are dire for they leave us unable to “gather what griefs destroy / Or bless
                  the mellowing year, / When the blasts of winter appear” (28-30). Without a joyous,
                  nurturing education, we are left unprepared in later life either to learn from our
                  losses or to appreciate our blessings.</p>
               <p>When the schoolboy laments that he cannot take delight in his book, the complaint
                  itself suggests that however much he might like to enjoy his learning, the schoolmaster
                  is preventing that by his methods of instruction. What does delight in learning mean
                  to Blake? Blake’s comments to Trusler suggest that the mind responds to the challenge
                  of the “not too Explicit” by rousing itself to the puzzle and presumably experiencing
                  the joy and energy lost in the schoolboy’s classroom. Knowledge for Blake is discovery.
                  It is the grasping of the lesson behind the not too explicit, and part of that lesson
                  is an awareness and appreciation of the process of learning, of inquiry, of discovery.
                  As Wordsworth puts it in the preface to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, it is the pleasure of “difficulty overcome” (611).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>I often tell my students that Blake’s poems are like little linear accelerators, in
                     which the atomic particles of the text crash into each other, throwing off clouds
                     of possible meanings. I think this is true of all texts, but I think it is especially
                     true for Blake. Those clouds of possible meaning require a certain faith in the interaction
                     between reader and text, student and teacher. The lessons of the <em>Songs</em> are not the sort of knowledge that can simply be transferred from the author to the
                     reader or from the teacher to the student. Rather, the lessons of the <em>Songs</em> depend on awakening the reader to multiple possibilities and points of view. Blake
                     thought that most people sleepwalk passively through a book the way that they sleepwalk
                     through their lives. They must be taught to read in the infernal method. Skepticism
                     is a requirement, as are independence of spirit and a willingness to question the
                     received interpretations of past authorities. Blake intends his books to force the
                     reader to wake up, to “rouze” the mind to act. A Blakean pedagogy requires a negotiation
                     between control and freedom. In <em>Jerusalem</em> (comp. ca. 1804-1820), Los says to “Labour well the Minute Particulars” (55:51), but
                     the point of such labor is to release possible readings, to make visible the infernal
                     readings that are hidden by the encrustations of tradition or the “mind-forg’d manacles”
                     of expectation or prejudice or idolatry. Blake knew—and the teacher of Blake’s works
                     must accept—that he had only very limited control over what the reader made of his
                     books, but he knew that we must begin with the material object—the book itself—and
                     build up from there. In his stereotypes—the composite of text and image—Blake tried
                     to retain as much creative control as possible, choosing his own handwriting over
                     standard print, his own integrated images over the standard publication layout. In
                     building the contextures of the individual copies, we also build a contexture of the
                     interaction of those copies with each other. Some of those copies have been sequenced
                     by Blake, others were sequenced by collectors or booksellers; either way, those copies
                     and their special circumstances are part of the contexture of the overall <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>.

               <p>In that MLA collection on teaching the <em>Songs</em>, Stephen Cox discusses “Taking Risks in Teaching <em>Songs</em>,” but the risks in 1989 are different from risks twenty-five years later. For Cox,
                  risk constitutes using discussion classes to teach students critical thinking about
                  the content and value of the <em>Songs</em>, and the evidence we use to establish either. Literary theory and classroom practice
                  have changed much since then, and what Cox finds risky, I think is probably close
                  to standard practice today. We might push these methods further, especially with the
                  resources now available, but in the end, we may find that simply reading poems honestly
                  with our students is all that we need to do. If we expect our students to embrace
                  the play and uncertainty of Blake’s work, we as teachers must ourselves be open to
                  such play. I know that, regardless of which particular poems I may prepare for classroom
                  discussion of the <em>Songs</em>, I rarely end up discussing those poems. My class preparation is more of a back-up
                  plan in case the students do not have any questions or preferences among the poems;
                  it’s good to be prepared, but I rarely use it. Instead, I ask the students what questions
                  they have or what poems they especially liked or which ones might have confused them.
                  Their answers usually lead away from the poems that I had prepared, and those are
                  usually my most productive classes. Obviously I’ve read all of the <em>Songs</em> more times than I can count, but I rarely have a reading of a particular poem at
                  my fingertips. Consequently these classes are exploratory and almost purely improvisational,
                  as discussion inevitably leads to unexpected approaches, questions that I had not
                  considered, or a level of detail that I don’t often examine. And this is good because
                  most students have never experienced reading a poem with someone who knows what she’s
                  doing and who is willing to share with the class the mistakes, the false starts, and
                  methods of approaching the problem.</p>
               <p>I recently had such a discussion of “The Divine Image” that shocked my students by
                  consuming the entire 75-minute period. The whiteboard from that discussion is here:</p>
               <figure class="figure"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/pedagogies/pedagogical_blake/images/yoder1Thumb.jpg" alt="Whiteboard for “The Divine Image.”" class="inline" style=" width:15.154477777777778cm; height:5.676513888888889cm;"/></figure>
               <p>Fig. 1 Whiteboard for “The Divine Image.”</p>
               <p>I do a lot of board work in these more exploratory sessions. I put key terms and ideas
                  up, grouping them, drawing in connections. Stick figures and badly-drawn maps are
                  functions of my classroom persona, and I use them to help visualize and organize the
                  concepts. For this class I had prepared to discuss “Infant Joy” and “Infant Sorrow,”
                  but a student asked about “A Divine Image,” so we went there instead, and that quickly
                  led to investigation of “The Divine Image” as well. With no prep, I was feeling my
                  way along, stanza by stanza, and the board notes suggest the dynamic of exploratory
                  thinking. We simply looked at what “The Divine Image” says. If we pray to and return
                  thanks to the traits of “Mercy Pity Peace and Love” (1), that would seem to identify
                  God with those traits. The second stanza confirms that conclusion but extends the
                  reference to “Man” (8) as well as “God” (6), while also introducing a parental relationship
                  between God and Man. All of this is represented on the left side of the white board.
                  The image in the middle represents the design of “The Blossom” which is similar to
                  the design for “The Divine Image.” The words and images at the right depict the associations
                  made in the third stanza of “The Divine Image” and emphasize the anthropomorphism
                  of Blake’s concept of the divine. All of this was generated by the class discussion.
                  The students came away with a clearer sense of what the poem is about as well as a
                  heightened awareness of the process of discovery.</p>
               <p>Since the discussion of “The Divine Image” had been triggered by a student’s question
                  about “A Divine Image” (the unused companion poem), in the following class we looked
                  at how “The Divine Image” relates to both “A Divine Image” and “The Human Abstract,”
                  the poem that Blake used instead. We noted how the fragmenting of the body and the
                  negative attributes of “A Divine Image” mirror the fragmentation and positive attributes
                  of “The Divine Image,” while also recalling the industrial imagery of the blacksmith
                  from “The Tyger.” Then we considered “The Human Abstract” and the variations it plays
                  on both the positive attributes of “The Divine Image” and the negative attributes
                  of “A Divine Image” in a narrative that recalls both the biblical story of the Fall
                  and “A Poison Tree.” Here is the whiteboard for that discussion:</p>
               <figure class="figure"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/pedagogies/pedagogical_blake/images/yoder2Thumb.jpg" alt="Whiteboard for “A Divine Image.”" class="inline" style=" width:15.24cm; height:5.836708333333333cm;"/></figure>
               <p>Fig. 2 Whiteboard for “A Divine Image.”</p>
               <p>The second board suggests a more orderly approach on my part on the second day as
                  we set in place the alternative associations established in “The Human Abstract.”
                  I learned a lot in these discussions. Part of the discussion was about the poems and
                  how Blake represents the relationship between the human and the divine. But we also
                  learned that sometimes the Blakean ideas or images that seem most strange actually
                  make the most sense if taken at face value. I find that most new readers of Blake
                  understand what he says; they just can’t believe he said it. I counsel my students
                  that confusion is an appropriate first response to much of Blake’s work. All three
                  poems we discussed create chains of associations with the divine attributes of <em>Mercy, Pity, Peace</em> and <em>Love</em>. The fragmenting of the body, its industrialization in “A Divine Image,” the cryptic
                  allegory of “The Human Abstract,” and the conflicting associations all make the poems’
                  statements seem strange. Nonetheless, the associations are quite clear if we just
                  record what the poems say.</p>
               <p>The whiteboards from class show a movement from exploration to understanding. A Blakean
                  pedagogy demands that teachers and students alike approach the poems with an open
                  mind and a sense of adventure. This is reading in the infernal method: confronting
                  the essential strangeness of poetic pronouncements intruding into the mundane world
                  and accepting that strangeness as an invitation to play, to learn, to rouse the faculties.
                  Blake’s designs are filled with images of people reading. Some cover their books so
                  no one else can see, but more often, Blake shows adults and children reading together.
                  In <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> (1790), the poet and his new friend, an “Angel, who is now become a Devil,” “often
                  read the Bible together in its infernal . . . sense” (Plate 24). Discussion and skepticism
                  must be the basis for any Blakean pedagogy. But for anyone who knows Blake’s work,
                  this seems hardly to need saying.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Probably in 1818 Blake sent to Thomas Butts (probably) a list identifying “The Order
                     in which the Songs of Innocence &amp; of Experience out [sic] to be paged &amp; placed” (Erdman
                     772). The nature of Blake’s response suggests that Butts had asked him about the correct
                     order of the poems, a question he would only ask if he knew that there were copies
                     of the <em>Songs</em> with different sequences. Butts does not go as far as John Linnell did with Copy F
                     of <em>Jerusalem</em> (1827), actually changing Blake’s page numbers to match the pagination in his own
                     copy, but his question suggests the same sort of desire for a stable text that we
                     often find in our students.

                     </div> Nonetheless, everything about the <em>Songs</em> works against the fulfillment of that desire, and I must admit to a certain satisfaction
                     in the fact that only Copy V (1821) exhibits the correct “Order” outlined in the letter
                     to Butts; not even Blake’s own copy follows the sequence. I teach the <em>Songs</em> especially to my new English majors precisely because I want them to think about what
                     makes a book, and whether a book is ever a stable authoritative statement. I use Blake
                     to make certain points about the nature of literature, the nature of reading, the
                     nature of reality. The lesson of the multiplicity of the <em>Songs</em> is to embrace the uncertainty of new relationships and to discover the possibilities
                     that arise from the combination and recombination of words and pictures, poems and
                     books.</p>
