            <p class="noCount">While many Blake scholars across several generations have drawn attention to the varied
               processes at play in the illuminated books, prophecy—the particular aspects of those
               unique textual objects designed to provide “instruction” by operating on readers—has
               never been fully brought into a unified framework. This essay seeks to do so. Gathering
               aspects of scholarship focused on textuality, readings grounded in reception dynamics,
               and psychoanalytic critical theories, the essay examines the Blakean work as pedagogical
               instrumentation, pursuing these concerns through <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> (1790) and <em>Milton</em> (comp. ca. 1804-1811)—two enriched textual environments for tracing and unveiling
               such operations.</p>

                  <p>This essay contemplates Blakean textual practices as a method to induce intellectual
                     activities often associated with pedagogy, beginning with the ontological moment when
                     the printing technique (acid corrosion of copper to create the script and lines of
                     illuminated printing) first appears as a <em>leitmotif</em> in the canon and concluding with the teleological moment when mirrored printing disappears
                     from textual presence, closing Blake’s deployment/employment of the techniques associated
                     with <em>mise en abyme</em>. Two visual moments frame my meditation on textual method as pedagogical technique
                     and are well-known scenes of instruction in the illuminated books—although situated
                     at different yet related incipient points of culminating textual tactics deployed
                     for transformational strategies (one early and one late). The analysis opens with
                     a consideration of the curiously complex half-plate design at the bottom of the tenth
                     plate of <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> (1790), where William Blake offers a visual “key” for unlocking the verbal “code”
                     (i.e., how to read) a textual operation (whether verbal or visual) critically categorized
                     as one form of <em>mise en abyme</em> (“mirror in the text”), a presence that tends to work towards meta-textual ends.

                              of this textual component occurred with the publication of Lucien Dällenbach’s Le
                              récit spéculaire: Essai sur la mise en abyme (1977), later published as The Mirror
                              in the Text (1989), which had “a double outcome: it confirmed our working hypothesis,
                              namely that the mise en abyme is a structured reality, despite the apparent variety
                              and randomness of its actual manifestation; and it gave us an adequately rigorous
                              method to enable us to trace its diachronic evolution” (Dällenbach 165).</span></div>

                     </blockquote> Four such reflective lessons occur in <em>Jerusalem</em>, although the first (“Every Thing has its Vermin O Spectre of the Sleeping Dead!”)
                     from the frontispiece is only barely legible (Erdman 144). On this particular plate,
                     the legible lesson focuses on fallen “love,” grimly concluding that “In Heaven Love
                     begets Love! But Fear is the Parent of Earthly Love” (Erdman 238). In relation to
                     this analytic inscape of <em>eros</em>, the reversed writing proposes forgiveness as the vehicle for ascension to heaven
                     (a complex place within Blakean constructs), which establishes the method (forgiveness)
                     by which to realize the aim (love)—a realization unavailable to everyone pictured
                     in the design and its narrative. Real love untinged by fear as a lived experience
                     can only, in the horizon of Blakean ethical constructs, be achieved through the perfection
                     of processes of self-annihilation (mapped in extreme detail in <em>Milton</em> [comp. ca. 1804-1811]) to overthrow our individual specters and subvert collective
                     selfhood. These words are spoken by Gwendolen (the first daughter of Albion), who
                     often represents the <em>Female Will</em> in Blake’s late mythological casting of dramatized mental attributions with material
                     operations (hence “a Sublime Allegory . . . addressd to the Intellectual powers” created
                     to cultivate “Corporeal Understanding” [Erdman 730]). The primary poetic thrust of <em>Jerusalem</em> probes the interplay between the punctuated historical development of moral law and
                     the states of mind by which these stages achieve material bodies anchored in the real.
                     However, my focus will be on the meta-textual, the zone of pedagogy if you will, since
                     the last canonical instance of mirrored writing links the instrument of knowledge
                     (i.e., technique) directly to its transformation of knowledge into wisdom (i.e., forgiveness)
                     manifest as “the Art of Living.” In this sense, I tend to see works like <em>The Marriage</em> or <em>Milton</em> as books of wisdom in the same educational tenor and vehicle as <em>The Book of Job</em> or <em>The Heart Sutra</em> (a point made by Salman Rushdie in his evocation of Blake in the preface to <em>The Satanic Verses</em> [1988]).</p>
               </div>
               <p>These textual spots of imaginary time at the opening and closing of the illuminated
                  canon themselves depend on meta-textual operations to achieve different textual effects
                  and ends, and the discrete scenes, while performing local functions for individual
                  works, nonetheless manifest symbolic mirroring properties that connect them across
                  the temporal/textual semiotic sea of the illuminated works. The use of <em>mise en abyme</em> as intra/intertextual vehicle in an experimental printing method embodies a rather
                  sophisticated vision of textual operations (given its inherent function as “a kind
                  of reflexion” [Dällenbach 8]) and shadows the physical manifestation of the long-recognized
                  psychoanalytic structuration encoded into the illuminated works. When tracking the
                  vehicle that moves the inert work into activity, the unveiled textual trajectory traces
                  the development of a fledgling meta-textual technique (the pronouncement in a 1790s
                  fiery coda of a new type of printing—with its corrosive mirrored method) to the last
                  illuminated appearance of a piece of <em>mirrored writing</em> in the horizon of textual operations (concluding the practice of occasionally leaving
                  lines reversed in certain areas of <em>Milton</em> and <em>Jerusalem</em>).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Blake’s use of the full spectrum of functions associated with the <em>mise en abyme</em> element of production from <em>The Marriage</em> to <em>Jerusalem</em> (a passage from mirrors in the text to texts operating as mirrors) brings to fruition
                     across this span the promise of the former in the operations of the latter, with this
                     movement creating a vehicle of complexity, fluidity, illumination, instability, lucidity,
                     opaqueness, and speculation—an instrument of instruction incorporating the means to
                     unveil and then shatter the mirror from which its symbolic characters and its textual
                     body arose. In essence, the illuminated works in any number of ways force readers
                     to encounter and experience “what psychoanalysis calls the mirror stage” (Culler and
                     Abrams 150), the incipient point of entry into a conceptual structure of the subject
                     articulated by Jacques Lacan, resulting in “<em>an identification</em>” by which the adoption “of the <em>imago</em> . . . establishes a relation between the organism and its reality” through an experience
                     transacted within “the intraorganic mirror” (<em>Écrits</em> 2, 4). The adoption of the <em>imago</em> stabilizes the subject, rendering the psyche “dependent on the perception of the self
                     as other” yet coming at the cost of “the complex specular play of identification and
                     alienation” (Culler and Abrams 150-151). Of course, this process in Blake’s sublime
                     allegory gives rise to the “Spectre,” which must be “cast . . . into the Lake” of
                     mind (Erdman 184)—the reflective pool from which it emerges—to allow an awakening
                     into humanity. This antidote to the malady of alienation and fragmentation, the overt
                     symptoms of reflexive processes of subject formation, is the lesson taught through
                     perhaps the best known instance of mirrored writing, which occurs in <em>Jerusalem</em><div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> As the imp on the scroll ex/presses, and as Diane Piccitto has recently argued, “This
                     mirrored writing is in itself an alienation from a process that should be familiar,
                     reading, and forces the audience to grapple with the work” in unusually energetic
                     ways (Piccitto 78). This forced grappling, I argue, operates as a meta-textual pedagogical
                     zone, with the reversed writing forcing a mirror-stage encounter wherein one either
                     seeks or becomes a mirror. Through mirrored writing, then, Blake’s textual design
                     pragmatically prompts particular acts of reception to open the doors of perception
                     (think of the gates of Golgonooza initiating passage into virtually infinite paths
                     and worlds), which would be a necessary boundary condition (particularized acts of
                     reception) for an aspiring transactional and transformational textual condition.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The same <em>textual condition</em> (a fusion of the psychological and textual within the meta-textual zone of the pedagogical
                  in the service of cultivating salvific forms of self-annihilation capable of ending
                  the psychic domination of one’s spectre and deconstructing the tendency from which
                  it emerges, the collective state of consciousness known as selfhood) is a quite skillful
                  vehicle in light of its ability “to draw the antidote of self-consciousness from consciousness
                  itself” (Hartman 48). The annihilation of the spectre, which counters ceaseless circulation
                  in the speculum of secondary narcissism and which is predicated upon enthrallment
                  via identification with an imaginary self (an <span class="foreign">imago</span>), since the emergent stability of subjectivity created during “the mirror stage also
                  installs a rival other” (Nobus 113), thereby establishes alienation as one cornerstone
                  of consciousness and requires acts of “anti-self-consciousness” (Hartman 46) to overcome
                  its deleterious effects. This periodic practice of self-annihilation generates “an
                  ethics of alterity . . . focused less on the individual as the locus of ethical scrutiny
                  . . . than on relationships” (Moskal 5).</p>
               <p>Blake’s development of different uses of <em>mise en abyme</em> coincides with the punctuated appearance of an ethos of otherness that slowly replaces
                  the earlier emphasis on an ethos of energy, and the vehicle and its outcome are intimately
                  bound together. This complicated commitment intermittently surges into presence with
                  ever-greater insistence after the Lambeth works and as the last epics struggle to
                  realize systemic synthesis. And so, the mirrored textuality migrates from evocation
                  in a text so designed (i.e., by the “new” mirrored writing as mode of production)
                  to its final unveiling within textual operations and technologies (i.e., by literal
                  inclusion of reversed lines to unveil [and thereby unleash] meta-textual effects experienced
                  as psychological affects)—with the revolutionary furor of the former underwriting
                  the evolutionary flavor of the latter. As Dällenbach suggests following his masterful
                  typological analysis of the varied modes of <em>mise en abyme</em>: “ . . . the constitution of the <em>mise en abyme</em> as an ‘organ’ of the text is synonymous with its function” (55). Under Blake’s direction,
                  the sought function created a text that gazes back, that challenges in its very graphic
                  composition, that frustrates and stymies in its willed opacity, and that is operative
                  on numerous semiotic plateaus—whether an interlinear design flourish or a full-plate
                  illustration. And what is taught—to act, to commit, and to engage—is transferable
                  to any activity and capable of replication in any new textual form of representation.
                  Blake’s textual approach craftily captures “the functions of production, reception
                  and their interactions” while providing the “structure, function, [and] communication”
                  needed to shape a “phenomenological reader” (Holub 108, 109, 85).</p>

                  provides an extremely powerful yet subtle hermeneutic path (a skillful means) to a
                  pedagogical end (awakened awareness of one’s own similar entanglements), and in the
                  view of some psychoanalytic critics, their coupling is a natural partnership, since
                  “reader-response criticism is, in the world of literary criticism, the most practical
                  embodiment of the basic psychoanalytic insight that all knowledge is personal knowledge”
                  (Holland 58). However, from the reception side of the event-horizon, contact in the
                  free-flowing zone cannot be reduced to “an arbitrary series of merely subjective impressions,
                  but rather the carrying out of specific instructions in a process of directed perception”
                  (Jauss 23). Blake’s particular fusion of these strains—the illuminated book as pedagogical
                  tool and anagogical instrument—requires a deeply enriched semiotic field that functions
                  as preliminary <em>scene of instruction</em> (for both Blake the author and Blake the industry), and the shifting application
                  of watercolors and re-inscription of individual plates across time exhibit a willingness
                  to alter and transform the vehicle of illumination and to adapt and perfect its textual
                  operations for particular effects and ends. The inaugural moment is evocation of method
                  in <em>The Marriage</em>, and the work positions readers “on the abyss of the five senses” to contemplate
                  “a mighty Devil [who] . . . on the sides of the rock, with corroding fires” (Erdman
                  35)—the post-inscriptive chemical process at the base of the method—etches a proverb
                  that encourages identification as affective reception dynamic, the particular process
                  at the foundation of the Lacanian structure of subjectivity (i.e., the mirror-stage).
                  However, the mirrored operations situated in the very constitution of the physical
                  body of <em>The Marriage</em> is verbalized on the sixth plate but initially felt visually when “looking awry”
                  at its title plate design (with its anamorphic features) (Žižek 15-19; Lacan, <em>Four Fundamental Concepts </em>79-90). Both establish on two entangled planes the theme of the transformational text
                  and its corrosive origins and institute its textual operations as sequential mirror-stage
                  encounters serving as “structuring situation[s]” (Green 166), with the final flowering
                  of these early semiotic seeds emerging within the vibrant pages of <em>Milton</em> and <em>Jerusalem</em>, works which confront readers with “[infinite] zone[s] of indeterminacy” yet “provide
                  tools of . . . ideological analysis” (Rothenberg 89, 134).</p>
               <p>The extraordinary design at the foot of the tenth plate of <em>The Marriage</em> (Blake, Vol. 3, Plate 10), which appears immediately following passage through the
                  “Proverbs of Hell,” ostensibly illustrates the event described in the work’s first
                  “Memorable Fancy,” where the I-persona, while collecting proverbs from hell, sees
                  a “mighty Devil” writing on the face of a cliff “with corroding fires” the primary
                  proverb in the work: “How do you know but ev’ry Bird that cuts the airy way, / Is
                  an immense world of delight, clos’d by your senses five” (Erdman 35). The design immediately
                  follows the conclusion of the “Proverbs of Hell,” and in their facsimile edition,
                  Morris Eaves, Robert Essick, and Joseph Viscomi offer this description of the activities
                  unfolding at this crucial scene of instruction: <span class="quote">‘. . . a kneeling male devil with bat wings points to the scroll in his lap, while
                     a seated figure (probably male) to the left writes down what he says and a second
                     seated figure (probably male) to the right looks over his shoulder and copies from
                     the scroll to the tablet in his lap[.] (134)’</span> In considering the narrative segment serving as inspiration for the design, the encounter
                  of the I-persona with the mighty devil might fit a portion of the illustration (i.e.,
                  the reception dynamics sketched on the left side of the plate), yet the reading offered
                  by Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi— attending in great detail to the description of the
                  material/s at hand—sheds little light on the hermeneutic imperatives, the meta-critical
                  resonances, or the operational dynamics of the poem’s textuality. This moment, which
                  records the first transmission of infernal wisdom comprising the “Bible of Hell” to
                  another (the I-persona), clearly requires the figural supplement of the third entity
                  on the right, who remains unaccounted for (only acknowledged) in relation to the events
                  included in the first memorable fancy. No matter the shifting background and differing
                  application of paint so prominent on the various plates of the work, the figuration
                  remains the steady state across all (historical) transformations of its surface features,
                  delineating the most important dimension of the work at this crucial point of transition:
                  <em>how to read this particular work.</em></p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The context for the illustration is its capture of a narrative moment of transmission
                     (of teaching) in the first memorable fancy for the work, which follows a frontal parodic
                     and satiric assault on the construction of knowledge and (in the case of memorable
                     fancies) even those past influences who impacted Blake’s thinking (i.e., Emanuel Swedenborg).

                              crafted her or his own impoverished experience of reception.</span></div>
                     </div> The opening seven plates preceding this textual tutorial representation cultivate
                     unlearning as the necessary preparatory process for the awakening of wisdom, with
                     the visionary founder of the Church of the New Jerusalem (Swedenborg) reduced to “sitting
                     at the tomb” with “All Bibles or sacred codes” found rife with “Errors” and become
                     catalysts of strife, and with the pietistic poet John Milton seen in league with the
                     devils’ party (Erdman 34). The master technique of inversion becomes the tool to dismantle
                     pre-conceived notions, scraping the encrustations of constraint from the core of the
                     self to unleash unrestrained creativity, which certainly describes the “Proverbs of
                     Hell” and which provides transitional functions for the passage from unlearning and
                     the release of stifled creativity that occurs in its wake. Additionally, the opening
                     movement of the work from the title plate to the “Proverbs” functions as a structural
                     form of the <em>mise en abyme</em> trope (reflecting subsequent textual organization).</p>

                  the interplay of philosophical declamation and memorable fancy) four times—perhaps
                  embracing those proverbs with fourfold structuration as the schema by which to reassemble

               <p> Dyadic and tertiary proverbial constructs are suspended in the force field of the
                  proverbs as well, but the fourfold comes forward with consistent insistence and, in
                  the mythic works that follow <em>The Marriage,</em> assumes its structural function as a strategy of containment through which to explore
                  the interactions of those components of mind later examined as the <em>four zoas</em> and their emanations.</p>

                     half-page design (Blake, Vol. 3, Plate 10), the center of the visual field is occupied
                     by the devil with a scroll draped across his lap, although I believe the figures in
                     this group actually lack sufficient specificity to make clear-cut assignations of
                     gender and should remain undetermined (which widens the pedagogical impact of the
                     design).

                              which eliminates or, rather, transcends, all corrupt sexuality in a future utopia,
                              male as well as female” (37).</span></div>
                     </div> The devil leans to his right/our left and, with pointed finger and extended body,
                     dictates to the I-persona, capable of identification as such through his capacity
                     as recorder and textual editor who “collected some of their Proverbs” and observed
                     the corrosive compositional activities of the “mighty Devil” (Erdman 35). Under these
                     hermeneutic conditions, the figure on the right side of the design can only be an
                     (ideal/idealized) reader, and this reading is reinforced by following the direction
                     of this figure’s gaze. S/he resides on the heavenly side of the plate and looks horizontally
                     through the devil’s wings towards the hellish side of the plate, with the spatial
                     distribution replicating the geographic orientation established on the title plate—although
                     this visual association, not surprisingly (given the theme of the work) periodically
                     vacillates to create shifting emphases for variable ends. The figure does not read
                     the scroll (as Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi suggest) but seeks identification with the
                     I-persona as momentary <em>imago</em> that can function as the vehicle of transportation, with the narrative (verbal) operations
                     of the work here unveiled within the dimension of (visual) design as technique for
                     transformation. The design images a phenomenological act of participatory reading
                     that when combined with the literally mirrored body of the text establishes a textual
                     gaze that seeks to convert its intensity “into an energy finer than intellect” (Hartman
                     48) to cultivate in its receptive wake the awakening of a phenomenological reader.

               <p>Generally, in <em>The Marriage</em> the bridge across the abyss (an aspect of the literal translation of <em>mise en abyme</em>) between reader and text is mediated through the I-persona, who only appears in memorable
                  fancies (dining with prophets and wrestling with angels), who vacillates between active
                  and passive modes of apprehension (engagement versus observation), and who, through
                  reception dynamics, takes up temporary residence in consciousness as an imaginative
                  agent conceived to work (refinement of organs of perception within the meta-textual
                  zone of pedagogical engagement). This narrative method unfolds in interiority and
                  is unveiled via the reading experience—crafting a revolutionary mode of printing indeed
                  through the process—but in a sense different than its literal tracks left in the verbal
                  field. The method translates interior psychic experience into dialectically disposed
                  modes of symbolic communication (the verbal and visual) and transfers that experience
                  into a material body (the copper plate), courting in its construction and operations
                  countertransference during the act of reading.</p>
               <p>The problem, however, arrayed in advance of such a method, which seeks to utilize
                  instructional instrumentation grounded in the text for transformational outcomes located
                  in the reader, remains the seemingly logical (but actually mistaken) assumption made
                  by Wolfgang Iser that “a text cannot adapt itself to each reader it comes into contact
                  with” (109). However, the temporary yet atemporal identification through a first-person
                  narrator is a functional neurocognitive element of perception and reception, which
                  would vary by degree but remain present in all acts of reading. Blake’s use of the
                  I-persona in this early work creates an activated textual field designed to exploit
                  the neurocognitive dimensions of narratological engagement. Given the reflective dynamics
                  of textual operation manifest in its dialogical tendencies (angels and devils, prolific
                  and devourer) and deployed across numerous dialectical dimensions (verbal and visual,
                  poetic and prosaic), the work has maximized its opportunities for conversionary ends,
                  which then gains the final impetus to liberate readers by unveiling visually what
                  it exploits verbally. Analyzing the images brings one to an act of “anti-self-consciousness”
                  experienced as the recognition of the presence of the <em>imago</em> as vehicle of transport. The re/cognition of this realization reveals one’s position
                  in an extremely potent pedagogical zone of engagement registered within the meta-textual,
                  as Georges Poulet noted long ago: <span class="quote">‘Whenever I read, I mentally pronounce an <em>I</em>, and yet the <em>I</em> which I pronounce is not myself . . . Reading, then, is the act in which the subjective
                     principle which I call <em>I</em>, is modified in such a way that I no longer have the right, strictly speaking, to
                     consider it as my <em>I</em>. I am on loan to another, and this other thinks, feels, suffers, and acts within
                     me. (44-45)’</span> Being on loan to another is to have a self-conscious encounter with alterity, and
                  dual lives registered in singular consciousness establish relations generative of
                  compassion, empathy, and sympathy—the foundation for Adam Smith’s theory of moral
                  sentiments: “Pity and compassion are words appropriated to signify our fellow-feeling
                  with the sorrow of others. Sympathy, though its meaning was, perhaps, originally the
                  same, may now, however, without much impropriety, be made use of to denote our fellow-feeling
                  with any passion whatever” (13).</p>

                  <p>In the view of some psychoanalytic critics, this fusion of reception dynamics and
                     psychoanalytic techniques in textual operations brings <em>natural</em> into mutual illumination, since—as noted earlier—“reader-response criticism is, in
                     the world of literary criticism, the most practical embodiment of the basic psychoanalytic
                     insight that all knowledge is personal knowledge” (Holland 58). The mirrored text
                     provides <em>structure</em>; turbulent dynamics <em>function</em> to intermingle the energies brought into play by writer and reader in creative interchange
                     at the event-horizon of the textual event, and the screen of textuality, at the very
                     level of form, pursues transformative reception dynamics in an attempt to create a
                     communitarian model capable of addressing all readers without tyrannizing any of them.
                     Thus, complementary textual alliances (between word and design, form and function,
                     reception and inception, projection and introjection, etc.) shape the final state
                     of Blake’s illuminated printing method, and this allegiance creates an opportunity
                     to intervene on both sides of the <em>event</em> (in Badiou’s sense of the term) by constructing a screen upon which projections from
                     either pole of textuality are cast and on which those projections counter-impose and
                     interact.

               <p>The textual crescendo of these imaginative impulses occurs in <em>Jerusalem</em> (Blake, Vol. 1, Plate 41): a critical judgment made relative to its didactically
                  yet pithily expressed antidote, casting the spectre into the lake of mind from which
                  the <em>imago</em> emerged, for the dis/ease of the selfhood (which becomes the first step along an
                  imaginary path of countertransference capable of ending the delusive dominion of the
                  spectre). However, the <em>denouement</em> of the mirrored method occurs much later (Blake, Vol. 1, Plate 81): the immediate
                  context for the illustration on this plate is Gwendolen’s elaboration (to her fellow
                  eleven daughters of Albion) of a discourse on demented love expressive of a desire
                  for dominion (“For Men are caught by Love: Woman is caught by Pride / That Love may
                  only be obtained in the passages of Death”) (Erdman 238). As Minna Doskow suggests,
                  Gwendolen “uses false affection to dominate man” and notes the degree to which this
                  discourse connects to similar ideological assertions of authority by Vala and Enitharmon
                  (145). However, the image is demonstrative of a peculiar Blakean tendency of registering
                  irony within the visual field—with Gwendolen’s “affective error . . . appear[ing]
                  in mirror writing [within] the looking-glass” of the mirrored text at the culmination
                  of its pedagogical mission (Doskow 145, 146).</p>
               <p>Even as she urges her sisters to greater mechanism of control, pointing to the mirrored
                  writing as support for her promulgation of “self interest &amp; selfish natural virtue”
                  (Erdman 237), she has nonetheless consciously evoked and embraced the principle capable
                  of creating transformations in the realm of the real (i.e., forgiveness). Her hope
                  to use it as a mechanism of control finally fails, since the seeds of selfless forms
                  of love are actually planted in the fertile ground of imagination by and through the
                  unconscious and blossom across the last plates of the work. Dramatic irony is defined
                  as the audience (outscape) knowing what the participants in the drama (inscape) know
                  not, and only the reader can break through the vegetative glass that captures the
                  gaze in its own to uncover, via textual techniques “using and combining textual strategies
                  like a consummate deconstructionist,” a window onto eternity beyond its panes (Hilton
                  100). </p>
               <p>The argument for the illuminated book as pedagogical tool designed to act upon its
                  readers and therein stimulate passivity into activity as the necessary receptive reaction
                  to the mirrored dynamics embedded at its foundation rests upon the knowledge that
                  “no writer has ever controlled so much of the process himself, nor has any writer
                  been so self-conscious about the process of making books” (Jones 25). Such imaginative
                  and productive textual practices, which provide access to plateaus of the dialogic,
                  require more research, since “the role of dialogue, in Blake’s poetic universe and
                  in his relationship with the reader, warrants special attention” (Esterhammer 82).
                  For example, my analysis has only touched upon the broader play of <em>mise en abyme</em> across illustrative and narrative planes of the Blakean textual universe in all its
                  manifestations—such as the mirroring of several plates of <em>Milton</em>, where the inversely mirrored postures of the full-plate designs are echoed in advance
                  in a small interlinear flourish (Blake, Vol. 5, Plate 14). And this design, when read
                  left to right, displays features equally present two plates earlier (Blake, Vol. 5,
                  Plate 12). This overt play <em>in the abyss</em> through the agency of textual mirrors will require additional labor to position criticism
                  in the places where textuality and pedagogy converge—with the <em>jouissance</em> attainable within the fields of force flowing from this event-horizon in which readers
                  participate in its affective stylistics.</p>

         </div>
         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">The most influential elaboration of the aesthetic, dramatic, and narratological dimensions
               of this textual component occurred with the publication of Lucien Dällenbach’s <em>Le récit spéculaire: Essai sur la mise en abyme</em> (1977), later published as <em>The Mirror in the Text</em> (1989), which had “a double outcome: it confirmed our working hypothesis, namely
               that the <em>mise en abyme</em> is a structured reality, despite the apparent variety and randomness of its actual
               manifestation; and it gave us an adequately rigorous method to enable us to trace
               its diachronic evolution” (Dällenbach 165).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Such a pedagogy should cultivate skills transferable as needed to all events and situations,
               since “the language of the situation is the medium of knowledge” (Badiou 133).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">All parenthetical page citations for William Blake quotes refer to David Erdman’s
               edition of <em>The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</em> (1988).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">As a transcription of the mirrored writing suggests, the move towards self-annihilation
               corrects both individual enchantment of secondary narcissism—the self-victimization
               that comes with subjectivity constructed via the imaginary from the outside inside—that
               identifies with another “self” (but one anchored in the real and not reducible to
               self-as-other): “Each man is in / His Spectre’s power / Untill the arrival / Of that
               Hour, / When his Humanity / awake / And cast his Spectre / Into the Lake” (Erdman
               184).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Unless otherwise noted, in this essay references to Blake’s plates (by volume and
               plate number) refer to The William Blake Trust/Princeton University Press’s <em>The Illuminated Books of William Blake</em>, gen. ed. David Bindman (6 vols., 1991-1995).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Thus, one semiotic strain to be confronted (through active reception) must be the
               work’s intertextual engagements, and an inert and unenterprising reader will have
               crafted her or his own impoverished experience of reception.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">This argumentative line is informed by Magnus Ankarsjö: “Thus, it is my contention
               that Blake can be no misogynist, since he embraces a humanitarian utopian position
               which eliminates or, rather, transcends, <em>all</em> corrupt sexuality in a future utopia, male as well as female” (37).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">For a related account of the phenomenology of reading, see Maurice Mearleau-Ponty’s
               <em>Phenomenology of Perception</em> (226).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">The language offered for Blake’s textual operations in the act of reception is something
               like Jacques Lacan’s diagram of interaction between the “gaze” and “the subject of
               representation” through an image projected onto a “screen” (<em>Four Fundamental Concepts </em>106).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
