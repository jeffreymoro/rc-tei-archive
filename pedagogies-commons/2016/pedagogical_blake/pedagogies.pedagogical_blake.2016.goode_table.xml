          <cell>Post in a web forum devoted to growing cannabis. The post is responding to a query about whether it is bad for growing soil to have worms in it and, if not, whether it is acceptable if one accidentally cuts those worms in the process
            of mixing the soil. </cell>
          <cell>It is acceptable to plow because, aside from the fact that the act of cutting worms is a necessary by-product of the positive work of cultivation, the worm itself is not really sacrificed (“worms regenerate fairly well after being
            cut”). </cell>

          <cell>Comment in response to a blog post by an officer in the US Marine Corps describing his experiences in Afghanistan. The comment responds specifically to a blog post about the complacency of Americans toward the sacrifices the military
            is making for them abroad. The post describes a firefight in which 30 marines successfully held off 250 insurgents and yet did not receive any media coverage for their heroism.</cell>
          <cell>Not clear. In context, the implication is perhaps that the blogger should complain less: i.e., that those who make sacrifices are repaid by the understanding that they do so in the service of a greater good. That said, given the
            attention in the blog post to the dead insurgents and to the Afghan people’s respect for the tactical prowess of the marines in this firefight, one could also read the person invoking the proverb as trying to say: “A culture or group that
            suffers collateral damage or loss in the name of progress/cultivation forgives in hindsight.” </cell>

          <cell>The implication seems to be that, while intentional harm is bad, there is a kind of inevitable violence to being and growing in history (which is a process of sensory experimentation). The cut worm and the plow operator grasp this.

          <cell>“If there is a hierarchy of being, a great chain, it seems only natural for an ‘advanced’ ‘being’ to ‘watch’ us. The cut worm forgives the plow.” (This interprets the proverb as saying: the person who has faith in a benevolent God

          <cell>Comment on a thread responding to a 2009 article in the American Copy Editors Society (ACES) newsletter. The article refers to the declining economic prospects of journalism, and, with it, copyediting, making reference to the fact
            that former Society President John McIntyre had been laid off in the past year by <hi rend="italic">The Baltimore Sun</hi>. The comment is from a copy editor disaffected with the ineffectiveness of ACES. He closes by writing, “A shout out
            to John McIntyre! Remember: The cut worm forgives the plow!”</cell>
          <cell rend="Normal_(Web)">This is a complicated citation. It interprets the proverb to mean something like “one can or should accept one’s sacrifice in the service of a greater good” (in this case, the greater good of keeping a failing
            industry afloat). However, in context, this is clearly a sarcastic invocation of the proverb, implicitly suggesting that the proverb’s “wisdom” is self-serving to supporters of plow-wielders and does not issue from the mouths of cut
            worms.</cell>

      <head>II. Sources of Differences in Meaning when “The cut worm forgives the plow” is Cited Online [sample]
      </head>
        <list type="bulleted">
      <item>“Worm” can either signify an actual worm or serve as a metaphor for a wide range of things, including a human (either an everyman figure or a more specific person, like a soldier, an employee, or a war-torn people), any animal, any entity
        that lacks the capability of exacting revenge, and a word.</item>
      <item>The literal meaning of “cut worm” signifies different things to different people, including harmed worms, dead or sacrificed worms, or two live worms. </item>
      <item>“Forgives” signifies different things to different people, including something like “accepts as true” and “accepts as good.” In the case of the latter, some translate “good” as “beneficial to the greater good” and others as “beneficial to
        oneself.” </item>
      <item>“Plow” or the act of plowing becomes a metaphor for a wide range of things, including a psychological challenge to an individual’s sense of self, a sharp tool of agricultural cultivation, anything that causes individual suffering or pain,
        the activity of subsistence living, the activity of cultural or national transformation/improvement, a powerful force heedless to anything other than itself, the course of history, the course of nature, and workplace cutbacks. </item>
      <item>Some people cite the proverb as if its wisdom is directed to a potential cut worm, whereas others cite it as if its wisdom is for a potential plow or plow-wielder. </item>
      <item>Depending on context, the proverb-citer may be asking her hearer to accept (or, alternatively, to lament others’ acceptance of) a plow that has already come through, to encourage an approach to future plowing that could or inevitably will
      happen, or actually to engage in plowing.</item></list></div>
