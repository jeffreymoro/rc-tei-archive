            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount"> The present volume intervenes in the notion that pedagogy is of a
          secondary concern to Blake scholars by showing how William Blake’s work can invigorate the
          classroom. Contributors use Blake’s inspiration to create new teaching methodologies,
          propose new assignments, engage new public audiences, and critically explore the emergence
          of new technological modalities. Famously difficult, Blake nevertheless constructs crucial
          dialogues in fields from the digital humanities to manuscript history and affect theory.
          This volume shows how teachers can take advantage of his holistic approach to pedagogy—his
          insistence that teaching is entangled with every part of our lives—to contest standard
          approaches to Blake in the literature classroom.</p>

               <p>In his resplendent though often overlooked watercolour <title level="m">Age Teaching
            Youth </title>(ca. 1785-1790), William Blake crafts a complex visual meditation
          concerning the nature and function of teaching and learning (Figure 1). The scenes of
          pedagogy depicted in this image articulate Blake’s brilliant entanglement of a range of
          topics and concepts that, during the period, become critical for his work: experience and
          innocence, childhood and adulthood, authority and subordination, human society and the
          natural world. The drawing prompts its viewers to ponder one of Blake’s most fundamental
          questions concerning education: where, in what, or in whom does the power and right of
          pedagogical authorization rest? And the image does so by guiding its viewers through a
          range of much more subtle and nuanced queries. The sage, with his open book, looks like
          the teacher. Yet, the student who responds to its leaves by pointing to nature and the
          firmament beyond explicitly recalls the position of one of the most famous teachers of
          Western history: Plato’s gesture to the heavens from Raphael’s fresco <title level="m">The
            School of Athens</title> (1509-1511). Meanwhile, the youth who wears the luminous
          flower-print dress in the foreground seems to ignore this scene of instruction entirely
          while intently studying his own book. The obscured left hand might suggest that this youth
          is drawing in a pose similar to what Blake would later reserve for the inward posture of
          his colour print <title level="m">Newton</title> (1795), in which the natural philosopher
          is criticized for ignoring imagination by favoring an abstract nature found only within
          his own scientific representations. </p>
               <p>As with many of Blake’s works, <title level="m">Age Teaching Youth</title> transforms
          classical figures in order to pose questions about the interplay between reason and
          imagination. The expansive gesture of the Platonic student is interrupted by the
          comparatively darker colors and lines of the Newtonian student—perhaps suggesting that the
          visionary imagination is annihilated all too easily by the spectre of reason. The Platonic
          student and the sage almost look like ghosts. Neglected entirely by the Newtonian youth,
          they appear to fade into nothingness, as knowledge marches onward to modernity. If “Age”
          represents visionary expansiveness and the entanglement of knowledge, then the
          standardization and disciplining of learning found in the concentration of the modern
          Newtonian “Youth” suggests a knowledge that learns nothing, as it focuses only on what is
          in front of its own eyes.<note place="foot" resp="editors">“Entanglement” in this
            introduction resonates with Claire Colebrook’s comparison between Blake’s understanding
            of radical immanence as the intrusion of the infinite “into all aspects of existence,
            and its vortical opening from every aspect of the world,” on the one hand, and Gilles
            Deleuze’s mobilization of the <emph>virtual</emph> in his reversal of Platonism, on the
            other (76). “Rather than see the actual world as deriving from static forms,” Colebrook
            argues while interpreting Deleuze, “the actual world comes into being by contracting all
            the potential differential relations . . . The world we know and live in is composed of
            actual relations among differences, but it is possible to intuit the virtual
            differential forces from which actuality has been contracted” (xiv).</note>

               <p>The entangled composition of <title level="m">Age Teaching Youth</title> reflects Blake’s
          complex attitudes toward teaching. Blake’s life is filled with scenes of education. G. E.
          Bentley, Jr. argues in <title level="m">The Stranger from Paradise</title> (2001) that
          Blake “was clearly a natural teacher” and was probably far more “involved with teaching
          than we have any direct evidence for” (182, 185). Bentley, further, recalls several
          episodes illustrating that—as a teacher—Blake was more concerned with inspiration and
          compassion than technical skill. For instance, when George Richmond complains that he is
          experiencing difficulty in finding inspiration, Blake responds by turning to his wife: “It
          is just so with us, is it not, for weeks together, when the visions forsake us? What do we
          do then, Kate?” To which, Catherine Blake responds, “We kneel down and pray, Mr. Blake”
          (as cited by Bentley, 183). Another fascinating pedagogical episode from Bentley involves
          a young Samuel Palmer, who, upon first meeting Blake, is struck by his fixed “grey eyes”
          as well as a question that Blake asks the young artist: “Do you work with fear and
          trembling?” Palmer responds that he does, and Blake remarks: “Then . . . you’ll do”
          (ibid., 183). Finally, Bentley presents a short piece by Frederick Tatham recounting two
          scenes that reveal the role of social class in Blake’s pedagogy. The first involves a
          “sickly” young man who “passed [Blake’s] House daily” and “looked interesting &amp; eager”
          (ibid., 183). Blake begins to teach the young man, but his pupil quickly falls ill. In
          response, Blake and his wife “never omitted visiting him daily &amp; administering
          medicine, money, or Wine &amp; every other requisite until death relieved their adopted of
          all earthly care &amp; pain” (ibid., 184). In the second scene, Tatham recalls a story by
          Catherine Blake during the years that Blake taught drawing to “some families of high
          rank.” Such employment, Tatham continues, was not very profitable <quote>for after his
            lesson he got into conversation with his pupils, &amp; was found so entertaining &amp;
            pleasant, possessing such novel thoughts &amp; such eccentric notions, together with
            such jocose hilarity &amp; amiable demeanour, that he frequently found himself asked to
            stay [to] dinner . . . Thus he stopped whole days from his work at home . . . (ibid.,
            184)</quote> As Tatham’s story goes, Blake was subsequently “recommended &amp; nearly
          obtained an Appointment to teach Drawing to the Royal Family,” but, of course, this
          shocked rather than delighted Blake, who quickly became worried that “he would have been
          expected to have lived in comparative respectability, not to say splendour, a mode of
          life, as he thought, derogatory to the simplicity of his designs &amp; deportment” (ibid.,
          184, 185). As such, Blake is said to have rejected the offer, ended his appointments with
          his other students, and decided to get by on other sources of income. These anecdotes
          really only give us a glimpse of the kind of teacher that Blake might have been, but they
          also reveal a generous but eccentric mentor dedicated to transforming his students and
          making their lives better, not merely giving them marketable skills. </p>
               <p> Blake’s approach to education stresses the entangled, holistic scene of teaching against
          the emergent standardizing logic of nineteenth-century industrial capitalism, with its
          tendency to devalue formerly-profitable artisanal trades that were becoming increasingly
          mechanized in factories. As Saree Makdisi argues, Blake’s poetry is concerned with an
          historical moment when “more and more peoples around the world were being violently yoked
          together to serve the same system of production and exchange as . . . the nature,
          cultures, and lifeworlds of England were being altered beyond recognition” (318). The
          entanglement that Makdisi identifies in Blake’s work reaches into our own time, with the
          ecological and political crises that Blake resists resonating with our own struggles and
          questioning of the tidy periods we ascribe to such work in historical criticism. Studying
          Blake’s refusal of the standardizing logic of capitalist production can inspire us to
          reject the various ways that the contemporary university “Flog[s] [its members] into
          following the Style of a Fool”: from the encroachment of market-logic into our
          universities to the violence done to our students in the guise of standardized testing and
          the exploitation and even starvation of adjunct labor. We believe that passionate
          pedagogical reflection doesn’t end with the classroom and instead follow Blake’s example
          by proposing that it is entangled with every part of our lives. Blake reminds us that any
          pedagogical stance is political and must therefore come to grips with what Henry Giroux
          has called “critical pedagogy.” For Giroux, critical pedagogy is concerned with “helping
          students to ‘read’ the world critically” rather than “helping students to ‘master’ the
          tools of reading” (2). It also requires that teachers be as active as students in “the
          pursuit of truth and social change,” meaning that our role as teachers is irreducibly
          connected to our roles as scholars, advocates, and democratic citizens (198).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The scholarship on critical pedagogy is much too vast to
            review here adequately. For a more comprehensive introduction, see the online reading
            list that Martin Ryder maintains at the University of Colorado at Denver. To be clear,
            our account of Blake’s pedagogy and critical pedagogy does not mean that we do not feel
            that the humanities have a duty to make graduates employable. But we also recognize that
            our pedagogical role does not end with employability.</note>

               <p>The present volume intervenes in the notion that pedagogy is of a secondary concern to
          Blake scholars and reveals that this attitude would be anathema to Blake. Aside from the
          transformative work of Robert Gleckner, Mark Greenberg, David Gross, and Thomas Pfau, few
          have explored Blake’s art and poetry in the context of pedagogy.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See, for example, Robert F. Gleckner and Mark L. Greenberg’s <title level="m">Approaches to Teaching Blake’s </title>Songs of Innocence and of Experience
            (1989); Robert F. Gleckner and Thomas Pfau’s <title level="m">Lessons of Romanticism: A
              Critical Companion </title>(1998); and David Gross’ “Infinite Indignation: Teaching,
            Dialectical Vision, and Blake’s <title level="m">Marriage of Heaven and Hell</title>.”
            For more recent work in this area, see Roger Whitson and Jason Whittaker’s chapter

              Social Media</title> (2013) as well as Daniel Cook’s in-progress edited collection
              <title level="m">Teaching Romanticism VI: William Blake</title>, which presents brief
            observations from Richard C. Sha, Małgorzata Łuczyńska-Hołdys, and Stephen Behrendt.
          </note> Even Bentley reveals an attitude toward pedagogy that we find all too prevalent in
          literary studies today when he argues that “teaching is only art at second hand” (185).
          Few publications or other resources on teaching Romantic-period literature exist, nor are
          there many publishing venues for scholars interested in sharing pedagogical research.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title level="m">Romantic Circles Pedagogy Commons</title>,
            edited by Kate Singer, is central here, as is the 2010-2011 run of <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title>’ <title level="m">Teaching Romanticism Blog </title>with
            contributions by Deidre Lynch, Erik Simpson, Eric Eisner, Katherine D. Harris, Patricia
            A. Matthew, Roger Whitson, Crystal B. Lake, Scott Haegle, and Lindsey Eckert. Other
            journals dedicated to literature pedagogy include both <title level="j">Pedagogy
            </title>and <title level="j">The Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy</title>.
            For helpful relevant essays from these sources, see especially Harriet Kramer Linkin’s
            “How It Is: Teaching Women’s Poetry in British Romanticism Classes”; David T. Coad,
            Kelly Curtis, Jonathan Cook, and Katherine D. Harris’ “BeardStair: A Student-Run Digital
            Humanities Project History, Fall 2011 to May 16, 2013”; and Kimon Keramidas, Amanda
            Licastro, and Roger Whitson’s “Digital Literary Pedagogy: An Experiment in
            Process-Oriented Publishing.”</note> At best, teaching is presently most often seen in
          an analogous manner to how Brett Hirsch views pedagogy in the digital humanities, as an
          “afterthought, tacked-on to a statement . . . after the word ‘research’ (or its synonyms),
          often in parentheses” (5). The general absence of scholarship in this area is particularly
          perplexing when it comes to Blake given how difficult it is to teach his work in college
          courses, as we and a number of our contributors confess. In order to address this and
          related pedagogical issues, we have solicited and gathered together a range of essays that
          tackle the most pressing common questions and concerns that both groups and individuals
          now face when working to understand and discuss Blake’s art and poetry. </p>
               <p>Inspired by our contributors’ essays, we have organized the introduction to this
          collection around a cluster of topics that enable explorations of Blake’s work in a
          variety of contexts. We focus on a range of common pedagogical matters:
            <emph>methodologies</emph> (Geraldine Friedman and Mark Lussier); <emph>audiences</emph>
          (Paige Morgan); <emph>modalities</emph> (Jason Whittaker); and <emph>assignments</emph>
          (Mike Goode and R. Paul Yoder). These clusters are critical for the investigation of
          almost any literary-historical figure or period but are particularly relevant to
          engagement with the multimodal complexities of Blake’s work. While each of the six essays
          addresses all four of the categories, individual contributions focus and elaborate
          primarily upon one of them. Additionally, we mobilize these topics with the intention of
          furthering Kate Singer’s provocation from the first post of <title level="m">Romantic
            Circles</title>’ pioneering <title level="m">Teaching Romanticism Blog</title>. “[W]hat
          happens when,” Singer asks, “even momentarily, we envision our praxis, our ideas, and our
          literary theories through the lens of pedagogy? Does pedagogy need to have a greater or
          different role in our thinking, and if so how?” We intend to use this issue of <title level="m">Romantic Circles Pedagogy Commons</title> to demonstrate the various
          possibilities of a Blake Studies invigorated by a greater attention to pedagogy—as well as
          to say, unequivocally, <emph>yes</emph>: pedagogical scholarship is vitally important to
          the future of our field. </p>

                  <head>Methodologies</head>
                  <p> Given the natural limitations of the essay format, the contributions to this volume
            are best understood not as comprehensive statements but, instead, as intellectual and
            pedagogical interventions issued to stimulate new conversations about how to teach and
            discuss Blake’s work. As such, articles in this collection responding most directly to
            issues of methodology consider how different approaches to exploring Blake’s complex
            work can provide students with tools for wrestling with the daunting nature of his art
            and poetry. What diverse approaches, interpretive and explanatory grids, or critical,
            historical, and theoretical lenses do we primarily adopt (both successfully and
            unsuccessfully) when we set out to teach Blake’s poetry and art? </p>
                  <p>As a self-described non-expert of Blake’s work, Geraldine Friedman describes
            “developing a pedagogy of non-mastery”—one in which she uses her “limitations as the
            basis of a pedagogical methodology rather than seeing them as something simply to be
            overcome” (par.
              2). Turning to the work of Silvan Tomkins and Baruch Spinoza, Friedman relies
            upon the affective movement in recent scholarship in order to foreground personal
            stories of affective responses to Blake that serve as entrées into a pedagogical
            methodology for conveying the profound difficulties that both faculty and students
            experience when approaching his art and poetry for the first time. There is much to be
            said about why students often react so strongly to Blake’s work, and this type of
            affective response is something that Karen Swann and others have noted as well in recent
              years.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Karen Swann’s essay “Teaching <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>” for more on her approaches to teaching the illuminated
              books. Geraldine Friedman attended Swann’s workshop with us on “Learning to Teach by
              Teaching <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>” at the 2013 meeting of the North American
              Society for the Study of Romanticism in Boston. Swann’s presentation and the essay
              that has since emerged from it have been centrally motivating factors behind the
              present volume, precisely because of the types of stimulating questions and
              conversations that Swann’s lecture and discussion launched concerning Blake and
              pedagogy during and after the NASSR conference. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Friedman explores some of Blake’s most celebrated works: “All Religions Are One” (comp.
            ca. 1798), “There is No Natural Religion” (comp. ca. 1788) and especially <title level="m">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell </title>(1790) and <title level="m">Milton</title> (comp. ca. 1804-1811). She explores these texts in order to create
            what, drawing from the language of <title level="m">The Marriage</title>, she calls the
            “improvement of sensual enjoyment” (Erdman 39). She finds this enjoyment enhanced by
            directing student attention to <title level="m">The William Blake Archive</title>,
            which, as she notes, provides rich digital editions of Blake’s plates when compared to
            letterpress versions or even printed editions of his work. Friedman explains that the
              <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>’s textual transcriptions and magnification
            functions add to a readerly experience of “sensual enjoyment.” These and related
            functions of the website help to immerse students in the poetry and art as they zoom in
            and out, for instance, and are able to appreciate Blake’s plates more intimately—thus
            breaking inside-outside distinctions or at least blurring them further. Friedman’s
            analyses of <title level="m">The Marriage</title> are among this collection’s most
            developed and nuanced—enabling textual and pictorial close readings. She prompts readers
            to consider why faculty and students alike often seek to read at a distance from rather
            than inside the Blakean text, and her close readings actively immerse readers of the
            essay back into the poetry and art as her affective theory of pedagogical response is
            itself generated out of these close readings of Blakean text and pictorial image. </p>
                  <p> Furthermore, as Friedman envisions what she plans to do differently in future courses
            focusing on Blake, she enacts her essay’s affective theory at the level of its own form
            and content. Readers will quickly recognize Friedman’s wonderful sense of humor, which
            is both refreshing and enlivening and which productively fosters new affective
            approaches to teaching Blake’s work. Teachers need to strive to foster pedagogical
            methodologies that introduce honesty about our own affective responses to Blake’s
            complex art and poetry. This type of approach to Blake is one that took some time for
            Friedman to arrive at and accept during her teaching career, but now that she has paved
            the way, other faculty need not suffer or struggle in precisely these same ways and can
            instead choose to adopt similar pedagogical methodologies of “non-mastery.” </p>
                  <p>Mark Lussier’s contribution at first appears as if it is the least concerned with
            giving teachers practical tools for addressing Blake in the classroom. Yet his piece is
            also a powerful exemplification of what a Blakean approach to teaching might look like
            in literary studies. Lussier intricately deconstructs Blake’s form of mirror writing as
            a pedagogical method designed to induce what Alain Badiou has called “infinite thought.”
            Badiou associates infinite thought explicitly with the transfinite calculus of Georg
            Cantor and argues that such thinking can only occur with mathematics. Lussier shows how
            the <foreign>mise-en-abyme</foreign> of Blake’s mirror writing proves that such thought
            can be found within illuminated poetry as well because it forces readers “to open the
            doors of perception” (par. 4) by fusing “the psychological and textual within the meta-textual zone
            of the pedagogical in the service of cultivating salvific forms of self-annihilation”
              (par. 5). For
            Lussier, Blake’s difficulty is the central point for studying him because Blake
              <emph>directly</emph> works against the sense of separation and individuation that is
            a product of Jacques Lacan’s mirror stage. Blake’s mirror shatters Lacan’s mirror. </p>
                  <p> In the afterword of <title level="m">Romantic Dharma: The Emergence of Buddhism into
              Nineteenth-Century Europe </title>(2011), Lussier rejects what he calls the Western
            pedagogy of compulsion, and its obsession with defining achievement by appealing to
            external rewards, for the more compassionate approach to teaching signified in Buddhist
            practice. Lussier’s pedagogy of compassion “establishes and encourages discovery
            grounded in the present moment of a student’s engagement with the material at hand and
            the personal growth that results when a student makes the material his or her own”
            (185). Lussier develops confidence among his students by emphasizing a gradual growth of
            knowledge, a familiarity with the ethics associated with that knowledge, and a wisdom
            derived from having to give things up and leave them behind. Lussier sees Blake’s
            invocation of self-annihilation as a pedagogical tool with a primary outcome: the
            transformation of the student has to be self-directed because only the individual can
            choose to enact this subjective activity. </p>
                  <p>Lussier’s piece for this collection acts as a textual enactment of his compassionate
            pedagogy. He focuses on how the notion of a personal reception of Blake’s work is
            annihilated by the inter-operational textual dynamics of the illuminated books. The
            Blakean scene of pedagogy is one of profound <emph>unlearning</emph>, as one
            interpretation after another is subjected to a powerful machine of contradictory
            viewpoints and images destroying one subjective perception after another. “The mirrored
            text provides <emph>structure</emph>,” Lussier argues, “[and] pursues transformative
            reception dynamics in an attempt to create a communitarian model capable of addressing
            all readers without tyrannizing any of them” (par. 14). The
            double movement of Blakean pedagogy is crucial yet also unendingly complex and thorny.
            By pointing out these structures and dynamics, Lussier argues that teachers seeking to
            make Blake more palatable miss the point of his transformational challenge.
            Self-annihilation is difficult, but the pursuit of wisdom, compassion, and democratic
            community are well worth the effort. In other words, if Friedman’s piece gives a
            methodological approach to understand the ways in which students and teachers avoid
            immersion in Blake’s text, Lussier shows the benefits of facing the Blakean abyss head
            on. </p>

                  <head>Audiences</head>
                  <p>When considering our audiences as teachers, Friedman and Lussier show us that different
            students have very different needs when encountering Blake’s work. Paige Morgan’s
            contribution to this volume dramatically expands upon issues concerning audience and
            reception in the context of Blake’s various projects. Morgan’s work does so by revealing
            that ostensibly straightforward questions concerning student audiences or
            faculty-student pedagogical dialectics quickly snowball into many more complex
            inquiries: with whom do we talk about Blake when we talk about Blake? </p>
                  <p>As Friedman notes, graduate students are much more heavily invested in feeling the need
            to master Blake’s work, as we often are as faculty members, but this phenomenon quickly
            becomes meaningfully different from the challenges (as well as the novel opportunities)
            that open up when discussing Blake outside the academy. The Blake Society is a British
            non-profit charity organization that, as Morgan explains, is devoted to “working towards
            greater recognition of Blake” but that, unlike the academy, does not have “a specific
            argument or narrative about Blake that [they] are trying to advance” (par. 14). Instead,
            founded and organized upon principles more closely related to Michael Warner’s concept
            of the “counterpublic” or Michel Foucault’s notion of “heterotopic space” (Morgan par. 24),
            the Blake Society’s ultimate goal is to create multiple publics who are free to engage
            and experiment with Blake’s works and their various traditions. Morgan’s essay questions
            what “pedagogy” means beyond the Ivory Tower while showing the complications of a group
            of Blake enthusiasts who radically question the role of teaching when no one believes in
            the pedagogical authority that too many academics take for granted.</p>
                  <p>Like many of our contributors, Morgan begins with a story of personal engagements with
            Blake’s art and poetry. She narrates these experiences through a trajectory that links
            her work as a student to her career as a teaching faculty member and an Executive
            Committee Member and Trustee of the Blake Society. Morgan’s story underscores
            experiences familiar to us and to many of our students. A series of formal engagements
            revealed to her the need to foster in her own students an escape from the “mind-forg’d
            manacles” that oftentimes come hand-in-hand with the academy’s burdensome practices (as
            cited by Morgan par.
              5). It is Morgan’s hope that students might break free from those restrictive
            institutional settings in favor of experiences with Blake far afield from the college
            campus through opportunities like those offered by the Blake Society. Morgan’s essay,
            further, describes the type of labor involved in a non-profit charity organization that
            actively runs on little funding and the types of events that it nonetheless achieves
            despite apparent financial limitations. Blake Society events are often shockingly
            antinomian in nature, as in Morgan’s example of a society occasion in which
            disadvantaged British school children were brought together at the London Zoo to recite
            Blake’s “The Tyger” to actual tigers living in captivity. Such an example reveals the
            crux of Morgan’s essay and its major intervention in this volume, as it exposes just how
            important it is to stress that academics cannot lay an exclusive claim to understanding,
            appreciating, or engaging with Blake’s poetry and art. </p>

              as the “performative” aspect of such work. </note> How do we use these different
            modalities to allow students to encounter Blake in a transformative manner? </p>
                  <p>Jason Whittaker opens his essay with a description of the contemporary publishing scene
            of digital books, expectations about reading habits in the college classroom, and his
            own general preference for e-books over traditional print modalities. The result of the
            present move to e-books signals, for Whittaker, that “we have arrived at a crucial stage
            in the use of Blake in the classroom, where mobile electronic devices will soon be
            ubiquitous” (par.
              2). Whittaker’s anecdotes about the reading habits of his students, who
            increasingly turn up to class with e-readers instead of traditional books, might signal
            that we are quickly arriving at the usage of these types of e-readers and other
            technologies in pedagogical situations as the norm rather than as the exception.
            However, many students might now be using e-books, but many others still do not—either
            because they cannot afford them or because they still prefer print books. A further
            complication is the fact that tablets and mobile devices make it more likely that such
            technologies will not be provided by universities or colleges but, instead, will need to
            be purchased by students and their parents for use in the classroom. Noting the economic
            inequalities of this rapidly complexifying pedagogical situation, Whittaker employs his
            narratives concerning personal reading habits, teaching, and learning in order to take
            up an “issue of digital pedagogy that is especially pertinent to Blake studies: what is
            it that students are actually reading and what role will e-books have in education in
            contrast to traditional print formats?” (par. 2). Blake
            is especially pertinent here in raising these questions concerning traditional versus
            e-book modalities because the plates of his illuminated manuscripts continuously force
            us to confront the nature and function of reading practices. </p>
                  <p>Whittaker’s goal in raising questions about teaching Blake’s composite art through new
            electronic devices does not mean a discarding of print in the classroom, as there will
            continue to be a place for David Erdman’s edition, for example.<note place="foot" resp="editors">One of the many reasons why the Erdman edition remains indispensable
              for contemporary Blake scholars is the fact that the Erdman estate keeps his
              scholarship perpetually in the public domain. Both Nelson Hilton’s <title level="m">Blake Digital Text Project</title> and the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>
              maintain easily-searchable digital copies of the Erdman edition on their sites. The
              former also has a concordance that interfaces with their online Erdman edition.
            </note> The role of Blake’s work in relation to print has been questioned for several
            decades now by scholars precisely because Blake hoped that illuminated printing would
            become a new media platform that would make obsolete his need for letterpress printing
            methods. Blake’s process is inherently antithetical to letterpress printing methods, and
            this is why Blake’s art and poetry have been taken up so often in early digital
            engagements with his work. Whittaker argues for an analogue approach to Blake, seeing
            the material originality of the illuminated prints as crucial for understanding
            them—even despite the fact that most students and scholars of Blake never see these
            original prints. </p>
                  <p> In the 1990s and early years of the twenty-first century, the primary platform for
            experiencing digital textuality was the screen of a desktop or laptop computer. For this
            reason, it is clear why print formats would be preferred for most readers and teachers
            of the period. Hardware and software technologies have, in the interim decade, increased
            the ubiquity of e-readers, creating a watershed moment that rivals the invention of the
            PC or the development of the Web. This change radically challenges the traditional
            teaching of literature. Further, the scholarly temptations to idealize certain digital
            projects like the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title> for use in college classrooms
            can be problematic when they obscure the fact that there are whole sets of academic and
            institutional speeds associated with these now-aging modalities.<note place="foot" resp="editors">N. Katherine Hayles’ consideration of the <title level="m">Blake
                Archive</title> in “Translating Media: Why We Should Rethink Textuality” is
              important here too, as she explores the material difference between the bits of the
              archive and the print materiality of Blake’s plates and paper. It might also be worth
              discussing the place of a program like Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in this
              discussion. OCR takes a digital image and then uses probabilistic logic to match that
              image with the closest machine-readable character. One of the problems mentioned by
              the Santa Cruz Reading Group in their 1984 review of the Erdman edition is the
              difference between printed typography and Blake’s etched letters. When we confront a
              character deemed similar by an OCR algorithm, we see a further layer of separation
              between Blake’s original material prints, their pixelated simulation in digital
              images, and the machine-readable algorithmic output of OCR. </note> Whittaker’s
            research implies that academic archival projects may have a responsibility to deliver
            apps for mobile devices while also exploring how such devices might change the ways
            Blake is taught in the classroom. </p>

                  <head>Assignments</head>
                  <p>R. Paul Yoder’s and Mike Goode’s respective essays represent the pithy, provocative,
            and playful types of contributions that we requested from our contributors and reflect
            on assigning Blake’s work in a variety of contexts. In undergraduate institutions
            focused largely on discussion-based classrooms, the most often taught texts are <title level="m">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</title> (1794), <title level="m">The
              Marriage</title>, the so-called “Lambeth Books” (e.g., <title level="m">The Book of
              Los </title>[1795] and <title level="m">The [First] Book of Urizen</title> [1794]), as
            well as the Continental prophecies, and especially <title level="m">America a Prophecy
            </title>(1793) and <title level="m">Europe a Prophecy </title>(1794). In fact, faculty
            are not likely to move beyond these books in introductory survey courses in Romanticism.
            Yoder notes that <title level="m">Songs </title>is almost certainly Blake’s most often
            taught work but adds that, because so many different copies of that work exist, there
            are a range of difficulties in teaching the text in college classrooms. Bentley lists
            thirty-four different total orderings of the plates of <title level="m">Innocence</title> and the combined <title level="m">Songs</title>, and Yoder explains
            that faculty almost always assign only one of the orderings, focus on a letterpress
            edition of the <title level="m">Songs</title>, or use the <title level="m">Blake
              Archive</title> to show the variety of plates as they teach or have students complete
            readings (Yoder par.
              1). Drawing upon Neil Fraistat’s argument concerning poetic sequencing from
              <title level="m">The Poem and the Book </title>(1985), Yoder focuses especially on the
            notion of “contexture,” which, he explains, “results from the poets’ deliberate
            sequencing of poems in Romantic poetry collections” (par. 3). Yoder’s
            pedagogical investigation of the <title level="m">Songs </title>complicates Fraistat’s
            approach, as each different copy has its own contexture that shifts (often
            significantly) from copy to copy across, for instance, the thirteen different
            contextures presently offered by the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See R. Paul Yoder’s essay “What Happens When: Narrative
              and the Changing Sequence of Plates in Blake’s <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>,
              Chapter 2” for more information about his theory of narrative sequencing in Blake’s
              work. </note> To make matters even more complicated, later owners of individual copies
            of the <title level="m">Songs</title> would oftentimes reorder their particular copies,
            as Yoder points out. </p>
                  <p>To illustrate these issues to students, Yoder envisions a new type of class focusing
            entirely on the <title level="m">Songs</title>. Such a course would ultimately ask a
            student or group to be assigned a particular contextural sequence from the <title level="m">Songs</title> and to become the authority of their copy during the rest of
            the term. For Yoder, this type of assignment would come closest in the classroom to
            experiencing the <title level="m">Songs</title> in their totality. Blake’s approach to
            creating the <title level="m">Songs </title>is one in which, as Yoder notes, a certain
            level of <emph>play</emph> is built into the design process. Teachers and students alike
            must embrace play in order to experience the basic nature and function of this work.
            Such pedagogical approaches to assignments explore the difference between active and
            passive forms of engagement with Blake’s texts. </p>
                  <p>Goode’s essay also embraces <emph>play</emph> with Blake’s work, as it relies upon
            hyperlinking to a variety of resources across the Web as well as to Goode’s own teaching
            documents. Goode is interested in helping students to understand how W. J. T. Mitchell’s
            notion of Blake’s “composite art” decomposes as the Web engages with Blake’s original
            poetry, painting, and printmaking.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See W. J. T.
              Mitchell’s <title level="m">Blake’s Composite Art: A Study of the Illuminated
                Poetry</title> (1978) in which he argues that Blake wanted “to create unity out of
              contrariety rather than similitude or complementarity” (33). </note> The title of
            Goode’s essay, “Google Blake,” reveals this author’s commitments to thinking through
            innovative assignments involving Blake’s poetry and art, as it could be taken as a
            descriptive title or an imperative one. The Web tends to fragment Blake’s composite art
            into so many textual and pictorial pieces, “atomic artistic particles much smaller than
            the unit of the book, poem, plate, or picture” (par. 1). Goode’s
            essay critiques the reliance of so many scholars on Mitchell’s belief about the
            composite nature of Blake’s art. Instead of bemoaning the digital atomization of Blake’s
            work, Goode sees it as providing a tremendous pedagogical opportunity. </p>
                  <p>Building upon his 2006 <title level="j">PMLA </title>article “Blakespotting,” Goode’s
            introductory web-browsing assignment involving viral media and its accompanying research
            project ask students to track the propagation of a given proverb from Blake’s <title level="m">The Marriage</title> across the Web.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Also
              see Mike Goode’s article “The Joy of Looking: What Blake’s Pictures Want” for more of
              his scholarship regarding the “delinquent tendency on the part of Blake’s ‘composite
              art’ to de-compose itself whenever and wherever it finds an audience” (5). </note> The
            only major prerequisite in his simple and elegantly designed assignment is a device with
            Internet access. In the first stage, “Searching for Blake’s Hellish Wisdom,” a major
            goal is for students to build archives of evidence in order to spur classroom discussion
            concerning the nature and function of the proverb form and Blake’s proverbs in
            particular. Goode’s follow-up project, “Re-searching for Blake’s Hellish Wisdom,” is
            geared for advanced undergraduates or graduate students and requires students to build
            upon and further develop academic research skills. Goode’s projects might be especially
            helpful for non-experts of Blake’s work or for new faculty only beginning to teach
            Blake’s poetry and art. That said, even veteran academics would do well to have their
            students engage with these assignments—especially since they open up new understandings
            and appreciations of the instabilities of Blakean poetical and pictorial texts. Goode’s
            assignments are highly structured all the way down to their clearly demarcated tables,
            which are readily adaptable to a variety of formats. </p>
                  <p>We see Goode’s piece as perhaps our volume’s best example of how pedagogical reflection
            can transform scholarly practice. Goode sees pedagogical and critical value in “the
            rhizomatic realm of Wikipedia, which tempts your indiscriminate wandering” for enabling
            an encounter with Blakean transformative experiences (par. 1).
            Accordingly, the projects that he offers have the potential for producing a feedback
            effect in which students as well as professional scholars who had previously been
            convinced of Mitchell’s composite art might start to consider the viral capabilities of
            Blake’s artworks. </p>

                  <head>Conclusion: Blakean Pedagogy </head>
                  <p> In very different ways, the authors of this volume intervene in contemporary education
            by applying what we call <emph>Blakean pedagogy</emph>: a style of teaching that has the
            potential to change both students and teachers. Blakean pedagogy encourages visionary
            experience, entangled knowledge, and a belief that learning is part of our lives as
            citizens. Respectively, Blakean pedagogy rejects calculated technique, discrete
            disciplinary knowledge, and the assumption that education exists only to develop
            specific, marketable skills. In the spirit of our contributors, who explore how these
            profound experiences appear in some of the least expected places, we have chosen to
            conclude this introduction by relating our own transformative scenes of Blakean
            pedagogy. </p>
                  <ab rend="center">***</ab>
                  <p rend="noCount">
                     <hi rend="bold">Roger:</hi> I love to teach Blake because he frightens
            me. I never know where the conversation is going to go. I have no idea what students
            will think as they walk out of the classroom with Blake’s visions of body-horror and
            hellfire burning in their heads. One of the best evaluations I ever received from a
            student appeared on RateMyProfessors.com and was associated with a class on Blake: “I’m
            not sure if I learned anything, but he sure boggled my mind a bit.” The worst response
            came from a graduate student who, evidently, didn’t realize that I was a Blake scholar.
            “I don’t get why anyone would write about this guy,” she said off-handedly during our
            discussion, “he’s too strange.” Robert Early, my colleague and fellow Blakean at Saint
            Louis University (SLU), first showed me the unpredictable pedagogical potential of
              <title level="m">Urizen</title> during a session he led in my Spring 2002
            “Introduction to Poetry” class. The class was designed to allow students to understand
            the fundamentals of poetic expression. I adopted Helen Vendler’s <title level="m">Poems,
              Poets, Poetry</title> (1997), a book that I had studied during my undergraduate years,
            along with the Dover edition of Blake’s <title level="m">Urizen</title> and T. S.
            Eliot’s <title level="m">Four Quartets</title> (1943). As Bob entered my classroom, I
            was skeptical. I’d been a big fan of Eliot’s work and was eager to outline the
            musicality of his verse. I wanted the Blake session to finish before it began. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">Bob asked the class to sit in a circle. I sat directly in front of the
            crucifix hung in a prominent place in every classroom at SLU. I tried to make a few
            jokes to start the class, but I looked at Bob and realized that he wasn’t in the mood
            for levity. There was a strange fire burning in his eyes as I introduced him. He was
            clearly somewhere else. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">“So, let’s take a look at the preludium, shall we?” Bob began his lesson
            somewhat abruptly, but the students looked eager to begin. “Blake is such an individual
            thinker. He’s not like most of the people you’ll read in this class.” My brain wandered
            to Eliot’s essay on Blake, in which the modernist poet praises Blake for the
            “naked[ness]” of his vision but is ultimately condescending with regards to his lack of
            poetic education and calls Blake’s work formless (90, 91). “[T]he weakness of the long
            poems is certainly not that they are too visionary, too remote from the world,” Eliot
            contends, “It is that Blake did not see enough, became too much occupied with ideas”
            (91). </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">Then Bob’s voice started booming. “Lo, a shadow of horror is risen / In
            Eternity!” (70). The students looked blank-eyed and remained completely silent. “Who is
            this shadow?” A hand slowly and (I could tell) nervously raised. “Yes?” </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">“Urizen?” </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">Bob looked pleased but also disappointed. “Yes, but who is Urizen? The
            shadow of horror? And who says this?” </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">More silence. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">“Eternals?” The meekness of the students was in a harsh contrast to
            Bob’s otherworldly enthusiasm. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">Still more silence.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">“Well, the poem says, ‘Some said / ‘It is Urizen’ but then the poem says
            that the shadow is unknown” (70). </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">Bob’s eyes widened. “Yes! That’s right. Why?” </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">Silence.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">Silence.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">Silence. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">(This was the first time I had invited someone else as a guest speaker
            in my class. It was only my third semester teaching and my first literature class.
            During the previous year, I had remarked to someone that the most frightening thing to
            me about teaching wasn’t grading or lecturing. It was the knowledge that, if I stopped
            talking, the class would break down. Silence was entropy: eating away at the reality of
            my classroom and convincing the students that I had nothing real to contribute to their
            lives). </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">More silence. Bob was clearly more patient with silence than most
            people. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">“Could it be,” another student seemed to grow a bit with confidence,
            “that both Urizen and the eternals are brought into existence by naming each other?
            Meaning: their anxiety creates . . . um . . . themselves?” </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">“Yeah! Yeah! When does this happen?”</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">We sat there for quite a while pondering this question. It created a
            space in the middle of the classroom where time slowed down. The silence started
            becoming full and substantial, rather than entropic—almost, for a moment, a “universe of
            starry majesty” (109). Bob’s voice passed through the space like a ghost phasing through
            a wall: “isn’t it happening now?”</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">The class ended. I was fascinated by the fact that we spent an entire
            hour talking about three lines, that these three lines so clearly articulated my own
            anxieties about teaching literature, and that this anxiety took on a meta-textual
            resonance that lured the class into further reflection. What I feared the most, the
            silence of an empty classroom, became the very thing that was most valuable about Bob’s
            lesson. Blake had anticipated my own response and implicated me in the violence
            occurring in <title level="m">Urizen</title>. Such experiences, I learned, were common
            for teachers of Blake, and this sense of entanglement played a large part of my own
            transformation into a Blake scholar. </p>

                  <p rend="noCount">
                     <hi rend="bold">Andrew:</hi> On Halloween a few years ago—perhaps an
            auspicious coincidence—I had scheduled to teach my first rare-books event at Union so
            that my students, who had been very much struggling with Blake’s work (and especially
              <title level="m">The Marriage</title>), could investigate his poetry and art in the
            context of the Trianon Press facsimile editions. My emeritus colleague, mentor, and
            friend, Jim McCord, who had recently retired from the very tenure line that I had just
            taken up, kindly took me under his wing and showed me the obvious treasures as well as
            wonderful secrets of our Romantic rare-book materials. Because our institution was
            founded during the age of Romanticism in 1795, as I love to remind my students, we have
            a lot of incredible late-eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century materials among our
            rare-books collection and especially for a small liberal arts college. Jim helped me to
            pull a remarkable set of books to share with my small, advanced-level Romantics seminar:
            the beautiful Trianon versions of <title level="m">The Marriage</title>, <title level="m">America</title>, <title level="m">Europe</title>, <title level="m">The Book
              of Los</title>, <title level="m">The Book of Urizen</title>, and the <title level="m">Songs</title>. We placed these books around a long rectangular table at our rare
            books library and intercalated them with a number of exceedingly rare Romantic-age
            materials. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">I should stress that this was my first term teaching at Union, and I was
            petrified to be leading undergraduates through our rare books room and particularly with
            my colleagues from the English department and library joining us that day. Perhaps in
            order to deal with these fears, I decided to over-prepare for that afternoon by also
            bringing in my laptop, a projector, and a drop-down screen to display Blake’s “Proverbs
            of Hell” from an edition of <title level="m">The Marriage </title>available at the
              <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>. I had hoped to remind my students to seek out
            the proverbs as they carefully leafed through the Trianon facsimile. As my students
            moved cautiously around the dimly-lit table, they gradually gained confidence in
            engaging with the pillowed books in front of them—slowly picking them up, cradling their
            spines, and opening the Blake facsimiles to reveal their stunning illuminated plates. As
            they did so the room suddenly went absolutely silent, almost as if we had entered a
            museum or cathedral instead of a rare books library. For half an hour these young men
            and women, one of the most engaging and talkative groups of my career thus far, quietly
            peered into these materials, warily touching their delicate pages while variously gazing
            at and studying Blake’s plates and other materials with a level of hushed intensity that
            I had never witnessed before in my teaching. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">And then that day’s most interesting moment happened: one of my
            particularly precocious students stopped to look at the projection of the <title level="m">Blake Archive </title>and apparently gravitated to one of Blake’s proverbs.
            I asked her what she was doing and gently prompted her to return to the rare books
            themselves, the class’ obvious focus of attention, or so I had hoped. But out of
            curiosity, I asked her which proverb she had been reading. “That one,” she said as she
            began to walk away, pointing to the grainy line’s image on the screen and reading aloud
            to me her unsurprising choice given the heavily formalized pedagogical scene of that
            day’s class, “In seed time learn, in harvest teach, in winter enjoy” (35). “What does
            that mean?,” she asked, “I read that one over a few times last night.” Other nearby
            students looked up from their materials, and within a few seconds everyone around the
            table was listening intently to what would be my reply. “Well, I’m not so sure,” I said,
            “What <emph>does</emph> this proverb mean? What do <emph>you</emph> make of it? And why
            did you pick this one? To be honest, it has never been one of my favorites.” For the
            next forty minutes, the remainder of our time together that afternoon, my students and I
            gathered around the humming projector and wobbly drop-down screen in a dark corner of
            the room to discuss as a group this and other of the proverbs from the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>’s digital edition. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount">At first I felt completely defeated, thinking to myself that we could
            have been anywhere instead of a rare books library to engage in this type of discussion.
            “We might as well be back in the classroom!,” my mind raced. But then it dawned upon me
            that all of my recent research concerning the “composite art” and the much-debated
            differences between the “textual” versus the “physical” versus the “digital” Blake were
            suddenly playing out around us in the room and right before our very eyes. We
              <emph>could</emph> have been just about anywhere in studying and discussing together
            this version of Blake—and that was precisely the point—because Blake’s art and poetry
            might certainly live in the rarefied spaces of libraries and museums, but it also lives
            in print and in readily accessible hardcopies and digital archives as well as far-flung
            online spaces. Blake lives in all of these places and spaces and many others besides.
            This is something that I certainly knew to be true in a scholarly sense but that I had
            never fully appreciated or experienced in a pedagogical way, and this scene of teaching
            and learning had brought the criticism and theory to life for me and, through me, for my
            students that afternoon at the rare books room. Indeed, I should have paid a lot more
            attention to my student’s chosen proverb a long time ago: “In seed time learn, in
            harvest teach, in winter enjoy.” </p>

               <p rend="noCount">The first part of this essay suggests ways to teach the varying versions
          of William Blake’s <title level="m">Songs of Innocence and of Experience </title>(1794) in
          order to highlight different types of interpretive coherence as well as Blake’s idea of
          what a book is.  The second part of the essay considers the implications of teaching the
            <title level="m">Songs</title> for what we might call a “Blakean pedagogy.”</p>

                  <p>
                     <title level="m">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</title> (1794) is almost certainly
            William Blake’s most commonly taught work. Teaching the <title level="m">Songs</title>
            is complicated by the fact that it exists in so many different forms. According to G. E.
            Bentley, Jr., “The plates of <title level="m">Innocence</title> and the combined <title level="m">Songs</title> were arranged in thirty-four distinct ways” (386). Inevitably
            we teach using one of the relatively cheap facsimile editions, or we make do with the
            letterpress poems in our anthology and supplement that with images online. This is where
            the fun starts because the best place to get the images for the <title level="m">Songs</title> is the online <ref target="http://www.blakearchive.org">William Blake
              Archive</ref>, where we currently find four different copies of the <title level="m">Songs of Innocence</title> (1789) and thirteen different copies of the combined
              <title level="m">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</title>. This does not give
            students access to all extant copies of the <title level="m">Songs</title>, but this is
            a pretty good sample, and the multiplicity itself makes a point to students about what
            Blake thought about the stability of a “finished” work. While any single copy of the
              <title level="m">Songs</title> obviously functions as an artistic unity, no copy can
            claim to be the “last word” on the <title level="m">Songs</title>. The ultimate version
            of Blake’s <title level="m">Songs</title> is the composite reading of as many copies as
            possible, and while we may not hope to do that, we can do other things. In the following
            pages of this essay, I want to suggest why and how we might read “all” the <title level="m">Songs</title> (more or less) in the classroom.</p>
                  <p> The multiplicity of the <title level="m">Songs</title> is commonly recognized as both
            a problem and an advantage to teaching them. In their introduction to the MLA <title level="m">Approaches to Teaching Blake’s <title level="m">Songs</title>
                     </title>
            (1989), Robert Gleckner and Mark Greenberg remark that “the <title level="m">Songs</title> poses the problem of what, for Blake, constitutes a ‘book,’ as distinct
            from a collection of poems or an anthology” (xiv). They note that “Even ‘complete’
            composite editions in color of one copy of the <title level="m">Songs</title> present
            but one state of a work that Blake altered in color, visual design, and arrangement each
            time he printed and painted it,” and they commiserate with the “instructor (constrained
            by the chosen edition of work) [who] thus fixes a text that was continually changing in
            its author’s hands” (xvi). Nonetheless, in the collection’s essay on “Teaching the
            Variations in <title level="m">Songs</title>,” Robert Essick extols “the rewards of a
            historical perspective on Blake’s composition, arrangement, and production of the <title level="m">Songs</title> over a period of more than thirty-five years” because “We lose
            our sense of the individual copy as an unchanging and completely authoritative icon as
            it is recontextualized back into its material and temporal origins and seen as only one
            of many versions” (93). The problem in 1989 was the severely limited access to the basis
            for that “historical perspective on Blake’s composition” in the designs themselves;
            indeed, the advice of John Grant and Mary Lynn Johnson in the MLA volume on the
            availability of reproductions for classroom use suggests a sort of Blakean underground
            market in which images are available to those who have the right connections or enough
            money.</p>
                  <p> The situation has changed since 1989. With the thirteen combined <title level="m">Songs</title> in the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title> and the Blake Trust
            edition of Copy W ([c. 1825] the “King’s College” copy), students now have ready access
            to fourteen different versions of the <title level="m">Songs of Innocence and of
              Experience</title>. Each copy is different, but some differences have a greater impact
            on our interpretation than others, and sequencing—the order of the poems in the
            collection—is especially important. I teach the combined <title level="m">Songs</title>
            in four different classes, including a threshold course for English majors, a Romantics
            survey, a seminar exclusively on Blake, and a course I’ve developed on the <title level="m">Songs</title> and <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (1798). In all
            these classes, I use an approach to the various sequences adapted from Neil Fraistat’s
              <title level="m">The Poem and the Book</title> (1985). In this book, Fraistat looks at
            “Ideas of Poetic Order and Ordering” and “Forms of Coherence in Romantic Poetic Volumes”
            in the “contexture” that results from the poets’ deliberate sequencing of poems in
            Romantic poetry collections, and he begins his discussion by noting that Blake’s <title level="m">Songs</title> display “in its most unadulterated form . . . the Romantic
            urge not only to structure, but to restructure, contextures” (4).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For related work on this topic, see Neil Fraistat’s edited collection
                <title level="m">Poems in their Place </title>(1986). </note> However, Fraistat does
            not discuss the <title level="m">Songs</title> at length, focusing instead on William
            Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, John
            Keats’ <title level="m">Lamia</title> (1820) collection, and Percy Bysshe Shelley’s
              <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> (1820) collection. For Fraistat,
            contexture describes the fabric of the book created by the weaving together of the
            “inner” meaning of a given poem taken separately and the “outer” meaning of the poem
            considered as part of an ordered sequence. Fraistat lists a number of possible
            contextural structures based on “subject, theme, image or voice,” noting that the use of
            titles, epigraphs, or prefaces can also suggest possible relationships or continuities
            among the poems in a collection (12). Fraistat’s point is that in the original
            publication, the poet placed the poems in each collection into a particular sequence,
            and the meaning and significance of a particular poem depends at least in part on its
            position in that original sequence with other poems. </p>
                  <p> Fraistat’s focus on the author’s intentional sequencing of the poems in a collection
            implies a tension between authorial and editorial concerns that I have explored in a
            class on anthologies (see the <ref target="http://www.ualr.edu/rpyoder/AnthologiesS06736001syl.htm">sample
            syllabus</ref>). On the one hand, editorial decisions may be seen as manifestations of
            certain theories of literary value that may have little to do with the author’s original
            decisions about organizing his or her book. Fraistat’s approach to authorial concerns,
            on the other hand, assumes that poets expected readers to read the poems in their poetry
            collections in the order in which they appear, and that in such a sequential reading,
            various relationships would emerge for readers. For Blake’s <title level="m">Songs</title>, the authorial concerns reflected in Fraistat’s notion of contexture
            are rather more complicated than for many writers. In the case of the <title level="m">Songs</title>, what constitutes the contexture? Certainly the sequence of poems in
            any individual copy provides the foundation for the contexture of that copy. Working
            with only the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>, we can now compare the contextures
            in thirteen different copies. Can we weave these separate contextures into a fluid
            multi-dimensional setting for each poem? Moreover, in some cases the poems in an extant
            copy were not sequenced by Blake but by a later owner, so the provenance of a particular
            copy may be included as part of its larger contexture. As such, these copies come to the
            reader already encrusted with the traces not only of interpretation but also the values
            assigned by the historical and commercial processes that led to the copy’s assembly.
            Finally, we must add Blake’s use of stereotypes of text and design to Fraistat’s list of
            “subject, theme, image or voice” as possible bases for contexture, opening up questions
            of visual as well as verbal relations. The object of our study looks less like a
            sequence of pages than a cluster of intersecting spheres that largely overlap but are
            nowhere identical.</p>
                  <p> I noted that I teach the full <title level="m">Songs</title> in several different
            classes, but the truth is that I assign the full <title level="m">Songs</title> in
            several different classes, without ever teaching all of the poems. There is just not
            enough time to do so. Instead, I try to use poems that give a sense of structure and
            theme, poems that suggest some point I want to make. I do feel a sense of responsibility
            to the collection’s critical history, so I make a point to discuss “The Lamb” and “The
            Tyger” for at least a bit, but the differences in purpose and focus of the various
            classes mean that I have to approach the <title level="m">Songs</title> differently in
            each course. Nonetheless, I always try to use the <title level="m">Songs</title> to
            allow students to explore the various possible lines of continuity as well as the more
            theoretical questions concerning the stability of the text. What sort of work allows for
            so many different manifestations? What sort of artist envisions such a work? How does
            Blake imagine his control over his creation? Even with half a semester devoted to the
              <title level="m">Songs</title>, these are questions toward which I feel I only
            gesture. </p>
                  <p> But perhaps we can imagine a class I have never actually taught, but which I can begin
            to see on my horizon. It is a class exclusively on the <title level="m">Songs</title>.
            With fifteen weeks (more or less) we can deepen our study considerably. Take a week each
            for the students to read through the <title level="m">Songs of Innocence</title> and the
              <title level="m">Songs of Experience</title>. Then use a week to introduce them to the
              <title level="m">Blake Archive</title> and the different copies. Then, depending on
            class size, assign each student or team of students one particular copy of the <title level="m">Songs</title> to adopt. Their task now is to be the expert on their copy.
            The course would include regular updates on what each student has learned about his or
            her copy. Discussions of individual poems would be informed by each student’s different
            textual and contextural experience, considering placement in a particular sequence as
            well as coloring, history, or provenance. The history of each book is part of the
            character of the individual copy and therefore part of the character of the full <title level="m">Songs</title>, the ultimate composite text comprising all copies. In the
            classroom, this is about as close as we might get to experiencing the <title level="m">Songs</title> for the slippery, protean book it actually is. </p>

                  <head> Toward a Blakean Pedagogy </head>
                  <p> The multiple sequences of the <title level="m">Songs</title> demonstrate that Blake
            accepted a certain amount of play in what constituted a “finished” work as well as in
            his readers’ reactions to and reconstructions of that work. Teaching the multiplicity of
            the <title level="m">Songs</title> requires teachers and students to embrace that play
            as well. Therein lies the key to a Blakean pedagogy. Perhaps Blake’s most famous
            statement on pedagogy is his remark to Dr. Trusler in a letter dated August 23, 1799:
            “The wisest of the Ancients considered what is not too Explicit as the fittest for
            Instruction because it rouzes the faculties to act” (Erdman 702).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> All parenthetical page citations for William Blake quotes refer to
              David Erdman’s edition of <title level="m">The Complete Poetry and Prose of William
                Blake</title> (1988). When appropriate, poetic line numbers or plate numbers are
              also given. </note> Blake seems to assume that the typical state of mind is inactive
            and not conducive to learning; the mind is bound by its own “mind-forg’d manacles” (8)
            that the poet marks in every face he meets in “London.” The faculties must be roused,
            released from those manacles, in order to learn, and the “not too Explicit” makes that
            happen. But how?</p>
                  <p> The mental lethargy to which Blake responds is clearly evident in “The School Boy”
            which appears in both <title level="m">Innocence</title> and <title level="m">Experience</title> at different times. The schoolboy states that school, where “I
            drooping sit” (11), “drives all joy away” (7). The schoolmaster has a “cruel eye” (8),
            and the oppressive atmosphere is such that “Nor in my book can I take delight” (13).
            Ironically, school is where mental lethargy sets in; the process is equivalent to caging
            a bird (16-17), nipping fresh buds, or stripping “tender plants” (21-23). The effects of
            this stifled mentality are dire for they leave us unable to “gather what griefs destroy
            / Or bless the mellowing year, / When the blasts of winter appear” (28-30). Without a
            joyous, nurturing education, we are left unprepared in later life either to learn from
            our losses or to appreciate our blessings.</p>
                  <p> When the schoolboy laments that he cannot take delight in his book, the complaint
            itself suggests that however much he might like to enjoy his learning, the schoolmaster
            is preventing that by his methods of instruction. What does delight in learning mean to
            Blake? Blake’s comments to Trusler suggest that the mind responds to the challenge of
            the “not too Explicit” by rousing itself to the puzzle and presumably experiencing the
            joy and energy lost in the schoolboy’s classroom. Knowledge for Blake is discovery. It
            is the grasping of the lesson behind the not too explicit, and part of that lesson is an
            awareness and appreciation of the process of learning, of inquiry, of discovery. As
            Wordsworth puts it in the preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, it is the
            pleasure of “difficulty overcome” (611). </p>
                  <p> I often tell my students that Blake’s poems are like little linear accelerators, in
            which the atomic particles of the text crash into each other, throwing off clouds of
            possible meanings. I think this is true of all texts, but I think it is especially true
            for Blake. Those clouds of possible meaning require a certain faith in the interaction
            between reader and text, student and teacher. The lessons of the <title level="m">Songs</title> are not the sort of knowledge that can simply be transferred from the
            author to the reader or from the teacher to the student. Rather, the lessons of the
              <title level="m">Songs</title> depend on awakening the reader to multiple
            possibilities and points of view. Blake thought that most people sleepwalk passively
            through a book the way that they sleepwalk through their lives. They must be taught to
            read in the infernal method. Skepticism is a requirement, as are independence of spirit
            and a willingness to question the received interpretations of past authorities. Blake
            intends his books to force the reader to wake up, to “rouze” the mind to act. A Blakean
            pedagogy requires a negotiation between control and freedom. In <title level="m">Jerusalem</title> (comp. ca. 1804-1820), Los says to “Labour well the Minute
            Particulars” (55:51), but the point of such labor is to release possible readings, to
            make visible the infernal readings that are hidden by the encrustations of tradition or
            the “mind-forg’d manacles” of expectation or prejudice or idolatry. Blake knew—and the
            teacher of Blake’s works must accept—that he had only very limited control over what the
            reader made of his books, but he knew that we must begin with the material object—the
            book itself—and build up from there. In his stereotypes—the composite of text and
            image—Blake tried to retain as much creative control as possible, choosing his own
            handwriting over standard print, his own integrated images over the standard publication
            layout. In building the contextures of the individual copies, we also build a contexture
            of the interaction of those copies with each other. Some of those copies have been
            sequenced by Blake, others were sequenced by collectors or booksellers; either way,
            those copies and their special circumstances are part of the contexture of the overall
              <title level="m">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Joseph Byrne suggests that Blake’s <title level="m">Songs</title> may
              be seen as a hypertext video game that creates an “immersive experience” (par. 41)
              that facilitates the sort of discovery I am describing as part of a Blakean pedagogy.
              Byrne has constructed a “Contraries Machine” that allows the player to compare on one
              screen songs from <title level="m">Innocence</title> and from <title level="m">Experience</title> that match or contrast, but the game is limited to Copy Z. The
              next step, of course, would be to combine Byrne’s approach with the “compare” function
              in the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title> that allows the viewer to see any or all
              copies of a given plate in the archive on a single screen. For classroom purposes, one
              can easily construct a primitive version of this tool by simply using separate browser
              windows to compare all copies of a plate from <title level="m">Innocence</title> and
              one from <title level="m">Experience</title> and then resize the windows so that both
              fit on the screen. Then the class can scroll through parallel histories of the
              plates.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> In that MLA collection on teaching the <title level="m">Songs</title>, Stephen Cox
            discusses “Taking Risks in Teaching <title level="m">Songs</title>,” but the risks in
            1989 are different from risks twenty-five years later. For Cox, risk constitutes using
            discussion classes to teach students critical thinking about the content and value of
            the <title level="m">Songs</title>, and the evidence we use to establish either.
            Literary theory and classroom practice have changed much since then, and what Cox finds
            risky, I think is probably close to standard practice today. We might push these methods
            further, especially with the resources now available, but in the end, we may find that
            simply reading poems honestly with our students is all that we need to do. If we expect
            our students to embrace the play and uncertainty of Blake’s work, we as teachers must
            ourselves be open to such play. I know that, regardless of which particular poems I may
            prepare for classroom discussion of the <title level="m">Songs</title>, I rarely end up
            discussing those poems. My class preparation is more of a back-up plan in case the
            students do not have any questions or preferences among the poems; it’s good to be
            prepared, but I rarely use it. Instead, I ask the students what questions they have or
            what poems they especially liked or which ones might have confused them. Their answers
            usually lead away from the poems that I had prepared, and those are usually my most
            productive classes. Obviously I’ve read all of the <title level="m">Songs</title> more
            times than I can count, but I rarely have a reading of a particular poem at my
            fingertips. Consequently these classes are exploratory and almost purely
            improvisational, as discussion inevitably leads to unexpected approaches, questions that
            I had not considered, or a level of detail that I don’t often examine. And this is good
            because most students have never experienced reading a poem with someone who knows what
            she’s doing and who is willing to share with the class the mistakes, the false starts,
            and methods of approaching the problem. </p>
                  <p> I recently had such a discussion of “The Divine Image” that shocked my students by
            consuming the entire 75-minute period. The whiteboard from that discussion is here:</p>

                  <p>Fig. 1 Whiteboard for “The Divine Image.”</p>
                  <p>I do a lot of board work in these more exploratory sessions. I put key terms and ideas
            up, grouping them, drawing in connections. Stick figures and badly-drawn maps are
            functions of my classroom persona, and I use them to help visualize and organize the
            concepts. For this class I had prepared to discuss “Infant Joy” and “Infant Sorrow,” but
            a student asked about “A Divine Image,” so we went there instead, and that quickly led
            to investigation of “The Divine Image” as well. With no prep, I was feeling my way
            along, stanza by stanza, and the board notes suggest the dynamic of exploratory
            thinking. We simply looked at what “The Divine Image” says. If we pray to and return
            thanks to the traits of “Mercy Pity Peace and Love” (1), that would seem to identify God
            with those traits. The second stanza confirms that conclusion but extends the reference
            to “Man” (8) as well as “God” (6), while also introducing a parental relationship
            between God and Man. All of this is represented on the left side of the white board. The
            image in the middle represents the design of “The Blossom” which is similar to the
            design for “The Divine Image.” The words and images at the right depict the associations
            made in the third stanza of “The Divine Image” and emphasize the anthropomorphism of
            Blake’s concept of the divine. All of this was generated by the class discussion. The
            students came away with a clearer sense of what the poem is about as well as a
            heightened awareness of the process of discovery.</p>
                  <p> Since the discussion of “The Divine Image” had been triggered by a student’s question
            about “A Divine Image” (the unused companion poem), in the following class we looked at
            how “The Divine Image” relates to both “A Divine Image” and “The Human Abstract,” the
            poem that Blake used instead. We noted how the fragmenting of the body and the negative
            attributes of “A Divine Image” mirror the fragmentation and positive attributes of “The
            Divine Image,” while also recalling the industrial imagery of the blacksmith from “The
            Tyger.” Then we considered “The Human Abstract” and the variations it plays on both the
            positive attributes of “The Divine Image” and the negative attributes of “A Divine
            Image” in a narrative that recalls both the biblical story of the Fall and “A Poison
            Tree.” Here is the whiteboard for that discussion:</p>
                  <figure>
                     <graphic n="1002"

                  <p>Fig. 2 Whiteboard for “A Divine Image.”</p>
                  <p>The second board suggests a more orderly approach on my part on the second day as we
            set in place the alternative associations established in “The Human Abstract.” I learned
            a lot in these discussions. Part of the discussion was about the poems and how Blake
            represents the relationship between the human and the divine. But we also learned that
            sometimes the Blakean ideas or images that seem most strange actually make the most
            sense if taken at face value. I find that most new readers of Blake understand what he
            says; they just can’t believe he said it. I counsel my students that confusion is an
            appropriate first response to much of Blake’s work. All three poems we discussed create
            chains of associations with the divine attributes of <title level="m">Mercy, Pity,
              Peace</title> and <title level="m">Love</title>. The fragmenting of the body, its
            industrialization in “A Divine Image,” the cryptic allegory of “The Human Abstract,” and
            the conflicting associations all make the poems’ statements seem strange. Nonetheless,
            the associations are quite clear if we just record what the poems say. </p>
                  <p> The whiteboards from class show a movement from exploration to understanding. A
            Blakean pedagogy demands that teachers and students alike approach the poems with an
            open mind and a sense of adventure. This is reading in the infernal method: confronting
            the essential strangeness of poetic pronouncements intruding into the mundane world and
            accepting that strangeness as an invitation to play, to learn, to rouse the faculties.
            Blake’s designs are filled with images of people reading. Some cover their books so no
            one else can see, but more often, Blake shows adults and children reading together. In
              <title level="m">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</title> (1790), the poet and his new
            friend, an “Angel, who is now become a Devil,” “often read the Bible together in its
            infernal . . . sense” (Plate 24). Discussion and skepticism must be the basis for any
            Blakean pedagogy. But for anyone who knows Blake’s work, this seems hardly to need
            saying.</p>
                  <p> Probably in 1818 Blake sent to Thomas Butts (probably) a list identifying “The Order
            in which the Songs of Innocence &amp; of Experience out [sic] to be paged &amp; placed”
            (Erdman 772). The nature of Blake’s response suggests that Butts had asked him about the
            correct order of the poems, a question he would only ask if he knew that there were
            copies of the <title level="m">Songs</title> with different sequences. Butts does not go
            as far as John Linnell did with Copy F of <title level="m">Jerusalem</title> (1827),
            actually changing Blake’s page numbers to match the pagination in his own copy, but his
            question suggests the same sort of desire for a stable text that we often find in our
              students.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For additional treatment of the narrative
              structure and sequencing of Blake’s <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>, see my essay
              “What Happens When: Narrative and the Changing Sequence of Plates in Blake’s <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>, Chapter 2.” </note> Nonetheless, everything about the
              <title level="m">Songs</title> works against the fulfillment of that desire, and I
            must admit to a certain satisfaction in the fact that only Copy V (1821) exhibits the
            correct “Order” outlined in the letter to Butts; not even Blake’s own copy follows the
            sequence. I teach the <title level="m">Songs</title> especially to my new English majors
            precisely because I want them to think about what makes a book, and whether a book is
            ever a stable authoritative statement. I use Blake to make certain points about the
            nature of literature, the nature of reading, the nature of reality. The lesson of the

            relationships and to discover the possibilities that arise from the combination and
            recombination of words and pictures, poems and books.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">William Blake’s mastery of print media long presented a problem for
          readers of Blake who wished to experience the full range of his illuminated books. While
            <title level="m">The William Blake Archive</title> offered a solution to access to the
          various copies, the formats for reading digital media have been too intrusive for
          conventional literary pedagogic experiences. As such, this paper explores the potential
          for a new generation of devices for opening up Blake’s works in a variety of ways and how
          that potential is itself affected by ecosystems and economic decisions that prevent easy,
          open access.</p>

               <p>In 2013, at a meal with a poet and senior colleagues, the conversation at our table
          inevitably turned to books that we were reading. Admitting at some point that wherever
          possible I preferred to use a Kindle, I was met with a mixture of confusion and even mild
          horror, while for my part I felt considerable amusement at playing the role of devil’s
          advocate. I certainly do not read every book on such a device: many (particularly older
          ones still in copyright) are not available as e-books; for art books, I prefer a glossy
          hardback with high-quality paper and a resolution that even the latest 4K and Retina
          screens struggle to match; finally, I conceded that sometimes I was as interested in
          typography and layout (where a lot of e-books still falter) as I was in ideas and content.
          Yet, despite these various exceptions, it remains the case that the majority of books I
          read are electronic and that, where possible, I prefer to travel with most of my library
          in one device weighing a few ounces. I still remember visiting Rome on a holiday when I
          had to write an undergraduate dissertation: as my holdall passed through an airport X-ray
          machine, all that could be seen was a dense, black mass, and I spent the next half hour
          worrying that I was about to miss my flight while watching a security officer as he
          retrieved book after book from my bag. Against such undoubted convenience, however, my
          dinner guests fretted that something essential was being lost in the transition to
          electronic formats, and they were particularly surprised that someone who has spent so
          much of his career studying particular <emph>books</emph> could be so eager to abandon the
          citadel in favor of a platform better suited (as they saw it) for <title level="m">Fifty
            Shades of Grey</title> (2011)<title level="m">. </title>
               </p>
               <p>In many respects, it would be easy to bracket off this particular discussion as taking
          place among a group of people of a certain age, ones who did not grow up as digital
          natives. While I do not consider that to be true (just from witnessing reading habits on
          different types of public transport where people of all ages increasingly read from
          electronic devices), we do seem to be approaching a period where the status of the printed
          book is converging with various other media such as DVDs and CDs, ripe for digital
          dissemination. Personally, I have a suspicion that the future role of print will be closer
          to that of vinyl: much loved by cognoscenti—who will laud its superior qualities—but not
          an object for mass consumption. As such, we have arrived at a crucial stage in the use of
          William Blake in the classroom, where mobile electronic devices will soon be ubiquitous.
          In the same year of my dinner discussion with the poet and colleagues, I taught classes
          where more students would turn up with some form of tablet or e-reader than a printed copy
          of the texts set for that week’s discussion. As an early adopter, previously I would
          sometimes elicit polite curiosity from those students as I sat in front of them with a
          Kindle or tablet: now it elicits no response whatsoever. As such, this essay is
          particularly concerned with an issue of digital pedagogy that is especially pertinent to
          Blake studies: what is it that students are actually reading and what role will e-books
          have in education in contrast to traditional print formats? While I believe that the
          electronic formats currently available are inadequate for Blake’s work, this inadequacy is
          based upon the fact that Blake is a special case that print has not served well. The issue
          of e-books is a surprisingly recent one for digital pedagogy, for reasons that have more
          to do with economics and distribution than the actual technology. In the illuminating 2007
          collection, <title level="m">Rethinking Pedagogy for a Digital Age</title>, for example,
          e-books are barely mentioned in contrast to e-portfolios and online delivery aimed at
          desktop and notebook computer users. Similarly, in Brett D. Hirsch’s edited volume <title level="m">Digital Humanities Pedagogy </title>(2012), the main focus remains on the use
          of computer mediated technologies that bring with them considerable benefits for the
          processing of data to present it in innovative ways, such as Matthew K. Gold’s wonderful
          account of the project “Looking for Whitman.” But the actual experience of reading remains
          relatively unexplored, perhaps because that experience has been rendered apparently
          transparent by our close encounters with print. One of the great virtues of teaching and
          studying Blake is that the fundamental question of what it is we are reading, even how we
          actually read the pages before us, cannot be taken for granted.</p>
               <p>What is important here is not to create or invert hierarchies of print and other media,
          but to return to the objects of reading and transmission as part of a material culture
          that is not simply a crude materialism or technological determinism but instead part of an
          ecology (in Timothy Morton’s sense of the term): the “practice and process of becoming
          fully aware of how human beings are connected with other beings—animal, vegetable,
          mineral” (7). Such an ecology emphasizes, after Graham Harman (2011), Levi Bryant (2011),
          and Manuel De Landa (2009), a flat ontology of objects as the means to understand better
          that practice and process. This is especially important with Blake: most Blake readers do
          not have access to his original artifacts and have instead constantly engaged with
          products of different media and publishing ecosystems. I have written extensively with
          Roger Whitson about how Blake has been created as a virtual object in an archive and
          ecosystem created by publishing companies and academic scholars since the late-nineteenth
          century, and that this virtual Blake is a “plane of consistency” that makes possible the
          organization of particular works—for example the recognition that Blake wrote a body of
          work that we call the “prophetic books” (Whitson and Whittaker 33). What I am more
          concerned with in this essay, however, is the role of those digital ecosystems in which
          Blake—like so many authors and artists—will become increasingly entangled. In so many
          respects, Blake is an exemplar of print culture at its height, and he certainly understood
          the processes of printing much more than the vast majority of writers, but we must also
          accept that for the vast majority of future readers Blake will be digital.</p>
               <p>It is almost impossible to think that one of the most technologically-astute writers,
          artists, and self-publishers of his (or, indeed, any age) would have been anything other
          than profoundly concerned with the means of producing, disseminating, and consuming
          digital versions of his own works had he been alive and working today. In addition,
          although Blake, especially in his later life, demonstrated considerable hostility towards
          capitalism, he was deeply concerned with the <emph>business</emph> of literature and
          art—whether in his own projects such as printmaking or the illuminated books, or as
          engaged with publishing opportunities for editions of Edward Young’s <title level="m">Night Thoughts</title> (1797) or Robert Blair’s <title level="m">The Grave</title>
          (1808) (Bentley 69-81). With regard to the digital ecosystems in which his work will
          increasingly be encountered, however, it is important to take a critical and more properly
          ecological view than the oft-abused phrase “digital ecosystem” frequently allows. Theories
          of media ecologies have their roots in the work of Marshall McLuhan and Gregory Bateson
          among others, with important developments by theorists such as De Landa and Jussi Parikka
          (2012). Although there is a tendency to slip into media and technological determinism
          among a number of these writers or to emphasize the divisions between orality and literacy
          in ways that cannot always be justified, nonetheless such theorists contribute
          significantly to understanding the practices and processes by which we may gain awareness
          of our connection to other objects. This is very much in contrast to the notions of
          digital ecosystems as bandied around by monopolies such as the Big Four (Apple, Google,
          Amazon, and Facebook, the latter often interchangeable with, or supplemented by,
          Microsoft), who are attempting to gain control of our relations with media in a very
          deterministic fashion. As Michael deAgonia has written (somewhat melodramatically) the
          contest between tech behemoths is “a war between vast ecosystems made up of hardware,
          software and online services,” one in which the ecosystem is very clearly tied to economic
          imperatives above anything else and in which the aim of such a comprehensive market and
          operational system is intended to obscure users to the consequences of their buying
          decisions. For those interested, deAgonia’s article is an extremely good summary of how
          the big technology groups are seeking to exercise monopoly over media consumption, but as
          with so much current technology writing on the subject, the reduction of important agents
          in these ecosystems to the role of consumers offers more blindness than insight.</p>
               <p>Blake’s own system of production was, as practice, a trenchant critique of the system of
          publishing in his time, whereby late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth-century booksellers
          hardened the barriers between producers and consumers. Morris Eaves has discussed
          extensively how the <title level="m">Public Address</title> (1810), issued as an
          advertisement for the engraving of Chaucer’s Canterbury pilgrims, explored the processes
          of a “rational division of production” that adapted programs of pedagogy and principles to
          an ideal of a macrosystem capable of unifying all aspects of book production in a system
          of ideologies (i.e., taste), institutions, technologies, and economics (176). As Blake
          remarks in the <title level="m">Address</title>: <quote>Englishmen rouze yourselves from
            the fatal Slumber into which Booksellers &amp; Trading Dealers have thrown you Under the

            honourable to a Nation as an Original . . . Be-lying the English Character in that well
            known Saying Englishmen Improve what others Invent[.] This Even Hogarths Works Prove a

              refer to David Erdman’s edition of <title level="m">The Complete Poetry and Prose of
                William Blake</title> (1988). </note>
                  </quote> As Eaves observes, the division of
          labor into a system whereby journeyman were no more than hired hands employed by
          publishers to reproduce (and, in Blake’s opinion, botch) designs originating elsewhere was
          reflected in class terms as the “separation of ruling upper-class minds from working
          lower-class bodies” (172). William Hogarth lived at that cusp when art was becoming
          increasingly commercialized, with print forms being displayed as engravings in shop
          windows frequented by the bourgeoisie rather than paintings restricted to the homes of the
          aristocracy. Hogarth himself took advantage of this transition in the market to engrave
          his own works, but by the nineteenth century, the publishing ecosystem had firmly divided
          the arts of invention and execution. G. E. Bentley, Jr.’s recent exploration of Blake’s
          activities in the “desolate market” demonstrates the various ways in which Blake sought to
          prosper (or merely survive) in this fragmentary system that reduced him to the role of a
          journeyman, as teacher, printer, shop owner, and publisher of works in conventional
          typography. However, it was through his illuminated books that Blake most actively set
          himself up in opposition to the interlocking framework of production that sought to bring
          consumers and publishers together for the highest profit while relegating the engraver to
          the role of hired hand. As Bentley observes, Blake originally sought to distribute his
          works conventionally through retailers (most notably Joseph Johnson), writing in 1793 that
          “the Author is sure of his reward” (as cited by Bentley, 103); by 1818, however, Blake
          printed his works to order and made the melancholy observation that they were
          “unprofitable enough to me tho Expensive to the Buyer” (as cited by Bentley, 104).
          Ultimately, Bentley points out, the works in illuminated printing “provided only a small
          fraction of his income” (104), and it was only the munificence of patrons such as John
          Linnell and Thomas Butts, who saved Blake from penury in his later years, as his annual
          income fell from a high point of some £203 per annum in the 1790s to a low of £68 in the
          1810s.</p>
               <p>Part of the reason for Blake’s commercial failure during his own lifetime, as well
          documented by Bentley, Eaves, Viscomi, and others, is that his technological innovation
          was not sufficient to overcome the economic transformations that took place during his
          lifetime, dividing the roles of book production and promotion into various streams. Such
          commercial failure, however, should not detract from the aesthetic triumphs of Blake’s
          endeavor, which, as Eaves observed, was to employ the technology of the book in what was
          ultimately a pedagogical service: to teach the English public (and also the English school
          of painters) the importance of original creation as opposed to imitation, a mission that
          identifies the divine with the human and as such aims at a total transformation of human
          psychology, religion, and society (Eaves 133-134). Blake, who most famously declared that
          he must create a system or be enslaved by another man’s, saw the role of art as far beyond
          the limits of print and the booksellers of his day (for which, as he laments in the <title level="m">Public Address</title>, his contemporaries considered him mad). The publishing
          ecosystem of the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries had sacrificed what, for
          Blake, was its most important aspect—the illumination and transformation of both reader
          and author—for the sake of retail efficiencies and smoother production cycles. Stephen
          Behrendt (3-4) compares the experience of reading Blake to engaging with <title level="m">Tristram Shandy</title> (1759-1767): our expectations of what to find in the text and
          our simple assumptions of what a text should be are overturned in a highly interactive
          process of reading. The reader is forced to take on a greater responsibility for
          formulating meaning, and as such he or she must reassess their own ideas of how such
          meaning can be created as part of a dialectic with Blake’s books and as part of the
          process of illumination. In <title level="m">Pedagogy of Freedom</title> (2001), Paulo
          Freire rails against the reduction of education to “a question of training a student to be
          dexterous or competent” (22), arguing instead for the right for education to dream of
          utopia. Blake’s own practice, then, was not to instruct his readers into the narrow bounds
          of correct competence, a variant of what he would have seen as moral law via the brass
          books of Urizen, but rather to lead them to their own discovery of utopia via an eternal
          conversation: <quote>

                  </quote> As technology, the printed book is subject to a whole nexus of production,
          distribution, and economic cycles that we easily recognize with other media formats but
          that have been all too eager to mystify when it comes to the printed word—almost certainly
          because of its early associations with the Word of Gutenberg’s first bestseller. Leaving
          aside the complex issue of Blake’s originals, which are largely inaccessible for the vast
          majority of instances of teaching, there is no longer a privileged position for
            <emph>print</emph> when studying his work. The printed book has long demonstrated itself
          fallible when connecting with an audience in the way that Blake so desperately desired.
          This is reflected in the transition in Blake studies in the two decades since Joseph
          Viscomi’s <title level="m">Blake and the Idea of the Book </title>(1993): from discussing
          Blake’s <emph>texts</emph> to considering <emph>copies</emph> of his work. As such, in
          terms of using Blake in the classroom, we should not assume some hierarchy of being when
          handling Blakean artifacts: if anything, the production methods of commercial printing
          demand a complete disruption of Blakean unity of design and execution if the publisher has
          any hope of financial success. Blake studies have long been at the forefront of using
          digital technologies to disseminate an artist’s vision—the <ref target="http://www.blakearchive.org">
                     <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>
                  </ref> being
          one of the pre-eminent resources in the digital humanities, offering as it does the most
          complete corpus of Blake’s works that would be commercially ruinous on paper. Very few
          authors understood print in a way that Blake—a printmaker—did, and yet to read his variant
          copies in anything approaching the evolving formats in which they were published during
          his lifetime has proved impossible for generations of publishers to produce. As such,
          although Blake may be synonymous with print through his craft, if ever there was an author
          who demanded the reproducibility of digital media, it is Blake. </p>
               <p>There is nothing new in this assertion. The editors of the <title level="m">Blake
            Archive</title> came to this very conclusion in the 1990s, enabling a new generation of
          Blake scholars to have some chance of understanding the corpus completely. What it does
          mean, however, is that we must examine more closely than ever the methods by which his
          works are distributed, and in many ways the advent of new platforms for reading and
          dissemination are an excellent opportunity for this. Although there are plenty of scholars
          who have returned attention to the economics and technology of the book, too often these
          have become invisible to us through familiarity: as such, the current disruption of the
          book publishing industry that we are experiencing provides an excellent opportunity to
          consider once more how we engage with Blake in the classroom. The fallibility of the
          publishing industry meant that for more than a century of reproduction following the
          appearance of Alexander Gilchrist’s biography of Blake in 1863, editors could not place
          before the vast majority of readers anything like Blake’s complete corpus of individual
          copies before the advent of the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>. Yet if I do not
          intend to praise print in and of itself, nor do I intend to bury it in the classroom. Two
          of my most treasured possessions remain a very battered copy of David Erdman’s <title level="m">The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</title> (1965), annotations
          penciled across its yellowing leaves, and the hardback facsimiles of the illuminated books
          produced by the William Blake Trust and the Tate in the 1990s, both of which regularly
          make their way into my teaching sessions. The flaws in Erdman’s edition of Blake were
          commented upon widely following publication of the revised edition, most notably by the
          Santa Cruz Blake Study Group (1984), and yet as Andrew Welch observes, this remarkable,
          flawed text remains the academic standard when referring to Blake because facsimiles are
          frequently almost illegible and because it serves as a common reference point amidst the
          potential confusion of multiple copies (2010). Furthermore, when we abandon some analogue
          forms such as the printed book, we also lose a series of sensory inputs that digital
          technologies find it hard to replicate in their current forms, as Chris Harrison pointed
          out recently when comparing the “rich touch” interface of something like a guitar to the
          more limited screen of a smartphone or tablet (as cited by Leswing, 2014). This is more
          than mere nostalgia for the yellowing paper of my copy of Erdman: turning pages and
          scribbling annotations can be an important part of the physical act of studying that, as
          Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer argue (2014), is more effective for retaining
          information in memory.</p>
               <p>Mueller and Oppenheimer’s research deals more with note taking than actual reading, but
          it is important here as a warning to avoid the all-too-common rush in some quarters to
          assume that digital is automatically superior to print, against those such as Sven
          Birkerts, who lamented the loss of the printed book. Some uses are better served by print,
          while others (e.g., the ability to search through large amounts of data in ever more
          convenient devices; the ability to compare multiple copies of a particular work) are more
          easily done via digital devices. Yet the experience of relying on e-readers remains, when
          teaching Blake, a messy one, not least because the attempt to read (and teach) Blake in
          print remains chaotic. Attempts to create standard editions, which have their origins in
          attempts to recover authoritative biblical translations by scholars such as Johann Bengel
          and Johann Griesbach in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, are complex enough when
          the primary sources are printed more conventionally. Occasionally, controversies can spill
          into the public domain, particularly when an editor uses unpublished manuscripts to
          produce copy-texts, scandalously so in the case of Walter Gabler’s new version of <title level="m">Ulysses</title> (1922) in 1984. Gabler (and others) were responding to the
          well-understood fact that James Joyce’s novel had repeatedly been printed with numerous
          errors since 1922, but as Charles Rossman discovered, the final edition was as much about
          the conflicts of money, copyright law, and critical ideology as the pursuit of a pure
          ur-text (Brannon 70-74). In the classroom, the ideal aspiration should always be to direct
          students towards an edition of an author’s works that presents the original text in a form
          that is also convenient to use: add in a technological innovation such as Blake’s use of
          illuminated printing, however, and that process becomes much more complicated. If scholars
          previously had difficulties deciding what the authoritative text of <title level="m">Ulysses </title>should look like, imagine the manifold difficulties of a teacher who
          should really also decide what copy of one of Blake’s illuminated books should be
          presented to the classroom. The printed book was meant to be a solution to a problem,
          standardizing the delivery of text to multiple readers distributed widely across space and
          time. For his own radical purposes, Blake thumbed his nose at the conventions of
          publishing, refusing something as simple as a fixed, authoritative book from which
          teachers could transmit priestly knowledge. In <title level="m">The Four Zoas</title>
          (comp. ca. 1796-1797), Blake describes Urizen as transcribing the world as a series of
          iron laws, suitably recorded in an enduring format: <quote>

                  </quote> Urizen’s books are fixed, final records, and his brain is one of eternal print, a
          mockery of Blake’s own fluid and experimental approach to the technology of
          publishing.</p>
               <p>For Richard Nash, the tendency—and temptation—to defend publishing and the printed book
          via an exceptionalist stance is one that undermines the book because it sees it as a frail
          entity threatened by technology. By contrast, he argues, “[t]he book is not
          counter-technology, it is technology, it is the apotheosis of technology—just like the
          wheel or the chair” before concluding: <quote>Book culture is in far less peril than many
            choose to assume, for the notion of an imperiled book culture assumes that book culture
            is a beast far more refined, rarified, and fragile than it actually is. (Nash
            2013)</quote> The disruptive power of book culture has long been evident, and its
          ability to transform education is not something that was restricted to previous times: the
          book is not a bulwark <emph>against</emph> but an agent <emph>of</emph> change. Ted
          Striphas points out that the unsettled and unsettling effects of books are nothing new to
          the current age and that they are always “both in and out of sync with the
          present—whenever the present may be” (x). Nash’s call for book culture to lead the charge
          rather than man the barricades against the barbarians does not dismiss the traditions of
          book publishing that have their roots in the eighteenth century. Editors, for example,
          will clearly have a role to play in making writing better and producing books; but as
          curators of what should be placed in front of the public, Nash believes that their
          abilities to pick the right book is nonsense, a combination of money and luck. Rather,
          their real skills are relational, connecting authors with designers, publishers, markets,
          and, ultimately, audiences. While the marketplaces of Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and Apple
          may have lowered many of the barriers to entry, simply launching a title into the world
          and hoping it will connect (as Blake, bitterly, knew far too well) is far from a guarantee
          of success. Publishing, as Nash observes, is developing into areas such as bespoke bureau
          services, conferences and consultation, and educational activities such as the Faber
          Academy. In such a world, the brand and reputation of editors and publishers, rather than
          an intrinsic value of the content of “art,” remains as important as ever: “the business of
          literature is the business of making culture, not just the business of manufacturing bound
          books” (Nash).</p>
               <p>In many respects, this essay is broadly in agreement with Nash, especially with regard to
          literature as a business, which is probably in more robust shape than many undoubtedly
          suffering from the current disruption of print would care to admit. As Striphas observes,
          the book trade has been on the “brink” of collapse since the 1930s at least (45).
          Nonetheless, this suffering is real, and Nash’s underlying faith in the free market should
          be viewed skeptically. John B. Thompson’s <title level="m">Merchants of Culture</title>
          (2012) offers an insight into some of the major trends affecting the current book trade,
          most notably the “winner takes more” model of publishing, which does not have its origin
          in the transition to digital but is instead an outcome of publishing conglomerations and
          mergers that began in the 1980s (189-191). It was the demands of the so-called “Big Six”
          in the publishing world, as well as large-scale retailers such as Borders and Barnes and
          Noble, that led to a deterioration of a mythical golden age of publishing—one where
          authors and editors could build upon profound relationships without the necessary
          imperative of turning a fast—and large—buck. Indeed, the fears of monopolization of book
          culture that Amazon is currently felt to represent—quite rightly in many cases—follow
          ironically from the many successes of Random House, Penguin, Hachette, Simon &amp;
          Schuster, HarperCollins, and Macmillan throughout the late-twentieth and
          early-twenty-first centuries. Nonetheless, Laura Miller is right to have called
          booksellers “reluctant capitalists,” although the scenario she described in the 1990s is
          increasingly looking like ancient history—one where acquisitions by companies such Barnes
          and Noble and HMV (which bought out Waterstones in 1998) established precedents for Amazon
          to become the largest retailer in the world.</p>
               <p>The example of HMV is an illustrative one: established as a retail outlet for the
          Gramophone Company in London in 1921, by the early-twenty-first century it had become a
          major retailer for DVDs, consumer electronics, video games, and magazines—as well as
          books. HMV was anything but a reluctant capitalist, seeing books as a valuable part of its
          entertainment business. However, with the rise of e-commerce it found itself unable to
          compete with online retailers and with Amazon in particular. When setting up Amazon, Jeff
          Bezos famously drew up a list of twenty potential products he might sell—including CDs and
          software as well as books—before settling on the latter as offering the widest selection
          of inventory with which no bricks and mortar store could compete (Brandt 53-65). From this
          point, the company would expand into new products to such an extent that it would
          eventually dwarf even giants such as Walmart and become what Brad Stone has called “the
          everything store” (2013). One of the significant factors in the rise of Amazon has been
          the complete transition from book retailers being reluctant capitalists to the darling of
          Wall Street, with Bezos bringing the frequently aggressive techniques of large-scale
          retail to an industry that has generally managed to maintain at least a veneer of genteel
          capitalism alongside ongoing commodification. More significantly, its investment in
          e-books has been the driving force in a much bigger transformation of the business of
          literature.</p>
               <p>The e-book was not invented by Amazon, but until the launch of the Kindle in 2007, it
          would be fair to say that it was a minority concern for publishers. In the late eighties
          and early nineties, companies such as Eastgate Systems, Digital Book, Inc., and Sony were
          working on delivering books via formats such as floppy disk and CD-ROM, all of which were
          easily surpassed as media for distributing text by the growth of the web. As a way of
          initially transmitting text and then other multimedia content, the web quickly surpassed
          other formats, not least because of its public and open protocols and formatting language.
          Unlike early e-book formats, HTML and HTTP were non-proprietary, and the variety of
          devices upon which web texts could be displayed meant that services such as Project
          Gutenberg (which predated the web by some twenty years) could be more widely distributed
          than ever before. The emphasis at this point tended to be on <title level="m">texts</title> rather than books. It is not especially surprising that, during the
          nineties, the theoretical emphasis of much writing about the web—for example George Landow
          and Paul Delany’s <title level="m">Hypermedia and Literary Studies</title> (1994) or
          Landow’s <title level="m">Hypertext 2.0</title> (1997)—concentrated more on texts than
          books, as much a condition of the response to the poststructuralism that dominated much
          critical theory at the time. Those writers who did focus on the book, such as Birkerts in
            <title level="m">The Gutenberg Elegies</title> (2006), tended to lament its downfall,
          and so the stage seemed to be set for a contrast and conflict between books and
          technology.</p>
               <p>What this neglected, of course, was the fact that books are and have always been
          technology. Poststructural discussions of hypertext were not the only critical framework
          for how ways of reading could be considered even in the nineties, although works such as
          Roger Chartier’s <title level="m">The Order of Books</title> (translated in 1994) and
          Leila Avrin’s <title level="m">Scribes, Scripts and Books</title> (1991) seemed to operate
          within a non-overlapping magisterium when compared to the glamour exercised by the web.
          Yet even at this early stage there was a recognition by what theorists such as David
          Greetham (<title level="m">Theories</title> 27-63) referred to as the ontology of texts,
          that the physical medium affected the relation between readers and what they read. As
          Chartier observed, readers “never confront abstract, idealized texts detached from any
          materiality” (50), and while the discussion of the ontology of hypertext was rarely
          discussed, Birkert’s insistence that the web would never replace books (a position
          substantially ceded in the preface to the second edition of his own book) semi-consciously
          echoed the difficulty caused by the material reality of reading on a screen when that
          screen was attached to a desktop computer or, at best, a laptop. The experience of
          absorbing an eighteenth-century triple-decker or an epic poem while scrolling through long
          screeds of text was a daunting one for even the most dedicated reader, and to pretend
          otherwise was to ignore the convenience and efficiency that the format of print offered,
          particularly as cheap, easily-transported paperbacks. The technology of the web, while
          more immediate in many ways than the technology of print, was much less amenable to
          certain types of reading than being able to open a book at any time and in any location
          without waiting for a cumbersome computer to boot up.</p>
               <p>As such, the single most important innovation in the development and acceptance of
          e-books has been the object which people use to read them. Such objects, of course, are
          more complex than the plastic, metal, and glass of which they are made. Innovations in
          terms of software (first of all Adobe’s PDF format, followed by others such as EPUB and
          mobipocket, a proprietary variant of which Amazon uses for its own e-books), display
          technologies such as e-ink and Retina displays, and battery life have all contributed to
          the possibilities of e-readers. In addition, the business of electronic literature also
          depends on a commercial environment, the digital or media ecosystems that will fund that
          innovation. It was David Clark, a computer scientist at MIT, who first coined the phrase
          the “post PC internet” in a talk delivered in 1999 to describe the future of computing as
          “inevitably heterogeneous” (as cited by Lohr, 1999), but the term was popularized by Steve
          Jobs in 2007 at the time of the launch of the iPhone. In an interview with Bill Gates at
          the fifth “All Things Digital” conference, he very clearly saw (in a way that Gates
          equally as clearly did not) that consumers were beginning to focus on the function of
          devices rather than the devices themselves (Gates and Jobs 2007). With the release of the
          Kindle in 2007 and the iPad in 2010, such objects could finally approach the status of
          books in the sphere of reading—one in which readers tend not to view them as the
          technological marvels they are but instead focus on the content that they deliver. Of
          course, we are still very far from that stage at present: tablets are still (just) too
          novel to be perceived as anything <emph>but</emph> technology. Yet as consumer
          devices—whether for web pages, apps, movies, games, or books—it is also clear that their
          ubiquity means that we are moving into a post-PC era that is as significant for our
          computer-using habits as the invention of the desktop PC itself in the seventies or the
          adoption of the web in the nineties.</p>
               <p>With that observation in mind, a cautionary note will be useful: Greetham has warned that
          the experience of editing electronic texts can be as much a totalitarian one as something
          which is phenomenologically fluid, observing that, contrary to the exhortations of what he
          calls “pomo romanticists and liberation technologists” (“Function of [Textual] Criticism”
          40), the shift from orality to literacy was much more significant than that from print to
          electronic media. Furthermore, he suggests that it was the transition from roll to codex
          that effected a non-hierarchical, nonlinear understanding of textuality. Such an
          observation is also helpful in terms of what scholars such as Lars Sauerberg and Thomas
          Pettitt have called the “Gutenberg parenthesis”—the five hundred years or so of literate,
          print-based culture that is bracketed by the oral culture of the spoken word and the new
          oral culture of electronic and broadcast media. Pettitt’s provocative statement that the
          history of media has been “interrupted by print” and Sauerberg’s insistence that the new
          oral culture moves from “a metaphorics of linearity and reflection to a-linearity and
          co-production of ‘reality’” (79) are useful in drawing attention to certain cognitive
          factors introduced by different media objects, but the distinction is too neat: as any
          reader of Blake’s prophetic works will know, a-linearity can easily be a feature of print
          as well as oral cultures.</p>
               <p>The long history of print publishing after Blake’s death rarely served him well,
          particularly in the context of a rapidly expanding sphere of higher education in the
          second half of the twentieth century. It took a century for an authoritative collection of
          Blake’s poetry and prose to be published in Geoffrey Keynes’s Nonesuch edition of 1927,
          which separated text and image in the format that publishers could more easily distribute.
          The various Trianon Press facsimiles are beautiful objects in their own right, but they
          are too rare and expensive for everyday teaching, and prior to the appearance of the
            <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>, that tended to mean a reliance on the much
          cheaper Oxford University Press paperbacks that were restricted to <title level="m">Songs
            of Innocence and of Experience</title> (1794) and <title level="m">The Marriage of
            Heaven and Hell</title> (1790). The <title level="m">Blake Archive</title> transformed
          accessibility to the original illuminated books and yet raises its own frustrations when
          it comes actually to reading Blake in class, which is why I still often sit in the
          classroom with a Kindle as well as a computer projector displaying the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>. Recent improvements to the <title level="m">Blake
            Archive</title> mean that it does display now on tablets such as the iPad (which was
          previously not the case because of a reliance on Java which, along with Flash, was not
          supported by iOS), but trying to read the frame-based version of Erdman remains a
          less-than-pleasurable experience on such devices. Having committed to the Kindle—more from
          the folly of being a passive consumer who enjoyed having a library of several hundred
          works on one light, plastic object—I can easily access Alicia Ostriker’s Penguin edition
          of Blake’s works. However, the Erdman edition is not currently available, and illustrated
          versions such as that by Lexicos Publishing are of poor quality. The situation is slightly
          better on iBooks, where an edition by e-Art now offers more or less readable facsimiles of
          plates but with an almost complete absence of professional editing that makes it dangerous
          to recommend to students. Faber and Touch Press demonstrated as far back as 2011 just what
          the iPad, in particular, was capable of when they released an extremely impressive version
          of T. S. Eliot’s <title level="m">The Waste Land</title> (1922) as an app, combining audio
          readings, interviews, and filmed performances alongside a carefully prepared edition of
          the text. I have used the iOS app regularly for the past three years in one course that I
          teach, and it deserves much of the critical praise it has earned, drawing attention to the
          lamentable lack of anything comparable for studying Blake.</p>
               <p>Rather than conclude with a simple plea to publishers to create something similar for
          Blake’s works, however, this essay will return to the problem of ecosystems, as they are
          currently conceived by the Big Four technology companies. Rather than being a flat system
          that would allow us to understand our connection to the mineral object of the book in our
          hands, the ecosystems of Amazon, Google, and Apple, in particular, are highly vertical
          systems designed to lock consumers into a particular product and operating system. It
          should never be forgotten that the technology of the printed book has its own barriers to
          access, not least of which are literacy and access to books, but at least most of us can
          borrow a copy from the local library (assuming it hasn’t been closed down, as is currently
          happening in many smaller locations in the UK). To read the Faber and Touch Press edition
          of <title level="m">The Waste Land</title> requires an iPad. This represents the current
          commercial landscape whereby Amazon, Google, and Apple in particular attempt to monopolize
          a wide range of activities and data—which include the classroom. This is not a nostalgic
          glance backwards to a golden age of publishing: as is clear from the introduction, my
          argument is concerned with the business of literature that also exercised Blake during his
          lifetime. However, the mechanisms of distribution and production that emerged over three
          centuries—while flawed in many ways (there is, after all, a reason why the phrase “rare
          books” flows so easily from the tongue)—did not hardwire technological restrictions into
          reading in a way that Google Play, Apple iTunes, and the Amazon store so frequently do.
          While I have argued that the printed book does not automatically deserve a privileged
          position because of its ontological status over digital formats, economically it worries
          me that we are witnessing a possible balkanization of cultural formats into different
          platforms, for example in the recent spat between Amazon and Hachette. Suzanne Tamang and
          Gregory Donovan cite Evgeny Morozov’s phrase “openwashing” to refer to reading “openness
          into situations and environments where it doesn’t exist” (2014), but a more immediate
          threat of “openwashing” could be the removal of relatively open systems with monopolistic
          platforms. One of the great virtues of the use of the book in class has been the sheer
          convenience of referring to the set text; to use a well-worn cliché, it can be very much
          simpler (at least to teach) when we are all reading from the same page. If we cannot be
          sure that everyone can access the text we want to use and if readers are excluded from
          discovering new vistas from being locked out of print, our task as educators will become
          that much harder. Book culture—and its role in the classroom—is far from fragile once we
          recognize just how varied its forms are. What it should never become, however, is a
          privilege for the few, rolling back the gains that relatively true openness in digital
          communications have established over the past two decades in the pursuit of short-term
          profit. </p>

            <title level="m">Milton</title> (comp. ca. 1804-1811) to graduate students was
          retrospectively transformed by reading Silvan Tomkins and Baruch Spinoza’s <title level="m">Ethics</title> (1677) in a seminar that I subsequently taught on affect
          theory. Engaging with Spinoza’s and Tomkins’s respective writings on negative affects
          (such as shame and fear) and positive affects (such as joy) allowed me to discover in what
          I had been thinking of as a pedagogical failure an exciting pedagogical opportunity to
          rethink my unreflected assumptions about teaching and what constitutes teaching success.
          The key breakthrough came when, through a shift of perspective, I began to see that the
          shame and fear of not understanding <title level="m">Milton</title> that my students (and
          on occasion, I) experienced was a version of the affective dramas, or “Mental Fight,” in
          Blake’s works and thus an essential aspect of the reading process rather than an obstacle
          to it.</p>

               <p>Chances are that anyone who has ever taught William Blake’s prophecies has at one time or
          another wondered if this Blake is teachable. The answer depends in part on what we mean by
          “teachable.” The word is often assumed to mean “masterable,” first by the instructor and
          then by the students, to whom the instructor has transferred his or her mastery. A
          pedagogy based on this assumption is driven by the desire to be correct, to “get it
          right,” but does not ask what the “it” to be got is, what “getting it” means, or if
          seeking mastery is the way to learn. Such a pedagogy also takes for granted that we as
          readers—teachers and students alike—are positioned outside the text, remain at a distance
          from it, and contemplate it from afar. This approach is questionable in general, but, in
          the case of Blake, it is particularly problematic because he profoundly and energetically
          rejects all the assumptions behind this concept of teaching—and nowhere more so than in
          the prophecies. An approach more in tune with Blake would ask not whether he is teachable
          but how he redefines teachability. How does he teach us to teach? This essay focuses on
          the ways that I have discovered to transform my reading and teaching habits by teaching
          Blake. </p>
               <p>I write from the perspective of a Romanticist who is not a Blake scholar and whose
          graduate training, for various reasons, barely touched on him (my doctoral program was in
          Comparative Literature rather than English, was not driven by a coverage model, and took
          William Wordsworth as the paradigmatic Romantic poet).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I
            add that I have never taught a class devoted entirely to William Blake; rather, on the
            undergraduate level, I have included him in large-scale historical surveys (from the
            Romantics to the Moderns) and introductory classes on poetry, and on the graduate level
            in broader-based classes on Romanticism and thematically focused seminars in the period.
          </note> As a result, I had to teach myself Blake in order to teach his work in my courses,
          and I frankly admit that the task was extremely intimidating. All of these things would
          normally be hindrances to contributing to a volume on teaching Blake, but I have found
          that they can be turned to advantage in developing a pedagogy of non-mastery that allows
          for more engaged reading (instead of being an excuse for not reading). In essence, I use
          my limitations as the basis of a pedagogical methodology rather than seeing them as
          something simply to be overcome. What has allowed me to reconceive personal limitations as
          the basis of a pedagogy is the affective turn in the recent critical landscape.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The year 1995, which saw the publication of Eve Kosofsky
            Sedgwick and Adam Frank’s “Shame in the Cybernetic Fold” and Brian Massumi’s “The
            Autonomy of Affect” is often cited as a watershed moment in affect theory. Other
            commonly cited works include Rei Terada’s <title level="m">Feeling in Theory</title>
            (2001); <title level="m">The Affective Turn</title>, edited by Patricia Clough (2007);
            Sianne Ngai’s <title level="m">Ugly Feelings</title> (2005); Heather Love’s <title level="m">Feeling Backward</title> (2007); and <title level="m">Romanticism and the
              Emotions</title>, edited by Joel Faflak and Richard C. Sha (2014). The type of
            teaching that I advocate in this essay is close to what Andrew H. Miller explores as
            “implicative criticism” in “Implicative Criticism, or the Display of Thinking.” In their
            “Introduction: Feeling Romanticism” (in <title level="m">Romanticism and the
              Emotions</title>), Faflak and Sha state: “Once a toxic chemical, emotion now fuels the
            affective turn in humanities and social science research” (1).</note> The particular
          affect theories that I draw on come from Silvan Tomkins and Baruch Spinoza’s <title level="m">Ethics</title> (1677).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Silvan Tomkins has
            come into literary studies through queer theory and more specifically under Sedgwick’s
            influence. The current visibility of Baruch Spinoza in literary studies owes a great
            deal to the influence of Gilles Deleuze. Deleuze’s two books on Spinoza are <title level="m">Spinoza: Practical Philosophy</title> (2001) and <title level="m">Expressionism in Philosophy: Spinoza</title> (1992).</note>
               </p>
               <p>Tomkins is especially helpful on the subject of motivation; he calls “the affect system”
          “the primary motivational system in human beings” (34). We all know <emph>experientially
          </emph>that the teaching, learning, and reading processes are affectively driven, but it
          has taken a new theoretical development to tell us that affect has a legitimate place, one
          worth discussing in teaching, learning, and scholarship.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
            Lisa Ann Robertson made this point in “The Enactive Imagination: William Wordsworth’s
            Embodied Mind.” </note> Blake is in many ways an ideal candidate for such an approach,
          since affect, especially extreme affect, is writ large in his works. For example, the word
          “terror” and its related forms, such as “terrors,” “terrible,” “terrifying,” “terrified,”
          as well as “fear” and “fright” appear frequently in Blake’s poetry in general. The

          Since Blake’s oeuvre is so fear filled, is it any wonder that reading Blake frequently
          makes readers fearful? Once one begins thinking of Blake in these terms, it becomes
          obvious that readerly affect and textual affect in his works are related, but making that
          relation a matter for reflection and the motivating impulse of a teaching practice is
          another thing entirely. Such a teaching practice is precisely what I shall aim to adopt
          when I teach Blake in the future.</p>
               <p>As a result of having long struggled with Blake myself, I am in a good position to
          empathize with students’ distress at not understanding his work. Perhaps more important,
          my experience brings home to me the <emph>importance </emph>of empathizing with them. I
          can use myself as an example to help my students see that struggling with his prophecies
          is not a sign of failure but a potentially productive reading practice. Most
          fundamentally, my difficult engagement with the esoteric Blake has taught me to shift my
          relationship to his poetry, and my top priority is to enable my students to do the same.
          Achieving such a fundamental transformation of one’s orientation to texts involves a kind
          of psychotherapy for readers, which most closely resembles the desensitization techniques
          used to treat phobias; yet, it is a desensitization that allows for developing a
          sensitivity of a qualitatively different kind, one that gives the reader an alternative to
          closing herself or himself off from the work in self-defense. On the contrary, such a
          desensitization process allows the reader to open up to the work so that it can open up to
          her or him. It is perhaps an exaggeration to say that Blake’s prophetic works were phobic
          objects for me or that they are phobic objects for my students, but in the context of a
          classroom, they come pretty close. Certainly, they can raise a lot of fear or anxiety of
          being wrong or stupid and shame at not understanding. </p>
               <p>I have arrived at this view and practice of teaching as the result of a long, incremental
          process, which has not been without detours or serendipity. I tell the longer narrative
          below; here I would like to note three relatively recent events that suddenly reshaped the
          way I think of my history with Blake. First, in the Spring Semester of 2013, I taught
            <title level="m">Milton </title>in a graduate seminar on Romantic natures. Then, in
          Spring 2014, I assigned readings in the Silvan Tomkins anthology edited by Eve Kosofsky
          Sedgwick and Adam Frank and the three chapters on affect in Spinoza’s <title level="m">Ethics</title> in a graduate seminar on affect theory, an area in which I had become
          interested through the work of a doctoral student on whose dissertation committee I was
          serving. Finally, the combined impact of these factors motivated me to attend Karen
          Swann’s workshop on teaching <title level="m">Jerusalem </title>(“Learning to Teach by
          Teaching <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>”) at the 2013 conference of the North American
          Society for the Study of Romanticism.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Karen Swann’s
            pedagogical essay on <title level="m">Jerusalem</title> begins with a brilliant
            treatment of readerly affect—her own and that of her students. I attempt to get at some
            of the same issues in the thread of the present essay on affect.</note> Teaching the
          affect theory class between the two Blake-related events turned out to be transformative.
          By the strange temporality of mental processes, it retroactively prepared the groundwork
          for an “aha” moment that I had during the <title level="m">Jerusalem </title>workshop, in
          which I suddenly saw that affect had been a barrier to reading Blake for me, and affect
          was my best chance of finding a different—and happier—way of reading him. The reason I
          single out Tomkins and Spinoza from all the readings in that Spring 2013 seminar is that,
          in very different ways, they both emphasize that affects can become toxic but do not have
          to remain so; we can transform them by working on them. For Tomkins, when one particular
          affect comes to monopolize a person’s affective life, that person has developed a strong
          theory of that affect, such that s/he will find opportunities for experiencing it in a
          wide range of encounters that would be unlikely to activate it in a different type of
          person. Tomkins had a powerful impact on me because he paints vivid pictures of the
          soul-killing suffering that strong theories of negative affects inflict on those who hold
            them.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Tomkins’s most poignant examples involve shame
            and fear. For his account of “how a total affect-shame bind can be produced,” see <title level="m">Shame and Its Sisters</title> (163-165, 172-174). For his account of how a
            person can develop a strong theory of fear, see (165-168). </note> I responded to him on
          a gut level, as one cannot help responding to Blake, although in a very different register
          and on a different scale. In short, Tomkins resonated with Blake for me in that they both
          pack an affective punch. However, when it comes to weakening the hold of negative affects,
          Spinoza’s analysis is the one I found more effective in helping me shift my relation to
          Blake. </p>
               <p>The hyper-rationalist Spinoza and the anti-rationalist Blake might seem like strange
            bedfellows,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Reading Blake after Spinoza, I cannot help
            but think of Blake’s method in the treatises “All Religions Are One” and “There Is No
            Natural Religion” as akin to the “geometric style” that Spinoza adopts in the <title level="m">Ethics</title> (1677): “I shall consider human actions and appetites just as
            if it were a question of lines, planes, and bodies” (69). </note> and, to be sure, they
          disagree fundamentally on many fronts. Nonetheless, they both vehemently reject a vision
          of humanity that rests on the categories of sin and transgression. In the preface to the
          third part of the <title level="m">Ethics</title>, “Of the Origin and Nature of the
          Affects,” Spinoza states his opposition to those who “attribute the cause of human
          impotence and inconstancy . . . to I know not what vice of human nature, which they
          therefore bewail, or laugh at, or disdain, or (as usually happens) curse.” Rather than
          “curse or laugh at the affects and actions of men,” he proposes to “understand them” and
          by a method he acknowledges to be paradoxical: “I should wish to demonstrate by certain
          reasoning things which are contrary to reason, and which they [those who laugh and curse]
          proclaim to be empty, absurd, and horrible” (68-69).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In
            line with this eschewing of moral prescription, Spinoza radically redefines “good” and
            “evil” (in the scholium to proposition 39 of part 3 [IIIP39S]): “By good here I
            understand every kind of joy, and whatever leads to it, and especially what satisfies
            any kind of longing, whatever that may be. And by evil [I understand here] every kind of
            sadness, and especially what frustrates longing. For we have shown above (in P9S) that
            we desire nothing because we judge it to be good, but on the contrary, we call it good
            because we desire it. Consequently, what we are averse to we call evil” (91). In his
            introduction to the Penguin edition of the <title level="m">Ethics</title>, Stuart
            Hampshire notes that the brackets contain either variant texts or possibly the
            translator’s errors or license (xix).</note> To me, Spinoza holds promise for readers of
          Blake in that he bases his ethics on affects and does so in a non-moralistic manner. He
          aims not to set out rules to be obeyed but rather to show how the mind may pass “<emph>to
            a greater perfection</emph>,” where perfection is a state in which the mind does things
          rather than undergoes them; it becomes active rather than passive, where passivity means
          being dominated by passions (77). This active state Spinoza calls “joy” (77). In a rare
          pathos-filled sentence, he describes the plight of those who are at the mercy of their
          passions and thereby suffer many and frequent “vacillations of mind”: “We are driven about
          in many ways by external causes, and . . . like waves on the sea, driven by contrary
          winds, we toss about, not knowing our outcome and fate” (103). Hence he calls “man’s lack
          of power to moderate and restrain the affects” “bondage,” and the fourth part of the
            <title level="m">Ethics </title>is accordingly called “Of Human Bondage, or the Power of
          the Affects” (113). The entire <title level="m">Ethics </title>tends toward a
          demonstration of how the mind can escape this plight and find “the means, or way, leading
          to freedom,” which depends on “the power of reason” to counteract the affects (160). At
          this point, Spinoza states that the only and best way of becoming as free as possible is
          to gain “a true knowledge” of the affects: “Each of us has—in part, at least, if not
          absolutely—the power to understand himself and his affects, and consequently the power to
          bring it about that he is less acted on by them” (164). What appeals to me in Spinoza is
          that he takes affects not as something to be eliminated but as something to be worked on
          and through. Furthermore, he does not oppose reason to affects or hold that reason negates
          affects. Rather, affects can arise from or be aroused by reason, and over time such
          affects can grow to be more powerful than passions (165). In short, through reason,
          affects counteract affects. </p>
               <p>If ever Spinoza’s definition of “sadness” as “that <emph>passion by which it </emph>[the
          mind] <emph>passes to a lesser perfection</emph>” needed proof (77), it would find it in
          the classroom, where varieties of sadness (in Spinoza’s sense) such as fear, shame, and
          anxiety have the capacity effectively to shut down the mind and produce a painful silence.
          To avoid this result, it is crucial to keep students from feeling so lost that they simply
            disengage.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In her essay on which her <title level="m">Jerusalem</title> workshop was based, Swann speaks to the desirability of providing
            students with the means to keep from feeling totally at sea.</note> I use as teaching
          tools works such as “All Religions Are One” (comp. ca. 1788), “There Is No Natural
          Religion” (comp. ca. 1788) and especially <title level="m">The Marriage of Heaven and
            Hell</title> (1790), an historically popular point of entry into Blake.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Morris Eaves makes this point in “To Paradise the Hard Way”
            in his introduction to <title level="m">The Cambridge Companion to William Blake
            </title>(2003). </note> These are texts that challenge conventional reading habits while
          also remaining relatively accessible. I then seize on moments in such texts that can serve
          as entrées to an altogether different type of reading; drawing on the language of <title level="m">The Marriage</title>, I call this method reading through “an improvement of
          sensual enjoyment” (Erdman 39; object 14 in all copies).<note place="foot" resp="editors">
            Unless otherwise noted, all parenthetical page citations for Blake quotations refer to
            David Erdman’s edition of <title level="m">The Complete Poetry and Prose of William

            that is available on the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title> website, I also specify
            the copy I use and provide object numbers (which correspond to plate numbers in printed
            versions). Where appropriate, I supply line numbers as well.</note> My primary resource

                  </ref>, which has revolutionized the study and teaching of his works by
          making the illuminated texts easily available online and free of charge. For those
          students and professors of literature who by habit and/or training are primarily
          text-based—especially those whose Blake-habits were formed in the pre-digital age—it is a
          revelation to see how different and how much richer Blake’s plates are from the
          conventionally typeset versions in printed books. </p>
               <p>As Morris Eaves notes in his introduction to <title level="m">The Cambridge Companion to
            William Blake</title> (2003), those print editions served an important historical
          purpose when they first appeared in the Victorian age, and they continue to do so now,
          although not in the same way. Deleting the images and regularizing the idiosyncratic
          aspects of the text were then part of a mission to rescue Blake from the decades of
          neglect he had already suffered. These simplifications made “his poetry friendlier and
          more legible,” thereby “prepar[ing] the way for serious study and reflection on a scale
          previously unthinkable” (Eaves 7).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On this point Eaves
            quotes W. M. Rossetti, who “wrote in reaction to a nineteenth-century facsimile of
              <title level="m">Jerusalem</title> (1877), ‘the publication in ordinary book-form,
            without designs . . . of the <title level="m">Jerusalem</title> and the other Prophetic
            Books, is highly to be desired. Difficult under any circumstances, it would be a good
            deal <emph>less </emph>difficult to read these works in an edition of that kind, with
            clear print, reasonable division of lines, and the like aids to business-like perusal’”
            (Eaves 7). It’s hard not to imagine Blake turning over in his grave at the word
            “business-like,” and for this reason it is important to stress that such a reading is
            only an early step along a path that makes a very different kind of reading possible.
          </note> The difficulty of parsing Blake’s script is considerable, and perhaps no one has
          gauged it more aptly than Vincent De Luca, who holds that it poses as much of a challenge
          to the reader as does Blake’s hermeticism (89-90). My myopic, astigmatic, and presbyopic
          eyes would be able to sustain the reading effort only as long as I could tolerate the
          whopping headache it would be sure to bring on, which is to say not very long at all.
          However, today the availability of conventionally printed editions of Blake and the
          technological enhancements of the online <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>, including
          the textual transcriptions it provides, allow us to experience the difficult legibility of
          Blake as something more and other than a daunting physical obstacle. In particular, the
          magnification function makes it much more practical to read the facsimiles while also
          preserving a sense of the resistance they offer to legibility. Slowly tracing out the
          strokes of Blake’s lettering with our eyes, we can get some idea of the resistance that
          the physical substrate offers to the engraver; our reading activity approaches to the
          artisanal character of his production methods. To a certain degree and extent, then, we
          work along with Blake as we read, and this is one way our relation to his works shifts; we
          are no longer fully detached readers positioned over and against them. </p>
               <p>Most importantly, the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title> offers a viewing pleasure
          that one completely misses when reading only a verbal transcription, and this pleasure can
          help defuse the anxiety that any new (and I suspect many a veteran) reader of Blake
          experiences when confronted with his prophecies. The reader is then more likely to relax
          enough to begin to relinquish the desire for mastery and assume a less defensive, more
          open disposition toward the text. This is where affect comes in. I encourage my students
          to cultivate and reflect on their affective relationship to Blake. Through this process, I
          strive to help them do two related things: (1) to see their reading experience not as
          outside the text but rather as part of the drama of intellectual warfare at the center of
          so many of Blake’s works; and (2) to perform a kind of inner recalibration that allows
          them to re-experience their fear of not understanding him as joyful exhilaration and wild
          exuberance. This transformation can perhaps be thought of as turning intellectual terror
          into an experience of the sublime. One can facilitate this process for students by
          directing them to places in Blake’s <foreign>oeuvre </foreign>where it is thematized. A
          prime example is the speaker’s vow to wage “Mental Fight” in the famous poem included in
          some copies of <title level="m">Milton</title> (Erdman 95; see copies A and B, object 2,
          l. 38). Once students come to think of their struggles with the esoteric Blake as a
          “mental fight” they are obliged to wage in their own right, they can also come to see that
          many aspects of the works that bewilder them are those that dramatize or enact this
          “fight.” There Blake does what in the prefatory poem he says he will do. Coming this far
          can prepare students to rethink their acts of reading precisely <emph>as</emph> acts in
          the strong sense of the word, or, even better, experience their reading activity as dramas
          on the order of Blake’s poems and/or of Blake’s visionary dramas as unrolling within them.
          Thus, they become, as it were, dramatic characters, the “Visionary forms dramatic,” in the
          poems (Erdman 257; <title level="m">Jerusalem </title>copy E, plate 98, l. 29). </p>
               <p>My story begins with the first time that I taught a course on Romanticism. As an overly
          conscientious new assistant professor, I felt obliged to include some of the esoteric
          Blake in my syllabus despite my discomfort with him. I was worried about my authority in
          the classroom in general, but that worry was nowhere more intense than with this Blake. My
          response at the time was to shore up my authority by developing as much expertise as I
          could in the short time available, and to do so, I set out to read Geoffrey Keynes’s
            <title level="m">The Complete Writings of William Blake </title>(1966) from cover to
          cover along with a good chunk of the extant criticism. Any reasonable person would have
          realized from the outset that this was an impossible task, and, sure enough, it wasn’t
          long before I was forced to rethink my strategy. I hit a wall once I embarked on longer,
          more complex, and more daunting works, which, I stress, I was reading for the first time.
          I can best illustrate why by recurring to one day when I spent ten hours reading such
          works. By early evening, I was in a mental state that was akin to tripping—or to what I
          imagined tripping was like. I felt as if I was having a drug-free psychedelic experience.
          The feeling was so intense and overwhelming that I remember it vividly decades later.
          Since my reading was in the service of teaching, which then meant mastery to me, the
          experience felt profoundly disabling. However, when I managed to bracket the approaching
          semester and immerse myself in the reading experience itself, I felt exhilarated. In fact,
          I was laughing, and I made everyone I met that evening laugh by saying that if the illegal
          drug trade knew about the cheap and perfectly legal high that Blake provided, they would
          burn every copy, because he could put them out of business. For me, the big difference
          between now and then is that at the time it did not occur to me that I could use this
          response in my teaching, and if back then someone had suggested that I try to do so, I
          would have told that person in no uncertain terms that he or she was insane. </p>
               <p>Only by virtue of reading, rereading, and teaching Blake year after year and semester
          after semester did I slowly grow to feel that my personal enjoyment did not have to remain
          separate from what I did in the classroom. In the course of repeatedly engaging with a
          number of his texts (at this time I was dealing only with the texts, not the
          illuminations), I found myself positively warming to some, namely, the manifesto-like ones
          that I have mentioned above: “There Is No Natural Religion,” “All Religions Are One,” and
            <title level="m">The Marriage</title>. Over time, I came to discern that these works
          could be read precisely as Blakean lessons in reading, most obviously through their
          insistence on other modes of perception beyond those available through the five physical,
          “bounded” senses. For the purposes of this essay, in the next section I focus on <title level="m">The Marriage</title> to exemplify the pedagogy of non-mastery that teaches
          with, rather than despite, the instructor’s (i.e., my) limitations. However, before I go
          any further, let me hasten to add that none of this is to say that I think knowing Blake
          well is a hindrance to teaching him or that ignorance is the great desideratum of teaching
          or scholarship. Not only does Blake scholarship, which is particularly vibrant at this
          moment, disprove any such absurd claim, it also includes voices that speak in a spirit
          similar to the one that I advocate here.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For examples,
            Eaves uses the metaphors of exploration and extreme sports for reading Blake (14-15). In
            a similar spirit, Mary Lynn Johnson declares: “The best way into the time-twisting,
            identity-scrambling otherworld of Blake’s <title level="m">Milton: A Poem</title> (c.
            1804-18) is to set aside guidebooks, including this one, take a deep breath, and follow
            the hero as he breaks through the surface of the title page—alone, without a ‘companion’
            . . . to brave the swirling abyss of the unknown” (231). She goes on to liken the
            process as “a wilderness-survival test” (231). The example of Blake scholarship that to
            my knowledge goes farthest in this direction is Ron Broglio’s “Living Inside the Poem:
            MOOs and Blake’s <title level="m">Milton</title>.” </note> What I am saying is that
          those who are less comfortable with Blake can take heart and, as an added bonus, plug into
          the excitement of that scholarship all the more deeply. </p>
               <p>For reasons of economy, I choose from the many passages of <title level="m">The Marriage
          </title>that can be read as lessons for reading three of the “Memorable Fancies”: the
          narrator’s dinner with Isaiah and Ezekiel (plate 12), the one where the speaker and an
          angel set out to show each other their eternal lots (plates 17-20), and the one where the
          Devil and the Angel contend (plates 22-24). In plate 12 where the speaker questions the
          prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel, I suggest that modes of perception align with interpretive
          approaches: <quote>
                     <p rend="noCount">The Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel dined with me, and I
              asked them how they dared so roundly to assert. that God spake to them; and whether
              they did not think at the time, that they would be misunderstood, &amp; so be the
              cause of imposition.</p>
                     <p rend="noCount">Isaiah answer’d. “I saw no God, nor heard any, in a finite organical
              perception; but my senses discover’d the infinite in every thing, and as I was then
              perswaded. &amp; remain confirm’d; that the voice of honest indignation is the voice
              of God, I cared not for consequences but wrote. (Erdman 38)</p>
                  </quote> I understand
          this exchange to raise one of the basic questions of Biblical hermeneutics: whether to
          take scripture literally or figuratively, which is to say imaginatively, and I take Isaiah
          to be challenging the assumption that the default mode of interpretation is the literal
          one, which is based on “finite organical perception.” To take this point beyond canonical
          sacred texts and to demonstrate what a different kind of perception might look like, I
          find it helpful to turn to the poem that Blake includes in his letter to Thomas Butts of
          22 November, 1802—a text that elaborates on alternative, expanded modes of sensory
          experience: among them, the “double vision” that sees with an inward eye in addition to an
          outer eye (Erdman 721; l. 28). What appears to the “outward” eye merely “a Thistle across
          my way” is to the “inward Eye . . . an old Man grey” who speaks prophecies to Blake
          (Erdman 721; l. 30, l. 29).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The final lines of the poem
            go on to “threefold” and “fourfold vision,” which contrast with “Single vision &amp;
            Newton’s sleep” (Erdman 722; l. 88), but since they introduce “Beulah,” and with it
            Blake’s mythological geography, at this point they are liable to be as confusing as they
            are to be helpful.</note>
               </p>
               <p> Infinite perception is associated with daring: “I cared not for consequences,” Isaiah
          says. I suggest that perhaps we can become the type of reader who rises to Isaiah’s
          challenge by being daring as well, and for a model, I point to the young man who contends
          with the moralizing angel on plate 17. The angel, who would frighten him with a vision of
          his eternal damnation, demands security. His approach is to show the young man the abyss
          while they both remain outside it: they “held by the roots of trees and hung over this
          immensity,” as a frightful apocalyptic scene unrolls below them (Erdman 41). In contrast,
          the young man proposes that they throw caution to the winds and plunge in: “if you please
          we will commit ourselves to this void, and see whether providence is here also, if you
          will not I will?” (Erdman 41). When the speaker finally acts on this impulse, he finds
          that the Angel’s fear is what generated the fearsome sight. When the angel is gone, the
          young man is rewarded for his fearlessness with an idyllic pastoral vision: “I found
          myself sitting on a pleasant bank beside a river by moon light hearing a harper who sung
          to the harp” (Erdman 41-42). </p>
               <p> Once we reach this point, I suggest that as readers we might think of the positions that
          the angel and the devil take to this vision as indicating the available relations that we
          as readers can assume to the text. These come down to the alternative between reading at a
          remote distance from the text and immersing oneself in it, where we understand the
          immersion as our own implication in the text. It seems to me that we, professors and
          students alike, habitually read as angels. Eager and sometimes desperate to find a firm
          interpretive foothold, we place ourselves outside the text without considering whether or
          not there are other possible stances. But just as Isaiah showed us an alternative to
          assuming that the default mode of interpretation is literal, the final “Memorable Fancy”
          shows us that we can choose an alternative position, and it does so by showing that by the
          end of the work, the angel becomes a devil and reads like one. This section has particular
          pedagogical value, for, if the angel, who embodies conventional authority, can make the
          leap, can’t anyone, including us? Finally, the wild humor of the entire scene aids the
          process of transformation because the silent or outright laughter it provokes is a form of
          “sensual enjoyment,” and if we give ourselves over to it, it can cleanse “the doors of
          perception” (Erdman 39), as Blake says. </p>
               <p>To turn now to the Angel’s transformation: it occurs through contention, illustrating
          Blake’s axiom that “Opposition is true Friendship” (Erdman 42). The context is that the
          Angel and a Devil argue about the nature of God. The Devil pronounces the heterodox
          conviction that “The worship of God is. Honouring his gifts in other men each according to
          his genius. and loving the greatest men best . . . for there is no other God”: <quote>The
            Angel hearing this became almost blue but mastering himself he grew yellow, &amp; at
            last white pink &amp; smiling, and then replied, “Thou Idolater, is not God One? &amp;
            is not he visible in Jesus Christ? and has not Jesus Christ given his sanction to the
            law of ten commandments . . . ?” (Erdman 43)</quote> In tracing the color changes the
          Angel undergoes, the young man provides a wickedly funny genealogy of the anodyne
          renditions of angels in much religious painting. The saccharine, benign pastel images that
          we have come to expect are exposed as nothing but a cover for the suppressed rage of the
          orthodox when their dogma is challenged. I can never refrain from laughing at the
          incongruity of this rage vis-à-vis typical cherubic representations. By giving in to the
          impulse to laugh, I convey to the students that it’s okay for them to laugh too because
          literature can be funny, and it can be funny in order to say something important. </p>
               <p>The Angel holds his ground in the first round of his argument with the Devil, but he
          meets his match when the Devil counterattacks him, asserting: “no virtue can exist without
          breaking these ten commandments: Jesus was all virtue, and acted from impulse: not from
          rules” (Erdman 43). Here the Angel, up to now so cautious, becomes as daring as the young
          man and Isaiah. Apparently no longer caring for consequences or physical danger, he
          “stretched out his arms embracing the flame of fire &amp; he was consumed and arose as
          Elijah” (Erdman 43). This self-immolation effects his transformation, and he becomes the
          young man’s reading buddy: <quote>
                     <p rend="noCount">Note. This Angel, who is now become a
              Devil, is my particular friend: we often read the Bible together in its infernal or
              diabolical sense which the world shall have if they behave well</p>
                     <p rend="noCount">I have also: The Bible of Hell: which the world shall have whether
              they will or no. (Erdman 44)</p>
                  </quote> Here the speaker speaks with exuberant
          defiance, adopting first the voice of a cajoling parent. The Bible in its infernal sense
          is a reward for good behavior in the logic of “be good now, and you’ll get ice cream
          later” (i.e., deferred gratification) and then that of harsh parental authority—you’ll get
          the Bible of Hell, whether you like it or not. In both cases, the speaker mimics the voice
          of conventional morality to defy it. This is one way in which the poem stages a marriage
          of heaven and hell; here it is a marriage of voices in which one parodies or, in Blakean
          language, “imposes” on the other (Erdman 37, 42). More particularly, this passage exposes
          the <foreign>ressentiment</foreign> at the basis of moral and religious authority, which
          it counters through parody. </p>
               <p>I have taught <title level="m">The Marriage </title>to undergraduate and graduate
          students alike. Now I would like to turn to the challenge of teaching the most daunting of
          Blake’s works to graduate students, and here I draw on my recent experience of teaching
            <title level="m">Milton</title>. I must admit that we did not get very far with the poem
          in this class, and I did not find it a particularly satisfying pedagogical experience.
          Truth to tell, by any usual definition, it was largely a failure, and for that reason, it
          haunted me, but not in a completely negative way. What I could not forget was the
          intensity of the work and of the classroom atmosphere, and, besides, I love a challenge. I
          am convinced that I learned more about teaching the esoteric Blake from this teaching
          failure than I would have if this experience had been what generally passes for
          successful. The fact that I had a graduate student audience defined this pedagogical
          situation to a great extent. The advantages of teaching a difficult text to graduate
          students rather than undergraduates are obvious, but there are particular challenges too.
          Since graduate students are far more invested in achieving mastery, they feel the
          imperative to understand much more intensely than undergraduates do and consequently are
          more terrified at the prospect of not “getting it.” It is as if non-understanding were
          specifically disallowed by the implicit contract they signed on entering graduate school.
          Other defining factors were two decisions that I made because of time limitations: I
          reluctantly decided not to assign <title level="m">The Marriage</title>, despite my
          conviction of its great pedagogical value, and I dedicated only two, three-hour seminar
          meetings to <title level="m">Milton</title>, which was not nearly enough time. Both of
          these decisions exacerbated the inherent difficulty of the work for my students, and they
          understandably panicked. Since they experienced their panic as failure, their distress
          threatened to prevent us from doing any work at all on the poem. So I had to come up on
          the spot with some ways of averting that outcome. </p>
               <p>First, I suggested that one reason they were so unnerved was that they were each assuming
          they were the only ones who were struggling, and I assured them that this was not the
          case; Blake’s late prophecies bewilder everyone who approaches them for the first time.
          Stating this explicitly may seem trivial, but the students reported that it helped a great
          deal, and the atmosphere in the room became palpably more relaxed. Second, since I found
          myself tactically quoting <title level="m">The Marriage</title> to illuminate <title level="m">Milton</title>, I reversed course and made it available to them. Working
          through these various difficulties made us bond as a group and allowed us to continue with
          a sense of shared purpose. Finally, I took advantage of the fact that <title level="m">Milton </title>is one of Blake’s most spectacular illuminated books and displayed the
          various copies of some of the most stunning illustrations side by side, using the
          invaluable “compare” function on the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>. Seeing these
          versions raised some fundamental questions, including ones concerning the definition of
          what constitutes a “work” by Blake. Is it all the copies? Since the various copies do not
          all contain the same plates or order the plates in the same way, are they the same work or
          not? Are they all copies of an original? Are they all originals? Is each one a different
          work? Is the metal plate the original from which all the copies derive? Is it part of the
          work, or is the work limited to one or all the printed versions? Is the “real” <title level="m">Milton</title> for Blake and for us perhaps best thought of as mental—that is,
          the simultaneous totality of all the copies, which we can see only in imagination?<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Seeing the side-by-side plates on the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title> is not exactly the same thing, but it can be a step toward that
            impossible total feat.</note> Does the language of original and copy that, as Walter
          Benjamin has taught us, works well with mechanical reproduction<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Walter Benjamin’s “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical
            Reproduction.”</note> apply to Blake’s very different mode of production? Exactly what
          are we referring to when we refer to <title level="m">Milton</title>? </p>
               <p>We did not come to any absolute conclusions about these questions, and there may be no
          definitive answers to them. These questions can, however, make us aware that our default
          ways of thinking about them are not neutral but rather have been formed by what has been,
          until recently, the dominant mode of production of our time. Perhaps we need a different
          conceptual language to talk about Blake’s copies of the illuminated texts. Among all these
          unanswered questions, one thing became clear: now that, thanks to the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>, the illuminated works are readily available and at no cost, we
          are not really talking about <title level="m">Milton </title>or any other of Blake’s
          illuminated works if we talk only about the words. In fact, it may be wrongheaded to see
          the designs as secondary or supplementary to the written text, and we misrecognize the
          text also if we take a verbal transcription in conventional print as equivalent to Blake’s
          lettering. As De Luca has pointed out, Blake pushes the lettering of the illuminated books
          as close to the visual as possible, with strokes of letters curling off into vine-like
          structures (89-90). More specifically, we talked about how the different colorings on
          versions of the same plate created radically different moods or atmospheres, and I
          suggested that one might think about them in relation to the references to atmosphere in
          the verbal text or “States of the Human Soul,” which are in this work more numerous (or
          more multi-dimensional) than the contraries of “innocence” and “experience.” Perhaps most
          fundamentally, the power and vividness of the illuminations can draw students in even when
          they feel that they have not been able to understand much. My ultimate hope is that the
          attraction that the illuminations hold will help students eventually come to question
          understanding, or at least the kind of understanding that rests on “Single vision &amp;
          Newton’s sleep” (Erdman 722) as the goal of reading Blake. I shall say more about this
          below.</p>
               <p>This is where I stood with Blake when I attended the <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>
          workshop. Participants offered a number of innovative suggestions for teaching <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>, which apply as well to all of Blake’s most challenging
            works.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For example, Swann suggested having students
            write their own Proverbs of Hell and/or create their own mythological character. Drawing
            on the popularity of video games, Peter Otto said that asking students to think of
            reading <title level="m">Jerusalem</title> as moving through a virtual space could
            connect Blake to the world of popular culture they know well. For <title level="m">Milton</title> as itself a virtual space, see Broglio, who offers the <title level="m">Milton</title> MOO as an example of how new media can be performative in the
            context of literary studies. After detailing the “rich literary elements” that make
            Blake’s poetry an apt test case for pushing the immersive possibilities of MOOs, he
            adds: “Blake had already thought through the problem of creating immersive environments.
            His characters are continually creating windows and doors into new worlds or falling
            through space and time in such a way that the fall creates both space and time. Through
            their immersive interaction with one another and their surroundings, Blake’s characters
            forge the world upon which the narrative is staged. In like manner, Blake wants the
            reader to immerse him/herself in the poem such that ‘doors of perception’ open for the
            reader, creating new worlds and new possibilities” (par. 7).</note> However, my own
          experience with Blake suddenly crystallized when Swann led the discussion to the subject
          of forgiveness and the refusal to forgive in <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>. Her
          example was Albion’s refusal to forgive Jerusalem, and one could also add the spectre of
          Los’s refusal to forgive Albion. As Swann pointed out, the refusers harden themselves and
          stand on the rock of the law. When the “Saviour” calls to Albion, “we are One; forgiving
          all Evil” (Erdman 146), Albion brutally rebuffs him: “here will I build my Laws of Moral
          Virtue!” (Erdman 147). All of a sudden it occurred to me that we do the same thing when we
          search for an authoritative interpretation, when we want to be sure we understand, when we
          seek to stand on solid interpretive ground. In the context of <title level="m">Milton</title>, we act like Satan (who here is not “of the Devils party” and therefore
          not a “true Poet” [Erdman 35]) when he imposes his code of sin and punishment and declares
          himself the only God: <quote>

                     </lg>
                  </quote> Thus, we must enter the same “Mental Fight” that Blake declares in the
          preface of <title level="m">Milton </title>(Erdman 95; see copies A and B, object 2, l.
          38). This fight is the drama that Blake thematizes and enacts in all of the prophecies
          centering on mythological characters. The enactive aspect is one reason <title level="m">Milton </title>is so challenging. It does not merely say that the title character opens
          up and falls through multiple dimensions of space and time; it performs those events and
          forces the reader to experience them. We barely engage with the poem unless we enter its
          multi-dimensional universe, but when we do so, it engulfs and disorients us. The trick, as
          Mary Lynn Johnson and Ron Broglio (for example) each point out, is to realize that this is
          the means by which the poem “helps cleanse the [our] doors of perception” (Johnson 231;
          Broglio). Blake is about the toxic effects of the desire for mastery, and <title level="m">Milton </title>teaches us to give up the master’s position by giving us no choice but
          to do so. So, if we do not pass through a moment of the reading process where we feel that
          we do not and cannot “get it,” we stand little or no chance of “getting it.” This means
          that undergoing the negative affects in the first place is absolutely necessary. As has
          often been noted, <title level="m">Milton </title>and <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>
          contain biographical elements where Blake strikes back at those he considered the enemies
          of his imagination, such as his well-meaning but hopelessly conventional patron William
          Hayley. However, as Blake declares in a number of letters, it is most urgently a battle
          that he was obliged to wage again and again within himself, for he had to contend with his
          inner Urizenic reasoner in order to keep his visionary imagination alive. For our students
          and for us, it is a battle of reading and interpretation in which we are called to
          tolerate uncertainty and confusion in the classroom and put our authority on the line. In
            <title level="m">Milton</title>, the moment of risking authority occurs when the title
          character identifies with Satan and turns against the Satan in himself: <quote>
                     <lg>
                        <l>I in my Selfhood am that Satan: I am that Evil One!</l>
                        <l>He is my Spectre! in my obedience to loose him from my Hells</l>
                        <l>To claim the Hells, my Furnaces, I go to Eternal Death. (Erdman 108; copy B, object
                12, ll. 30-32)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> Our professorial “Selfhood” is our desire to have the authoritative
          reading. If we can relinquish it and dare to admit to our students that we often feel
          unsure when reading Blake, our self-annihilation can also feel freeing, for the
          responsibility of always knowing and always having to be right is a heavy burden. </p>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">Milton</title> is the ideal work for such teaching because it pushes the
          issue of understanding to the crisis point with the refrain that punctuates the Bard’s
          song: “Mark well my words! they are of your eternal salvation” (Erdman 96; copy B, objects
          3, 5 [twice], 7 and 9). When “eternal salvation” is the stakes of “mark[ing] well,” could
          they possibly be any higher? They are certainly higher than feeling or looking stupid, the
          typical readerly fear with Blake. Eaves wittily remarks that “such ultimate claims on
          ‘your’ devotion can leave you feeling hung out to dry, with only yourself to blame for
          your failures” (6). For what does it mean to mark the Bard’s words, and how do we know if
          we are marking them well? We see one consequence of not marking his words well through
          those who dwelt on the “mild banks” of the river Ololon in Eden (Erdman 115; copy B,
          object 19). Blake writes: <quote>

                  earlier: <quote>

                              </quote>In this passage, the reader likely construes the dwellers on the
                  river banks as subject and Milton as direct object, but it is equally possible to
                  read “those who Milton drove” as a poetic inversion, so that subject and object
                  are reversed. Lines 31 and 32 of this plate fix the syntax: “they had . . . /
                  Driven Milton . . .” One could perhaps take the difference between the two
                  passages and/or the ambiguous syntax (ll. 16-17) as examples of perspectival
                  switching, a common occurrence in Blake.</note>

                     </lg>
                  </quote> As readers, however, we learn at the outset that it was “A Bards prophetic
          Song!” that “mov’d Milton, who walkd [sic] about in Eternity . . . To go into the deep . .
          .” (Erdman 96). Ostensibly, the speaker invokes the Muse to “Say [this]
          <emph>first</emph>” so that the reader will not repeat the mistake of the dwellers on the
          banks of Ololon, who in Blake’s manifold vision, are also the people of Ololon and
          Milton’s “Sixfold Emanation” (Erdman 96, emphasis mine). The irony is that he has come to
          redeem them. Apparently, the danger is that we will mistake our redeemer for our enemy and
          the dire process through which redemption occurs as a grievous error. </p>
               <p>It is possible to puzzle indefinitely over the meaning of the urgent imperative “Mark
          well my words! they are of your eternal salvation.” Perhaps our “eternal salvation” is to
          keep reading and rereading. At any rate, the imperative to “[m]ark” is another way that
            <title level="m">Milton </title>implicates the reader in the text; it makes us actors in
          the drama that <title level="m">Milton </title>relates. Perhaps <title level="m">marking</title> can also be taken as the engraving and printing process, in which case,
          as suggested above, the reader participates with Blake in producing and printing the words
          of the poem. He calls us to be not only readers but also his co-writers. Talking in
          general about the reader as participant and implicated in the work is easy; the hard part
          is to take up the mind-bending work of seeing how this works specifically in any one Blake
          text. It is a labor that we as readers must perform anew with every reading of a Blake
          work. On one level, they are all the stories of our reading/textual production.</p>
               <p>I close with some remarks on how, building on what I learned between the Spring Semester
          of 2013 and now, I would teach <title level="m">Milton </title>differently in the future.
          To sum up what I have already stated: I would prepare the ground by using the works
          mentioned above as providing a relatively user-friendly introduction to Blake’s
          prophecies, and I would build flexibility into the syllabus so as to be able to adjust the
          class time according to the needs of the students in any particular group; this is the
          change that makes all others possible. For all assignments and class discussions, I would
          integrate attention to the two things I have emphasized in this essay—the affective and
          visual aspects of the works—into considerations of the verbal texts. I would encourage
          students to <emph>look</emph> at all of the plates from first to last before reading.
          Going from “There Is No Natural Religion” and “All Religions Are One” to <title level="m">The Marriage </title>and then <title level="m">Milton </title>will have the added
          benefit of providing some sense of Blake’s evolution as a writer and artist. To take full
          advantage of the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>, I would devote one class (or as
          much of it as necessary) to taking the interactive tour of the website (available from the
          site’s homepage) with my students; now that most of them have laptops and/or tablets, they
          could play along instead of just watching me do it. I have found the “search” function on
          the homepage and the “show me” and “compare” buttons for individual plates especially
          useful. By allowing the user to enlarge the image, see a visual description of it, and
          read a textual transcription, the “show me” button helps educate the reader’s eye in how
          to view the plates and in some cases how to make viewing and reading work together. A few
          dry runs with colleagues, who have all responded with amazement and rapt delight, have
          convinced me that exploring its capabilities stands a good chance of hooking the viewer on
          Blake. I would frame our discussion of <title level="m">The Marriage</title> by asking how
          we get from the various couples on the title page to the “marriage” between the young man
          and the angel at the end of the work. The illustration description of the title plate with
          some uncertainty identifies the two large figures at the bottom of the plate as a woman
          (on the left) and a man (on the right). Yet the figure on the right looks more like
          another woman to me. Does that figure’s gender make a significant difference? How might we
          think about going from a marriage between a man and woman or between two women to a
          marriage between two men? These questions can set up a discussion of the pronounced
            homo<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See, for example, Susan Fox’s <title level="m">Poetic Form in Blake’s Milton</title> (1976) and Christopher Z. Hobson’s <title level="m">Blake and Homosexuality</title> (2000).</note> eroticism that many viewers
          perceive in the illustrations of <title level="m">Milton</title>, about which I shall say
          more below. One could also ask about the spatial organization of the title plate of <title level="m">The Marriage</title>. If, as the illustration description suggests, the bottom
          left of the image is hell and the right heaven, what do we make of the horizontal division
          about a third of the way down the page? We would normally expect heaven to be above and
          hell below. This complication of direction and dimension, which participates in satirizing
          conventional views of good and evil in the work, can set the stage for the more
          thoroughgoing dislocations of <title level="m">Milton</title>. </p>
               <p>For both <title level="m">The Marriage </title>and <title level="m">Milton</title>, using
          the “compare” feature allows students to see for themselves that, when colored
          differently, copies of the same plate can produce startlingly different impressions. It is
          also important for them to see that not all copies of <title level="m">Milton
          </title>contain the same plates; for example, the preface on the “Daughters of
          Inspiration” and the “Daughters of Memory” and the poem “And did those feet,” the best
          known lines in the poem, appear only in copies A and B (Erdman 95). For <title level="m">Milton</title>, in addition to using the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>, I
          would also assign the volume in the Princeton edition of <title level="m">The Illuminated
            Books of William Blake </title>(1993) for two reasons: the scholarly apparatus of each
          includes things that the other does not, and the reader/viewer enters the book format and
          the website in different ways. This is all the more the case given that digital technology
          advances rapidly and thus also rapidly becomes obsolete. A case in point is the <title level="m">Milton </title>MOO formerly supported by the <title level="m">Romantic Circles
          </title>website. “Changing servers and configurations and the by-now advanced age of the
          MOO platform” have made site managers at <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title> unable
          “to keep up support for it.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> David Rettenmaier, Site
            Manager, Romantic Circles, personal
            communication (17 Mar. 2015). </note> When the MOO was up and running, one could turn
          the pages of the “book” form of <title level="m">Milton </title>with one’s hand in virtual
          reality, and this possibility had profound implications for the reader’s relation to the
          work. As Broglio writes: <quote>This famous opening page shows Milton naked, having cast
            off the robes of promise, and pushing with his right hand through the ether as he begins
            the descent to the vegetative world. The reader upon opening the book and beginning a
            descent into its pages places a hand over the upper right hand corner to flip the page.
            Doing so, the reader’s hand is placed over Milton’s hand so that the two perform a
            descent at the same time. Whose hand it is flipping and descending is up for grabs.
            Remember that Milton’s hand is drawn with Blake’s hand but Blake has been possessed and
            commanded to write by Milton who is possessed and inspired by the bard. The reader
            cannot enter the poem, that is enter <title level="m">Milton</title>, without having
            Milton enter the reader. The physicality of reading allows Blake to collapse the
            reader's second position—outside the poem—into part of the first position—being immersed
            in the poem’s field of play. (par. 12)</quote> Now that the MOO is, unfortunately, no
          longer accessible, only the <title level="m">Illuminated Books</title> edition of <title level="m">Milton </title>allows the reader’s hand to merge with Milton’s on the title
          page. Nonetheless, Broglio’s essay, which I would assign only <emph>after</emph> the class
          had done a first reading of the poem without secondary material, can still give readers a
          sense of <title level="m">Milton</title> as an interactive, multi-dimensional virtual
          space and of Blake himself as a constructor of virtual realities well before digital
          technology came into being. By the same token, this essay can help students—especially
          gamers but also digital natives in general—transform their disorientation, confusion,
          frustration, and fear into a virtual reality experience.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
            For drawing on students' facilities with immersive digital environments, I again
            acknowledge Otto’s suggestion during Swann’s 2013 workshop on <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>. See note 18 above. I came upon Broglio’s essay more than a year
            after attending the workshop.</note> The transformation is a crucial part of the
          process; this is also to say that one completely misses Blake’s visionary rush if one does
          not lose one’s bearings in the first place. We all habitually live in the Newtonian world
          of single vision, which we take as <emph>the</emph> world, and we need to be forced out of
          this perspective over and over again. If students do not initially feel lost, they will
          never realize that their doors of perception need to be cleansed in the first place and
          therefore never experience the cleansing. Blake is about this transformation.</p>
               <p>To offer concrete examples of how the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title> and the
          Princeton <title level="m">Illuminated Books</title> edition of <title level="m">Milton
          </title>can facilitate a teaching and reading practice that brings the verbal and visual
          aspects of the work together, I focus on the title plate and the plate where Milton
          contends with and sculpts Urizen (object 17 in the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>;
          plate 15 in the Princeton edition). Under the illustration appears the caption: “To
          Annihilate the Selfhood of Deceit and False Forgiveness.” Both the “illustration
          description” of this plate on the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title> and the editorial
          apparatus of the Princeton <title level="m">Milton</title> point out that Milton’s right
          foot, which—I add—is associated with poetic inspiration at key moments in the work,
          visually enacts the annihilation of the Selfhood by splitting the very word into its two
          constituent syllables.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The illustration description on
            the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title> reads: “His right foot and its tarsus are
            prominent as it breaks the word “Self- -hood” in the brief text below” [“To Annihilate
            the Selfhood of Deceit and False Forgiveness”]. The annotation in the Princeton edition
            makes a similar point: “With his right foot Milton quite literally breaks the ‘Self-
            -hood’ in the text while clutching the projected embodiment of that selfhood (compare
            Milton dividing his name on the title page)” (24).</note> The commentary in the
          Princeton edition explicitly links this plate to the title plate, where Milton’s “right
          hand and arm also cut his name in two” (20);<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The full
            sentence in the annotation reads: “His [Milton’s] right hand and arm also cut his name
            in two, an action suggesting that the route to apocalypse (and perhaps, to us, of an
            understanding of the book) is blocked by a ‘selfhood’ that must be self-annihilated
            (compare Milton’s foot breaking his ‘Self- -hood’ on plate 15)” (20). This plate
            corresponds to object 17 on the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>. </note> an
          action suggesting that the route to apocalypse (and perhaps, to us, of an understanding of
          the book) is blocked by a ‘selfhood’ that must be self-annihilated. Compare this moment of
          annihilation to Milton’s foot breaking his ‘Self-hood’ on plate 15 or object 17 in the
            <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>. Here again, word and image together enact an
          annihilation of the selfhood. Could this annihilation be related, I would ask, to the
          homoeroticism suggested by the poem’s numerous illustrations of muscular naked men,
          frequently with prominent buttocks? To entertain the question, I would display via the
            <title level="m">Blake Archive</title> some of the most striking examples as a
            group.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In addition to object 17, they include the
            title page (copy B, object 1, which shows a rear view of Milton leaving eternity),
            object 9 (where two arguably male bodies stand to the left of a male figure in flames),
            and illustrations where a man “enters” another man: object 31 (where Milton in the form
            of a star enters the foot of William Blake), object 36 (the mirror image of 31), where
            Robert Blake takes the place of William, and object 46 (where Los enters the
            speaker).</note> The “light box” feature on the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>,
          which allows the user to group different objects on the same screen (but, alas, not save
          the grouping), would be ideal for this exercise.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
            However, the light box is the one feature on the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>
            with which I have had the most trouble. The problem seems to be with security settings,
            which I cannot change on my university’s computer network. My hope is that a
            technological solution will be found for this issue in the not-too-distant future.

               </p>
               <p>As a theoretical support for this queer reading of Blake, I would introduce Leo Bersani’s
          notion of “shattering” into the discussion, for it is specifically a “shattering” of the
          “structured self” through sexual acts. In a reading of <title level="m">Civilization and
            Its Discontents</title> (1930), Bersani argues that for Freud the shattering power of
          sexual enjoyment can be traced back to the species’ atavistic memory of “the experience,
          or rather the smell of sex before we adopted an erect posture,” and Bersani characterizes
          this Freudian speculation as “the fantasy of a mythic, prehistoric convulsing of our
          physical being in the passionate sniffing of a male on all fours” (17).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For the effect of sexual enjoyment on the “structured self,” see Bersani
            (38). Bersani (17) discusses the relevant passages in Freud, which can be found in the
            Norton edition of <title level="m">Civilization and Its Discontents</title> (46-47).
          </note> The scene of anal intercourse between men that Bersani finds in Freud and its
          disruptive effect on the integrity of the self seem uncannily congruent with the
          homoeroticism of Milton’s annihilation of his own selfhood in his intimate contention with
          Urizen. In any case, the point is not for the commentary to do the work of seeing for the
          students but to give them examples of how they might proceed on their own. In allowing the
          user to see as many copies side by side as s/he chooses, the “compare” button
          exponentially increases the “sensual enjoyment” one experiences by looking at any one copy
          alone, while also facilitating the all-important but never finally accomplished discipline
          of cleansing “the doors of perception.” </p>
               <p>As valuable as the bibliography and the introduction to (or initiation in) the critical
          literature that the digital and book editions provide are the indications of scholarly
          disagreement, sometimes on the most basic things. The Princeton <title level="m">Illuminated Books </title>edition of <title level="m">Milton </title>is particularly
          instructive on this score. For example, its annotations often note that different scholars
          identify figures in some designs differently. Perhaps the most telling case is that of the
          three nude figures in plate 8 of the Princeton edition, for whom the editors Robert Essick
          and Joseph Viscomi find eight extant interpretations in the secondary literature, in which
          even the gender can vary” (22). Awareness of the disagreements can helpfully lead students
          to think of the annotations not as certain knowledge but as possible interpretations,
          which as such do not have absolute or sole authority. Or better, they might come to ask
          whether any one set of identifications is sufficient, since much of the action in <title level="m">Milton </title>and the other prophecies is driven by the dissolution,
          multiplication, and reforming of unstable identities. Blake’s manifold vision might demand
          multiplicitous, simultaneous identifications.</p>
               <p>In conclusion, for me the Blake of the prophecies is a poet of radical excess, and the
          most fruitful place to begin in teaching such works is with the thoroughgoing confusion
          that any reader experiences. Our default ways of reading are based on the kind of analytic
          demonstration that is precisely the mindset that Blake is trying to disrupt. Feeling lost
          beyond any possibility of being found again shakes us out of our rational reading habits.
          Confusion is thus not only lack of understanding—nor is it the beginning of understanding
          in the sense of the cliché—it is the beginning of a different path that is not the path of
          understanding at all and does not have what we usually conceive of as understanding as its
          goal. The type of non-understanding I am talking about is not a negative but a contrary,
          in Blake’s sense of those words. It is something positive. When I spend a long time at a
          stretch with any of Blake’s late prophecies, a funny thing happens not only with the
          plates but also with the scholarly apparatus, whose ostensible function is to orient us.
          In tracing much of Blake’s mythological world to numerous esoteric traditions, it
          eventually devolves itself into an unmanageable excess of annotations, glosses, and
          cross-references. There is always a point where I want to scream at Blake and his editors:
          “Stop! Stop, it’s already too much; I can’t take anymore.” This is all the more the case
          when the apparatus is particularly full and rich, as in the Princeton <title level="m">Illuminated Books </title>editions. But if, going by the Blakean Proverbs of Hell that
          it is never “Enough” until it is “Too much” and “The road of excess leads to the palace of
          wisdom,” I persevere and keep coming back, I finally arrive at the point where I no longer
          experience being overwhelmed and unable to find my bearings as defeat (Erdman 38, 35). I
          finally say: yes, yes, more, more, keep it coming. </p>

               <p rend="noCount">In this essay, I reflect on how my experience of teaching William Blake’s
            <title level="m">Milton</title> (comp. ca. 1804-1811) to graduate students was
          retrospectively transformed by reading Silvan Tomkins and Baruch Spinoza’s <title level="m">Ethics</title> (1677) in a seminar that I subsequently taught on affect
          theory. Engaging with Spinoza’s and Tomkins’s respective writings on negative affects
          (such as shame and fear) and positive affects (such as joy) allowed me to discover in what
          I had been thinking of as a pedagogical failure an exciting pedagogical opportunity to
          rethink my unreflected assumptions about teaching and what constitutes teaching success.
          The key breakthrough came when, through a shift of perspective, I began to see that the
          shame and fear of not understanding <title level="m">Milton</title> that my students (and
          on occasion, I) experienced was a version of the affective dramas, or “Mental Fight,” in
          Blake’s works and thus an essential aspect of the reading process rather than an obstacle
          to it.</p>

               <p>Chances are that anyone who has ever taught William Blake’s prophecies has at one time or
          another wondered if this Blake is teachable. The answer depends in part on what we mean by
          “teachable.” The word is often assumed to mean “masterable,” first by the instructor and
          then by the students, to whom the instructor has transferred his or her mastery. A
          pedagogy based on this assumption is driven by the desire to be correct, to “get it
          right,” but does not ask what the “it” to be got is, what “getting it” means, or if
          seeking mastery is the way to learn. Such a pedagogy also takes for granted that we as
          readers—teachers and students alike—are positioned outside the text, remain at a distance
          from it, and contemplate it from afar. This approach is questionable in general, but, in
          the case of Blake, it is particularly problematic because he profoundly and energetically
          rejects all the assumptions behind this concept of teaching—and nowhere more so than in
          the prophecies. An approach more in tune with Blake would ask not whether he is teachable
          but how he redefines teachability. How does he teach us to teach? This essay focuses on
          the ways that I have discovered to transform my reading and teaching habits by teaching
          Blake. </p>
               <p>I write from the perspective of a Romanticist who is not a Blake scholar and whose
          graduate training, for various reasons, barely touched on him (my doctoral program was in
          Comparative Literature rather than English, was not driven by a coverage model, and took
          William Wordsworth as the paradigmatic Romantic poet).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I
            add that I have never taught a class devoted entirely to William Blake; rather, on the
            undergraduate level, I have included him in large-scale historical surveys (from the
            Romantics to the Moderns) and introductory classes on poetry, and on the graduate level
            in broader-based classes on Romanticism and thematically focused seminars in the period.
          </note> As a result, I had to teach myself Blake in order to teach his work in my courses,
          and I frankly admit that the task was extremely intimidating. All of these things would
          normally be hindrances to contributing to a volume on teaching Blake, but I have found
          that they can be turned to advantage in developing a pedagogy of non-mastery that allows
          for more engaged reading (instead of being an excuse for not reading). In essence, I use
          my limitations as the basis of a pedagogical methodology rather than seeing them as
          something simply to be overcome. What has allowed me to reconceive personal limitations as
          the basis of a pedagogy is the affective turn in the recent critical landscape.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The year 1995, which saw the publication of Eve Kosofsky
            Sedgwick and Adam Frank’s “Shame in the Cybernetic Fold” and Brian Massumi’s “The
            Autonomy of Affect” is often cited as a watershed moment in affect theory. Other
            commonly cited works include Rei Terada’s <title level="m">Feeling in Theory</title>
            (2001); <title level="m">The Affective Turn</title>, edited by Patricia Clough (2007);
            Sianne Ngai’s <title level="m">Ugly Feelings</title> (2005); Heather Love’s <title level="m">Feeling Backward</title> (2007); and <title level="m">Romanticism and the
              Emotions</title>, edited by Joel Faflak and Richard C. Sha (2014). The type of
            teaching that I advocate in this essay is close to what Andrew H. Miller explores as
            “implicative criticism” in “Implicative Criticism, or the Display of Thinking.” In their
            “Introduction: Feeling Romanticism” (in <title level="m">Romanticism and the
              Emotions</title>), Faflak and Sha state: “Once a toxic chemical, emotion now fuels the
            affective turn in humanities and social science research” (1).</note> The particular
          affect theories that I draw on come from Silvan Tomkins and Baruch Spinoza’s <title level="m">Ethics</title> (1677).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Silvan Tomkins has
            come into literary studies through queer theory and more specifically under Sedgwick’s
            influence. The current visibility of Baruch Spinoza in literary studies owes a great
            deal to the influence of Gilles Deleuze. Deleuze’s two books on Spinoza are <title level="m">Spinoza: Practical Philosophy</title> (2001) and <title level="m">Expressionism in Philosophy: Spinoza</title> (1992).</note>
               </p>
               <p>Tomkins is especially helpful on the subject of motivation; he calls “the affect system”
          “the primary motivational system in human beings” (34). We all know <emph>experientially
          </emph>that the teaching, learning, and reading processes are affectively driven, but it
          has taken a new theoretical development to tell us that affect has a legitimate place, one
          worth discussing in teaching, learning, and scholarship.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
            Lisa Ann Robertson made this point in “The Enactive Imagination: William Wordsworth’s
            Embodied Mind.” </note> Blake is in many ways an ideal candidate for such an approach,
          since affect, especially extreme affect, is writ large in his works. For example, the word
          “terror” and its related forms, such as “terrors,” “terrible,” “terrifying,” “terrified,”
          as well as “fear” and “fright” appear frequently in Blake’s poetry in general. The
          “search” function in <ref target="http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/">
                     <title level="m">The
              William Blake Archive</title>
                  </ref> reveals well over 200 combined occurrences of the
          “terror” series and over 140 of “fear” and “fright,” and the frequency is especially high
          in <title level="m">Jerusalem </title>(comp. ca. 1804-1820) and <title level="m">The Four
            Zoas</title> (comp. ca. 1796-1797), with <title level="m">Milton </title>(comp. ca.
          1804-1811) making a respectable showing as well, especially considering that it is about
          half as long as <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The
            search function is on the homepage of the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>.</note>
          Since Blake’s oeuvre is so fear filled, is it any wonder that reading Blake frequently
          makes readers fearful? Once one begins thinking of Blake in these terms, it becomes
          obvious that readerly affect and textual affect in his works are related, but making that
          relation a matter for reflection and the motivating impulse of a teaching practice is
          another thing entirely. Such a teaching practice is precisely what I shall aim to adopt
          when I teach Blake in the future.</p>
               <p>As a result of having long struggled with Blake myself, I am in a good position to
          empathize with students’ distress at not understanding his work. Perhaps more important,
          my experience brings home to me the <emph>importance </emph>of empathizing with them. I
          can use myself as an example to help my students see that struggling with his prophecies
          is not a sign of failure but a potentially productive reading practice. Most
          fundamentally, my difficult engagement with the esoteric Blake has taught me to shift my
          relationship to his poetry, and my top priority is to enable my students to do the same.
          Achieving such a fundamental transformation of one’s orientation to texts involves a kind
          of psychotherapy for readers, which most closely resembles the desensitization techniques
          used to treat phobias; yet, it is a desensitization that allows for developing a
          sensitivity of a qualitatively different kind, one that gives the reader an alternative to
          closing herself or himself off from the work in self-defense. On the contrary, such a
          desensitization process allows the reader to open up to the work so that it can open up to
          her or him. It is perhaps an exaggeration to say that Blake’s prophetic works were phobic
          objects for me or that they are phobic objects for my students, but in the context of a
          classroom, they come pretty close. Certainly, they can raise a lot of fear or anxiety of
          being wrong or stupid and shame at not understanding. </p>
               <p>I have arrived at this view and practice of teaching as the result of a long, incremental
          process, which has not been without detours or serendipity. I tell the longer narrative
          below; here I would like to note three relatively recent events that suddenly reshaped the
          way I think of my history with Blake. First, in the Spring Semester of 2013, I taught
            <title level="m">Milton </title>in a graduate seminar on Romantic natures. Then, in
          Spring 2014, I assigned readings in the Silvan Tomkins anthology edited by Eve Kosofsky
          Sedgwick and Adam Frank and the three chapters on affect in Spinoza’s <title level="m">Ethics</title> in a graduate seminar on affect theory, an area in which I had become
          interested through the work of a doctoral student on whose dissertation committee I was
          serving. Finally, the combined impact of these factors motivated me to attend Karen
          Swann’s workshop on teaching <title level="m">Jerusalem </title>(“Learning to Teach by
          Teaching <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>”) at the 2013 conference of the North American
          Society for the Study of Romanticism.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Karen Swann’s
            pedagogical essay on <title level="m">Jerusalem</title> begins with a brilliant
            treatment of readerly affect—her own and that of her students. I attempt to get at some
            of the same issues in the thread of the present essay on affect.</note> Teaching the
          affect theory class between the two Blake-related events turned out to be transformative.
          By the strange temporality of mental processes, it retroactively prepared the groundwork
          for an “aha” moment that I had during the <title level="m">Jerusalem </title>workshop, in
          which I suddenly saw that affect had been a barrier to reading Blake for me, and affect
          was my best chance of finding a different—and happier—way of reading him. The reason I
          single out Tomkins and Spinoza from all the readings in that Spring 2013 seminar is that,
          in very different ways, they both emphasize that affects can become toxic but do not have
          to remain so; we can transform them by working on them. For Tomkins, when one particular
          affect comes to monopolize a person’s affective life, that person has developed a strong
          theory of that affect, such that s/he will find opportunities for experiencing it in a
          wide range of encounters that would be unlikely to activate it in a different type of
          person. Tomkins had a powerful impact on me because he paints vivid pictures of the
          soul-killing suffering that strong theories of negative affects inflict on those who hold
            them.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Tomkins’s most poignant examples involve shame
            and fear. For his account of “how a total affect-shame bind can be produced,” see <title level="m">Shame and Its Sisters</title> (163-165, 172-174). For his account of how a
            person can develop a strong theory of fear, see (165-168). </note> I responded to him on
          a gut level, as one cannot help responding to Blake, although in a very different register
          and on a different scale. In short, Tomkins resonated with Blake for me in that they both
          pack an affective punch. However, when it comes to weakening the hold of negative affects,
          Spinoza’s analysis is the one I found more effective in helping me shift my relation to
          Blake. </p>
               <p>The hyper-rationalist Spinoza and the anti-rationalist Blake might seem like strange
            bedfellows,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Reading Blake after Spinoza, I cannot help
            but think of Blake’s method in the treatises “All Religions Are One” and “There Is No
            Natural Religion” as akin to the “geometric style” that Spinoza adopts in the <title level="m">Ethics</title> (1677): “I shall consider human actions and appetites just as
            if it were a question of lines, planes, and bodies” (69). </note> and, to be sure, they
          disagree fundamentally on many fronts. Nonetheless, they both vehemently reject a vision
          of humanity that rests on the categories of sin and transgression. In the preface to the
          third part of the <title level="m">Ethics</title>, “Of the Origin and Nature of the
          Affects,” Spinoza states his opposition to those who “attribute the cause of human
          impotence and inconstancy . . . to I know not what vice of human nature, which they
          therefore bewail, or laugh at, or disdain, or (as usually happens) curse.” Rather than
          “curse or laugh at the affects and actions of men,” he proposes to “understand them” and
          by a method he acknowledges to be paradoxical: “I should wish to demonstrate by certain
          reasoning things which are contrary to reason, and which they [those who laugh and curse]
          proclaim to be empty, absurd, and horrible” (68-69).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In
            line with this eschewing of moral prescription, Spinoza radically redefines “good” and
            “evil” (in the scholium to proposition 39 of part 3 [IIIP39S]): “By good here I
            understand every kind of joy, and whatever leads to it, and especially what satisfies
            any kind of longing, whatever that may be. And by evil [I understand here] every kind of
            sadness, and especially what frustrates longing. For we have shown above (in P9S) that
            we desire nothing because we judge it to be good, but on the contrary, we call it good
            because we desire it. Consequently, what we are averse to we call evil” (91). In his
            introduction to the Penguin edition of the <title level="m">Ethics</title>, Stuart
            Hampshire notes that the brackets contain either variant texts or possibly the
            translator’s errors or license (xix).</note> To me, Spinoza holds promise for readers of
          Blake in that he bases his ethics on affects and does so in a non-moralistic manner. He
          aims not to set out rules to be obeyed but rather to show how the mind may pass “<emph>to
            a greater perfection</emph>,” where perfection is a state in which the mind does things
          rather than undergoes them; it becomes active rather than passive, where passivity means
          being dominated by passions (77). This active state Spinoza calls “joy” (77). In a rare
          pathos-filled sentence, he describes the plight of those who are at the mercy of their
          passions and thereby suffer many and frequent “vacillations of mind”: “We are driven about
          in many ways by external causes, and . . . like waves on the sea, driven by contrary
          winds, we toss about, not knowing our outcome and fate” (103). Hence he calls “man’s lack
          of power to moderate and restrain the affects” “bondage,” and the fourth part of the
            <title level="m">Ethics </title>is accordingly called “Of Human Bondage, or the Power of
          the Affects” (113). The entire <title level="m">Ethics </title>tends toward a
          demonstration of how the mind can escape this plight and find “the means, or way, leading
          to freedom,” which depends on “the power of reason” to counteract the affects (160). At
          this point, Spinoza states that the only and best way of becoming as free as possible is
          to gain “a true knowledge” of the affects: “Each of us has—in part, at least, if not
          absolutely—the power to understand himself and his affects, and consequently the power to
          bring it about that he is less acted on by them” (164). What appeals to me in Spinoza is
          that he takes affects not as something to be eliminated but as something to be worked on
          and through. Furthermore, he does not oppose reason to affects or hold that reason negates
          affects. Rather, affects can arise from or be aroused by reason, and over time such
          affects can grow to be more powerful than passions (165). In short, through reason,
          affects counteract affects. </p>
               <p>If ever Spinoza’s definition of “sadness” as “that <emph>passion by which it </emph>[the
          mind] <emph>passes to a lesser perfection</emph>” needed proof (77), it would find it in
          the classroom, where varieties of sadness (in Spinoza’s sense) such as fear, shame, and
          anxiety have the capacity effectively to shut down the mind and produce a painful silence.

          text-based—especially those whose Blake-habits were formed in the pre-digital age—it is a
          revelation to see how different and how much richer Blake’s plates are from the
          conventionally typeset versions in printed books. </p>
               <p>As Morris Eaves notes in his introduction to <title level="m">The Cambridge Companion to
            William Blake</title> (2003), those print editions served an important historical
          purpose when they first appeared in the Victorian age, and they continue to do so now,
          although not in the same way. Deleting the images and regularizing the idiosyncratic
          aspects of the text were then part of a mission to rescue Blake from the decades of
          neglect he had already suffered. These simplifications made “his poetry friendlier and
          more legible,” thereby “prepar[ing] the way for serious study and reflection on a scale
          previously unthinkable” (Eaves 7).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On this point Eaves
            quotes W. M. Rossetti, who “wrote in reaction to a nineteenth-century facsimile of
              <title level="m">Jerusalem</title> (1877), ‘the publication in ordinary book-form,
            without designs . . . of the <title level="m">Jerusalem</title> and the other Prophetic
            Books, is highly to be desired. Difficult under any circumstances, it would be a good
            deal <emph>less </emph>difficult to read these works in an edition of that kind, with
            clear print, reasonable division of lines, and the like aids to business-like perusal’”
            (Eaves 7). It’s hard not to imagine Blake turning over in his grave at the word
            “business-like,” and for this reason it is important to stress that such a reading is
            only an early step along a path that makes a very different kind of reading possible.
          </note> The difficulty of parsing Blake’s script is considerable, and perhaps no one has
          gauged it more aptly than Vincent De Luca, who holds that it poses as much of a challenge
          to the reader as does Blake’s hermeticism (89-90). My myopic, astigmatic, and presbyopic
          eyes would be able to sustain the reading effort only as long as I could tolerate the
          whopping headache it would be sure to bring on, which is to say not very long at all.
          However, today the availability of conventionally printed editions of Blake and the
          technological enhancements of the online <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>, including
          the textual transcriptions it provides, allow us to experience the difficult legibility of
          Blake as something more and other than a daunting physical obstacle. In particular, the
          magnification function makes it much more practical to read the facsimiles while also
          preserving a sense of the resistance they offer to legibility. Slowly tracing out the
          strokes of Blake’s lettering with our eyes, we can get some idea of the resistance that
          the physical substrate offers to the engraver; our reading activity approaches to the
          artisanal character of his production methods. To a certain degree and extent, then, we
          work along with Blake as we read, and this is one way our relation to his works shifts; we
          are no longer fully detached readers positioned over and against them. </p>
               <p>Most importantly, the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title> offers a viewing pleasure
          that one completely misses when reading only a verbal transcription, and this pleasure can
          help defuse the anxiety that any new (and I suspect many a veteran) reader of Blake
          experiences when confronted with his prophecies. The reader is then more likely to relax
          enough to begin to relinquish the desire for mastery and assume a less defensive, more
          open disposition toward the text. This is where affect comes in. I encourage my students
          to cultivate and reflect on their affective relationship to Blake. Through this process, I
          strive to help them do two related things: (1) to see their reading experience not as
          outside the text but rather as part of the drama of intellectual warfare at the center of
          so many of Blake’s works; and (2) to perform a kind of inner recalibration that allows
          them to re-experience their fear of not understanding him as joyful exhilaration and wild
          exuberance. This transformation can perhaps be thought of as turning intellectual terror
          into an experience of the sublime. One can facilitate this process for students by
          directing them to places in Blake’s <foreign>oeuvre </foreign>where it is thematized. A
          prime example is the speaker’s vow to wage “Mental Fight” in the famous poem included in
          some copies of <title level="m">Milton</title> (Erdman 95; see copies A and B, object 2,
          l. 38). Once students come to think of their struggles with the esoteric Blake as a
          “mental fight” they are obliged to wage in their own right, they can also come to see that
          many aspects of the works that bewilder them are those that dramatize or enact this
          “fight.” There Blake does what in the prefatory poem he says he will do. Coming this far
          can prepare students to rethink their acts of reading precisely <emph>as</emph> acts in
          the strong sense of the word, or, even better, experience their reading activity as dramas
          on the order of Blake’s poems and/or of Blake’s visionary dramas as unrolling within them.
          Thus, they become, as it were, dramatic characters, the “Visionary forms dramatic,” in the
          poems (Erdman 257; <title level="m">Jerusalem </title>copy E, plate 98, l. 29). </p>
               <p>My story begins with the first time that I taught a course on Romanticism. As an overly
          conscientious new assistant professor, I felt obliged to include some of the esoteric
          Blake in my syllabus despite my discomfort with him. I was worried about my authority in
          the classroom in general, but that worry was nowhere more intense than with this Blake. My
          response at the time was to shore up my authority by developing as much expertise as I
          could in the short time available, and to do so, I set out to read Geoffrey Keynes’s
            <title level="m">The Complete Writings of William Blake </title>(1966) from cover to
          cover along with a good chunk of the extant criticism. Any reasonable person would have
          realized from the outset that this was an impossible task, and, sure enough, it wasn’t
          long before I was forced to rethink my strategy. I hit a wall once I embarked on longer,
          more complex, and more daunting works, which, I stress, I was reading for the first time.
          I can best illustrate why by recurring to one day when I spent ten hours reading such
          works. By early evening, I was in a mental state that was akin to tripping—or to what I
          imagined tripping was like. I felt as if I was having a drug-free psychedelic experience.
          The feeling was so intense and overwhelming that I remember it vividly decades later.
          Since my reading was in the service of teaching, which then meant mastery to me, the
          experience felt profoundly disabling. However, when I managed to bracket the approaching
          semester and immerse myself in the reading experience itself, I felt exhilarated. In fact,
          I was laughing, and I made everyone I met that evening laugh by saying that if the illegal
          drug trade knew about the cheap and perfectly legal high that Blake provided, they would
          burn every copy, because he could put them out of business. For me, the big difference
          between now and then is that at the time it did not occur to me that I could use this
          response in my teaching, and if back then someone had suggested that I try to do so, I
          would have told that person in no uncertain terms that he or she was insane. </p>
               <p>Only by virtue of reading, rereading, and teaching Blake year after year and semester
          after semester did I slowly grow to feel that my personal enjoyment did not have to remain
          separate from what I did in the classroom. In the course of repeatedly engaging with a
          number of his texts (at this time I was dealing only with the texts, not the
          illuminations), I found myself positively warming to some, namely, the manifesto-like ones
          that I have mentioned above: “There Is No Natural Religion,” “All Religions Are One,” and
            <title level="m">The Marriage</title>. Over time, I came to discern that these works
          could be read precisely as Blakean lessons in reading, most obviously through their
          insistence on other modes of perception beyond those available through the five physical,
          “bounded” senses. For the purposes of this essay, in the next section I focus on <title level="m">The Marriage</title> to exemplify the pedagogy of non-mastery that teaches
          with, rather than despite, the instructor’s (i.e., my) limitations. However, before I go
          any further, let me hasten to add that none of this is to say that I think knowing Blake
          well is a hindrance to teaching him or that ignorance is the great desideratum of teaching
          or scholarship. Not only does Blake scholarship, which is particularly vibrant at this
          moment, disprove any such absurd claim, it also includes voices that speak in a spirit
          similar to the one that I advocate here.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For examples,
            Eaves uses the metaphors of exploration and extreme sports for reading Blake (14-15). In
            a similar spirit, Mary Lynn Johnson declares: “The best way into the time-twisting,
            identity-scrambling otherworld of Blake’s <title level="m">Milton: A Poem</title> (c.
            1804-18) is to set aside guidebooks, including this one, take a deep breath, and follow
            the hero as he breaks through the surface of the title page—alone, without a ‘companion’
            . . . to brave the swirling abyss of the unknown” (231). She goes on to liken the
            process as “a wilderness-survival test” (231). The example of Blake scholarship that to
            my knowledge goes farthest in this direction is Ron Broglio’s “Living Inside the Poem:
            MOOs and Blake’s <title level="m">Milton</title>.” </note> What I am saying is that
          those who are less comfortable with Blake can take heart and, as an added bonus, plug into
          the excitement of that scholarship all the more deeply. </p>
               <p>For reasons of economy, I choose from the many passages of <title level="m">The Marriage
          </title>that can be read as lessons for reading three of the “Memorable Fancies”: the
          narrator’s dinner with Isaiah and Ezekiel (plate 12), the one where the speaker and an
          angel set out to show each other their eternal lots (plates 17-20), and the one where the
          Devil and the Angel contend (plates 22-24). In plate 12 where the speaker questions the
          prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel, I suggest that modes of perception align with interpretive
          approaches: <quote>
                     <p rend="noCount">The Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel dined with me, and I
              asked them how they dared so roundly to assert. that God spake to them; and whether
              they did not think at the time, that they would be misunderstood, &amp; so be the
              cause of imposition.</p>
                     <p rend="noCount">Isaiah answer’d. “I saw no God, nor heard any, in a finite organical
              perception; but my senses discover’d the infinite in every thing, and as I was then
              perswaded. &amp; remain confirm’d; that the voice of honest indignation is the voice
              of God, I cared not for consequences but wrote. (Erdman 38)</p>
                  </quote> I understand
          this exchange to raise one of the basic questions of Biblical hermeneutics: whether to
          take scripture literally or figuratively, which is to say imaginatively, and I take Isaiah
          to be challenging the assumption that the default mode of interpretation is the literal
          one, which is based on “finite organical perception.” To take this point beyond canonical
          sacred texts and to demonstrate what a different kind of perception might look like, I
          find it helpful to turn to the poem that Blake includes in his letter to Thomas Butts of
          22 November, 1802—a text that elaborates on alternative, expanded modes of sensory
          experience: among them, the “double vision” that sees with an inward eye in addition to an
          outer eye (Erdman 721; l. 28). What appears to the “outward” eye merely “a Thistle across
          my way” is to the “inward Eye . . . an old Man grey” who speaks prophecies to Blake
          (Erdman 721; l. 30, l. 29).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The final lines of the poem
            go on to “threefold” and “fourfold vision,” which contrast with “Single vision &amp;
            Newton’s sleep” (Erdman 722; l. 88), but since they introduce “Beulah,” and with it
            Blake’s mythological geography, at this point they are liable to be as confusing as they
            are to be helpful.</note>
               </p>
               <p> Infinite perception is associated with daring: “I cared not for consequences,” Isaiah
          says. I suggest that perhaps we can become the type of reader who rises to Isaiah’s
          challenge by being daring as well, and for a model, I point to the young man who contends
          with the moralizing angel on plate 17. The angel, who would frighten him with a vision of
          his eternal damnation, demands security. His approach is to show the young man the abyss
          while they both remain outside it: they “held by the roots of trees and hung over this
          immensity,” as a frightful apocalyptic scene unrolls below them (Erdman 41). In contrast,
          the young man proposes that they throw caution to the winds and plunge in: “if you please
          we will commit ourselves to this void, and see whether providence is here also, if you
          will not I will?” (Erdman 41). When the speaker finally acts on this impulse, he finds
          that the Angel’s fear is what generated the fearsome sight. When the angel is gone, the
          young man is rewarded for his fearlessness with an idyllic pastoral vision: “I found
          myself sitting on a pleasant bank beside a river by moon light hearing a harper who sung
          to the harp” (Erdman 41-42). </p>
               <p> Once we reach this point, I suggest that as readers we might think of the positions that
          the angel and the devil take to this vision as indicating the available relations that we
          as readers can assume to the text. These come down to the alternative between reading at a
          remote distance from the text and immersing oneself in it, where we understand the
          immersion as our own implication in the text. It seems to me that we, professors and
          students alike, habitually read as angels. Eager and sometimes desperate to find a firm
          interpretive foothold, we place ourselves outside the text without considering whether or
          not there are other possible stances. But just as Isaiah showed us an alternative to
          assuming that the default mode of interpretation is literal, the final “Memorable Fancy”
          shows us that we can choose an alternative position, and it does so by showing that by the
          end of the work, the angel becomes a devil and reads like one. This section has particular
          pedagogical value, for, if the angel, who embodies conventional authority, can make the
          leap, can’t anyone, including us? Finally, the wild humor of the entire scene aids the
          process of transformation because the silent or outright laughter it provokes is a form of
          “sensual enjoyment,” and if we give ourselves over to it, it can cleanse “the doors of
          perception” (Erdman 39), as Blake says. </p>
               <p>To turn now to the Angel’s transformation: it occurs through contention, illustrating
          Blake’s axiom that “Opposition is true Friendship” (Erdman 42). The context is that the
          Angel and a Devil argue about the nature of God. The Devil pronounces the heterodox
          conviction that “The worship of God is. Honouring his gifts in other men each according to
          his genius. and loving the greatest men best . . . for there is no other God”: <quote>The
            Angel hearing this became almost blue but mastering himself he grew yellow, &amp; at
            last white pink &amp; smiling, and then replied, “Thou Idolater, is not God One? &amp;
            is not he visible in Jesus Christ? and has not Jesus Christ given his sanction to the
            law of ten commandments . . . ?” (Erdman 43)</quote> In tracing the color changes the
          Angel undergoes, the young man provides a wickedly funny genealogy of the anodyne
          renditions of angels in much religious painting. The saccharine, benign pastel images that
          we have come to expect are exposed as nothing but a cover for the suppressed rage of the
          orthodox when their dogma is challenged. I can never refrain from laughing at the
          incongruity of this rage vis-à-vis typical cherubic representations. By giving in to the
          impulse to laugh, I convey to the students that it’s okay for them to laugh too because
          literature can be funny, and it can be funny in order to say something important. </p>
               <p>The Angel holds his ground in the first round of his argument with the Devil, but he
          meets his match when the Devil counterattacks him, asserting: “no virtue can exist without
          breaking these ten commandments: Jesus was all virtue, and acted from impulse: not from
          rules” (Erdman 43). Here the Angel, up to now so cautious, becomes as daring as the young
          man and Isaiah. Apparently no longer caring for consequences or physical danger, he
          “stretched out his arms embracing the flame of fire &amp; he was consumed and arose as
          Elijah” (Erdman 43). This self-immolation effects his transformation, and he becomes the
          young man’s reading buddy: <quote>
                     <p rend="noCount">Note. This Angel, who is now become a
              Devil, is my particular friend: we often read the Bible together in its infernal or
              diabolical sense which the world shall have if they behave well</p>
                     <p rend="noCount">I have also: The Bible of Hell: which the world shall have whether
              they will or no. (Erdman 44)</p>
                  </quote> Here the speaker speaks with exuberant
          defiance, adopting first the voice of a cajoling parent. The Bible in its infernal sense
          is a reward for good behavior in the logic of “be good now, and you’ll get ice cream
          later” (i.e., deferred gratification) and then that of harsh parental authority—you’ll get
          the Bible of Hell, whether you like it or not. In both cases, the speaker mimics the voice
          of conventional morality to defy it. This is one way in which the poem stages a marriage
          of heaven and hell; here it is a marriage of voices in which one parodies or, in Blakean
          language, “imposes” on the other (Erdman 37, 42). More particularly, this passage exposes
          the <foreign>ressentiment</foreign> at the basis of moral and religious authority, which
          it counters through parody. </p>
               <p>I have taught <title level="m">The Marriage </title>to undergraduate and graduate
          students alike. Now I would like to turn to the challenge of teaching the most daunting of
          Blake’s works to graduate students, and here I draw on my recent experience of teaching
            <title level="m">Milton</title>. I must admit that we did not get very far with the poem
          in this class, and I did not find it a particularly satisfying pedagogical experience.
          Truth to tell, by any usual definition, it was largely a failure, and for that reason, it
          haunted me, but not in a completely negative way. What I could not forget was the
          intensity of the work and of the classroom atmosphere, and, besides, I love a challenge. I
          am convinced that I learned more about teaching the esoteric Blake from this teaching
          failure than I would have if this experience had been what generally passes for
          successful. The fact that I had a graduate student audience defined this pedagogical
          situation to a great extent. The advantages of teaching a difficult text to graduate
          students rather than undergraduates are obvious, but there are particular challenges too.
          Since graduate students are far more invested in achieving mastery, they feel the
          imperative to understand much more intensely than undergraduates do and consequently are
          more terrified at the prospect of not “getting it.” It is as if non-understanding were
          specifically disallowed by the implicit contract they signed on entering graduate school.
          Other defining factors were two decisions that I made because of time limitations: I
          reluctantly decided not to assign <title level="m">The Marriage</title>, despite my
          conviction of its great pedagogical value, and I dedicated only two, three-hour seminar
          meetings to <title level="m">Milton</title>, which was not nearly enough time. Both of
          these decisions exacerbated the inherent difficulty of the work for my students, and they
          understandably panicked. Since they experienced their panic as failure, their distress
          threatened to prevent us from doing any work at all on the poem. So I had to come up on
          the spot with some ways of averting that outcome. </p>
               <p>First, I suggested that one reason they were so unnerved was that they were each assuming
          they were the only ones who were struggling, and I assured them that this was not the
          case; Blake’s late prophecies bewilder everyone who approaches them for the first time.
          Stating this explicitly may seem trivial, but the students reported that it helped a great
          deal, and the atmosphere in the room became palpably more relaxed. Second, since I found
          myself tactically quoting <title level="m">The Marriage</title> to illuminate <title level="m">Milton</title>, I reversed course and made it available to them. Working
          through these various difficulties made us bond as a group and allowed us to continue with
          a sense of shared purpose. Finally, I took advantage of the fact that <title level="m">Milton </title>is one of Blake’s most spectacular illuminated books and displayed the
          various copies of some of the most stunning illustrations side by side, using the
          invaluable “compare” function on the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>. Seeing these
          versions raised some fundamental questions, including ones concerning the definition of
          what constitutes a “work” by Blake. Is it all the copies? Since the various copies do not
          all contain the same plates or order the plates in the same way, are they the same work or
          not? Are they all copies of an original? Are they all originals? Is each one a different
          work? Is the metal plate the original from which all the copies derive? Is it part of the
          work, or is the work limited to one or all the printed versions? Is the “real” <title level="m">Milton</title> for Blake and for us perhaps best thought of as mental—that is,
          the simultaneous totality of all the copies, which we can see only in imagination?<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Seeing the side-by-side plates on the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title> is not exactly the same thing, but it can be a step toward that
            impossible total feat.</note> Does the language of original and copy that, as Walter
          Benjamin has taught us, works well with mechanical reproduction<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Walter Benjamin’s “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical
            Reproduction.”</note> apply to Blake’s very different mode of production? Exactly what
          are we referring to when we refer to <title level="m">Milton</title>? </p>
               <p>We did not come to any absolute conclusions about these questions, and there may be no
          definitive answers to them. These questions can, however, make us aware that our default
          ways of thinking about them are not neutral but rather have been formed by what has been,
          until recently, the dominant mode of production of our time. Perhaps we need a different
          conceptual language to talk about Blake’s copies of the illuminated texts. Among all these
          unanswered questions, one thing became clear: now that, thanks to the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>, the illuminated works are readily available and at no cost, we
          are not really talking about <title level="m">Milton </title>or any other of Blake’s
          illuminated works if we talk only about the words. In fact, it may be wrongheaded to see
          the designs as secondary or supplementary to the written text, and we misrecognize the
          text also if we take a verbal transcription in conventional print as equivalent to Blake’s
          lettering. As De Luca has pointed out, Blake pushes the lettering of the illuminated books
          as close to the visual as possible, with strokes of letters curling off into vine-like
          structures (89-90). More specifically, we talked about how the different colorings on
          versions of the same plate created radically different moods or atmospheres, and I
          suggested that one might think about them in relation to the references to atmosphere in
          the verbal text or “States of the Human Soul,” which are in this work more numerous (or
          more multi-dimensional) than the contraries of “innocence” and “experience.” Perhaps most
          fundamentally, the power and vividness of the illuminations can draw students in even when
          they feel that they have not been able to understand much. My ultimate hope is that the
          attraction that the illuminations hold will help students eventually come to question
          understanding, or at least the kind of understanding that rests on “Single vision &amp;
          Newton’s sleep” (Erdman 722) as the goal of reading Blake. I shall say more about this
          below.</p>
               <p>This is where I stood with Blake when I attended the <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>
          workshop. Participants offered a number of innovative suggestions for teaching <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>, which apply as well to all of Blake’s most challenging
            works.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For example, Swann suggested having students
            write their own Proverbs of Hell and/or create their own mythological character. Drawing
            on the popularity of video games, Peter Otto said that asking students to think of
            reading <title level="m">Jerusalem</title> as moving through a virtual space could
            connect Blake to the world of popular culture they know well. For <title level="m">Milton</title> as itself a virtual space, see Broglio, who offers the <title level="m">Milton</title> MOO as an example of how new media can be performative in the
            context of literary studies. After detailing the “rich literary elements” that make
            Blake’s poetry an apt test case for pushing the immersive possibilities of MOOs, he
            adds: “Blake had already thought through the problem of creating immersive environments.
            His characters are continually creating windows and doors into new worlds or falling
            through space and time in such a way that the fall creates both space and time. Through
            their immersive interaction with one another and their surroundings, Blake’s characters
            forge the world upon which the narrative is staged. In like manner, Blake wants the
            reader to immerse him/herself in the poem such that ‘doors of perception’ open for the
            reader, creating new worlds and new possibilities” (par. 7).</note> However, my own
          experience with Blake suddenly crystallized when Swann led the discussion to the subject
          of forgiveness and the refusal to forgive in <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>. Her
          example was Albion’s refusal to forgive Jerusalem, and one could also add the spectre of
          Los’s refusal to forgive Albion. As Swann pointed out, the refusers harden themselves and
          stand on the rock of the law. When the “Saviour” calls to Albion, “we are One; forgiving
          all Evil” (Erdman 146), Albion brutally rebuffs him: “here will I build my Laws of Moral
          Virtue!” (Erdman 147). All of a sudden it occurred to me that we do the same thing when we
          search for an authoritative interpretation, when we want to be sure we understand, when we
          seek to stand on solid interpretive ground. In the context of <title level="m">Milton</title>, we act like Satan (who here is not “of the Devils party” and therefore
          not a “true Poet” [Erdman 35]) when he imposes his code of sin and punishment and declares
          himself the only God: <quote>
                     <lg>
                        <l>He created Seven deadly Sins drawing out his infernal scroll,</l>
                        <l>Of Moral laws and cruel punishments upon the clouds of Jehovah</l>

                        <l>There is no other! let all obey my principles of moral individuality[.] (Erdman
                103)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> Thus, we must enter the same “Mental Fight” that Blake declares in the
          preface of <title level="m">Milton </title>(Erdman 95; see copies A and B, object 2, l.
          38). This fight is the drama that Blake thematizes and enacts in all of the prophecies
          centering on mythological characters. The enactive aspect is one reason <title level="m">Milton </title>is so challenging. It does not merely say that the title character opens
          up and falls through multiple dimensions of space and time; it performs those events and
          forces the reader to experience them. We barely engage with the poem unless we enter its
          multi-dimensional universe, but when we do so, it engulfs and disorients us. The trick, as
          Mary Lynn Johnson and Ron Broglio (for example) each point out, is to realize that this is
          the means by which the poem “helps cleanse the [our] doors of perception” (Johnson 231;
          Broglio). Blake is about the toxic effects of the desire for mastery, and <title level="m">Milton </title>teaches us to give up the master’s position by giving us no choice but
          to do so. So, if we do not pass through a moment of the reading process where we feel that
          we do not and cannot “get it,” we stand little or no chance of “getting it.” This means
          that undergoing the negative affects in the first place is absolutely necessary. As has
          often been noted, <title level="m">Milton </title>and <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>
          contain biographical elements where Blake strikes back at those he considered the enemies
          of his imagination, such as his well-meaning but hopelessly conventional patron William
          Hayley. However, as Blake declares in a number of letters, it is most urgently a battle
          that he was obliged to wage again and again within himself, for he had to contend with his
          inner Urizenic reasoner in order to keep his visionary imagination alive. For our students
          and for us, it is a battle of reading and interpretation in which we are called to
          tolerate uncertainty and confusion in the classroom and put our authority on the line. In
            <title level="m">Milton</title>, the moment of risking authority occurs when the title
          character identifies with Satan and turns against the Satan in himself: <quote>
                     <lg>
                        <l>I in my Selfhood am that Satan: I am that Evil One!</l>
                        <l>He is my Spectre! in my obedience to loose him from my Hells</l>
                        <l>To claim the Hells, my Furnaces, I go to Eternal Death. (Erdman 108; copy B, object
                12, ll. 30-32)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> Our professorial “Selfhood” is our desire to have the authoritative
          reading. If we can relinquish it and dare to admit to our students that we often feel
          unsure when reading Blake, our self-annihilation can also feel freeing, for the
          responsibility of always knowing and always having to be right is a heavy burden. </p>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">Milton</title> is the ideal work for such teaching because it pushes the
          issue of understanding to the crisis point with the refrain that punctuates the Bard’s
          song: “Mark well my words! they are of your eternal salvation” (Erdman 96; copy B, objects
          3, 5 [twice], 7 and 9). When “eternal salvation” is the stakes of “mark[ing] well,” could
          they possibly be any higher? They are certainly higher than feeling or looking stupid, the
          typical readerly fear with Blake. Eaves wittily remarks that “such ultimate claims on
          ‘your’ devotion can leave you feeling hung out to dry, with only yourself to blame for
          your failures” (6). For what does it mean to mark the Bard’s words, and how do we know if
          we are marking them well? We see one consequence of not marking his words well through
          those who dwelt on the “mild banks” of the river Ololon in Eden (Erdman 115; copy B,
          object 19). Blake writes: <quote>
                     <lg>
                        <l>. . . they lamented that they had in wrath &amp; fury &amp; fire </l>

                        <l>That it was Milton the Awakener: they had not heard the Bard, </l>
                        <l>Whose song calld [sic] Milton to the attempt[.] (Erdman 116)<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See also a similar passage that appears approximately twenty lines
                  earlier: <quote>
                                 <lg>
                                    <l>There is in Eden a sweet River, of mild &amp; liquid pearl,</l>
                                    <l>Namd Ololon; on whose mild banks dwelt those who Milton drove</l>
                                    <l>Down into Ulro: and they wept in long resounding song (Erdman 115; object
                        19, ll. 15-17)</l>
                                 </lg>
                              </quote>In this passage, the reader likely construes the dwellers on the
                  river banks as subject and Milton as direct object, but it is equally possible to
                  read “those who Milton drove” as a poetic inversion, so that subject and object
                  are reversed. Lines 31 and 32 of this plate fix the syntax: “they had . . . /
                  Driven Milton . . .” One could perhaps take the difference between the two
                  passages and/or the ambiguous syntax (ll. 16-17) as examples of perspectival
                  switching, a common occurrence in Blake.</note>
                        </l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> As readers, however, we learn at the outset that it was “A Bards prophetic
          Song!” that “mov’d Milton, who walkd [sic] about in Eternity . . . To go into the deep . .
          .” (Erdman 96). Ostensibly, the speaker invokes the Muse to “Say [this]
          <emph>first</emph>” so that the reader will not repeat the mistake of the dwellers on the
          banks of Ololon, who in Blake’s manifold vision, are also the people of Ololon and
          Milton’s “Sixfold Emanation” (Erdman 96, emphasis mine). The irony is that he has come to
          redeem them. Apparently, the danger is that we will mistake our redeemer for our enemy and
          the dire process through which redemption occurs as a grievous error. </p>
               <p>It is possible to puzzle indefinitely over the meaning of the urgent imperative “Mark
          well my words! they are of your eternal salvation.” Perhaps our “eternal salvation” is to
          keep reading and rereading. At any rate, the imperative to “[m]ark” is another way that
            <title level="m">Milton </title>implicates the reader in the text; it makes us actors in
          the drama that <title level="m">Milton </title>relates. Perhaps <title level="m">marking</title> can also be taken as the engraving and printing process, in which case,
          as suggested above, the reader participates with Blake in producing and printing the words
          of the poem. He calls us to be not only readers but also his co-writers. Talking in
          general about the reader as participant and implicated in the work is easy; the hard part
          is to take up the mind-bending work of seeing how this works specifically in any one Blake
          text. It is a labor that we as readers must perform anew with every reading of a Blake
          work. On one level, they are all the stories of our reading/textual production.</p>
               <p>I close with some remarks on how, building on what I learned between the Spring Semester
          of 2013 and now, I would teach <title level="m">Milton </title>differently in the future.
          To sum up what I have already stated: I would prepare the ground by using the works
          mentioned above as providing a relatively user-friendly introduction to Blake’s
          prophecies, and I would build flexibility into the syllabus so as to be able to adjust the
          class time according to the needs of the students in any particular group; this is the
          change that makes all others possible. For all assignments and class discussions, I would
          integrate attention to the two things I have emphasized in this essay—the affective and
          visual aspects of the works—into considerations of the verbal texts. I would encourage
          students to <emph>look</emph> at all of the plates from first to last before reading.
          Going from “There Is No Natural Religion” and “All Religions Are One” to <title level="m">The Marriage </title>and then <title level="m">Milton </title>will have the added
          benefit of providing some sense of Blake’s evolution as a writer and artist. To take full
          advantage of the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>, I would devote one class (or as
          much of it as necessary) to taking the interactive tour of the website (available from the
          site’s homepage) with my students; now that most of them have laptops and/or tablets, they
          could play along instead of just watching me do it. I have found the “search” function on
          the homepage and the “show me” and “compare” buttons for individual plates especially
          useful. By allowing the user to enlarge the image, see a visual description of it, and
          read a textual transcription, the “show me” button helps educate the reader’s eye in how
          to view the plates and in some cases how to make viewing and reading work together. A few
          dry runs with colleagues, who have all responded with amazement and rapt delight, have
          convinced me that exploring its capabilities stands a good chance of hooking the viewer on
          Blake. I would frame our discussion of <title level="m">The Marriage</title> by asking how
          we get from the various couples on the title page to the “marriage” between the young man
          and the angel at the end of the work. The illustration description of the title plate with
          some uncertainty identifies the two large figures at the bottom of the plate as a woman
          (on the left) and a man (on the right). Yet the figure on the right looks more like
          another woman to me. Does that figure’s gender make a significant difference? How might we
          think about going from a marriage between a man and woman or between two women to a
          marriage between two men? These questions can set up a discussion of the pronounced
            homo<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See, for example, Susan Fox’s <title level="m">Poetic Form in Blake’s Milton</title> (1976) and Christopher Z. Hobson’s <title level="m">Blake and Homosexuality</title> (2000).</note> eroticism that many viewers
          perceive in the illustrations of <title level="m">Milton</title>, about which I shall say
          more below. One could also ask about the spatial organization of the title plate of <title level="m">The Marriage</title>. If, as the illustration description suggests, the bottom
          left of the image is hell and the right heaven, what do we make of the horizontal division
          about a third of the way down the page? We would normally expect heaven to be above and
          hell below. This complication of direction and dimension, which participates in satirizing
          conventional views of good and evil in the work, can set the stage for the more
          thoroughgoing dislocations of <title level="m">Milton</title>. </p>
               <p>For both <title level="m">The Marriage </title>and <title level="m">Milton</title>, using
          the “compare” feature allows students to see for themselves that, when colored
          differently, copies of the same plate can produce startlingly different impressions. It is
          also important for them to see that not all copies of <title level="m">Milton
          </title>contain the same plates; for example, the preface on the “Daughters of
          Inspiration” and the “Daughters of Memory” and the poem “And did those feet,” the best
          known lines in the poem, appear only in copies A and B (Erdman 95). For <title level="m">Milton</title>, in addition to using the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>, I
          would also assign the volume in the Princeton edition of <title level="m">The Illuminated
            Books of William Blake </title>(1993) for two reasons: the scholarly apparatus of each
          includes things that the other does not, and the reader/viewer enters the book format and
          the website in different ways. This is all the more the case given that digital technology
          advances rapidly and thus also rapidly becomes obsolete. A case in point is the <title level="m">Milton </title>MOO formerly supported by the <title level="m">Romantic Circles
          </title>website. “Changing servers and configurations and the by-now advanced age of the
          MOO platform” have made site managers at <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title> unable
          “to keep up support for it.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> David Rettenmaier, Site
            Manager, <ref target="../customXml/item1.xml">Romantic Circles</ref>, personal
            communication (17 Mar. 2015). </note> When the MOO was up and running, one could turn
          the pages of the “book” form of <title level="m">Milton </title>with one’s hand in virtual
          reality, and this possibility had profound implications for the reader’s relation to the
          work. As Broglio writes: <quote>This famous opening page shows Milton naked, having cast
            off the robes of promise, and pushing with his right hand through the ether as he begins
            the descent to the vegetative world. The reader upon opening the book and beginning a
            descent into its pages places a hand over the upper right hand corner to flip the page.
            Doing so, the reader’s hand is placed over Milton’s hand so that the two perform a
            descent at the same time. Whose hand it is flipping and descending is up for grabs.
            Remember that Milton’s hand is drawn with Blake’s hand but Blake has been possessed and
            commanded to write by Milton who is possessed and inspired by the bard. The reader
            cannot enter the poem, that is enter <title level="m">Milton</title>, without having
            Milton enter the reader. The physicality of reading allows Blake to collapse the
            reader's second position—outside the poem—into part of the first position—being immersed
            in the poem’s field of play. (par. 12)</quote> Now that the MOO is, unfortunately, no
          longer accessible, only the <title level="m">Illuminated Books</title> edition of <title level="m">Milton </title>allows the reader’s hand to merge with Milton’s on the title
          page. Nonetheless, Broglio’s essay, which I would assign only <emph>after</emph> the class
          had done a first reading of the poem without secondary material, can still give readers a
          sense of <title level="m">Milton</title> as an interactive, multi-dimensional virtual
          space and of Blake himself as a constructor of virtual realities well before digital
          technology came into being. By the same token, this essay can help students—especially
          gamers but also digital natives in general—transform their disorientation, confusion,
          frustration, and fear into a virtual reality experience.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
            For drawing on students' facilities with immersive digital environments, I again
            acknowledge Otto’s suggestion during Swann’s 2013 workshop on <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>. See note 18 above. I came upon Broglio’s essay more than a year
            after attending the workshop.</note> The transformation is a crucial part of the
          process; this is also to say that one completely misses Blake’s visionary rush if one does
          not lose one’s bearings in the first place. We all habitually live in the Newtonian world
          of single vision, which we take as <emph>the</emph> world, and we need to be forced out of
          this perspective over and over again. If students do not initially feel lost, they will
          never realize that their doors of perception need to be cleansed in the first place and
          therefore never experience the cleansing. Blake is about this transformation.</p>
               <p>To offer concrete examples of how the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title> and the
          Princeton <title level="m">Illuminated Books</title> edition of <title level="m">Milton
          </title>can facilitate a teaching and reading practice that brings the verbal and visual
          aspects of the work together, I focus on the title plate and the plate where Milton
          contends with and sculpts Urizen (object 17 in the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>;
          plate 15 in the Princeton edition). Under the illustration appears the caption: “To
          Annihilate the Selfhood of Deceit and False Forgiveness.” Both the “illustration
          description” of this plate on the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title> and the editorial
          apparatus of the Princeton <title level="m">Milton</title> point out that Milton’s right
          foot, which—I add—is associated with poetic inspiration at key moments in the work,
          visually enacts the annihilation of the Selfhood by splitting the very word into its two
          constituent syllables.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The illustration description on
            the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title> reads: “His right foot and its tarsus are
            prominent as it breaks the word “Self- -hood” in the brief text below” [“To Annihilate
            the Selfhood of Deceit and False Forgiveness”]. The annotation in the Princeton edition
            makes a similar point: “With his right foot Milton quite literally breaks the ‘Self-
            -hood’ in the text while clutching the projected embodiment of that selfhood (compare
            Milton dividing his name on the title page)” (24).</note> The commentary in the
          Princeton edition explicitly links this plate to the title plate, where Milton’s “right
          hand and arm also cut his name in two” (20);<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The full
            sentence in the annotation reads: “His [Milton’s] right hand and arm also cut his name
            in two, an action suggesting that the route to apocalypse (and perhaps, to us, of an
            understanding of the book) is blocked by a ‘selfhood’ that must be self-annihilated
            (compare Milton’s foot breaking his ‘Self- -hood’ on plate 15)” (20). This plate
            corresponds to object 17 on the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>. </note> an
          action suggesting that the route to apocalypse (and perhaps, to us, of an understanding of
          the book) is blocked by a ‘selfhood’ that must be self-annihilated. Compare this moment of
          annihilation to Milton’s foot breaking his ‘Self-hood’ on plate 15 or object 17 in the
            <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>. Here again, word and image together enact an
          annihilation of the selfhood. Could this annihilation be related, I would ask, to the
          homoeroticism suggested by the poem’s numerous illustrations of muscular naked men,
          frequently with prominent buttocks? To entertain the question, I would display via the
            <title level="m">Blake Archive</title> some of the most striking examples as a
            group.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In addition to object 17, they include the
            title page (copy B, object 1, which shows a rear view of Milton leaving eternity),
            object 9 (where two arguably male bodies stand to the left of a male figure in flames),
            and illustrations where a man “enters” another man: object 31 (where Milton in the form
            of a star enters the foot of William Blake), object 36 (the mirror image of 31), where
            Robert Blake takes the place of William, and object 46 (where Los enters the
            speaker).</note> The “light box” feature on the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>,
          which allows the user to group different objects on the same screen (but, alas, not save
          the grouping), would be ideal for this exercise.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
            However, the light box is the one feature on the <title level="m">Blake Archive</title>
            with which I have had the most trouble. The problem seems to be with security settings,
            which I cannot change on my university’s computer network. My hope is that a
            technological solution will be found for this issue in the not-too-distant future.
          </note>
               </p>
               <p>As a theoretical support for this queer reading of Blake, I would introduce Leo Bersani’s
          notion of “shattering” into the discussion, for it is specifically a “shattering” of the
          “structured self” through sexual acts. In a reading of <title level="m">Civilization and
            Its Discontents</title> (1930), Bersani argues that for Freud the shattering power of
          sexual enjoyment can be traced back to the species’ atavistic memory of “the experience,
          or rather the smell of sex before we adopted an erect posture,” and Bersani characterizes
          this Freudian speculation as “the fantasy of a mythic, prehistoric convulsing of our
          physical being in the passionate sniffing of a male on all fours” (17).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For the effect of sexual enjoyment on the “structured self,” see Bersani
            (38). Bersani (17) discusses the relevant passages in Freud, which can be found in the
            Norton edition of <title level="m">Civilization and Its Discontents</title> (46-47).
          </note> The scene of anal intercourse between men that Bersani finds in Freud and its
          disruptive effect on the integrity of the self seem uncannily congruent with the
          homoeroticism of Milton’s annihilation of his own selfhood in his intimate contention with
          Urizen. In any case, the point is not for the commentary to do the work of seeing for the
          students but to give them examples of how they might proceed on their own. In allowing the
          user to see as many copies side by side as s/he chooses, the “compare” button
          exponentially increases the “sensual enjoyment” one experiences by looking at any one copy
          alone, while also facilitating the all-important but never finally accomplished discipline
          of cleansing “the doors of perception.” </p>
               <p>As valuable as the bibliography and the introduction to (or initiation in) the critical
          literature that the digital and book editions provide are the indications of scholarly
          disagreement, sometimes on the most basic things. The Princeton <title level="m">Illuminated Books </title>edition of <title level="m">Milton </title>is particularly
          instructive on this score. For example, its annotations often note that different scholars
          identify figures in some designs differently. Perhaps the most telling case is that of the
          three nude figures in plate 8 of the Princeton edition, for whom the editors Robert Essick
          and Joseph Viscomi find eight extant interpretations in the secondary literature, in which
          even the gender can vary” (22). Awareness of the disagreements can helpfully lead students
          to think of the annotations not as certain knowledge but as possible interpretations,
          which as such do not have absolute or sole authority. Or better, they might come to ask
          whether any one set of identifications is sufficient, since much of the action in <title level="m">Milton </title>and the other prophecies is driven by the dissolution,
          multiplication, and reforming of unstable identities. Blake’s manifold vision might demand
          multiplicitous, simultaneous identifications.</p>
               <p>In conclusion, for me the Blake of the prophecies is a poet of radical excess, and the
          most fruitful place to begin in teaching such works is with the thoroughgoing confusion
          that any reader experiences. Our default ways of reading are based on the kind of analytic
          demonstration that is precisely the mindset that Blake is trying to disrupt. Feeling lost
          beyond any possibility of being found again shakes us out of our rational reading habits.
          Confusion is thus not only lack of understanding—nor is it the beginning of understanding
          in the sense of the cliché—it is the beginning of a different path that is not the path of
          understanding at all and does not have what we usually conceive of as understanding as its
          goal. The type of non-understanding I am talking about is not a negative but a contrary,
          in Blake’s sense of those words. It is something positive. When I spend a long time at a
          stretch with any of Blake’s late prophecies, a funny thing happens not only with the
          plates but also with the scholarly apparatus, whose ostensible function is to orient us.
          In tracing much of Blake’s mythological world to numerous esoteric traditions, it
          eventually devolves itself into an unmanageable excess of annotations, glosses, and
          cross-references. There is always a point where I want to scream at Blake and his editors:
          “Stop! Stop, it’s already too much; I can’t take anymore.” This is all the more the case
          when the apparatus is particularly full and rich, as in the Princeton <title level="m">Illuminated Books </title>editions. But if, going by the Blakean Proverbs of Hell that
          it is never “Enough” until it is “Too much” and “The road of excess leads to the palace of
          wisdom,” I persevere and keep coming back, I finally arrive at the point where I no longer
          experience being overwhelmed and unable to find my bearings as defeat (Erdman 38, 35). I
          finally say: yes, yes, more, more, keep it coming. </p>

               <p rend="noCount">This article outlines and models a simple web-browsing assignment and
          related research project designed to help students reflect critically on the propensity
          for William Blake’s illuminated books to break apart and circulate in pieces. The
          web-browsing assignment asks students to track how the present uses of a single Blake
          proverb call forth its potentials to mean different things, while the research project has
          them historicize some of those potentials. Together, the two assignments are designed to
          prompt classroom discussion of the ways that the semantic and situational instability of
          Blake’s proverbs might matter for thinking about the formal properties of the illuminated
          books as a medium, the culture that generated this medium, the cultures that continue to
          converge with it, and the complexity of the artistic project bound up with it.</p>

               <p>Google “Blake,” and his “composite art” does not stay composite for long.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The term “composite art” of course comes from W. J. T.
            Mitchell’s classic <title level="m">Blake’s Composite Art: A Study of the Illuminated
              Poetry </title>(1978). I use it here, however, as a stand-in for any conception of
            Blake’s verbal-visual art that emphasizes its integrity as a medium.</note>
                  <ref target="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake">William Blake’s Wikipedia
            entry</ref>, the top result currently for the search term “William Blake,” reproduces
          two frontispieces from his illuminated books, the projects wherein he most thoroughly
          integrated the arts of printmaking, painting, and poetry, but neither of the selected
          frontispieces incorporates words.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Given Google’s complex
            algorithms, the search results reported throughout this essay will likely be different
            if attempted again at some point in the future. </note> Examples of more fully composite
          images are only a click away if, for instance, you follow the embedded links to the
          entries for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Thel">Blake’s <title level="m">The Book of Thel</title>
                  </ref> (1789) and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marriage_of_Heaven_and_Hell">
                     <title level="m">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</title>
                  </ref> (1790). But in the rhizomatic realm of
          Wikipedia, which tempts your indiscriminate wandering, the same degree of virtual
          separation also exists between “William Blake,” “concubinage,” the history of “hosiery,”
          and the results of the BBC’s 2002 poll of “the 100 Greatest Britons” (where Blake ranks
            38<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, two places ahead of Henry VIII and just five behind
          David Beckham).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Admittedly, it is slightly misleading to
            apply Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s idea of a “rhizomatic” form to Wikipedia given
            that the site’s editorial practices presently grant different degrees of editorial
            control to different users to produce hyperlinks across encyclopedia entries, thus in
            effect limiting the number of possible, mechanized, pathways through the site. At the
            same time, Wikipedia’s external openness as a system (theoretically, there are no limits
            on the number of new entries that can be added to it) and the sheer abundance of defined
            intra-site hyperlinks bring it closer to a rhizomatic system than to either the more
            closed, traceable systems that Deleuze and Guattari denote as “radicles” or the more
            radial, discretely branching systems that they denote as “root-trees” (Deleuze and
            Guattari 5-6). </note> Should you opt to bypass Wikipedia, you might instead enter the
          celebrated <ref target="http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/">
                     <title level="m">William Blake
              Archive</title>
                  </ref>, where the illuminated books are displayed in their composite
          form. The archive offers a rare oasis, however, before the vast desert of the World Wide
          Web, where de-composition of literary corpuses is a regular feature of the media ecology.
          The next hundred results for “William Blake” consist almost entirely of study guides, hack
          biographies, poetry sites, galleries, and compendia of quotations that, with rare
          exceptions, strip Blake’s poems of their visual character, extract his pictures from their
          poetic contexts, or privilege those pictures that have never had a poetic context. Indeed,
          the pieces of the illuminated books that these sites reproduce usually amount to fragments
          in their own right in relation to their original verbal or visual contexts. In general,
          the vast Blake archive searchable through Google is comprised of atomic artistic particles
          much smaller than the unit of the book, poem, plate, or picture—that is, single lines of
          text or stanzas excerpted from longer poems, details isolated from page-sized plates, or
          images cropped from larger pictures.</p>
               <p>Given that the Internet tends to atomize almost everything, even as it also helps to
          create niches and foster communities, Blake’s fragmentation on the web hardly can come as
          a surprise. Whether this fragmentation is cause for sadness, interest, or excitement,
          however, may depend on who is doing the browsing. It presumably has not been a welcome
          development for those who remain committed to the cult of the artist as Romantic genius,
          those who privilege the claims of “original” historical contexts to determine texts’
          meanings, or those who hold the view that only through understanding the compositeness of
          Blake’s composite art can we grasp its fullest complexity and most significant
            meanings.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Scholarly attention to the artistic
            compositeness of Blake’s illuminated books had been growing since the publication of
            Mitchell’s <title level="m">Blake’s Composite Art </title>in 1978, and, before that, of
            Jean Hagstrum’s <title level="m">William Blake, Poet and Painter </title>(1964). But it
            was catalyzed in the mid-1990s by Joseph Viscomi’s <title level="m">Blake and the Idea
              of the Book</title> (1993). Although Viscomi’s analytical conclusions were not without
            their critics, his attention to the materiality of Blake’s illuminated books made it
            newly imperative for scholars, especially historicists, to ground their critical
            analyses in the books’ material and composite form. Reflecting what he took to be a
            growing scholarly consensus, Nicholas Williams wrote in 2006 in overview of the state of
            Blake Studies that recent scholarship had made it imperative to “see the verbal and
            visual elements of the illuminated works as an integral whole, neither taking priority
            over the other, and both necessary for the full impact Blake intended” (3). </note> For
          others, however, Blake’s circulation in bits and pieces represents an opportunity both to
          develop new scholarly methods and also to challenge earlier accounts of the significance
          of Blake’s art. This has been especially true for a new generation of reception scholars
          and digital humanities scholars committed to studying texts as media, and to analyzing
          textual reception less with an eye towards isolating historically discrete reading
          formations and vectors of individual influence than with an eye towards mapping how
          certain texts <title level="m">behave</title> and <title level="m">could
          behave</title>—even in fragmented form—as media across populations and systems.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See, for example, Steve Clark, Tristanne Connolly, and
            Jason Whittaker’s “Introduction” to <title level="m">Blake 2.0: William Blake in
              Twentieth-Century Art, Music and Culture</title> (2010); Roger Whitson’s “Digital
            Blake 2.0”; Roger Whitson and Jason Whittaker’s <title level="m">William Blake and the
              Digital Humanities: Collaboration, Participation, and Social Media </title>(2013);
            Mark Lussier’s “Blake beyond Postmodernity”; as well as my own essays, “Blakespotting”
            and “The Joy of Looking: What Blake’s Pictures Want.”</note> For a number of these
          scholars, the reliance of earlier criticism on conceptual categories like “author,”
          “text,” and “reader,” can look like idealist abstractions, especially when applied to
          Blake’s new medium. Thinking in these terms does not mean that such scholars embrace the
          politics or interpretive prowess of every appearance that Blake makes in any cultural
          context. What it does mean is that they take seriously every behavior of Blake’s medium in
          different contexts, approaching any behavior not as an interpretation that merely reflects
          an interpreter’s historical situation, but as a potential, and possibly unwitting,
          realization of a Blake that, as Gilles Deleuze might say, had existed only virtually
            before.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For an explication of the Deleuzean concept of
            the “virtual” text through and in relation to Blake, see Claire Colebrook’s “The Work of
            Art that Stands Alone.” Colebrook’s <title level="m">Blake, Deleuzian Aesthetics, and
              the Digital</title> (2012) also makes a case for conceptualizing Blake’s aesthetic
            project in terms that lend further theoretical justification to many of the approaches
            pursued by the scholars cited in note 5. </note>
               </p>
               <p>Regardless of how one feels about the atomization of Blake’s illuminated books in
          contemporary culture, however, their atomization, or more generously, their ongoing
          vitality and vibrancy in pieces, also presents tremendous pedagogical opportunities.
          Bringing awareness of Blake’s contemporary fragmentation and circulation into the
          classroom carries the potential to give students fresh insights into the formal properties
          of the illuminated books as a medium, into the culture that generated this medium, into
          the cultures that continue to converge with it, and into the complexity of the artistic
          project bound up with it. This essay outlines and models a web-browsing assignment and
          related research project designed to advance all of these ends and which begins by having
          students perform Google searches to record instances of the appearance of a single
          fragment, or identifiable discrete particle, of Blake’s corpus around the web. The
          assignment requires students to track how the present uses of their chosen Blake fragment
          call forth its potentials to mean different things, with an eye towards inspiring them to
          investigate (in the follow-up research project) how long, or in what other situations,
          certain meaningful potentials might have been there. Which have been there all along? Are
          there any that were once there which are no longer available or have gone dormant? As
          students make visible some part of the illuminated books’ fragmentation and circulation,
          they ideally will become more aware of networks and resonances, disconnections and
          dissonances, within and across times and places. This will both heighten their awareness
          of culture’s and history’s complexity and encourage them to think about what it means that
          the illuminated books—or, rather, the movement and mutability of the books’ pieces—enabled
          this heightened awareness. </p>
               <p>The overall assignment could conceivably be based on any number of different kinds of
          textual particles. Indeed, the ability since 2011 to do a <ref target="http://images.google.com/imghp?hl=en">Google image search</ref> using JPEGs
          instead of words as one’s search terms has opened up exciting possibilities for tracking
          the spread of specific digitized copies of Blake’s pictures, including the spread of
          visual details that are smaller than the more macro-units of the plate or print. The
          version I present here, however, focuses on the verbal textual unit of the proverb due to
          the prevalence on university syllabi of the “Proverbs of Hell” section of Blake’s <title level="m">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</title> as well as to the ease of searching
          electronically for a proverb’s citation (a proverb is a discrete piece of text that tends
          to circulate syntactically whole and lexically unaltered). Aside from its practical
          advantages, however, focusing on proverbs also gives students the opportunity to think
          critically about the proverb form and its apparent privileging within William Blake’s
          verbal-visual medium, a line of inquiry that, for reasons that will become apparent in due
          course, I take to be especially provocative for thinking about that medium’s artistic,
          philosophical, and political significance. </p>
               <p>Specifically, the web-browsing assignment (“Searching for Blake’s Hellish Wisdom”), as I
          have written it, asks students to begin tracking how, as a single Blake proverb circulates
          today, its regulatory counsel becomes multiple and heterogeneous. The assignment is thus
          aligned with the media-oriented pedagogy of an earlier generation of poststructuralist
          scholars like Paul Delany and George Landow, who saw in emergent hypermedia a workshop for
          testing, among other things, the insights of deconstruction.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Paul Delany and George P. Landow’s “Hypertext, Hypermedia, and
            Literary Studies: The State of the Art.”</note> At the same time, the assignment owes
          much, too, to the recent efforts of formalist literary scholars like Caroline Levine, who
          have sought to reinvigorate and radically expand the project of doing historicized
          formalism by employing design theory’s idea of “affordances,” or “the potential uses or
          actions latent in materials and designs,” to study forms of all kinds, including
          conceptual forms and the forms of their collisions and intersections.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Caroline Levine’s <title level="m">Forms: Whole, Rhythm, Hierarchy,
              Network</title> (2015) (6).</note> By having each student work outside of the
          classroom to identify how, why, and where a specific proverb’s regulatory counsel becomes
          multiple and heterogeneous, the web-browsing assignment ensures that each student will
          have a unique evidentiary archive when she returns to the classroom from whence to reflect
          on what proverbs are and what the form affords, whether or not the instabilities of
          Blake’s proverbs make them special instances of the form, what insights the atomization of
          the “Proverbs of Hell” might give us into the formal qualities of the illuminated books
          more generally, and why someone with Blake’s political, theological, and philosophical
          views might have been attracted to the proverb form.</p>
               <p>Finally, the web-browsing assignment also takes up the challenge of media scholars like
          Gregory Ulmer and Marcel O’Gorman to invent forms of digital pedagogy that, at the same
          time that they make our students more technologically and informationally literate, also
          help them to reflect on the sweeping epistemological and ontological changes that result
          from the proliferation of new electronic and computing media.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See the second chapter of Gregory Ulmer’s <title level="m">Heuretics: The
              Logic of Invention</title> (1994) as well as his <title level="m">Internet Invention:
              From Literacy to Electracy</title> (2003). Also see Marcel O’Gorman’s <title level="m">E-crit: Digital Media, Critical Theory, and the Humanities</title> (2006). </note> In
          my own classroom experience, as the web-browsing assignment has prompted my
          media-saturated students to consider Blake’s proverbs as forms of viral media or,
          alternatively, as engines seeking end-users, it has encouraged them to think about the
          extent to which Blake’s medium might be elucidated by thinking about what viral media and
          search engines do (and potentially could do). It also has generated productive discussion
          of what tracking viral proliferation using a non-neutral search engine like Google can and
          cannot teach us, and has even led to probing insights into what affordances and
          limitations the idea of “the viral” itself might have as a conceptual form for
          understanding how media interface with the cultures of which they are also a part. Such
          discussions go a long way towards helping fulfill O’Gorman’s pedagogical mission to create
          “discursive practices that are suitable to a culture that has embraced electronic
          technology and has internalized the primary tenets of postmodern theory, but has done so
          by way of popular culture and computing techniques.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See
            O’Gorman’s <title level="m">E-crit</title> (xvi).</note>
               </p>
               <p>While the web-browsing assignment can be completed effectively by almost any level of
          student, the follow-up assignment (“Re-searching for Blake’s Hellish Wisdom”) is geared
          more towards advanced students, especially those who already have some experience doing
          more traditional forms of academic research. The assignment takes off from the premise
          that the instabilities of a given Blake proverb’s counsel in one time and place challenge
          us to figure out if the potential for these instabilities might have been present in other
          times and places. It offers students a choice of specific, focused research prompts, each
          of which asks them to generate a brief written report that highlights some aspect of their
          chosen proverb’s potential interpretive instability in Blake’s own day. Sharing these
          reports, especially in the context of a graduate seminar, becomes a way for students to
          develop insight into Blake’s project in <title level="m">The Marriage of Heaven and
            Hell</title> and perhaps his illuminated books more generally. It also gives them
          valuable experience in how bringing the study of reception and production contexts
          together can sometimes work to open up productive new research directions for each.</p>

                  <p>Proverbs are “words of wisdom” that get repeated in exactly the same form in many
            different contexts. For this assignment, you will choose <title level="m">one</title> of
            Blake’s “Proverbs of Hell” from <title level="m">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</title>
            and use Google searches to track down recent citations of the proverb in order to
            catalog what wisdom people try to make it dispense when they invoke it in different
            contexts. What wise counsel is seemingly being given in different situations when, for
            example, someone today states, “The cut worm forgives the plow” (Erdman 35), regardless
            of whether or not they attribute the line to Blake?<note place="foot" resp="editors">
              All parenthetical page citations for Blake quotes refer to David Erdman’s edition of
                <title level="m">The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</title> (1988).
            </note> The wisdom being dispensed will not be consistent across users, and, indeed,
            part of your task here is to be attuned to and to catalog these inconsistencies. </p>
                  <p>To present your research, compile a table that includes: (A.) the URL where the use of
            the proverb occurs; (B.) a brief description of the immediate context for the use; (C.)
            a summation of what you take the proverb to signify when used in this context (or a
            direct quote indicating what it signifies, if the author includes this kind of explicit
            explication). Your table must have a minimum of twenty rows or entries (i.e., twenty
            citations of the proverb). These twenty entries should reflect <title level="m">a
              minimum of five different interpretations of the proverb</title> (i.e., not a minimum
            of five different online contexts where the proverb gets cited to convey essentially the
            same wisdom but, rather, a minimum of five different online contexts where the nature of
            the wisdom itself is different). </p>
                  <p>NOTE: When you Google your chosen proverb, you should put quotation marks around it so
            as to weed out partial hits. Your initial search results may be heavily populated by
            lists of all of the “Proverbs of Hell,” or by e-texts of <title level="m">The Marriage
              of Heaven and Hell</title>, and so you may have to dig in order to find instances
            where your chosen proverb is actually being cited as wisdom or counsel. One way to
            adjust your search to yield more of the desired kinds of results is to repeat it with
            the additional term “-Marriage” or “-Blake” (without quotes) in the search field. This
            will yield only hits that do not identify the proverb’s textual or authorial source and
            thus a higher percentage of hits where the proverb is actually being cited as something
            like conventional wisdom.</p>

                  <p>Compiling the table (and especially column C) forces students to be attentive to subtle
            variations in how their chosen proverb gets invoked. It also has the effect of
            discouraging them from thinking that their proverb has a “right” or “best” meaning,
            encouraging them instead to think more in terms of the many things the proverb can
              <title level="m">do</title>. For the purposes of sparking class discussion, however,
            the table is more a means to the end of having each student identify the specific
            grounds or causes for the variations she has observed in her chosen proverb’s meaning as
            it gets invoked in different contexts. You might even require students to append a list
            of these causes (as I have done at the end of the sample complete table). </p>
                  <p>After students compile a list of how and why some of the interpretive variations (in
            column C) happened, they will be able to contribute real-world examples to a class
            discussion about the factors <title level="m">in general</title> that produce
            instabilities in the wisdom of Blake proverbs. When students share these examples, they
            are bound to notice that variations in the use of Blake’s proverbs tend to be a function
            of various combinations of the following factors: <list type="ordered">
                        <item>
                           <emph>Multiple or ambiguous literal meanings of words or phrases</emph>: (e.g.,
                in the case of “The cut worm forgives the plow,” the evidence of the sample table
                demonstrates that some people today take “cut worm” to mean “dead worm,” whereas
                others take it to mean “harmed worm,” whereas still others take it to mean “two
                worms whose missing halves will regenerate”; “forgives” also signifies different
                things to different people, including “accepts as true,” “refuses to be vengeful,”
                “accepts as beneficial to the greater good,” and “accepts as beneficial to
                oneself”). </item>
                        <item>
                           <emph>Syntactical or grammatical ambiguities in the proverb</emph>: (e.g.,
                though the evidence of the sample table suggests this is not presently a common
                reading, “the cut worm forgives the plow” need not refer to a worm offering
                retrospective forgiveness for having been cut but could, rather, refer to an already
                harmed worm proactively forgiving the plow headed towards it to finish it
                off).</item>
                        <item>
                           <emph>An unlimited range of situations in which the proverb could be invoked
                  meaningfully, especially because there are an unlimited range of possible
                  figurative applications for the proverb’s words or images</emph>: (e.g., the
                evidence of the sample table shows that while “worm” can signify an actual worm,
                people tend to invoke it as a metaphor for many different kinds of vulnerable
                entities, including a human being, a soldier, an employee, a war-torn people, a wild
                animal, and even a rule of grammar; likewise, “plow” gets invoked as a metaphor for
                a wide range of things, including a challenge to an individual’s sense of self,
                anything that causes individual suffering, the activity of subsistence living, the
                work of cultural or national cultivation, a force heedless to anything other than
                itself, the course of history, the course of nature, and workplace cutbacks).</item>
                        <item>
                           <emph>Multiple possible affective responses to the proverb’s wisdom</emph>,
                especially because there are <title level="m">multiple possible subjective
                  identifications one could have with the proverb’s figures</title>: (e.g., as the
                evidence of the sample table makes evident, the wisdom of “the cut worm forgives the
                plow” can be invoked in the spirit of tragedy, comedy, or irony, depending on the
                situation and speaker. Some cite it to admire the worm’s powers of forgiveness,
                whereas others cite it to critique the worm’s ignorance or helplessness; some quote
                it to highlight the worm’s selflessness, whereas others view the worm as
                self-preserving; some invoke the line as a justification to plow, whereas others
                invoke it as a critique of plowing or a warning about plowing; etc.). </item>
                     </list> Having discussed how and why Blake’s proverbs behave as they do in contemporary
            culture, students will be in a better position to think about the nature of proverbs as
            linguistic, cultural, and political forms. Prior to this assignment, your students
            probably will never have paid much mind to the practice of citing proverbs, though all
            of them are familiar with it and familiar, too, with many proverbs. Tracking the
            multiplicity and heterogeneity of the wisdom that Blake’s proverbs dispense in a variety
            of contemporary contexts and situations has the virtue of defamiliarizing what amounts
            to a customary practice just enough that students can reflect on it, and on the proverb
            form itself, more critically. The goal is to help your students realize that Blake’s
            proverbs actually exaggerate instabilities within the proverb form generally, so that
            they can have a more intelligent discussion of the artistic, philosophical, theological,
            and political implications of the form’s appearance in <title level="m">The Marriage of
              Heaven and Hell</title> or within Blake’s corpus more generally, depending on how much
            of it you have assigned. The easiest route into such a discussion is to poll the class
            for examples of other proverbs they know. Then, ask them <title level="m">when</title>
            they might be inclined to use some of these proverbs (or when they have heard others use
            them) and, more to the point, <title level="m">why</title> they might be inclined to use
            them. What is the function of invoking a proverb (as opposed to trying to say the same
            thing without doing so)? What makes a proverb a proverb? To the extent that proverbs
            convey something like wisdom, where does this wisdom come from and what is its status or
            authority in relation to other kinds of knowledge?</p>
                  <p>Folklorists who study proverbs do not agree on all points about the nature of the form.
            They do tend to concur, however, that a proverb constitutes a form of repeated wisdom
            that remains lexically stable across iterations and that tends to function as
            conventional wisdom over time.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Roger D. Abrahams
              and Barbara A. Babcock’s “The Literary Use of Proverbs” as well as David Cram’s “The
              Linguistic Status of the Proverb.”</note> Typically, this conventional wisdom
            simultaneously serves an epistemological and a regulatory function insofar as it both
            names a situation and offers strategic counsel in the face of it (though the counsel may
            not point out a particular course of action so much as ask for acceptance of a general
            truth about the situation).<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Kenneth Burke’s <title level="m">The Philosophy of Literary Form </title>(1973 [1-4]); Peter Seitel’s
              “Proverbs: A Social Use of Metaphor”; and Paul D. Goodwin and Joseph W. Wenzel’s
              “Proverbs and Practical Reasoning: A Study in Socio-Logic.” </note> A proverb, one
            might say, is any kind of regulatory wisdom that is cited and received within a culture
            as if it belongs to everyone, as if its wisdom does not issue from an authority external
            to the culture so much as accord with the culture’s—and, by extension, its
            auditor’s—internal regulatory desires or regulatory sense.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Archer Taylor’s <title level="m">The Proverb</title> (1931);
              Shirley L. Arora’s “The Perception of Proverbiality”; and Gavin Edwards’s “Repeating
              the Same Dull Round” (40). </note> It is for this reason that Blake can observe that
            “The sayings used in a nation, mark its character,” as he proposes at the start of the
            “Proverbs of Hell” (Erdman 35). A culture’s proverbs work hegemonically to inscribe
            customs of conduct, or simply customary approaches to living. As such, proverbs tend to
            operate alongside, beneath the purview of, and even at times in conflict with the
            culture’s (and the state’s) actual codified regulations. Though in a few cultures
            proverbs have held legal authority historically as something like common-law precedents
            for how to behave, their regulatory power in Western contexts has almost always tended
            to be extralegal.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On cultures where proverbs carry
              some legal authority, see Ruth Finnegan’s “Proverbs in Africa” as well as Kwesi
              Yankah’s <title level="m">The Proverb in the Context of Akan Rhetoric
              </title>(168-195).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>As students discuss what proverbs are and do, they may not arrive at all of the above
            points on their own. However, because they have approached the proverb form through
            Blake, they likely will realize without much prompting that proverbs’ hegemonic
            regulatory power is incredibly unstable in general and that Blake’s proverbs to some
            extent just exploit or exaggerate the form’s customary instabilities. A quick in-class
            experiment can help spark this realization. Have students write down what they take each
            of the following three well-known English proverbs to mean, along with two situations in
            which they could imagine someone invoking each: “a little knowledge is a dangerous
            thing,” “a rolling stone gathers no moss,” and “out of sight, out of mind.” The results
            will collectively demonstrate that many of the kinds of instabilities they observed
            online with Blake’s proverbs can be true of proverbs more generally.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This exercise is based on a survey that Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett
              conducted in the 1970s. Kirshenblatt-Gimblett discusses the survey, its results, and
              the issue of proverbs’ interpretive instability across people and situations in
              “Toward a Theory of Proverb Meaning.”</note> As they saw with Blake, proverbs often
            work by way of analogy (e.g., “a rolling stone . . .”), and the potential for breakdowns
            in communication can be high as the proverb’s sender and receiver try to trace this
            analogy to the situation at hand (e.g., is “a rolling stone” an irresponsible stone, or
            is it one free of corrosive entanglements?). The situation-specific meaning of proverbs
            also means that the same line’s regulatory counsel can vary markedly across situations
            (e.g., depending on the context, “out of sight, out of mind” can encourage acceptance of
            what feels like a tragic truth, or it can function as an exhortation to engage in some
            opportunistic forgetting).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For an extended study of the
              instability of proverbs’ meanings across situations, see Neal R. Norrick’s <title level="m">How Proverbs Mean</title> (1985).</note> Finally, some proverbs blatantly
            contradict one another (e.g., “out of sight, out of mind” and “absence makes the heart
            grow fonder”) and others can be interpreted as contradicting one another (e.g., “absence
            makes the heart grow fonder” and “a rolling stone gathers no moss”). This makes
            proverbial regulation as a whole a far from systematic or coherent enterprise. There is
            no constitution or system of precedents to which one might refer to determine which
            proverb’s regulatory authority ought to have jurisdiction in a given situation (or have
            the authority to establish precisely what kind of given situation or case is even at
            hand).</p>
                  <p> Discussing the politics of sharing proverbial wisdom gives students an excellent
            foundation for sharing their own wisdom about the “Proverbs of Hell” as a project,
            including how it relates to the rest of <title level="m">The Marriage of Heaven and
              Hell</title> or to whatever other Blake texts you may have assigned. Some students
            will want to call attention to the obvious subversive political implications of
            particular proverbs (e.g., “Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks
            of Religion” [Erdman 36]) and relate these to other moments where Blake makes similar
            political commentaries. Others may note the Zen riddle-like quality of particular
            proverbs (e.g., “Eternity is in love with the productions of time” [Erdman 36]) and
            connect it to Blake’s various calls on individuals to stretch their sensory capacities,
            imaginations, and powers of perception. But the advantage of having had the class think
            about the proverb form as a whole, including both the effects of individual proverbs as
            they circulate and the tendency of Blake’s own proverbs to fragment his corpus (i.e.,
            their propensity to make pieces of larger works circulate on their own), is that it
            gives them many more challenging angles from whence to approach the issue of the
            illuminated books’ artistic, philosophical, and political project. Grounding the wisdom
            of individual proverbs in positions expressed elsewhere in the illuminated books is all
            well and good, but it does run counter to proverbs’ demonstrated propensity to break
            free from their textual context and to their tendency to spread multiple and sometimes
            incompatible kinds of wisdom. Are we missing the forest for the trees if we focus on
            individual proverbs rather than the whole population of them? That is, if we focus on
            their individual “meanings” rather than on what they are capable of doing to the world
            as more people find them meaningful? </p>
                  <p>Questions you might ask students to provoke their thinking along these lines include:
            what might the attraction of a hegemonic regulatory form that is extralegal,
            heterogeneous, and non-systematic be in the context of the other political and
            philosophical views, beliefs, and positions put forth in <title level="m">The
              Marriage</title> or in the illuminated books more generally? Are there things that
            make the proverbs—either singly or collectively—seem incongruous or incompatible with
            other parts of <title level="m">The Marriage </title>or of the illuminated books
            generally? Does it make sense to think about the “Proverbs of Hell” as fulfilling some
            part of the promise that <title level="m">The Marriage</title> makes elsewhere that it
            will contribute to an “improvement of sensual enjoyment” (Erdman 39) or as fulfilling
            some part of its promise that the printing techniques whereby it was created constitute
            a process of burning away blockages that conceal “the infinite” (Erdman 39)? Is there a
            way to see any single “Proverb of Hell” as improving sensory enjoyment or revealing
            infinitude? What about the entire collection of proverbs as a whole? What about the act
            of relief etching? Finally, is the improvement and revelation that <title level="m">The
              Marriage</title> promises—or, for that matter, the kind of “progression” that <title level="m">The Marriage</title> says requires “Contraries” (Erdman 34)—something that
            happens to the individual reader, to an audience of readers, or, through this audience
            as medium, to a population or culture not entirely cognizant that it is happening? What
            evidence in <title level="m">The Marriage</title>, or elsewhere in Blake’s corpus,
            complicates our ability to answer this last question? What insight with respect to this
            question might be offered by the fact that certain Blake proverbs have been released
            from their original textual contexts and now circulate widely across a massive
            English-speaking global population? What insight might be offered by the activity of
            tracking and studying their circulation through a search engine like Google?</p>
                  <p>In my own classroom experience, the final question in this series has encouraged
            students to make an important cognitive leap that might prove provocative, too, even for
            seasoned Blake scholars. To the extent that the “Searching” assignment prompts students
            to study individual Blake proverbs as viral media, it encourages them to conceive of the
            “Proverbs of Hell,” and perhaps the illuminated books in general, not as discrete art
            objects or a discrete corpus but as a kind of engine networked into a population of
            users and, through those users, the world. As several decades of Blake scholarship have
            demonstrated, the internal complexity of and historical context for this engine can
            repay intensive study, as can its power to rewire the perceptions, thinking, and
            politics of the individual users who converge with it. But we also need to think about
            the engine as something that, through its heterogeneous convergences with a large
            population of users over time, all of them socially and culturally networked in their
            own ways, manages to make certain pieces of itself go viral through still larger
            populations. To the extent that these viral fragments circulate not just across media
            networks and platforms but also through the difference-producing medium of individual
            users’ and populations’ disparate regulatory desires for themselves, the fragments have
            the effect of complicating and rendering more heterogeneous the world that they also
            connect and rewire in new ways. A differential engine, indeed. </p>
                  <p>At the same time, as we develop better tools—both theoretical and technological—for
            studying Blake fragments in their complexifying work, we can also begin to look at them
            as agents for revealing the infinitude of this complex, connected world in ways that
            they make uniquely possible. When I had my graduate students do the “Searching”
            assignment recently, the resulting classroom discussion yielded the insight that it may
            not be exactly apt to conceive of this process of revelation by way of analogy to a
            computer virus or “worm,” which, through its passage from computer to computer, renders
            traceable the complexity and interconnectedness of global computing networks.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Thank you to the students in ENG 730: “Participatory
              Romanticism,” at Syracuse University in Fall 2015, for diligently completing this
              assignment and for contributing to the two incisive classroom discussions that
              resulted from it: Matt Chacko, Vicky Cheng, Noelle Hedgcock, Ashley O’Mara, David
              Peterka, and John Sanders. </note> After all, Blake’s proverbs move through culture
            more rhizomatically than can be mapped through the woven or branching image of
            interlaced networks. More to the point, in contrast to viruses or worms following
            programmers’ source codes, they also prove capable of infecting according to new rules.
            Still, I was able to suggest to students that the analogy becomes more apt if we merge
            the idea of the digital worm with that of the more earthly, cultivation-friendly
            variety, the kind that folk wisdom and some scientists tell us can be made more powerful
            when cut, because cutting does not harm it so much as create new worms with minds of
            their own. We could do worse as Blake scholars than to encourage our students to
            approach his proverbs as special kinds of digital worms that respond to and activate a
            potentially unlimited number of regulatory codes each time a user makes contact with
            them, recites them, resituates them, retweets them, or even just remembers them.
            Encouraging such an approach would be one step closer to realizing O’Gorman’s
            compelling—and self-professedly Blakean—call to develop pedagogies that use new media
            not “for archival purposes” but “as a means of rousing ourselves from the ‘Single vision
            &amp; Newton’s sleep’ [Erdman 722] in which print technology has steeped us.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See O’Gorman’s <title level="m">E-crit</title> (66).
              Before laying out this call, O’Gorman describes a simple, smart classroom exercise for
              making students more cognizant of the dynamics of image-text interactions in Blake. It
              involves blanking out the text of Blake’s “Nurse’s Song,” having them write lines to
              go with Blake’s accompanying images for the poem, and then, upon comparing their lines
              to Blake’s, reflecting on the extent to which image and text restrict (and open up)
              ways of seeing each other, as well as ways of seeing vision itself. </note> At the
            very least, to have students begin to see the web through Blake by seeking out Blake on
            the web can be a productive and evocative means of bringing the specificities of both
            forms of new media into critical focus. </p>
                  <p>That said, one of the potential pitfalls of this kind of discussion is that the
            participants in it must always be on their guard against the tendency to assert a clear
            demarcation between the world of the internet and “reality,” as such a distinction
            (implicitly present in concepts like “cyberspace” and even “virtual reality”) reduces
            the extent to which the web is a part of reality and reality to some extent “realizes”
            (and forecloses) some of its own virtuality through the web. In discussing this issue
            with my graduate students who completed the web-browsing assignment, we arrived at the
            idea that it might be more accurate to describe the web as an ever-shifting, expanding,
            and interpenetrating archive of a substantial set of the ways and means whereby reality,
            at present, publishes its efforts and its tools to connect with itself, know itself,
            sell itself to itself, and even <title level="m">become</title> itself (or, rather, to
            realize its previous virtuality). We also discussed the importance of never confusing
            the results of a Google search with some kind of objectively arrived at map of this
            archive (or of reality), insofar as Google’s search engine not only doesn’t return
            results from certain parts of the web (and which parts will differ according to the
            nation in which the user’s IP address is registered) but also relies upon a proprietary
            algorithm that privileges corporate websites over popular sites and that can vary based
            on a user’s previous searches. The thing actually being mapped by any given set of
            Google search results is the present state of Google’s dynamic algorithm itself as
            applied to the dynamic object of the web by a particular user and machine. Nevertheless,
            though engines like Google’s might be hopelessly compromised tools if one’s scholarly
            project were to try to use internet search engines to map the reality of which they are
            a part, or even simply to map that reality’s online archive and interfaces, what they
            can do—and do quite well—is give students and scholars alike a vehicle through which to
            begin to recognize the virtuality and affordances of certain identifiable cultural forms
            that have become resonant. Though a Google search cannot map this resonance in its
            totality, or map the degrees to which certain virtualities of given forms are being
            realized, it can provide sufficient evidence that some virtualities are being realized
            and perhaps make us aware of others that previously we did not know existed—new messages
            that different media are becoming. </p>

                  <p>One potential critique of the “Searching for Blake’s Hellish Wisdom” assignment is that
            it does little to historicize the proverb form, especially Blake’s use of it. This can
            be addressed to some extent by assigning secondary readings that situate Blake’s
            proverbs in relation to late-eighteenth-century thinking more generally about proverbs,
            aphorisms, the law, regulation, and ideology.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See, for
              example, John Villalobos’s “William Blake’s ‘Proverbs of Hell’ and the Tradition of
              Wisdom Literature”; Mark Barr’s “Practicing Resistance: Blake, <title level="m">Milton</title>, and the English Jury”; and my own essays, “Blakespotting” and “The
              Joy of Looking.” </note> Such readings can help to make the case that the class’s
            theorization of the proverb form would have been available to some extent to a
            late-eighteenth-century thinker, especially one (like Blake) familiar with the state of
            Biblical scholarship on proverbs, the workings of the law, and/or the philosophy of
            aesthetics. Secondary readings can also point interested students to other primary texts
            from the period that Blake’s proverbs can be studied profitably alongside, such as
            Johann Kaspar Lavater’s <title level="m">Aphorisms on Man</title> (1788), which fueled
            Blake’s interest in the proverb form.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On the influence
              of Lavater’s <title level="m">Aphorisms</title> on Blake as well as Blake’s influence

              Lavater, Fuseli and Blake’s Imprint on <title level="m">Aphorisms on Man</title>.”
            </note> Still, while secondary readings and additional primary readings can historically
            contextualize the general insights that the “Searching” assignment delivers, they will
            not necessarily counteract the tendency of some students to assume that certain
            instabilities currently made manifest in the application of individual Blake proverbs
            were possible all along or, alternatively, that the wide range of contemporary online
            invocations of a single proverb sufficiently captures the full extent of its
            possibilities in other times and places. You can help students become more aware of
            these as problematic modes of thinking by having them complete the “Re-searching for
            Blake’s Hellish Wisdom” assignment described below. </p>
                  <p>This assignment is designed to heighten students’ awareness that every conceivable
            interpretation or application of their chosen Blake proverb has historical conditions of
            possibility—that a proverb (and language in general) does not just contain a treasure
            trove of meanings always there waiting to be activated. The assignment consists of three
            separate prompts, from which students must select two, charging them to research the
            historical and interpretive conditions that were in place in Blake’s day for their
            chosen proverb to become meaningful in particular ways. Admittedly, by refocusing
            students’ attention on their chosen proverb’s “original” historical and textual
            contexts, the assignment may seem to run counter to the idea that only by studying what
            the entire population of Blake’s proverbs does apart from its “original” context can we
            grasp the full complexity of its significance. But the advantage of doing the
            “Re-searching” assignment after the “Searching” one is that you can help students
            recognize that the “Re-searching” assignment need not conflict with this idea. The
            assignment does not encourage them to privilege “original” historical and textual
            contexts as placing limits on what their chosen proverb <title level="m">meant once and
              for all </title>but, rather, challenges them to find evidence of the interpretive
            instabilities and historical conditions that opened up what it <emph>could have done at
              first</emph>. The “Re-searching” assignment also carries the added pedagogical
            benefits of developing students’ research and close-reading skills, as well as adding to
            their knowledge of the specificity of Blake’s historical context. To share this
            knowledge, as well as to reinforce the general lesson that interpretations always have
            historical conditions of possibility, you might have students share their research
            reports with each other via a course discussion board, blog, or website.</p>

                  <p>In the “Searching for Blake’s Hellish Wisdom” assignment, you tracked many of the
            different interpretations currently operative for a Blake proverb of your choice, as

                  <p>In doing the “Searching for Blake’s Hellish Wisdom” assignment, one thing that I found
            that causes divergent interpretations today of the proverb “The cut worm forgives the
            plow” (Erdman 35) is that people sometimes interpret “cut worm” to signify that the worm
            is dead or irreparably maimed whereas others seem to think that the two halves of a cut
            worm can regenerate into two new worms. Therefore, I decided to research the state of
            knowledge in Blake’s era concerning the ability of worms to regenerate. I discovered
            that worms cut in two might have been less irreparably harmed in the minds of Blake’s
            contemporaries than for modern readers, though there was no clear consensus on the
            issue. Worms were a subject of particular interest for eighteenth-century natural
            philosophers. At the start of the century, worms were at the center of debates over the
            issue of how species originated, as they were often the main example adduced in favor of
            the erroneous doctrine of spontaneous generation, which held that some complex creatures
            are eggless and originate spontaneously out of non-living matter. Though belief in
            worms’ ability to generate spontaneously quickly waned as the century progressed, new
            interest focused on their supposed ability to <title level="m">re</title>generate (Roger
            256-257, 317).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Note that all parenthetical references
              and other citations in the sample research reports have been abbreviated significantly
              and, of course, do not appear in full in any bibliographical lists in this
              essay.</note> Charles Bonnet, a Genevan philosopher, conducted some influential
            experiments in the early-eighteenth century wherein he cut some small freshwater worms
            into various sections and observed that the sections regrew. As the Victorian naturalist
            George Johnston described it, “The halves became whole worms,—the thirds and quarters
            also,—and the morsels grew to be complete individuals, not to be distinguishable from
            the original stock” (318-319). With more terrestrial worms, Bonnet found the
            regeneration to be slower and more erratic, with more casualties amongst the morsels
            (Johnston 319). Still, the idea took hold that worms, including earthworms, can
            regenerate their missing halves when cut. Although some mid-eighteenth-century European
            scientists, including Carl Linnaeus, expressed skepticism on this point, others, such as
            René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur, claimed to have some success regenerating two
            complete earthworms from cut worms (Johnston 319-320). It seems safe to say that, in the
            imagination of many in Blake’s day, worms cut by plows were not so much dead or maimed
            as multiplied. The year after Blake’s death, another prominent scientist—this time, the
            French zoologist Marie Jules César Lelorgne de Savigny—claimed success in regenerating
            multiple worms from certain species of earthworms. By 1843, the idea that earthworms
            could regenerate in this way was widely enough accepted in Britain that it was advanced
            in anatomy lectures in London by the prominent naturalist Sir Richard Owen (Johnston
            321).</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>According to evidence in the <title level="m">OED</title>, “worm” had a more expansive
            literal connotation in Blake’s day, signifying nearly any creature that crawls along the
            ground, including snakes [1667 John Milton, <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title>
            (7.476): “At once came forth whatever creeps the ground, Insect or Worme”; 1820 Percy
            Bysshe Shelley, <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> (4.1.151): “Ye beasts and
            birds, Ye worms, and fish.”]. It could also signify “The larva of an insect; a maggot,
            grub, or caterpillar, esp. one that feeds on and destroys flesh, fruit, leaves, cereals,
            textile fabrics, and the like,” and, collectively, “The worm” could also signify “a
            destructive pest” (<title level="m">Oxford English Dictionary Online</title>, s.v.
            “worm”). According to my findings in the “Searching for Blake’s Hellish Wisdom”
            assignment, people today who invoke “The cut worm forgives the plow” (Erdman 35) do not
            tend to regard the worm as a pestilential or potentially destructive creature. Indeed,
            almost all imply that the worm is a victim or heroic survivor and not a force that
            could, say, become more powerful (and potentially more violent and destructive) than the
            plow or plow-operator. But had the proverb gained currency in Blake’s day, many might
            have heard in it a warning that attempts to stamp out certain ills only multiply those
            very ills, or, more in line with Blake’s political radicalism, that the act of harming
            and killing society’s lowest and most oppressed, as if they were worms, only strengthens
            the cause of resistance or even rebellion. Such an interpretation seems entirely
            possible given the currency in Blake’s day, according to the <title level="m">OED</title>, of “worm” as a term to signify “A human being likened to a worm or
            reptile as an object of contempt, scorn, or pity; an abject, miserable creature” (<title level="m">Oxford English Dictionary Online</title>, s.v. “worm”). It is this
            signification that underlies the Romantic-era proverb “tread on a worm and it will turn”
            or “even a worm will turn,” which the <title level="m">OED</title> translates as “even
            the humblest will resent extreme ill-treatment” [e.g., 1818 Shelley, <title level="m">Julian &amp; Maddalo</title> (413): “Even the instinctive worm on which we tread /
            Turns, though it wound not”]. “The cut worm forgives the plow” can be read as a kind of
            translation of this proverb into other imagery.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p> Plows and plowing are recurring figures in Blake’s “Proverbs of Hell.” In addition to
            “The cut worm forgives the plow” (Erdman 35), they appear in three other proverbs:
            “Drive your cart and your plow over the bones of the dead” (Erdman 35), “As the plow
            follows words, so God rewards prayers” (Erdman 37), and “Prayers plow not! Praises reap
            not!” (Erdman 37). To the extent that the four proverbs associate plows and plowing with
            worms, driving, following, and reaping, they have a tendency collectively to pressure
            the reader to think of plows/plowing in terms of agricultural cultivation (as opposed
            to, say, their associations—associations more current in Blake’s day than our own—with
            paper-cutting and book-making). Despite this stability, however, the images of prayers
            that “plow not” and a plow that “follows words” already encourage the reader to think of
            cultivation more figuratively than literally. It is in imagining the four proverbs’
            possible figurative and situational applications that they collectively multiply one
            another’s meaningful possibilities, virtually ensuring that different readers will apply
            the same proverb very differently. “Drive your cart and plow over the bones of the
            dead,” for example, would seem to invest plowing with a kind of revolutionary power of
            revitalization and renewal, turning dead bones into life-sustaining natural fertilizer.
            Reading “The cut worm forgives the plow” alongside it thus might encourage the reader to
            merge the two, such that one imagines the cut worm forgiving the plow for the same
            reason that one is encouraged to drive one’s plow over dead bones—namely, because the
            worm recognizes that the collateral violence of the act is outweighed by the greater
            good of the revitalization and renewal it brings. Conversely, “As the plow follows
            words, so God rewards prayers” would seem, according to one reading, to make plowing
            into a potentially deluded or misdirected enterprise. Plows follow words in the sense
            that plow-drivers give orders to teams of oxen, but how many Christians regard God as a
            plow that does the bidding of those who pray? Perhaps the point is that oxen don’t
            actually follow verbal orders, just as the other plowing proverb tells us that “Prayers
            plow not.” Indeed, <title level="m">are</title> there any oxen in this proverb, or just
            a farmer cursing at his inanimate plow? One reading of the proverb is that God cannot be
            controlled by prayers, just as a plow does not follow verbal orders. Another is that God
            rewards not words but correct actions, just as a plow does. Another, more radical,
            interpretation is that just as there is no plow that words can move, there is no God to
            reward prayers. While none of these readings explains anything explicitly about the
            merits of plowing, each does plant the idea that not everyone who wants to plow knows
            what he is doing. The effect is to make the reader of “The cut worm forgives the plow”
            less apt to see the proverb as an endorsement of willing self-sacrifice to a greater
            good than as a critique of the complicity of victims in their own oppression by those
            who think they know best. All of this would suggest that one of the major kinds of
            regulatory instability we see operative in this proverb’s use today was potentially
            present from the time of its publication by Blake. Just as some people today cite the
            proverb to celebrate the worm’s selflessness and powers of forgiveness, whereas others
            cite it to critique the worm’s ignorance and self-defeating servility, we can imagine
            readers of the “Proverbs of Hell” in Blake’s age doing the same.</p>

                     <cell>Post in a web forum devoted to growing cannabis. The post is responding to a query
              about whether it is bad for growing soil to have worms in it and, if not, whether it
              is acceptable if one accidentally cuts those worms in the process of mixing the soil. </cell>
                     <cell>It is acceptable to plow because, aside from the fact that the act of cutting
              worms is a necessary by-product of the positive work of cultivation, the worm itself
              is not really sacrificed (“worms regenerate fairly well after being cut”). </cell>

                     <cell>Comment in response to a blog post by an officer in the US Marine Corps describing
              his experiences in Afghanistan. The comment responds specifically to a blog post about
              the complacency of Americans toward the sacrifices the military is making for them
              abroad. The post describes a firefight in which 30 marines successfully held off 250
              insurgents and yet did not receive any media coverage for their heroism.</cell>
                     <cell>Not clear. In context, the implication is perhaps that the blogger should complain
              less: i.e., that those who make sacrifices are repaid by the understanding that they
              do so in the service of a greater good. That said, given the attention in the blog
              post to the dead insurgents and to the Afghan people’s respect for the tactical
              prowess of the marines in this firefight, one could also read the person invoking the
              proverb as trying to say: “A culture or group that suffers collateral damage or loss
              in the name of progress/cultivation forgives in hindsight.” </cell>

              that the plow will crash on with or without the worm's approval.”</cell>

                     <cell>Comment on a website for a conservative political magazine. The comment is in
              response to a 2012 review of a book about the inevitability of Britain’s economic
              collapse and how life goes on after such collapses. The book also points out that
              sometimes those most exploited by economic changes can, ironically, end up being the
              changes’ strongest political supporters. The title of the review refers to the British
              populace as “worms.” </cell>

              world can forgive the world’s seemingly detrimental events as part of a beneficial
              divine plan.</cell>

                     <cell>Comment on a thread responding to a 2009 article in the American Copy Editors
              Society (ACES) newsletter. The article refers to the declining economic prospects of
              journalism, and, with it, copyediting, making reference to the fact that former
              Society President John McIntyre had been laid off in the past year by <hi rend="italic">The Baltimore Sun</hi>. The comment is from a copy editor disaffected
              with the ineffectiveness of ACES. He closes by writing, “A shout out to John McIntyre!
              Remember: The cut worm forgives the plow!”</cell>
                     <cell rend="Normal_(Web)">This is a complicated citation. It interprets the proverb to
              mean something like “one can or should accept one’s sacrifice in the service of a
              greater good” (in this case, the greater good of keeping a failing industry afloat).
              However, in context, this is clearly a sarcastic invocation of the proverb, implicitly
              suggesting that the proverb’s “wisdom” is self-serving to supporters of plow-wielders
              and does not issue from the mouths of cut worms.</cell>

                  <head>II. Sources of Differences in Meaning when “The cut worm forgives the plow” is Cited
            Online [sample] </head>
                  <list type="bulleted">
                     <item>“Worm” can either signify an actual worm or serve as a metaphor for a wide range
              of things, including a human (either an everyman figure or a more specific person,
              like a soldier, an employee, or a war-torn people), any animal, any entity that lacks
              the capability of exacting revenge, and a word.</item>
                     <item>The literal meaning of “cut worm” signifies different things to different people,
              including harmed worms, dead or sacrificed worms, or two live worms. </item>
                     <item>“Forgives” signifies different things to different people, including something
              like “accepts as true” and “accepts as good.” In the case of the latter, some
              translate “good” as “beneficial to the greater good” and others as “beneficial to
              oneself.” </item>
                     <item>“Plow” or the act of plowing becomes a metaphor for a wide range of things,
              including a psychological challenge to an individual’s sense of self, a sharp tool of
              agricultural cultivation, anything that causes individual suffering or pain, the
              activity of subsistence living, the activity of cultural or national
              transformation/improvement, a powerful force heedless to anything other than itself,
              the course of history, the course of nature, and workplace cutbacks. </item>
                     <item>Some people cite the proverb as if its wisdom is directed to a potential cut worm,
              whereas others cite it as if its wisdom is for a potential plow or plow-wielder. </item>
                     <item>Depending on context, the proverb-citer may be asking her hearer to accept (or,
              alternatively, to lament others’ acceptance of) a plow that has already come through,
              to encourage an approach to future plowing that could or inevitably will happen, or
              actually to engage in plowing.</item>

               <p rend="noCount">While many Blake scholars across several generations have drawn attention
          to the varied processes at play in the illuminated books, prophecy—the particular aspects
          of those unique textual objects designed to provide “instruction” by operating on
          readers—has never been fully brought into a unified framework. This essay seeks to do so.
          Gathering aspects of scholarship focused on textuality, readings grounded in reception
          dynamics, and psychoanalytic critical theories, the essay examines the Blakean work as
          pedagogical instrumentation, pursuing these concerns through <title level="m">The Marriage
            of Heaven and Hell</title> (1790) and <title level="m">Milton</title> (comp. ca.

                  <head>Mirrored Method/Reflective Modes</head>
                  <p>This essay contemplates Blakean textual practices as a method to induce intellectual
            activities often associated with pedagogy, beginning with the ontological moment when
            the printing technique (acid corrosion of copper to create the script and lines of
            illuminated printing) first appears as a <title level="m">leitmotif</title> in the canon
            and concluding with the teleological moment when mirrored printing disappears from
            textual presence, closing Blake’s deployment/employment of the techniques associated
            with <title level="m">mise en abyme</title>. Two visual moments frame my meditation on
            textual method as pedagogical technique and are well-known scenes of instruction in the
            illuminated books—although situated at different yet related incipient points of
            culminating textual tactics deployed for transformational strategies (one early and one
            late). The analysis opens with a consideration of the curiously complex half-plate
            design at the bottom of the tenth plate of <title level="m">The Marriage of Heaven and
              Hell</title> (1790), where William Blake offers a visual “key” for unlocking the
            verbal “code” (i.e., how to read) a textual operation (whether verbal or visual)
            critically categorized as one form of <title level="m">mise en abyme</title> (“mirror in
            the text”), a presence that tends to work towards meta-textual ends.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The most influential elaboration of the aesthetic, dramatic, and
              narratological dimensions of this textual component occurred with the publication of
              Lucien Dällenbach’s <title level="m">Le récit spéculaire: Essai sur la mise en
                abyme</title> (1977), later published as <title level="m">The Mirror in the
                Text</title> (1989), which had “a double outcome: it confirmed our working
              hypothesis, namely that the <title level="m">mise en abyme</title> is a structured
              reality, despite the apparent variety and randomness of its actual manifestation; and
              it gave us an adequately rigorous method to enable us to trace its diachronic
              evolution” (Dällenbach 165).</note> The “end,” in this case, is the inculcation of
            certain hermeneutic practices with the capacity to develop and sustain what Alain Badiou
            terms “infinite thought” as a sought outcome of all pedagogical activities.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Such a pedagogy should cultivate skills transferable as
              needed to all events and situations, since “the language of the situation is the
              medium of knowledge” (Badiou 133).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The analysis takes thereafter something of a quantum leap to the last of the
            illuminated works, <title level="m">Jerusalem</title> (comp. ca. 1804-1820), to examine
            the fluid flow of mirrored language on Plate 81 (line 15), which is the last occurrence
            of mirrored writing in the canonical illuminated prophecies: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>In Heaven the only Art of Living</l>
                           <l>Is Forgetting &amp; Forgiving</l>
                           <l>Especially to the Female</l>
                           <l>But if you on Earth Forgive</l>
                           <l>You shall not find where to Live[.] (Erdman 238)<note place="foot" resp="editors"> All parenthetical page citations for William Blake quotes refer to David
                    Erdman’s edition of <title level="m">The Complete Poetry and Prose of William
                      Blake</title> (1988). </note>
                           </l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> Four such reflective lessons occur in <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>, although the first (“Every Thing has its Vermin O Spectre of the
            Sleeping Dead!”) from the frontispiece is only barely legible (Erdman 144). On this
            particular plate, the legible lesson focuses on fallen “love,” grimly concluding that
            “In Heaven Love begets Love! But Fear is the Parent of Earthly Love” (Erdman 238). In
            relation to this analytic inscape of <title level="m">eros</title>, the reversed writing
            proposes forgiveness as the vehicle for ascension to heaven (a complex place within
            Blakean constructs), which establishes the method (forgiveness) by which to realize the
            aim (love)—a realization unavailable to everyone pictured in the design and its
            narrative. Real love untinged by fear as a lived experience can only, in the horizon of
            Blakean ethical constructs, be achieved through the perfection of processes of
            self-annihilation (mapped in extreme detail in <title level="m">Milton</title> [comp.
            ca. 1804-1811]) to overthrow our individual specters and subvert collective selfhood.
            These words are spoken by Gwendolen (the first daughter of Albion), who often represents
            the <title level="m">Female Will</title> in Blake’s late mythological casting of
            dramatized mental attributions with material operations (hence “a Sublime Allegory . . .
            addressd to the Intellectual powers” created to cultivate “Corporeal Understanding”
            [Erdman 730]). The primary poetic thrust of <title level="m">Jerusalem</title> probes
            the interplay between the punctuated historical development of moral law and the states
            of mind by which these stages achieve material bodies anchored in the real. However, my
            focus will be on the meta-textual, the zone of pedagogy if you will, since the last
            canonical instance of mirrored writing links the instrument of knowledge (i.e.,
            technique) directly to its transformation of knowledge into wisdom (i.e., forgiveness)
            manifest as “the Art of Living.” In this sense, I tend to see works like <title level="m">The Marriage</title> or <title level="m">Milton</title> as books of wisdom
            in the same educational tenor and vehicle as <title level="m">The Book of Job</title> or
              <title level="m">The Heart Sutra</title> (a point made by Salman Rushdie in his
            evocation of Blake in the preface to <title level="m">The Satanic Verses</title>
            [1988]).</p>
                  <p>These textual spots of imaginary time at the opening and closing of the illuminated
            canon themselves depend on meta-textual operations to achieve different textual effects
            and ends, and the discrete scenes, while performing local functions for individual
            works, nonetheless manifest symbolic mirroring properties that connect them across the
            temporal/textual semiotic sea of the illuminated works. The use of <title level="m">mise
              en abyme</title> as intra/intertextual vehicle in an experimental printing method
            embodies a rather sophisticated vision of textual operations (given its inherent
            function as “a kind of reflexion” [Dällenbach 8]) and shadows the physical manifestation
            of the long-recognized psychoanalytic structuration encoded into the illuminated works.
            When tracking the vehicle that moves the inert work into activity, the unveiled textual
            trajectory traces the development of a fledgling meta-textual technique (the
            pronouncement in a 1790s fiery coda of a new type of printing—with its corrosive
            mirrored method) to the last illuminated appearance of a piece of <title level="m">mirrored writing</title> in the horizon of textual operations (concluding the
            practice of occasionally leaving lines reversed in certain areas of <title level="m">Milton</title> and <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>).</p>
                  <p>Blake’s use of the full spectrum of functions associated with the <title level="m">mise
              en abyme</title> element of production from <title level="m">The Marriage</title> to
              <title level="m">Jerusalem</title> (a passage from mirrors in the text to texts
            operating as mirrors) brings to fruition across this span the promise of the former in
            the operations of the latter, with this movement creating a vehicle of complexity,
            fluidity, illumination, instability, lucidity, opaqueness, and speculation—an instrument
            of instruction incorporating the means to unveil and then shatter the mirror from which
            its symbolic characters and its textual body arose. In essence, the illuminated works in
            any number of ways force readers to encounter and experience “what psychoanalysis calls
            the mirror stage” (Culler and Abrams 150), the incipient point of entry into a
            conceptual structure of the subject articulated by Jacques Lacan, resulting in “<title level="m">an identification</title>” by which the adoption “of the <title level="m">imago</title> . . . establishes a relation between the organism and its reality”
            through an experience transacted within “the intraorganic mirror” (<title level="j">Écrits</title> 2, 4). The adoption of the <title level="m">imago</title> stabilizes
            the subject, rendering the psyche “dependent on the perception of the self as other” yet
            coming at the cost of “the complex specular play of identification and alienation”
            (Culler and Abrams 150-151). Of course, this process in Blake’s sublime allegory gives
            rise to the “Spectre,” which must be “cast . . . into the Lake” of mind (Erdman 184)—the
            reflective pool from which it emerges—to allow an awakening into humanity. This antidote
            to the malady of alienation and fragmentation, the overt symptoms of reflexive processes
            of subject formation, is the lesson taught through perhaps the best known instance of
            mirrored writing, which occurs in <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors"> As a transcription of the mirrored writing suggests, the move towards
              self-annihilation corrects both individual enchantment of secondary narcissism—the
              self-victimization that comes with subjectivity constructed via the imaginary from the
              outside inside—that identifies with another “self” (but one anchored in the real and
              not reducible to self-as-other): “Each man is in / His Spectre’s power / Untill the
              arrival / Of that Hour, / When his Humanity / awake / And cast his Spectre / Into the
              Lake” (Erdman 184).</note> (Blake, Vol. 1, Plate 41).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Unless otherwise noted, in this essay references to Blake’s plates (by volume and
              plate number) refer to The William Blake Trust/Princeton University Press’s <title level="m">The Illuminated Books of William Blake</title>, gen. ed. David Bindman (6
              vols., 1991-1995). </note> As the imp on the scroll ex/presses, and as Diane Piccitto
            has recently argued, “This mirrored writing is in itself an alienation from a process
            that should be familiar, reading, and forces the audience to grapple with the work” in
            unusually energetic ways (Piccitto 78). This forced grappling, I argue, operates as a
            meta-textual pedagogical zone, with the reversed writing forcing a mirror-stage
            encounter wherein one either seeks or becomes a mirror. Through mirrored writing, then,
            Blake’s textual design pragmatically prompts particular acts of reception to open the
            doors of perception (think of the gates of Golgonooza initiating passage into virtually
            infinite paths and worlds), which would be a necessary boundary condition
            (particularized acts of reception) for an aspiring transactional and transformational
            textual condition. </p>
                  <p>The same <title level="m">textual condition</title> (a fusion of the psychological and
            textual within the meta-textual zone of the pedagogical in the service of cultivating
            salvific forms of self-annihilation capable of ending the psychic domination of one’s
            spectre and deconstructing the tendency from which it emerges, the collective state of
            consciousness known as selfhood) is a quite skillful vehicle in light of its ability “to
            draw the antidote of self-consciousness from consciousness itself” (Hartman 48). The
            annihilation of the spectre, which counters ceaseless circulation in the speculum of
            secondary narcissism and which is predicated upon enthrallment via identification with
            an imaginary self (an <foreign>imago</foreign>), since the emergent stability of
            subjectivity created during “the mirror stage also installs a rival other” (Nobus 113),
            thereby establishes alienation as one cornerstone of consciousness and requires acts of
            “anti-self-consciousness” (Hartman 46) to overcome its deleterious effects. This
            periodic practice of self-annihilation generates “an ethics of alterity . . . focused
            less on the individual as the locus of ethical scrutiny . . . than on relationships”
            (Moskal 5).</p>
                  <p>Blake’s development of different uses of <title level="m">mise en abyme</title>
            coincides with the punctuated appearance of an ethos of otherness that slowly replaces
            the earlier emphasis on an ethos of energy, and the vehicle and its outcome are
            intimately bound together. This complicated commitment intermittently surges into
            presence with ever-greater insistence after the Lambeth works and as the last epics
            struggle to realize systemic synthesis. And so, the mirrored textuality migrates from
            evocation in a text so designed (i.e., by the “new” mirrored writing as mode of
            production) to its final unveiling within textual operations and technologies (i.e., by
            literal inclusion of reversed lines to unveil [and thereby unleash] meta-textual effects
            experienced as psychological affects)—with the revolutionary furor of the former
            underwriting the evolutionary flavor of the latter. As Dällenbach suggests following his
            masterful typological analysis of the varied modes of <title level="m">mise en
              abyme</title>: “ . . . the constitution of the <title level="m">mise en abyme</title>
            as an ‘organ’ of the text is synonymous with its function” (55). Under Blake’s
            direction, the sought function created a text that gazes back, that challenges in its
            very graphic composition, that frustrates and stymies in its willed opacity, and that is
            operative on numerous semiotic plateaus—whether an interlinear design flourish or a
            full-plate illustration. And what is taught—to act, to commit, and to engage—is
            transferable to any activity and capable of replication in any new textual form of
            representation. Blake’s textual approach craftily captures “the functions of production,
            reception and their interactions” while providing the “structure, function, [and]
            communication” needed to shape a “phenomenological reader” (Holub 108, 109, 85).</p>

                  <head>Phenomenological Readers and the Burden of Reception </head>
                  <p>Intermingling reception dynamics and psychoanalytic theory within textual operations
            provides an extremely powerful yet subtle hermeneutic path (a skillful means) to a
            pedagogical end (awakened awareness of one’s own similar entanglements), and in the view
            of some psychoanalytic critics, their coupling is a natural partnership, since
            “reader-response criticism is, in the world of literary criticism, the most practical
            embodiment of the basic psychoanalytic insight that all knowledge is personal knowledge”
            (Holland 58). However, from the reception side of the event-horizon, contact in the
            free-flowing zone cannot be reduced to “an arbitrary series of merely subjective
            impressions, but rather the carrying out of specific instructions in a process of
            directed perception” (Jauss 23). Blake’s particular fusion of these strains—the
            illuminated book as pedagogical tool and anagogical instrument—requires a deeply
            enriched semiotic field that functions as preliminary <title level="m">scene of
              instruction</title> (for both Blake the author and Blake the industry), and the
            shifting application of watercolors and re-inscription of individual plates across time
            exhibit a willingness to alter and transform the vehicle of illumination and to adapt
            and perfect its textual operations for particular effects and ends. The inaugural moment
            is evocation of method in <title level="m">The Marriage</title>, and the work positions
            readers “on the abyss of the five senses” to contemplate “a mighty Devil [who] . . . on
            the sides of the rock, with corroding fires” (Erdman 35)—the post-inscriptive chemical
            process at the base of the method—etches a proverb that encourages identification as
            affective reception dynamic, the particular process at the foundation of the Lacanian
            structure of subjectivity (i.e., the mirror-stage). However, the mirrored operations
            situated in the very constitution of the physical body of <title level="m">The
              Marriage</title> is verbalized on the sixth plate but initially felt visually when
            “looking awry” at its title plate design (with its anamorphic features) (Žižek 15-19;
            Lacan, <title level="m">Four Fundamental Concepts </title>79-90). Both establish on two
            entangled planes the theme of the transformational text and its corrosive origins and
            institute its textual operations as sequential mirror-stage encounters serving as
            “structuring situation[s]” (Green 166), with the final flowering of these early semiotic
            seeds emerging within the vibrant pages of <title level="m">Milton</title> and <title level="m">Jerusalem</title>, works which confront readers with “[infinite] zone[s] of
            indeterminacy” yet “provide tools of . . . ideological analysis” (Rothenberg 89, 134). </p>
                  <p>The extraordinary design at the foot of the tenth plate of <title level="m">The
              Marriage</title> (Blake, Vol. 3, Plate 10), which appears immediately following
            passage through the “Proverbs of Hell,” ostensibly illustrates the event described in
            the work’s first “Memorable Fancy,” where the I-persona, while collecting proverbs from
            hell, sees a “mighty Devil” writing on the face of a cliff “with corroding fires” the
            primary proverb in the work: “How do you know but ev’ry Bird that cuts the airy way, /
            Is an immense world of delight, clos’d by your senses five” (Erdman 35). The design
            immediately follows the conclusion of the “Proverbs of Hell,” and in their facsimile
            edition, Morris Eaves, Robert Essick, and Joseph Viscomi offer this description of the
            activities unfolding at this crucial scene of instruction: <quote>. . . a kneeling male
              devil with bat wings points to the scroll in his lap, while a seated figure (probably
              male) to the left writes down what he says and a second seated figure (probably male)
              to the right looks over his shoulder and copies from the scroll to the tablet in his
              lap[.] (134)</quote> In considering the narrative segment serving as inspiration for
            the design, the encounter of the I-persona with the mighty devil might fit a portion of
            the illustration (i.e., the reception dynamics sketched on the left side of the plate),
            yet the reading offered by Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi— attending in great detail to the
            description of the material/s at hand—sheds little light on the hermeneutic imperatives,
            the meta-critical resonances, or the operational dynamics of the poem’s textuality. This
            moment, which records the first transmission of infernal wisdom comprising the “Bible of
            Hell” to another (the I-persona), clearly requires the figural supplement of the third
            entity on the right, who remains unaccounted for (only acknowledged) in relation to the
            events included in the first memorable fancy. No matter the shifting background and
            differing application of paint so prominent on the various plates of the work, the
            figuration remains the steady state across all (historical) transformations of its
            surface features, delineating the most important dimension of the work at this crucial
            point of transition: <title level="m">how to read this particular work.</title>
                  </p>
                  <p>The context for the illustration is its capture of a narrative moment of transmission
            (of teaching) in the first memorable fancy for the work, which follows a frontal parodic
            and satiric assault on the construction of knowledge and (in the case of memorable
            fancies) even those past influences who impacted Blake’s thinking (i.e., Emanuel
              Swedenborg).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Thus, one semiotic strain to be
              confronted (through active reception) must be the work’s intertextual engagements, and
              an inert and unenterprising reader will have crafted her or his own impoverished
              experience of reception.</note> The opening seven plates preceding this textual
            tutorial representation cultivate unlearning as the necessary preparatory process for
            the awakening of wisdom, with the visionary founder of the Church of the New Jerusalem
            (Swedenborg) reduced to “sitting at the tomb” with “All Bibles or sacred codes” found
            rife with “Errors” and become catalysts of strife, and with the pietistic poet John
            Milton seen in league with the devils’ party (Erdman 34). The master technique of
            inversion becomes the tool to dismantle pre-conceived notions, scraping the
            encrustations of constraint from the core of the self to unleash unrestrained
            creativity, which certainly describes the “Proverbs of Hell” and which provides
            transitional functions for the passage from unlearning and the release of stifled
            creativity that occurs in its wake. Additionally, the opening movement of the work from
            the title plate to the “Proverbs” functions as a structural form of the <title level="m">mise en abyme</title> trope (reflecting subsequent textual organization). </p>
                  <p>Verbal and visual analytics give way to creative impulses and imaginative production,
            and the section of <title level="m">The Marriage</title> from Plate 11 through Plate 24
            manifests this same structural organization (i.e., the interplay of philosophical
            declamation and memorable fancy) four times—perhaps embracing those proverbs with
            fourfold structuration as the schema by which to reassemble what had been dismantled or
            unlearned: <quote>

            field of the proverbs as well, but the fourfold comes forward with consistent insistence
            and, in the mythic works that follow <title level="m">The Marriage,</title> assumes its
            structural function as a strategy of containment through which to explore the

                  <p>Turning directly to the actual configuration or organization of figuration of the
            half-page design (Blake, Vol. 3, Plate 10), the center of the visual field is occupied
            by the devil with a scroll draped across his lap, although I believe the figures in this
            group actually lack sufficient specificity to make clear-cut assignations of gender and
            should remain undetermined (which widens the pedagogical impact of the design).<note place="foot" resp="editors">This argumentative line is informed by Magnus Ankarsjö:
              “Thus, it is my contention that Blake can be no misogynist, since he embraces a
              humanitarian utopian position which eliminates or, rather, transcends,
                <emph>all</emph> corrupt sexuality in a future utopia, male as well as female”
              (37).</note> The devil leans to his right/our left and, with pointed finger and
            extended body, dictates to the I-persona, capable of identification as such through his
            capacity as recorder and textual editor who “collected some of their Proverbs” and
            observed the corrosive compositional activities of the “mighty Devil” (Erdman 35). Under
            these hermeneutic conditions, the figure on the right side of the design can only be an
            (ideal/idealized) reader, and this reading is reinforced by following the direction of
            this figure’s gaze. S/he resides on the heavenly side of the plate and looks
            horizontally through the devil’s wings towards the hellish side of the plate, with the
            spatial distribution replicating the geographic orientation established on the title
            plate—although this visual association, not surprisingly (given the theme of the work)
            periodically vacillates to create shifting emphases for variable ends. The figure does
            not read the scroll (as Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi suggest) but seeks identification
            with the I-persona as momentary <title level="m">imago</title> that can function as the
            vehicle of transportation, with the narrative (verbal) operations of the work here
            unveiled within the dimension of (visual) design as technique for transformation. The
            design images a phenomenological act of participatory reading that when combined with
            the literally mirrored body of the text establishes a textual gaze that seeks to convert
            its intensity “into an energy finer than intellect” (Hartman 48) to cultivate in its
            receptive wake the awakening of a phenomenological reader.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a related account of the phenomenology of reading, see Maurice
              Mearleau-Ponty’s <title level="m">Phenomenology of Perception</title>
            (226).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Generally, in <title level="m">The Marriage</title> the bridge across the abyss (an
            aspect of the literal translation of <title level="m">mise en abyme</title>) between
            reader and text is mediated through the I-persona, who only appears in memorable fancies
            (dining with prophets and wrestling with angels), who vacillates between active and
            passive modes of apprehension (engagement versus observation), and who, through
            reception dynamics, takes up temporary residence in consciousness as an imaginative
            agent conceived to work (refinement of organs of perception within the meta-textual zone
            of pedagogical engagement). This narrative method unfolds in interiority and is unveiled
            via the reading experience—crafting a revolutionary mode of printing indeed through the
            process—but in a sense different than its literal tracks left in the verbal field. The
            method translates interior psychic experience into dialectically disposed modes of
            symbolic communication (the verbal and visual) and transfers that experience into a
            material body (the copper plate), courting in its construction and operations
            countertransference during the act of reading.</p>
                  <p>The problem, however, arrayed in advance of such a method, which seeks to utilize
            instructional instrumentation grounded in the text for transformational outcomes located
            in the reader, remains the seemingly logical (but actually mistaken) assumption made by
            Wolfgang Iser that “a text cannot adapt itself to each reader it comes into contact
            with” (109). However, the temporary yet atemporal identification through a first-person
            narrator is a functional neurocognitive element of perception and reception, which would
            vary by degree but remain present in all acts of reading. Blake’s use of the I-persona
            in this early work creates an activated textual field designed to exploit the
            neurocognitive dimensions of narratological engagement. Given the reflective dynamics of
            textual operation manifest in its dialogical tendencies (angels and devils, prolific and
            devourer) and deployed across numerous dialectical dimensions (verbal and visual, poetic
            and prosaic), the work has maximized its opportunities for conversionary ends, which
            then gains the final impetus to liberate readers by unveiling visually what it exploits
            verbally. Analyzing the images brings one to an act of “anti-self-consciousness”
            experienced as the recognition of the presence of the <title level="m">imago</title> as
            vehicle of transport. The re/cognition of this realization reveals one’s position in an
            extremely potent pedagogical zone of engagement registered within the meta-textual, as
            Georges Poulet noted long ago: <quote>Whenever I read, I mentally pronounce an <title level="m">I</title>, and yet the <title level="m">I</title> which I pronounce is not
              myself . . . Reading, then, is the act in which the subjective principle which I call
                <title level="m">I</title>, is modified in such a way that I no longer have the
              right, strictly speaking, to consider it as my <title level="m">I</title>. I am on
              loan to another, and this other thinks, feels, suffers, and acts within me.
              (44-45)</quote> Being on loan to another is to have a self-conscious encounter with
            alterity, and dual lives registered in singular consciousness establish relations
            generative of compassion, empathy, and sympathy—the foundation for Adam Smith’s theory
            of moral sentiments: “Pity and compassion are words appropriated to signify our
            fellow-feeling with the sorrow of others. Sympathy, though its meaning was, perhaps,
            originally the same, may now, however, without much impropriety, be made use of to
            denote our fellow-feeling with any passion whatever” (13). </p>

                  <head>Reflective Mechanics in Mirrored Textuality </head>
                  <p> In the view of some psychoanalytic critics, this fusion of reception dynamics and
            psychoanalytic techniques in textual operations brings <title level="m">natural</title>
            into mutual illumination, since—as noted earlier—“reader-response criticism is, in the
            world of literary criticism, the most practical embodiment of the basic psychoanalytic
            insight that all knowledge is personal knowledge” (Holland 58). The mirrored text
            provides <title level="m">structure</title>; turbulent dynamics <title level="m">function</title> to intermingle the energies brought into play by writer and reader
            in creative interchange at the event-horizon of the textual event, and the screen of
            textuality, at the very level of form, pursues transformative reception dynamics in an
            attempt to create a communitarian model capable of addressing all readers without
            tyrannizing any of them. Thus, complementary textual alliances (between word and design,
            form and function, reception and inception, projection and introjection, etc.) shape the
            final state of Blake’s illuminated printing method, and this allegiance creates an
            opportunity to intervene on both sides of the <title level="m">event</title> (in
            Badiou’s sense of the term) by constructing a screen upon which projections from either
            pole of textuality are cast and on which those projections counter-impose and
              interact.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The language offered for Blake’s textual
              operations in the act of reception is something like Jacques Lacan’s diagram of
              interaction between the “gaze” and “the subject of representation” through an image
              projected onto a “screen” (<title level="m">Four Fundamental Concepts </title>106).
            </note> The resultant intermingling at the incipient point of contact depends upon “the
            ontological inseparability or entanglement of the object and the agencies of
            observation” that occur on the event-horizon termed “reading,” at least in its diabolic
            or internal sense (Barad 309). </p>
                  <p> The textual crescendo of these imaginative impulses occurs in <title level="m">Jerusalem</title> (Blake, Vol. 1, Plate 41): a critical judgment made relative to its
            didactically yet pithily expressed antidote, casting the spectre into the lake of mind
            from which the <title level="m">imago</title> emerged, for the dis/ease of the selfhood
            (which becomes the first step along an imaginary path of countertransference capable of
            ending the delusive dominion of the spectre). However, the <title level="m">denouement</title> of the mirrored method occurs much later (Blake, Vol. 1, Plate
            81): the immediate context for the illustration on this plate is Gwendolen’s elaboration
            (to her fellow eleven daughters of Albion) of a discourse on demented love expressive of
            a desire for dominion (“For Men are caught by Love: Woman is caught by Pride / That Love
            may only be obtained in the passages of Death”) (Erdman 238). As Minna Doskow suggests,
            Gwendolen “uses false affection to dominate man” and notes the degree to which this
            discourse connects to similar ideological assertions of authority by Vala and Enitharmon
            (145). However, the image is demonstrative of a peculiar Blakean tendency of registering
            irony within the visual field—with Gwendolen’s “affective error . . . appear[ing] in
            mirror writing [within] the looking-glass” of the mirrored text at the culmination of
            its pedagogical mission (Doskow 145, 146). </p>
                  <p>Even as she urges her sisters to greater mechanism of control, pointing to the mirrored
            writing as support for her promulgation of “self interest &amp; selfish natural virtue”
            (Erdman 237), she has nonetheless consciously evoked and embraced the principle capable
            of creating transformations in the realm of the real (i.e., forgiveness). Her hope to
            use it as a mechanism of control finally fails, since the seeds of selfless forms of
            love are actually planted in the fertile ground of imagination by and through the
            unconscious and blossom across the last plates of the work. Dramatic irony is defined as
            the audience (outscape) knowing what the participants in the drama (inscape) know not,
            and only the reader can break through the vegetative glass that captures the gaze in its
            own to uncover, via textual techniques “using and combining textual strategies like a
            consummate deconstructionist,” a window onto eternity beyond its panes (Hilton 100). </p>
                  <p> The argument for the illuminated book as pedagogical tool designed to act upon its
            readers and therein stimulate passivity into activity as the necessary receptive
            reaction to the mirrored dynamics embedded at its foundation rests upon the knowledge
            that “no writer has ever controlled so much of the process himself, nor has any writer
            been so self-conscious about the process of making books” (Jones 25). Such imaginative
            and productive textual practices, which provide access to plateaus of the dialogic,
            require more research, since “the role of dialogue, in Blake’s poetic universe and in
            his relationship with the reader, warrants special attention” (Esterhammer 82). For
            example, my analysis has only touched upon the broader play of <title level="m">mise en
              abyme</title> across illustrative and narrative planes of the Blakean textual universe
            in all its manifestations—such as the mirroring of several plates of <title level="m">Milton</title>, where the inversely mirrored postures of the full-plate designs are
            echoed in advance in a small interlinear flourish (Blake, Vol. 5, Plate 14). And this
            design, when read left to right, displays features equally present two plates earlier
            (Blake, Vol. 5, Plate 12). This overt play <title level="m">in the abyss</title> through
            the agency of textual mirrors will require additional labor to position criticism in the
            places where textuality and pedagogy converge—with the <emph>jouissance</emph>
            attainable within the fields of force flowing from this event-horizon in which readers
            participate in its affective stylistics. </p>

               <p rend="noCount">This article explores what Blakean pedagogy can be through an examination
          of the United Kingdom’s Blake Society, a non-academic organization. The Blake Society
          works to promote greater recognition of William Blake’s life and activities but eschews
          the goals of scholarly knowledge production that often accompany academic Blake
          activities. Through an exploration of the Blake Society’s pedagogy, this article asks what
          resources and authority are necessary to do things with Blake.</p>

               <p>Autumn, 1999: I am an undergraduate at Seattle Pacific University sitting in an 8:00 a.m.
          course—a survey of British literature from 1700 to the present day. I have a Norton
          anthology balanced on the tiny desk platform, and the book is open to the section of poems
          by William Blake. The professor is a Victorianist, but today she has invited one of her
          colleagues specializing in Blake to give a guest lecture. The poems included in the Norton
          are culled from the <title level="m">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</title> (1794),
          and include “The Tyger” and “Introduction.” I do not remember the exact content of the
          guest lecturer’s points. What I remember is feeling quietly nonplussed at the apparent
          simplicity of Blake’s poems. The guest lecturer seems to see them as entry points into
          something rich and vast. I’m not sure how—though I am fiercely determined to be a good
          student—to put all of my energies into studying literature, and so I am certain that he is
          right. I just need to work harder to understand. But when the class meets again two days
          later, we have moved on to William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, as the survey
          dictates, and I am pouring myself into their work and feeling happier because it seems
          like there is more to analyze and more with which to do things. I know that I want to go
          to graduate school in English and become a professor like the professors who have taught
          me. I am good at close reading and at being very, very determined in my work. I want
          desperately to be part of a community that matches my enthusiasms, and the English
          Department and then graduate school seem like my best shot. </p>
               <p>January, 2000: I am starting a senior capstone course on Blake, which was not my plan. My
          plan was to take a senior capstone course on Jane Austen as part of the university’s
          “European Quarter” study-abroad program in the spring. However, that burning determination
          to put all of my energies into my studies has been so successful that I have come down
          with mono. European Quarter no longer feels like an option, and the Blake capstone course
          is the only way of meeting my graduation requirements. I’m sort of okay with this, I
          think, because I’m not actually all that fond of Austen. The professor of the Blake
          capstone is the same guest lecturer from the previous year. Blake doesn’t particularly
          capture my interest but, really, how difficult can it be? </p>
               <p>February, 2000: I am miserable. I don’t understand what to do with Blake, I have no idea
          how I will write the final essay for this course, and I don’t understand what is so wrong
          with me that I cannot produce close readings that go anywhere. I read Northrop Frye’s
            <title level="m">Fearful Symmetry</title> (1947)—or I try to read it at least. I don’t
          feel like I retain anything from Frye’s book or from Kathleen Raine’s or Hazard Adams’s
          respective books either. I feel like a failure, and this results in my sobbing at the
          professor during his office hours—multiple times. My professor is sympathetic and
          encourages me to take a nap, to sleep more, to celebrate Lent by eating a chocolate bar
          each day (i.e., to try indulging myself rather than self-deprivation). I see his point,
          though I don’t want a chocolate bar. I am so frustrated that I hardly know what I do
          want.</p>
               <p>Thinking back on that miserable February in hindsight, I realize how much of my anguish
          was about being part of a system that I did not understand. I knew, of course, the basic
          components: students, professors, assignments, grades, courses, and degrees. I had
          embraced the system and was within it by my own choice, but I did not understand the
          larger scope beyond those components. What was happening to the frantic energy that I was
          generating? How did the activities of my coursework and of my university fit into the
          larger world?</p>
               <p>Fifteen years and a Ph.D. later—and in my eleventh year of teaching—I still encounter
          students who have found themselves in a mental space much like the one I found myself in
          with my Blake capstone course: striving to make progress and feeling trapped by the
          conventions of the classroom—assignments, deadlines, grades. Often, I can help them, and I
          also ask questions that allow them to help themselves. I can assure them honestly that the
          particular misery that they’re feeling while studying Blake’s work is not in any way a
          sign of ignorance or intellectual inadequacy. I try to show the same gentleness and
          compassion that I was shown as a student. However, the situation isn’t a simple question
          of compassionate pedagogy. My students’ anguish is an example of “mind-forg’d manacles”
          (Erdman 27) and is directly connected with the institutional practices of academia.
          Whatever understanding and compassion I offer might soothe, but it won’t unlock the
          constraints that they’re facing. Only they can figure out how to direct their own energies
          and the significance of channeling those energies in one direction versus another. The
          problem isn’t that academic endeavors aren’t worth it. Many difficult things are
          worthwhile, despite causing pain and anxiety. The problem is in understanding
            <emph>how</emph> the experience is worthwhile and in the particular context of each
          student’s individual situation. While I reassure my students that, yes, they will get
          through these difficult periods, the occasions make me think about Blake’s harsh words
          about teachers throughout his work.</p>
               <p>Of course, teaching and learning are widespread topics in Blake’s writings. Some
          instruction is beneficial while other instruction is not. Many instructors today would, I
          suspect, agree with the “wisest of the Ancients [who] considerd [sic] what is not too
          Explicit as the fittest for Instruction because it rouzes the faculties to act” (Erdman
            702).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> All parenthetical page citations for William
            Blake quotes refer to David V. Erdman’s edition of <title level="m">The Complete Poetry
              and Prose of William Blake</title> (1988). </note> Clearly, Blake knows that the
          activity of instruction goes on everywhere and in many and varied forms. On the subject of
          teachers—in the sense of a professional occupation—there is less ambiguity. The word he
          uses throughout is “hireling,” and Blake is unambiguously critical (e.g., Erdman 473, 635,
          641, etc.). Hirelings are associated with kings, courts, camps, and universities—equating
          those who teach for money with politicians and soldiers. These hireling instructors are
          accused of propagating an uncultivated life, being lazy and non-industrious, and
          participating in corrupt labor practices that build upon Blake’s own advances without
          giving him proper credit (Erdman 537). Blake’s critique is thus one of institutionalized
          teaching generally, but there are always particular exceptions. Similar critiques of
          educators are still being made today of course, and from an academic perspective, these
          are usually made by people who aren’t fully aware of the academic requirements of teaching
          and scholarly research or the energy demands that the system makes on its members. Still,
          if more education isn’t the answer, then what is involved in <emph>not teaching</emph>
          Blake’s work? </p>
               <p>In this essay, I examine one set of answers to that question and do so by using my
          experiences volunteering as a trustee of the <ref target="http://www.blakesociety.org">Blake Society</ref>, a non-profit charity organization based in London, England. I
          first became aware of the Blake Society in 2007, when I spoke at the “Blake at 250
          Conference” held at the University of York, and I became a member of its Executive
          Committee in 2009. Being part of the Blake Society has given me a new perspective on the
          activity of doing things with Blake’s work—in terms not only of the range of things
          possible but also the labor required and the challenges that appear. I investigate these
          topics because they present interesting contrasts with the ways in which academic scholars
          and instructors often work with Blake. Thus, I seek to explore and discuss some of the
          questions that have occurred and continue to arise for the Blake Society and to relate its
          practices in navigating them. This exploration could address many lines of inquiry of
          course, but for the sake of directness, I investigate in this essay two interrelated
          questions: What resources are necessary to do things with Blake? And where rests the
          authority to do things with Blake? </p>
               <p> The current incarnation of the Blake Society, as its website explains, was begun in 1985
          “on the instigation of Donald Reeves, the then rector of St. James’s Piccadilly,” where
          Blake himself was baptized (“Brief History”). <emph>Instigated</emph> is the operative
          word; what started has since been passed on, and the Blake Society is very much a product
          of its members and leadership. When it began, it was a society constituted by people for
          whom Blake was somewhere between a luminous presence and a lever and fulcrum that could be
          used to change the world. There was no formal registration or declaration of membership
          because bureaucracy seemed hardly Blakean. From the beginning, some members objected to
          the link with St. James’s Piccadilly, given Blake’s critique of organized religion, but
          these objections were not strong enough to overcome the church’s contribution in the form
          of a space to meet, and the church did not make any attempt to exert particular control
          over the group or make it into the William Blake Society of the Church of England. </p>
               <p>The earliest records of the society’s activities have been lost, but according to the
          Blake Society’s current chair, Tim Heath, who became involved with the group in 1987, the
          early meetings were tempestuous, as members sought to develop action from their various
          interpretations of Blake’s works. In 2004, the society adopted a formal constitution in
          order to become a charity and to continue growing with an eye towards raising funds and
          applying for grants and other opportunities open to legal non-profit organizations. This
          decision caused intense conflict: some members objected that becoming a legal society
          would violate the spirit of antinomianism that they saw as central to Blake’s arguments
          while others refused the constitution because they believed that becoming a charity would
          restrict the society’s ability to engage in political activities. Blakeans have long
          memories—even eleven years after the constitution and formal membership rules were
          adopted, some of the original attendees still refuse to join officially but, in the spirit
          of antinomian disruption, appear at annual meetings to insist that they are still members.
          The antinomians have a point, as requiring paid membership in order to identify oneself as
          in society with Blake seems either preposterous or corrupt when considered against the
          measuring stick of critical interpretation and close reading of the poet’s work. These
          objections prompt considerations of the types of resources required in order to do things
          with Blake’s poetry, painting, and printmaking and urge deliberations concerning the
          channeling of the Blake Society’s energy into the larger systems of the world.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For relevant work on the topic of Blake and antinomianism,
            see Jeffrey Kripal’s “Reality against Society: William Blake, Antinomianism, and the
            American Counterculture.” </note>
               </p>
               <p>One vital component to consider in relation to these questions is that of committed
          labor. Since 2004, ten members have been elected each January to serve one-year terms as
          volunteers on the Blake Society’s Executive Committee. At the end of these terms,
          committee members either step down or stand for election again for another year. Committee
          members then begin bimonthly meetings each February in order to plan out the year’s
          program of events. Generally, these events run from April until the following January,
          with one event per month. The timeline for planning is not only tight, because the April
          events always follow quite quickly behind society elections, but also because a full-color
          program featuring high-resolution images (similar to souvenir programs sold at theatrical
          productions) is sent each year to all members, usually by the end of March. </p>
               <p> The events hosted by the Blake Society vary widely, depending on what the Executive
          Committee can imagine and make a reality. In 2007, with the assistance of the British
          Royal Navy, the society recreated the sketching journey that Blake took in 1780 with
          Thomas Stothard. In 2008, the committee was able to arrange a tour of the Stationers’s
          Hall, where Blake was apprenticed, in order to see records relating to his apprenticeship.
          In 2012, voice specialist Jane Boston led a workshop on reading poetry aloud as the start
          of a project to increase coverage of <ref target="https://librivox.org/poems-of-william-blake-by-william-blake/">Blake’s poetry on
            Librivox</ref>, an audiobook crowdsourcing website, and throughout that year, the
          society helped to coordinate new online recordings of many of Blake’s texts.<note place="foot" resp="editors">During the course of that project, the Blake Society was
            contacted by a member in Australia who had access to a series of dramatic readings of
            Blake’s poetry made by an Australian theatre group in the 1960s, and these recordings
            were able to be added to the online resource, thus making them available to audiences
            worldwide after they had been packed away for several decades. </note> Furthermore, many
          monthly events are talks given by people who study Blake or who have found him influential
          on their work or life. While a fair number of these talks are given by working academics
          and would not be out of place in literature or history departments, other talks have
          featured filmmakers and cinematographers, composers, musicians, artists, theologians,
          psychologists, and organizational consultants. The subject matter varies widely: from
          traditional academic research to artistic projects in process; from discussions of Blake’s
          work by contemporary artists and writers to investigations of Blake’s writings in the
          context of John Milton, Emanuel Swedenborg, and Wilfred Owen; and from conversations
          concerning Blake’s responses to organized religion to various religious traditions, such
          as Christianity, Paganism, and Buddhism. </p>
               <p>Other than the approximate length of talks, speakers are given few boundaries, so
          sometimes even our organizers are surprised by the content of a given presentation, as
          when, for example, one speaker discussed his experiences as a spiritual medium in contact
          with William and Catherine Blake from beyond the grave. Who will speak is determined by a
          number of methods. Sometimes one of the committee or society members knows someone who
          would be appropriate (meaning that they have been in contact with an individual who has an
          interest in Blake, a willingness to speak, and something to speak about). Other times,
          potential speakers contact the Blake Society to offer their availability as they are
          passing through London. Speakers in the recent past have included leading Blake scholars
          and well-known public figures including Anne Mellor, Morton Paley, Philip Pullman,
          Kathleen Raine, Patti Smith, and Rowan Williams. The Executive Committee has also made a
          point of inviting talks from junior and independent scholars whose work often goes in new
          directions and might otherwise be less visible.</p>
               <p> Much of what we do might be summarized as making a <emph>space</emph> for William Blake.
          But what sort of a space are we attempting to make? The Blake Society Constitution lists
          our purpose as “educat[ing] the public regarding knowledge, understanding and appreciation
          of the work of William Blake (1757-1827), artist and poet, and his life and times and his
          influences on and relationships with others and to encourage studies relating thereto”
          (“Blake Society Constitution”). This is a fine but rather generic goal—precisely the sort
          of thing one puts into bureaucratic documents. More illustrative is the self-description
          of the society provided on the homepage of our website: <quote> The Blake Society honours
            and celebrates William Blake (1757-1827), engraver, poet, painter &amp; prophet. […] We
            bring together scholars and enthusiasts, amateurs and professionals on equal terms . . .
            We look for opportunities to continue the work that Blake began: exploring new modes of
            expression, and awakening the artist and prophet in each individual. (“The Society”)
          </quote> Educating is a familiar activity—something that people instinctively recognize
          when they see it. Honoring and celebrating leave more room for experimentation. The
          society’s ethos is thus significantly influenced by Blake’s proverb from <title level="m">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</title> (1790): “The most sublime act is to set another
          before you” (Erdman 36). Today, Blake’s work is widely available in print and online
          editions as well as in an infinite progression of excerpted forms—some apt, commercial,
          eccentric, and even inaccurate. Of course, there are scholarly books and essays of
          critical commentary as well. To complement those forms, the Blake Society works to create
          a physical and temporal space in order to listen, discuss, and create, and the society
          does so while placing as few limits as possible on what results, if any, are the outcome
          of these conversations concerning Blake’s poetry and art. As an example, Adriana
          Diaz-Enciso, a member of the Executive Committee, developed in 2013 an idea to have
          children read Blake’s poem “The Tyger” to actual living tigers. Taking the project from
          idea to reality took nearly two years of planning and negotiation, but the final event
          took place in October 2014 in collaboration with the London Zoo and Kids Company, a UK
          charity that works with at-risk and impoverished children in London, Bristol, and
          Liverpool. Diaz-Enciso’s vision is an example of what the Blake Society’s Executive
          Committee aspires to accomplish when it seeks to interpret Blake’s work as broadly as
          possible. We believe that setting men and women before us takes a concerted effort. We
          also believe that it is worthwhile to exert that same energy with tigers.</p>
               <p>There are obviously significant differences in our practice from the way that Blake is
          handled in academic settings. We are working towards greater recognition of Blake, but we
          do not have a specific argument or narrative about Blake that we are trying to advance and
          offer no metric of achievement or credential after a given event. Our audience has no time
          commitment, and our events do not build on each other, meaning that missing an event has
          no bearing on the comprehension of future events. As much as possible, we have worked to
          become something more like a <emph>trading zone</emph> for Blake, where multiple parties
          (i.e., publics) meet and where activities are driven by member or executive committee
          interests, current events, or simply opportunities that become possible.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Relevant here is Peter Galison’s concept of the “trading zone” as a
            space where multiple groups “can agree on rules of exchange even if they ascribe utterly
            different significance to the objects being exchanged” (“Trading Zone” 138). Even if the
            parties involved disagree on the significance of the exchange process, the trading zone
            supports “<emph>local</emph> coordination despite vast <emph>global </emph>differences”
            (“Trading Zone” 138). Galison began working with the idea of trading zones as a way of
            parsing the interactions and intersections between experimentalists and theorists in
            scientific fields, and he did so to show that while they might share a discipline, their
            conclusions were “<emph>not</emph> grounded on the same standards and forms of
            argumentation” (“Trading with the Enemy” 26). The Blake Society agrees to work to create
            a space for the appreciation of Blake, academics agree to be participants in that space,
            and we all agree that Blake is important enough to devote our energies to thinking about
            him. Beyond that point, our perspectives diverge significantly. The priorities within
            academic study of Blake often include historical accuracy and discovery, the
            preservation of the disciplines of literature, history, etc., as well as the professions
            associated with academia. The Blake Society’s priorities also include accuracy, yet the
            priority of simply surviving as an organization is nearly as important and is often a
            far more urgent concern. </note>
               </p>
               <p>Currently, our official membership numbers at about 300 people who pay either £25 or £15
          (students and unwaged) annually. While our members are from all over the world, most of
          our events are held in London. The local UK event audience has a wide age range (from
          people in their twenties to their eighties) and a diverse set of interests in Blake. While
          the society is cautious about overusing the question “What would Blake do?,” we do feel
          strongly that our events ought to be accessible to people working and earning very little
          money (as Blake did), and so we rarely hold events that charge any admission fees.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Though we have maintained this principle so far, we are
            also aware of the issue of asking our speakers to donate their time and energy without
            any sort of honorarium, and based on discussions at recent Executive Committee meetings,
            it seems likely that a small event charge for non-members will be instituted in the near
            future.</note> Our income is small, and it goes towards hiring spaces for special
          events, costs for printing and mailing full-color programs featuring Blake’s art, and to
          our annual Tithe Grant competition. Rather than striving to acquire more funds, our ethos
          of working with money has become one of demonstrating how much can be done with as little
          funding as possible.</p>
               <p>The Blake Society is also careful about the measuring stick employed in interpretations
          of Blake’s work because there are so very many different Blakes present in our
          membership’s views: scholarly, obscure, occult, ultra-conservative, etc. The society seeks
          to be as inclusive as possible—partly in deliberate contrast to the exclusivity of
          academia, but also because the group was not founded with the purpose of researching or
          proving the veracity of one version of Blake over another. Our programs are full of
          arguments, but there is no goal of combining all those arguments into a book, for example,
          or making them compete in order to winnow out the “best” interpretation. Additionally,
          while our audiences are full of contrasting views (and not shy about voicing them), they
          tend to be more united and in agreement about rejecting “Corporeal Understanding” (i.e.,
          “Reason” or “Ratiocination” to use the terms that are popular at events) in favor of
            <title level="m">mental fight</title>, and this results in a tendency to be fairly
          skeptical or suspicious of new media and digital tools (rather than to embrace them).
          However, the concerns expressed often involve the social injustices associated with
          technology, the pressures exerted on users of technology to conform to social and other
          customs, and a general unwillingness to be dependent on technology (or, in other words, a
          rejection of the idea that technology is in any way necessary for Blakean vision and
          action). </p>
               <p>Technology isn’t a particular <foreign>bête noire</foreign> of the Blake Society though.
          The problem would be if the society were to suggest that there
          were <emph>any </emph>dominant methods for achieving vision or even that “vision” was
          something that all our members ought to be trying to achieve. Those arguments would put us
          squarely into more academic or outcome-based territories. There are so many
          skill-acquisition programs already in existence that it seems hard to argue that another
          one is needed. Furthermore, even if the Blake Society wanted to introduce such a program,
          it is difficult to imagine such an endeavor being successful, simply because it would
          require more labor and time than such a voluntary executive body is typically able to give
          without risking burnout or event failure. And because, as a literary society, we offer no
          credentials and are under little pressure of accreditation, it is easier for us simply to
          decide not to do things when they seem unmanageable. The exception to this is that for
          certain activities, we must match the general conception of what various people or
          organizations expect a literary society to “look like” or “to do.” For example, the
          majority of our events are sponsored by the Waterstones bookshop in Piccadilly, which
          provides both meeting space and refreshments, and it is easy to imagine how Waterstones’s
          support might be complicated or controversial if, for instance, the Blake Society’s
          meetings were more overtly political or activist. </p>
               <p>As a professional academic, I regularly encounter the question of whether something is
          academic or non-academic, intellectual or anti-intellectual, but as a member of the Blake
          Society, the question never comes up, and if it did, I would probably sidestep it or ask
          why it needed an answer. Must we inscribe the bounds of our activities into a particular
          circle? However, I cannot deny that the Blake Society is responsive to academia and
          academic systems in certain ways. A primary effect of academia is to elevate intellectual
          merit through credentials, publications, and awards and to position individuals as
          teachers or learners. The teachers teach, but what the learners do—or what they are meant
          to do once they have their credential(s)—is not always clear. Grades have become an
          intrinsic part of the academic system, and the grades stick—and for some, leave deep
          impressions. Rectifying the consequences of educational scar tissue, however it was
          acquired, is incredibly difficult because the wounds are particular rather than general.
          As I completed my doctorate and learned to teach, I was aware of innovative pedagogical
          practices being developed to respond better to students’ changing needs, and I am also
          aware that there have always been pedagogical innovators focusing specifically on
          teaching—thinking actively about new possibilities and ways to combat the occasional
          tendencies of institutional education to grind individuals into uniformity. However, the
          improvements and intentions of recent educators cannot fully cancel out the alienation
          that might have occurred previously. And the Blake Society does not have the recourse of
          explaining to people that if they would only read more about pedagogy and current
          educational practices, they would understand that what we were doing was to their benefit. </p>
               <p>The fact that we are no school for Blake, however, does not mean that we have no
          pedagogy. As a poet and artist, Blake is so challenging that it feels impossible to do
            <emph>anything</emph> with him without having some form of pedagogical goal. If I had to
          sum up the Executive Committee’s pedagogy concerning Blake’s work, I would explain that we
          seek to make a Blake-centric community that is not contingent upon members exhibiting any
          particular set of learning behaviors. If one necessary resource for doing things with
          Blake is the labor and energy of the Executive Committee, then another component is
            <emph>need</emph>. Some people write to the Blake Society because they need help with
          school projects. Others write to inquire about whether a book signed “William Blake” that
          they’ve found in their attic might belong to <emph>the </emph>William Blake. In another
          example, a scholar from an Eastern European country wrote in 2009 to ask whether we could
          provide a grant for travel to London for the purposes of researching Blake’s work.
          Initially, this caused moderate conflict and debate among Executive Committee members
          because of a split on whether it was possible simply to give this scholar the funds as an
          act of radical generosity or whether doing so would cause legal problems or alienate other
          members who didn’t know that they could simply ask for funding (thus potentially
          inundating us with similar requests). </p>
               <p>The Tithe Grant emerged out of that conversation as a commitment to give back 10% of our
          income to an individual “carrying on Blake’s work and art,” an open category that the
          Executive Committee settled on because it was inclusive of multiple sorts of activities.
          We considered organizing the grant to be focused specifically on academic research, given
          the original request for funding, but in the end we rejected such a narrow category
          because other funding sources were available and because the amount we had available to
          give (then, around £300) would be insufficient to offer substantial assistance to
          researchers outside of the UK (our research indicated that such individuals had fewer
          opportunities when compared with researchers within the UK). We were all in agreement
          that, if at all possible, we wanted the Tithe Grant to be a “competition” that did not
          simply replicate existing funding struggles. Specifically, we sought to determine whether
          there was a particular method of designing an application so that people like Blake (i.e.,
          autodidacts, those not from wealthy backgrounds, individuals possibly but not necessarily
          embedded in formal training programs, etc.) could locate funding for their work. </p>
               <p>The downside of developing an original and uniquely Blakean competition, of course, is
          that one must figure out all the minute particulars, and each year of running the Tithe
          Grant has indeed proven to be a learning experience. The first year, we stuck to our
          commitment not to pre-define what form “carrying on Blake’s work and art” would take and
          chose to publicize the grant chiefly to our members, but we received no applications by
          the set deadline. The second year, we again defined no set form of “carrying on Blake’s
          work and art” but marketed the competition more widely through various newsletters and
          websites listing grant competitions, and we received 16 entries—including a lecture
          series, an exhibition based on an MA thesis, as well as photography, painting,
          translation, and theatrical projects. What we learned that year was that it is difficult
          to weigh the merits of very different projects in different forms. Since then, we have
          focused each year’s Tithe Grant on a particular area: musical composition, photography,
          and—most recently—on writing aphorisms on Twitter. What happens with the competition
          sometimes challenges our own assumptions about doing things with Blake, as when we invited
          photographs interpreting Blake’s poem “The Tyger” in 2013. We hoped for startling
          juxtapositions of Blake’s ideas with contemporary images, but a substantial number of the
          entries were photographs that, while magnificent, were indistinguishable from photos that
          might appear in issues of <title level="j">National Geographic</title>. We are still
          determining what a Blakean “competition” looks like as we reiterate the Tithe Grant each
          year, but we have been pleased at how it has changed over time. In 2011, the winners were
          a poet and an actress, both in their twenties, while last year’s aphorism competition,
          judged by Stephen Fry, was won by a woman in her eighties. The winners thus far have
          hailed from England, Australia, and America, and since 2011, we have gone from receiving
          16 to over 700 entries. </p>
               <p>Indeed, from “Tyger[s]” to tigers and Twitter, many things are possible with Blake. But
          in the last year, we have been engaged in a much more difficult project: in September
          2015, the Blake Cottage Trust (a small group which had emerged from the larger Blake
            Society)<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The Blake Cottage Trust is a legally separate
            entity from the Blake Society, but the campaign to raise funds for the cottage was run
            by the Blake Society while the Blake Cottage Trust was still being constituted (due to
            the time-sensitive nature of the project).</note> succeeded in purchasing the cottage at
          Felpham in Sussex, England where Blake had lived between 1800 and 1803. The cottage is a
          significant part of Blake’s history for several reasons, and acquiring the cottage was a
          momentous occasion: of the nine homes that Blake lived in during his lifetime, only two of
          the original buildings survive. One is 17 South Molton Street, now an upscale shopping
          avenue near Oxford Street in London. The other is the thatch-roofed cottage at Felpham, on
          the southeast coast of England, where Blake worked on <title level="m">Milton</title>
          (comp. ca. 1804-1811), wrote the lyrics to the hymn “Jerusalem,” and where he was arrested
          for sedition after ejecting a soldier from his yard. Though the building has been added
          onto, the original architectural structure of the cottage still survives intact. The
          cottage’s previous owner, Heather Howell, often generously entertained Blake scholars for
          teatime visits and occasionally allowed individuals to spend a night in what was most
          likely Blake’s bedroom. The question of what would become of the house was always
          uncertain. While Howell was interested in Blake and cordial to the Blake Society, her
          grown children were less so, and as a result there was really no chance of the cottage
          being simply willed into a public property, for example. </p>
               <p>From Heath’s perspective, as Blake Society Chair, finding a way to acquire the cottage
          was important for multiple reasons: as a heritage site and a physical artifact of Blake’s
          life that supplements his surviving books and prints; as a space that could be used for a
          wider variety of events than are currently possible through our relationships with St.
          James’s Piccadilly and Waterstones Books; and to embody Blake’s question: “Where shall we
          take our stand to view the infinite &amp; unbounded” (Erdman 391). Though the South Molton
          Street residence is in central London, and thus more accessible, its proximity to the
          trendy upmarket shops around Oxford Street establish its estimated value somewhere over
          £10,000,000. In contrast, the Felpham residence was bought for £495,000. Even so, raising
          this sum initially seemed like an impossible task for a literary society whose annual
          budget in recent years has been less than £5,000. Those of us involved in the process of
          raising funds thus count the purchase as a major accomplishment, but an accomplishment
          that we were far from confident would ever happen. Almost certainly, part of the challenge
          involved assumptions and questions about the purpose of the house. Many people assumed
          that the cottage was to become something like the “William Blake Museum” or perhaps a
          specialized lecture hall or retreat for writers. In other words, it was difficult for
          individuals to imagine what the society might do with the house (or with Blake himself as
          a cultural figure) if our purposes were not to be academic in nature. Such thinking
          suggests that although Morris Eaves expressed concern in 1995 about the “white noise” of
          Blake-related activity diluting the “original message” of Blake’s art and writing (414),
          the actual problem that friends of Blake face is that of limited vision in which Blake is
          too closely associated with school and learning—so limited that it is difficult or
          impossible to imagine a Blakean activity that is <emph>not </emph>obviously academic in
            nature.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The Blake Society’s activities could be
            classified as what Roger Whitson and Jason Whittaker have explored in their discussion
            of the “‘Blake brand’, . . . a particular type of visionary poetics and art that . . .
            may sometimes be closer to Blake’s original activities as an enterprising freelance on
            the fringes of the London art scene than the weighty, canonical interpretations that
            have been overlaid on him since” (120). See Whitson and Whittaker’s <title level="m">William Blake and the Digital Humanities: Collaboration, Participation, and Social
              Media </title>(2013). </note>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, there are a number of reasons that could be offered for why we struggled to raise
          the money for the cottage or for areas of the campaign that could have been run
          differently. I would argue, though, that our difficulties were related to the question of
          what the Blake Society does and how it does what it does—in other words, how we exert our
          energy in order to fit into larger systems. It’s a question of authority—where it comes
          from and on what basis it is recognized. Perhaps the authority to do things with Blake
          comes from the Blake Society’s legal and nominal status as a public organization. Beyond
          that status, however, we are a bit eccentric. One needs only to look at Michael Warner’s
          description of the relationships between private/public and interested/disinterested to
          begin to understand why. Warner writes that <quote>as private persons came to be seen as
            driven by self-interest, the public came to be defined as disinterested. Those aspects
            of people’s lives that particularize their interests came to be seen as inappropriate to
            public discussion. To be properly public required that one rise above, or set aside,
            one’s private interests and expressive nature. (40)</quote> In contrast, the Blake
          Society is specifically about those “aspects of people’s lives that particularize their
          interests,” and if our goal is not directly to make them into objects of public discussion
          (except when individuals specifically choose to do so), it is certainly to make the
          cultivation of those personal interests into a subject that is worthy of public dialogue
          and energy. We are, then, closer to Warner’s idea of a “counterpublic,” a space “defined
          by [its] tension with a larger public” and “enabl[ing] a horizon of opinion and exchange”
          (Warner 56), or as a Foucauldian heterotopic space, one that might juxtapose “in a single
          real place several spaces, several sites that are themselves incompatible” (Foucault 25).
          The possibility of such spaces existing is certainly recognized in academic discourse.
          Actually creating such a space, especially one that straddles the border between academic
          and non-academic activities and which tries to circumvent hallmarks of institutional
          learning in order to subvert expectations of public disinterestedness, is more difficult
          to achieve. Producing such a space—doing something with Blake—takes more than labor and
          energy: it requires capital. For an organization like the Blake Society, the challenge is
          finding a way of converting labor and energy into capital and in conjunction with the
          existing systems that surround us. </p>
               <p>In <title level="m">The Economy of Prestige</title> (2005), James F. English notes that
          “cultural practice itself has . . . become ever more dependent on institutions of cultural
          competition and award. The <emph>work</emph> of culture, especially the work of producing
          cultural value, has increasingly been accomplished through these institutions” (256).
          English’s statement confirms the focus on isolating merit and overemphasizing credentials.
          In that process, cultural value becomes strongly linked with institutional forms (e.g.,
          books, essays, courses, etc.) that become the trappings of cultural value. And in
          competitions and awards, it’s usually the output—rather than the process—that matters
            most.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> If James F. English is correct, then a
            conventional view might be that the Blake Society produces little or no cultural value
            simply by focusing on creating a space for Blake. Does the Blake Society count as the
            sort of cultural value-producing institution to which English refers? Academia is such
            an institution (recognizable in most parts of the world) with a mass of institutions of
            various sizes within it. Some of these institutions are so familiar and dominant that
            they set many of the standards by which others are measured. Other institutions are less
            accomplished but draw their own legitimacy from a combination of their own efforts and
            from sharing institutional designations (e.g., college, university, etc.). Academia
            often propagates cultural values and rules by following them itself. Underneath those
            rules and designations, however, academic institutions are people—instructors (permanent
            and adjunct), administrators, staff, and students. For better or worse, their individual
            efforts are often subsumed within the collective of the institution. Activities that
            fall within the expected scope of the institution often pass with little or no
            attention, while those that are unexpected draw attention and are found to be either
            outstanding innovations or errors. For an institution to change and become something
            else or something new thus often takes substantial work.</note> The problem is that when
          the “work of culture” becomes closely linked with outputs and finished products, it
          contributes to the devaluing and normalization of a great deal of labor. Academic work
          becomes invisible, resulting in the perception of academics as ignorant hirelings. This
          process affects the authority available to organizations like the Blake Society and, at
          the same time, negatively impacts professional academics. I don’t invoke these challenges
          in closing here in order to make excuses for the Blake Society and what it has or hasn’t
          accomplished. I invoke them because they affect the most basic terms and environments in
          which the Blake Society must continue to intervene. </p>
