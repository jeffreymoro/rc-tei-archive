                <p rend="noCount">Cumbersome terminology aside, this essay demonstrates the use and
                    interest of teaching the debated concept of lyric ontology in the Romantic
                    Poetry classroom across undergraduate and graduate levels. It moves from a
                    narrative introduction on Robert Frost's very material practice of "lyric
                    overhearing" on his Derry, New Hampshire party-phone line, to extended
                    consideration of the recent scholarly turn to historical poetics in the study of
                    nineteenth century British and American Poetry. I discuss Virginia Jackson's
                    influential and compelling anti-lyric anti-theory——Jackson's version of the
                    resistance to theory——as it presents a teachable conflict with the Romantic
                    "literary absolute." The essay ends by reconsidering the metonymic linkage
                    between the position of Romanticism and the position of poetry/ literature/ the
                    Humanities in the institution of the contemporary university, and with brief
                    suggestions for lesson plan ideas and student readings. (Post-production note:
                    contemporary American poet Ben Lerner's <emph>The Hatred of Poetry</emph>
                    [Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2016] makes for a timely addition to the essay's
                    bibliographic suggestions and also may impart something like a critical mass to
                    the essay's approach to teaching in the rift between poetic ontology and
                    historical poetics.)</p>

                    <p>On a recent car trip to the Boston area for an academic conference, I stopped
                        off at the Robert Frost Farm in Derry, New Hampshire, a visit I had been
                        meaning to make for a long time, since moving to Frost’s “other” New England
                        home state of Vermont. At one point early in the tour, our small group was
                        standing in the kitchen of the home, in which Frost and his young family had
                        lived from 1900-1911. We saw the striking red wallpaper (which Rob
                        “romantically” thought perfect for Christmas, our tour guide said); the
                        handsome large stove worth a local shoe factory worker’s year’s pay; the
                        soapstone farmhouse sink that had been improbably salvaged from the back
                        pasture after it was converted to the “Frosty Acres” automobile junkyard in
                        the 1950s and ’60s, and only authenticated because Elinor Frost’s knives had
                        been sharpened on the front apron; and then we were directed toward the far
                        wall with a telephone. Though the chronology suggests a time too early for a
                        phone in regular domestic use, our guide informed the group that Frost’s
                        daughter Lesley, as a consultant to the heritage site, had told a story
                        about the poet that dictated there should be one. The phone was part of his
                        vocation. Robert Frost apparently often listened in secretly to the
                        telephone conversations of neighbors on the party line around Derry. When
                        exhorted by his wife or daughter to stop eavesdropping, he is claimed to
                        have replied: “Don’t bother me, I’m working.”<note place="foot"
                            resp="editors">In standard accounts, Frost learns colloquial inflection
                            especially from his neighbor Napoleon Guay and the poultryman John Hall;
                            See Thompson, <emph>Robert Frost: The Early Years</emph> 284; Sanders,

                    <p> The joke (if that is what this is) resonates because it captures a lot of
                        Frost’s character and several of the recurrent ingredients of his famous
                        persona. On the private side one might include his position as the ultimate
                        insider-outsider in the New England community and his role as an
                        often-severe patriarchal family head. On the better-known and beloved public
                        side are his georgic conflation of languid ease and hard “work”; his magical
                        “folksy” touch with the quick reply; and not least, his devilish initiative
                        as an artist-tactician. If Frost’s poetry invites the reader in via its
                        surface of familiarity and offerings of countrified wisdom, only to toy with
                        and trap him or her in metaphysical plights, this story (were we those
                        neighbors!) presents a Frost who is unnervingly near and
                        <emph>un</emph>invited. </p>
                    <p>But for my aims in the context of this short essay, the thrust of the
                        anecdote should be directed straight to its analytical purchase on a long
                        Romantic and modern trajectory of lyric poetry’s interpretive creation.
                        Virginia Jackson characterizes this history as one of enabling confusion in
                        her entry on “LYRIC” for the (2012) fourth edition of the <title level="m"
                            >Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics</title>: <quote>A
                            persistent confusion—among verse genres, between historical genres and
                            natural ‘forms,’ between adjective and noun, between cognitive and
                            affective registers, between grammar and rhet. [rhetoric], between
                            privacy and publicity, and among various ideas about poetry—may be the
                            best way to define our current sense of the lyric. It is a confusion
                            that has proven enormously generative for both poets and critics. (826)
                        </quote> One reason why it remains vitally important to debate and teach the
                        theory of Romanticism, even in these widely proclaimed post-theoretical days
                        in the humanities, is due to the surreptitious depth of a circular
                        corroboration between interpretive “criticism” and poetic making. For
                        Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy in <title level="m">The Literary Absolute</title>,
                        the post-Kantian Romantic enterprise of critique/creation reflects an
                        “inauguration of the <emph>theoretical</emph> project in literature” (2);
                        and “the theoretical Romanticism of Jena characterized itself as the
                            <emph>critical</emph> question of literature” (5). The interposition of
                        “theory” between the literary object and hermeneutics comprises the
                        inaugural moment of Literature according to Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy—thus
                        scrambling the notions of “literary object” and interpretive “hermeneutics”
                        as stable entities and prior operations in themselves, in the name of the
                        radically mixed project of Romanticism. Especially when we think that
                        creation and explication form a complete pair requiring no subtractive
                        third, theory will be as urgently needed as it is resisted.<note
                            place="foot" resp="editors">“Resistance” of course is a trigger word. It
                            is worth recalling that, for Paul de Man, the important distinction
                            wasn’t one between “theory” and “praxis” (though he feints in this
                            direction when describing his failed <title level="m">PMLA</title>
                            commission at the start of “The Resistance to Theory,”) but rather the
                            extent to which the “literariness” that became the “object of literary
                            theory” (9) after Saussure is conceivably <emph>not in itself subject to
                                phenomenalization</emph>. In his Foreward, Wlad Godzich evokes this
                            staggering possibility—which de Man was insistently to call
                            “materialism” in his last years—as the radical <emph>matter of
                                reading</emph> and “the resistance of the material to the
                            ideological overlay” (<title level="m">Resistance to Theory</title>
                            x-xi). De Man himself is typically clearer and yet more mysterious:
                            “Literature is fiction not because it somehow refuses to acknowledge
                            ‘reality,’ but because it is not <emph>a priori</emph> certain that
                            language functions according to principles which are those, or which are
                                <emph>like</emph> those, of the phenomenal world” (11); “The
                            resistance to theory is a resistance to the use of language about
                            language” (12). The pedagogical upshot, as de Man flatly levels it, is
                            that “it is better to fail in teaching what should not be taught than to
                            succeed in teaching what is not true” (4). Words to gird the soul and
                            buckle the knees of any teacher. </note> Hence it was not only
                        pedagogically approachable, but theoretically telling, for Jonathan Culler
                        to recruit a short lyric by Frost (“Spring Pools”) as the occasion of his
                        2008 <title level="m">PMLA</title> Roundtable essay on how “it is deadly for
                        poetry to try to compete with narrative” once “narrative has become the norm
                        of literature.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Culler, “Why Lyric?,” 202.
                            This entire 2008 “New Lyric Studies Roundtable” forms part of the

                        Jackson in effect shows how closely the “negative” labor of theoretical
                        scrutiny can resemble an anti-theory, à la Stanley Fish or Walter Benn
                            Michaels.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In their notorious essay
                            “Against Theory” (1982), Walter Benn Michaels and Stephen Knapp exempt

                            out that poetics as a field of inquiry actually includes narratology
                            within it. Thus poetics and narrative theory (or lyric poems and novels)
                            need not be taught in isolation or confrontationally. See Jarvis (2009)
                            and Wang for incisive and (in their own right) ambitiously “theoretical”

                            formalism and the neo-pragmatism of Knapp and Benn Michaels, is that
                            generic form is intentional or has come to be treated as the final locus
                            of intentionality. “[I]n order to interpret these lines [of “A Slumber
                            Did My Spirit Seal”] we will immediately ask a double-sided question
                            concerning the intentions of the author and the intentions of the form”
                            (114). Marc Redfield offers a summary to date (fall 2012) of the
                            astoundingly large field of theoretical inquiry around the eight lines
                            of “A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal.” </note> Jackson recasts this
                        construction of the dual, mutually subtending categories of the poem and
                        poet as an obfuscating history of “lyric reading” practices dependent on the
                        rise of institutional print culture. Like pop stars, post-Romantic poets are
                        almost universally seen as figures whose pretension to that identity
                        precedes its real achievement; so it is fascinating and fruitfully
                        problematic to consider examples of major poets such as Dickinson who may
                        never exactly have willed to be thought poets on the given terms, or their
                        writings “poems.” My Frost story would appear to bear Virginia Jackson’s
                        thesis out that “from the mid-nineteenth through the beginning of the
                        twenty-first century, to be lyric is to be read as lyric” in an arc toward
                        increasing generic abstraction.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Jackson,
                                <title level="m">Dickinson’s Misery</title> 6. Since he aimed so
                            concertedly at success as a lyric poet, Frost’s oeuvre (to my knowledge)
                            contains no examples as radical as any of the “poems” of Dickinson. But
                            consider a relatively unexceptional poem like “The Pasture”, which was
                            published both as a prologue to <title level="m">North of Boston</title>
                            in 1914, and as the prologue to Frost’s <title level="m">Complete
                                Poems</title> after his death. Famously and rather vapidly ending
                            with the line, “I sha’n’t be long.—You come too,” this lyric offers a
                            paradigm of abstracted non-specific address to the notional reader. Yet
                            its concrete address is exceptionally intense, sexual and even tacitly
                            suicidal. Biographer Lawrance Thompson situates “The Pasture” in a
                            context of passionate address to Elinor, inviting her to remember
                            “moments of lovemaking” (311). Just a few pages earlier in <title
                                level="m">Robert Frost: The Early Years</title>, Thompson had
                            recounted a horrible memory of Lesley’s, in which her father woke her in
                            the night and brought her down to the parlor, then—pointing a gun toward
                            her mother and then toward himself—had asked her to choose: “‘Before
                            morning, one of us will be dead’” (308).</note> In Frost’s case, that
                        abstraction governs the shift from an “actual” material circuit of telephone
                        communications (the “sender” and “receiver” lend their roles to modern
                        linguistic theory as its paradigmatic example of language as a
                        communicational act), to the figural “music” conjured off a printed page.
                        Jackson’s book on Emily Dickinson thus presents a challenging, painstaking
                        brief concerning the widespread disciplinary “lyricization” that over time
                        has reduced the many richly addressed sub-genres of literary and
                        non-literary writing into a single, abstract, and overwhelmingly
                            <emph>poetic</emph> “literariness”; and her core contention about the
                        discursive framing of “lyric” or “poetic” ontology has basic, if also
                        complex, implications for our teaching the theory of Romanticism. If the
                        Jena Circle’s project of Romanticism carries within it an inaugural and
                        ineradicable theoretical investment, the classificatory model most often
                        bestowed upon British Romantic poets has leveled social, historical and
                        artistic differences to the point of nearly erasing the conceptual issues at
                        stake. </p>
                    <p>From one point of view, “Romanticism” in such an account has essentially a
                        schematic function. As opposed to the Keatsian nightingale and Shelley’s
                        skylark, Dickinson’s “homely American ‘bobolink’” and her letter-poem
                        enclosure of a whole dead cricket (Jackson 199, 91) manifestly show the
                        difference of her archive from the shared, interpretive-cum-creative, norms
                        of post-Romantic era publication culture.<note place="foot" resp="editors"

                        effects of Romantic discourse, the framing conventions of metaphorical lyric
                        reference and the yearning for disembodiment come in for brilliant
                        restructuring at the hands of Dickinson (as opposed to the hands of a series
                        of editors and readers who then render her straight through their
                        conventional praise). Yet the argument of <title level="m">Dickinson’s
                            Misery</title> is held firmly in place by insisting that we deal
                        exclusively with the worn normative stereotypes of Romantic idealization:
                        the pressure is kept squarely on a (very real) disciplinary and popular
                        mainstream, in an effective though repetitive fashion. Jackson’s many
                        allusions to Keats are all equally—and almost as problematically—subject to
                        the miserable ease of pre-interpretation as holds in the case of Emily
                        Dickinson lyrics.<note place="foot">The recent film version of Keats’s life,

                            reverses the scenario of lyric reading by recasting so many famous
                            poetics statements from the letters in a setting of intimate personal
                            communication with Fanny Brawne (see Grant F. Scott’s scrupulously sharp
                            review of the film in <title level="m">Studies in Romanticism</title>).
                            “I’ve come for my poetry class,” Fanny says to Charles Brown and to
                            Keats upon entering the room, at the start of a key scene in the film in
                            which Keats goes on to extemporize conversationally on the ideas of the
                            chameleon poet that we know so well from the letters. As teachers of
                            Romanticism and poetic theory, are we more in danger, then, of
                            overriding and abstracting the intimacy of personal address such as
                            Dickinson’s “letter poems” to Susan Gilbert? Or should we instead (or
                            concomitantly) pay attention to the danger of over-personalizing and
                                <emph>only</emph> reading biographically the often curiously
                            neutral, <emph>written</emph>, spaces of literature and its
                            genres?</note> British Romanticism gives the control group and makes for
                        the inert argumentative scarecrow of Jackson’s book in this sense; and
                        neither the concept of Romanticism nor any of the relevant poems themselves
                        are let free to join the rest of the book’s exhilarating lines of flight. </p>
                    <p>But if the fundamental question of <title level="m">Dickinson’s
                            Misery</title> asks how we have come to receive truly outsider textual
                            <emph>productions</emph> as canonical <emph>poems</emph> always to be
                        read by a certain light, given the posthumous conditions of poetic fame and
                        the disciplinary professionalization of literature, then Jackson’s study
                        bears down powerfully on Romantic coordinates. In his 1979 essay “Shelley
                        Disfigured,” Paul de Man began by noting the resistance of the Romantic
                        fragment to such monumentalization, while at the same time he acknowledged
                        up front that “Shelley’s last poem, is, as is well known, a fragment that
                        has been unearthed, edited, reconstructed and much discussed”: i.e., it has
                        served as the occasion of such a monumentalizing impulse nevertheless, and
                        (short of the text’s total loss) could hardly have eventuated in anything
                        else. Romanticism is thus the name for both a bracing contestatory failure
                        and that other kind of failure in which, as Barbara Johnson once remarked
                        with wryness and wisdom of deconstruction, “nothing fails like success”;
                        Romanticism is associated with that inevitable aftermath known as
                        “interpretive labor.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">See de Man (in Bloom,

                        scholarly outrage, with Jackson’s courageously indigestible assertion she
                        does not want to be heard as saying that Dickinson’s posthumous career
                            <emph>should</emph> have unfolded much differently (204 ff). </p>
                    <p>The set of linked inquiries to follow from her study might well break down
                        some of our fundamental teaching goals (like seeing meaning as a matter of
                        thematic reference: the song of the bird), while fostering others (like the
                        specificity of material index: the cricket).<note place="foot">However the
                            matter of deconstruction is by no means done away with in framing the
                            contrast between a symbolic/thematic register of lyric reading and what
                            I here call the poem’s “material index” (i.e., an indexical versus an
                            abstract model of reference). Virginia Jackson thus writes about the
                            freezing and fixing effect that anthropomorphism has upon the lateral
                            movement of the signifying chain—the most famous conclusion of Paul de

                                vicarious feeling; it is, and is not, to recall de Man’s definition
                                of lyric anthropomorphism, ‘an identification on the level of
                                substance,’ since it reverses the tropological process de Man
                                described when a figure ‘is no longer a proposition but a proper
                                name, as when the metamorphosis in Ovid’s stories culminates and
                                halts in the singleness of the proper name, Narcissus or Daphne or
                                whatever.’ Dickinson did not write to Susan, ‘This is my cheek,’ or
                                ‘this is my sorrow,’ or ‘this is my death,’ or ‘this is you.’ She
                                did not name the flower; by taking it from the woods, rather than
                                killing it she seems to have rescued it from being metamorphosed
                                into other names—or other poems. (<title level="m">Dickinson’s

                                <emph>not</emph> human) and extra-intentional system. So while, from
                            one perspective, Jackson’s procedure in this passage and throughout her
                            book brilliantly and cagily outstrips de Man by taking further his own
                            methodological insights, on another viewing Jackson’s approach seems to
                            desire to go so far outside the “Romantic” self-reflective theoretical
                            project of literature, that it is essentially <emph>pre</emph>-critical,
                            or—better said—its source of power is pre-critical. Much as Jackson
                            accuses de Man of doing (108), <title level="m">Dickinson’s
                                Misery</title> conducts a rational endgame according to the internal
                            dynamics of lyric reading, but it also casts its own spell. Jackson
                            retrieves the “open secret” of passion and traces a rich counterpoetics
                            of queer relationship in her commentary on Susan Gilbert Dickinson’s
                            1860 “Private” message (“I send / you this”) and the earlier
                            “deanthropomorphiz[ing]” lines Dickinson had sent to Susan in
                            1859—“Whose cheek is this?”—which rescue a real flower from poetic
                            personification (“I found her—‘pleiad’—in the woods / And bore her safe
                            away—” (230-1). But notice how Jackson’s passage lingers over the now
                            missing, carbonized flower—“Although the flower to which ‘this’ pointed
                            is no longer on the page for the word to point <emph>to</emph>, on the
                            manuscript its imprint is still visible” (228)—whereas de Man’s
                            “materiality” captures an aspect intrinsic to language. The strength of
                            Jackson’s commentary hence repeatedly stems from her recognition of how
                            Dickinson “folded other poetic genres” and signifying codes into her own
                            texts “that often point away” quite radically from modern generic
                            conventions and their interpretive violence (228). Symbolic reference is
                            at once meta-critically and literally folded into, or cited, in a
                            typical Dickinson archive “poem.” But success in anticipating this
                            hegemonic kind of “readability” is not at all the vector of her poetry’s
                            aspiration; if anything, it runs the opposite way. The danger of this
                            reading, however, is that it risks making the pathos of losing Hegelian
                            “sense-certainty” (the <emph>this</emph>; the flower rather than the
                            conventional poetic sign; and, in <title level="m">Dickinson’s

                            critical activity rather than its incitement. Hegel and, especially,
                            Derrida are largely omitted to a cost from Jackson’s discussion.</note>
                        What kinds of blinkers do we put on for students simply in running
                        (Romantic) poetry classes—insofar as the object of study is thereby already
                        constructed? What kinds of critical acts do communities of readers perform
                        to condition what counts as possible meaning, before our interpretation (a
                        “reading”) even starts? What individual cases besides Dickinson’s present an
                        unclassifiable archive as the heuristic prompt? Can we sustain the mission
                        of a “poetics” classroom (i.e., an enterprise whose descriptive methodology
                        is not supposed to be configured around a “hermeneutic” relation to meaning)
                        that is <emph>not </emph>constantly dragged back into interpretation? In
                        other words: can poetics be responsibly taught and pursued as a field all to
                        itself; or is its role essentially to produce a little saving distance in
                        view of the inevitable imperative that we interpret (we <emph>are</emph>
                        interpreting, “always already”) by some model? And if the latter, which of
                        the stages in the process of interpretive self-recognition as a class or a
                        course unfolds is the appropriately <emph>theoretical </emph>moment?
                        Finally, are there Romantic poets who don’t aspire, exactly, to be

                            non-assertive utterance. Also (and not coincidentally) relevant here is
                            Ann Banfield, who in <title level="m">Unspeakable Sentences</title> once
                            postulated of narrative theory that the conditions of print culture and
                            writing are the enabling conditions of the modern subject: i.e., a third
                            person “objective” instantiation of the subject, a “self,” whose form is
                            not that of the morphological speaker (234). For Banfield, if “[t]he
                            ingredients for represented speech and thought are thus given in
                            universal grammar,” they <emph>appear</emph> historically rather than a
                            priori. The horizon of the modern “self” becomes visible and operative
                            only after the supersession of an exclusive “I”/ “you” (and “here,”
                            “now”) communicative scene. It is the intrinsic <emph>writtenness
                            </emph>of the modern third-person novel—which was historically
                            unexampled even though poetry of course too had long been an artifact of
                            writing—that supplies the kind of perspective first required to
                                <emph>have</emph> and see our<emph>selves</emph>. I will quickly
                            add, however, that this massive transition in the ideological and formal
                            horizons of material print culture should not be misunderstood in a
                            facile way as the supersession of lyric and its paradigmatic “I.” We are
                            dealing not with a myth and an empirical reality, but with conjuration
                            and cross-conjuration, a situation in which lyric pretenses themselves
                            can become the other of a hegemonic order of narrative. Whereas the
                            lyric poem (especially what W.R. Johnson calls “absolute lyric,” a
                            post-Romantic written discourse now entirely beyond the social
                            environments of a concrete addressee) persists in a spectral formal
                            continuation of the unmediated speech-act scene, this formal ritual is
                            already a displacement of the “constative” norm. What the ascendant
                            “realist” novel and narrative theory do, nevertheless, is to promise the
                            release of literature from the demand for <emph>any</emph> linkage to
                            ritual. </note> Few if any of the British Romantic poets incite
                        questions, like Dickinson, on a level as disarmingly basic as whether they
                        in fact composed and published “poems.” But the critical urgency and utility
                        of asking questions about <emph>generic</emph> rather than artistically

                        presuppositions of “high” Romantic mythmaking on the composition of lyric.
                        Frost writes about “sentence sounds” and “the sound of sense” often in his
                        letters during a stretch of years leading up to his publication of <title
                            level="m">North of Boston</title> in 1914. The theory was in effect his
                        attempt to educate a small group of capable (and, as it turned out, mostly
                        British) readers. As strings of sound whose verbal character he theorized to
                        precede the meaning of the individual words out of which they were
                        comprised, for Frost “sentence sounds” are a kind of sub-musical linguistic
                        intonation contour, apprehended by the poet from his verbal culture as if
                        one were hearing a spoken conversation taking place on the other side of a
                        closed door. </p>

                        enormously influential characterization of something like the “primal scene”
                        of lyric as a modern genre. We all know the gist of Mill’s 1833 “What is
                        Poetry?” essay, of course, where he evokes a stereotypically “Romantic” idea
                        of poetry more as a spirit than as a genre, a spirit found in the
                            “<emph>over</emph>heard” expression of “utterance of feeling,” against
                        the “<emph>heard</emph>” address of persuasive eloquence.<note place="foot"

                            1044-51. For Mill, famously, “[t]he peculiarity of poetry appears to us
                            to lie in the poet’s utter unconsciousness of a listener. Poetry is
                            feeling confessing itself to itself in moments of solitude” (1048).

                        with reference to Mill. Frost, devilishly, would know that it was he who had
                        been actively and secretly overhearing. Reversing Mill’s poles of the
                        (notional) writer and (literalized) audience, Frost was at liberty to listen
                        in, as the poet. His prosaic Derry neighbors were rather the ones

                        to its logical generic extreme the inference that the psyche of the
                        quintessential poetic speaker is unbalanced, sociopathic or just plain
                        crazy. In the classroom, a pairing of Edgar Allan Poe’s “Philosophy of
                        Composition” with “The Raven” can serve as a lively early-semester reading
                        assignment for almost any student level, to test out and instantiate what
                        results from this idea of poetry as self-communion. With an objective
                        precision that does not exclude his own role as a literary hoaxer and
                        puffer, Poe realigns the scene of poetic production with optimal consumption
                        in the “Philosophy of Composition” essay, which constructs after the fact of
                        “The Raven” a double portrait of melodramatic suffering and clearheaded
                        sadomasochistic willfulness. </p>
                    <p>To put my own Romanticist’s spin on what the Derry tour guide said, Robert
                        Frost, at least the young Frost of these striving apprentice years before
                            <title level="m">North of Boston</title>, both despised and emulated the
                        “language really used by men” that lay behind Wordsworth’s experiment in
                            <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>. The recurrently despondent
                        young Frost was not sure yet if he resembled Wordsworth the mature poet or
                        his marginal subjects, if he was the witness to representation or the person
                        who gazed with suicidal thoughts into small pools of water and mused whether
                        they were deep enough to drown in. If in his poetry Frost sought to produce
                        the effect of an immediate but non-specifiable “oversound,”<note

                        was made of addressed communications, comprised of everyday intimacies that
                        “the poet” had gained access to and seems to have fecklessly violated. But
                        Frost’s approach, as most poetic theories do, has a multiplicity and
                        layering of functionalities that complicate any progressive linear narrative
                        available to analytical demystification. He sublimates the real content of
                        those overheard daily exchanges, to make from these materials a dynamic
                        frictional prosody that “breaks” sentence sound across the units of meter
                        and line. He exploits class privilege not only to record the slowly
                        disintegrating culture of failing New England farmers and itinerant country
                        laborers, but also to reinvigorate the quotidian life force of
                        Anglo-American poetry. Aligned broadly with Yeats and early Poundian
                        Imagism’s disapproval of mere poetic ornament, Frost’s commitment to the
                        “sound of sense” pushes back against the perception of an idealizing, ersatz
                        (i.e., “nonsense”) musicality of many late Victorian poets he grew up
                        admiring. Frost thus (just) saves the classic poetic tropes of “voice” and
                        “music” by exposing them to the contemporary truth of their
                            over-elaboration.<note place="foot">Yopie Prins offers a counterpoint
                            here; her work in a series of linked essays collectively entitled “Voice

                            to Simon Jarvis’s work), invests in the impersonality of musical
                            practice as a scientific or pseudo-scientific method in the poetic
                            theory of Sidney Lanier. For Prins, importantly, the “musicality” or
                            “harmony” of verse is not invoked as a generalizing “voice” metaphor,
                            but as an estranging mechanical techne that points up a mediating system

                        realization that Romantic Poetry isn’t obviously at the forefront of current
                        literary theory. The field’s very centrality to twentieth century
                        methodological change—and to the twenty to thirty years of rapid
                        metabolization dating from the first translations of structuralism/
                        post-structuralism to America, the period known most narrowly as the heady
                        days of “theory”—is in part the cause of Romanticism’s current positioning,
                        on balance more reflective than experimental. The philosophical side of our
                        field especially has a dauntingly large buy-in cost of past learning for
                        aspiring young scholars. Romantic poetic theory played a covertly key role
                        in New Critical formalism; (positively, from these critics’ point of view)
                        it sponsored the organic element of thinking about poetic structure, and
                        (negatively) its sublime, or catachrestic, aspect set off the limits of
                        taste and a regulative sense of decorum. It was hot and cool at once to

                        reminder that critical “theory” is itself of Romantic invention, not just a
                        creature of 1917 or 1968 that has been unhurriedly dying since 1989. In the
                        coda to his 2011 book <title level="m">Romantic Sobriety</title>, Orrin Wang
                        persuasively maintains that Romanticism’s extravagant way of foregrounding
                        the spectral character of literary values and non-values appears now as the
                        widespread “embarrassment” of the humanities in broader institutional
                        context. Yet, methodologically and imaginatively if not in administrative
                        terms, that very untimeliness continues to give our field its edge: “The
                        discursive operations of [Romanticism] thus provide a tropological resource
                        for understanding literature’s present predicament during the global
                        reorganization of knowledge in and beyond the humanities. [.&#160;.&#160;.]
                        If Romanticism has always been structured by its own legitimation crisis, so
                        has literature, a predicament whose present form we know today mostly
                        because of the meta-commentary of, and on, Romanticism.”<note place="foot"

                    <p>Here one can read Wang as offering an important reply to Jackson’s argument
                        about the role of Romanticism in the normalizing and naturalizing project
                        she calls “lyricization.” Romanticism, Wang shows, continues to perform its
                        own “legitimation crisis,” and therefore its study may lend an invaluable
                        perspective to the present reorganization of the humanities in which all
                        literary modes of knowledge are made to appear ghostly and marginalized. </p>
                    <p>However in this essay I have shared some of my introductory approaches to the
                        practice of teaching “literary” or “poetic” ontology. I think it’s important

                        theoretical concerns, even though the terminology may sound daunting.

                            its force, and asked “what bad things happen to me if I avoid using this
                            word?” See Jarvis, “How to Do Things with Tunes: Or, Prose Rhythm
                            Today.” Following Boris Eikhenbaum, Jarvis invited those in attendance
                            to embrace the Russian Formalist distinction, “we are not formalists, we
                            are specifiers.” But would the conceptual cave-in that did not occur in
                            Jarvis’s enlivening talk have been the vengeance of form and not the
                            result of the intellectual configurations of those people present?
                            Presumably, if form were a real category of experience and analysis

                        poor and too lavish alike to answer such questions.</p>
                    <p>In class, I end this discussion of poetic ontology with a look at Helen
                        Vendler’s claim that Elizabeth Bishop’s posthumously published lyrics in
                            <title level="m">Edgar Allan Poe and the Jukebox</title> aren’t even
                        “poems” but “repudiated” objects. Vendler’s <title level="m">New
                            Republic</title> review has a clear theoretical application to debates
                        about authorial intent and the Foucauldian author function, but I find it
                        even more resonant as an unwitting rehearsal of how drastically a simple
                        “genre” term can frame the field of available meaning. A class exercise
                        involving the contrast of Elizabeth Bishop’s and Felicia Hemans’s <title
                            level="m">Casabianca</title> poems effectively relates the social and
                        historical categories of lyric and narrative poetry. This generic or even
                        sub-generic divide has become—at its most flat and unproductive extreme—a
                        tacit judging standard of “good” and “bad” poems for many people in higher
                        education on both sides of the classroom; or, in Vendler's case, a test of
                        poetry that accedes to the status of a real “poem,” versus verse (!) which
                        is denied that status in such an exaggerative, indeed theological, way.
                        Having two students energetically read the absolutely sincere and yet
                        morosely funny, two-column poem on the death of Bishop’s toucan, “Uncle Sam”
                        (collected in <title level="m">Edgar Allan Poe</title>), will aid this
                        lesson and lighten the group dynamic of a graduate seminar inclined to
                        seriousness. In future iterations of this Romantically-oriented graduate
                        “Theory of Lyric” course, I am looking forward to incorporating two new
                        lessons on these issue of poetic ontology and lyric address: I want to open
                        up the syllabus more to avant-garde and post-war, post-modernist lyric
                        strategies, by looking at Frank O’Hara’s tongue-in-cheek “Personism”
                        Manifesto in the famous Donald Allen anthology; and to share George Oppen’s
                        “daybooks” and his unusually physical, accretive, method of revising his
                        poetry, where often new “versions” of a poem are marked by superimposed
                        layers of planks and wire and nails—not by an erasure. </p>
