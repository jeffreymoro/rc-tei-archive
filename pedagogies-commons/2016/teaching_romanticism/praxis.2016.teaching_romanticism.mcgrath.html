            <p class="noCount">Romantic texts have repeatedly played important roles in the development of what we
               call literary theory. For instance, all of the essays collected in the 1979 <em>Deconstruction and Criticism</em> volume, which did so much to announce deconstruction in the United States, were originally
               meant to focus on the poetry of P. B. Shelley. In the intervening decades, Romanticists
               have often been hired as literary theorists, and so the teaching of Romanticism has
               frequently been paired with the teaching of literary theory. For this special issue
               of <em>Romantic Circles Pedagogy Commons</em> I asked contributors to reflect on the ways they integrate literary theory into their
               teaching of Romanticism and to reflect on the continued importance of literary theory
               to Romanticism and the work of Romanticists. I did not define “literary theory” but
               left the term open to interpretation. Collectively the essays broach a range of questions,

               <p>Romantic texts have repeatedly played important roles in the development of what we
                  call literary theory. For instance, all of the essays collected in the 1979 <em>Deconstruction and Criticism</em> volume, which did so much to announce deconstruction in the United States, were originally

               <p>Contributors received their PhDs from departments well known for getting theoretical
                  (Chicago, Virginia, UC Irvine, and Yale (x2)) and now teach at a range of institutions,
                  some private, some public, some in the United States, some abroad. In selecting contributors
                  I was self-consciously interested in hearing from those who received their PhD after
                  the turn of the century, after the publication of the first edition of the <em>Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism</em> (2001) and so after literary theory courses had become a regular part of departmental
                  curricula. The range of responses tells us much not only about prevailing definitions
                  of Romanticism and literary theory but also about collective goals for the teaching
                  of literature today.</p>
               <p>To say that contributors received the PhD after the 2001 publication of the <em>Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism </em>is also to say that they entered the profession after the most violent decades of
                  the culture wars, when labels for theoretical positions became hardened (one strategy
                  among many, one might say, for resisting theory). In reading the essays I was struck
                  by the degree to which all contributors resist dogmatic claims. In fact, the essays
                  demonstrate a commitment not to theory per se, and certainly not to theory as a lens
                  through which to view the literary object, but to discovering texts (both “theoretical”
                  and “Romantic”) together and anew. Collectively, contributors are more interested
                  in what works, which texts when paired draw from each other new interpretations and
                  new insights, than in claiming allegiance with any particular theoretical position.
                  As Andrew Warren writes, “I find theory most useful, both in my own thinking and in
                  the classroom, when it creates the right kinds of resistances to texts and ideas I
                  have been taking for granted.”</p>
               <p>Metonymy and resistance play an important role in several essays in the volume. In
                  his contribution, David Sigler describes teaching Wordsworth’s “Steamboats, Viaducts,
                  and Railways” <em>alongside</em> a chapter from George Bataille’s <em>Theory of Religion</em>, entitled “The Rise of Industry.” Reading Bataille alongside Wordsworth is meant
                  to challenge the available readings of Wordsworth; but similarly, reading Wordsworth
                  alongside Bataille is meant to challenge students’ interpretations of Bataille. The
                  theoretical text does not explain the literary one; but neither does the literary
                  text explain the theoretical one. Ideally, both texts emerge changed after the pedagogical
                  encounter; such is the point, suggests Sigler, of placing the texts side by side.
                  In her teaching, Anahid Nersessian self-consciously embraces the aleatory, producing
                  the chance for unforeseen confluences between Romantic and theoretical texts: <span class="quote">‘One of my goals is to push students toward a non-instrumental relationship to criticism
                     . . . I believe we are all fatigued by studies promising to give an interpretation
                     of some poem or novel through one “angle” at a time, Morris Zapp-style. This sort
                     of pedantic relationship to theory, or to the more constrained genre of criticism,
                     is one current students should consider it their historical privilege to reject.’</span> In many of the essays collected here, “theory” describes less a critical position
                  than a shared openness to discovering texts together in new constellations of reference
                  and signification. For some, this commitment to discovery might seem yet another strategy
                  for resisting theory, as theory recedes from critical view (especially when so explicitly
                  replaced by “method” in Nersessian’s essay). For others, such a commitment to discovering
                  texts in constellations of reference and signification may simply be one theoretical
                  position among many, if unclaimed.</p>
               <p>What is meant by “theory” here, other than a loose set of texts and proper names?
                  In “Nothing Fails Like Success,” Barbara Johnson concludes that <span class="quote">‘if the deconstructive impulse is to retain its vital, subversive power, we must . . .
                     become ignorant of it again and again. It is only by forgetting what we know how to
                     do, by setting aside the thoughts that have most changed us, that those thoughts and
                     that knowledge can go on making accessible to us the surprise of an otherness we can
                     only encounter in the moment of suddenly discovering we are ignorant of it. (16)’</span> Efforts to transform deconstruction into a set of rule bound procedures must be resisted,
                  argues Johnson. Collectively, it seems to me, the essays in <em>Teaching Romanticism and Literary Theory</em> explore a similar paradox with respect to theory (deconstruction has often been code
                  for theory). Perhaps we must become ignorant of theory too, again and again, if the
                  term is to retain vital and subversive force, especially as each “theory” (formalism,
                  deconstruction, Marxism, feminism, etc.) is reduced to a discrete set of critical
                  procedures. As the courses described in contributions to this volume show, “forgetting
                  theory” does not mean not reading texts we call theoretical. It may just mean reading
                  theory as literature, as still capable of producing surprise. The essays collected
                  here share a commitment to surprise (both for students and teachers). “Teaching,”
                  then, is not the transmission of information but a shared encounter with texts.</p>
               <p>Essays by Emily Sun and Eric Lindstrom stage this question about the literariness
                  of theory most explicitly. Sun does not place importance on teaching Wordsworth’s
                  poem alongside a theoretical text, though the fact that Sun has read William Empson,
                  Paul de Man, and Edward Said certainly informs her class design and preparation. Sun’s
                  interest is in discovering the words of Wordsworth’s poem anew and in competing contexts.
                  Teaching in English in Taiwan, Sun explains how the attempt to read Wordsworth’s “sense”
                  in “Tintern Abbey” affected her students’ understanding of the Chinese phrase for
                  senses, <span class="foreign">wuguan</span>. Drawing on de Man’s “The Return to Philology” Sun reminds us that theory emerges
                  from the deceptively simple (or perhaps deceptively difficult?) effort to read just
                  what is on the page. Pairing literary and theoretical texts may, likewise, demonstrate
                  a desire to cut through received or practiced opinion and, however impossible an effort,
                  get to the words themselves and the questions they raise. In his contribution, Eric
                  Lindstrom reminds readers that literature (or the literary) is one name among many
                  for the gap between object and interpretation, between theory and method.</p>
               <p>All five essays move past “discovering” literary theoretical pronouncements buried
                  within Romantic texts, as if one buried a bone just so one could have the pleasure
                  of digging it up again. In response to definitions of Romanticism aligned with an
                  aesthetic purposelessness, Warren in “The Uses and Abuses of Theory (for Life)” moves
                  from Alain Badiou back to German Idealism to ask how Romanticism can or should be
                  instrumentalized to get students to think differently about our most familiar definitions
                  of Romanticism. In “The Intimacy of Infrastructure: Teaching Wordsworth with Bataille,”
                  Sigler shows how reading Bataille alongside Wordsworth allows Wordsworth’s nuanced
                  thinking about capitalist ideology in a poem like “Steamboats, Viaducts, and Railways”
                  to emerge: “When read in combination, Bataille and Wordsworth show how poetic devices
                  present an occasion for radically rethinking subjectivity in an industrial world.”
                  In “Dissensus in Two Registers: Tintern Abbey in Taiwan,” Sun shows the continued
                  importance of philology to our thinking about Romantic poems in historical and contemporary
                  cultural contexts. Sun describes the experience of teaching Wordsworth in Taiwan and
                  demonstrates the continued importance of poetry to “getting theoretical,” as Sun’s
                  Taiwanese students found themselves estranged from their own language and culture
                  by virtue of the encounter with Wordsworth’s poem. Lindstrom simultaneously moves
                  us beyond the traditional canon of British Romanticism to the writing of Robert Frost
                  and moves us back to thinking about the priority of poetry and poetic thinking, not
                  only to our conceptions of Romanticism but also to literary theory. Lindstrom reminds
                  us that how we read is too often preconditioned by our assumptions about what we are
                  reading, and teaching Romanticism and literary theory stretches those assumptions
                  about what makes a lyric poem or a theoretical text. Nersessian calls for thinking
                  of Romanticism not as theory but as method: “replacing theory with method means making
                  Romanticism useful.” Nersessian challenges readers to think about how encounters between
                  Romanticism and literary theory enable new forms of poetic making. With tremendous
                  style and intellectual rigor, each of these short essays shows how discovering Romantic
                  and literary theoretical texts together allows one to discover these texts anew. </p>
