            <p class="noCount">Cumbersome terminology aside, this essay demonstrates the use and interest of teaching
               the debated concept of lyric ontology in the Romantic Poetry classroom across undergraduate
               and graduate levels. It moves from a narrative introduction on Robert Frost's very
               material practice of "lyric overhearing" on his Derry, New Hampshire party-phone line,
               to extended consideration of the recent scholarly turn to historical poetics in the
               study of nineteenth century British and American Poetry. I discuss Virginia Jackson's
               influential and compelling anti-lyric anti-theory——Jackson's version of the resistance
               to theory——as it presents a teachable conflict with the Romantic "literary absolute."
               The essay ends by reconsidering the metonymic linkage between the position of Romanticism
               and the position of poetry/ literature/ the Humanities in the institution of the contemporary
               university, and with brief suggestions for lesson plan ideas and student readings.
               (Post-production note: contemporary American poet Ben Lerner's <em>The Hatred of Poetry</em> [Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2016] makes for a timely addition to the essay's bibliographic
               suggestions and also may impart something like a critical mass to the essay's approach
               to teaching in the rift between poetic ontology and historical poetics.)</p>

                  <p>On a recent car trip to the Boston area for an academic conference, I stopped off
                     at the Robert Frost Farm in Derry, New Hampshire, a visit I had been meaning to make
                     for a long time, since moving to Frost’s “other” New England home state of Vermont.
                     At one point early in the tour, our small group was standing in the kitchen of the
                     home, in which Frost and his young family had lived from 1900-1911. We saw the striking
                     red wallpaper (which Rob “romantically” thought perfect for Christmas, our tour guide
                     said); the handsome large stove worth a local shoe factory worker’s year’s pay; the
                     soapstone farmhouse sink that had been improbably salvaged from the back pasture after
                     it was converted to the “Frosty Acres” automobile junkyard in the 1950s and ’60s,
                     and only authenticated because Elinor Frost’s knives had been sharpened on the front
                     apron; and then we were directed toward the far wall with a telephone. Though the
                     chronology suggests a time too early for a phone in regular domestic use, our guide
                     informed the group that Frost’s daughter Lesley, as a consultant to the heritage site,
                     had told a story about the poet that dictated there should be one. The phone was part
                     of his vocation. Robert Frost apparently often listened in secretly to the telephone
                     conversations of neighbors on the party line around Derry. When exhorted by his wife
                     or daughter to stop eavesdropping, he is claimed to have replied: “Don’t bother me,
                     I’m working.”

               <p>The joke (if that is what this is) resonates because it captures a lot of Frost’s
                  character and several of the recurrent ingredients of his famous persona. On the private
                  side one might include his position as the ultimate insider-outsider in the New England
                  community and his role as an often-severe patriarchal family head. On the better-known
                  and beloved public side are his georgic conflation of languid ease and hard “work”;
                  his magical “folksy” touch with the quick reply; and not least, his devilish initiative
                  as an artist-tactician. If Frost’s poetry invites the reader in via its surface of
                  familiarity and offerings of countrified wisdom, only to toy with and trap him or
                  her in metaphysical plights, this story (were we those neighbors!) presents a Frost
                  who is unnervingly near and <em>un</em>invited.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>But for my aims in the context of this short essay, the thrust of the anecdote should
                     be directed straight to its analytical purchase on a long Romantic and modern trajectory
                     of lyric poetry’s interpretive creation. Virginia Jackson characterizes this history
                     as one of enabling confusion in her entry on “LYRIC” for the (2012) fourth edition
                     of the <em>Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics</em>: <span class="quote">‘A persistent confusion—among verse genres, between historical genres and natural ‘forms,’
                        between adjective and noun, between cognitive and affective registers, between grammar
                        and rhet. [rhetoric], between privacy and publicity, and among various ideas about
                        poetry—may be the best way to define our current sense of the lyric. It is a confusion
                        that has proven enormously generative for both poets and critics. (826) ’</span> One reason why it remains vitally important to debate and teach the theory of Romanticism,
                     even in these widely proclaimed post-theoretical days in the humanities, is due to
                     the surreptitious depth of a circular corroboration between interpretive “criticism”
                     and poetic making. For Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy in <em>The Literary Absolute</em>, the post-Kantian Romantic enterprise of critique/creation reflects an “inauguration
                     of the <em>theoretical</em> project in literature” (2); and “the theoretical Romanticism of Jena characterized
                     itself as the <em>critical</em> question of literature” (5). The interposition of “theory” between the literary object
                     and hermeneutics comprises the inaugural moment of Literature according to Lacoue-Labarthe
                     and Nancy—thus scrambling the notions of “literary object” and interpretive “hermeneutics”
                     as stable entities and prior operations in themselves, in the name of the radically
                     mixed project of Romanticism. Especially when we think that creation and explication
                     form a complete pair requiring no subtractive third, theory will be as urgently needed
                     as it is resisted.

                              Man, the important distinction wasn’t one between “theory” and “praxis” (though he
                              feints in this direction when describing his failed PMLA commission at the start of
                              “The Resistance to Theory,”) but rather the extent to which the “literariness” that
                              became the “object of literary theory” (9) after Saussure is conceivably not in itself
                              subject to phenomenalization. In his Foreward, Wlad Godzich evokes this staggering
                              possibility—which de Man was insistently to call “materialism” in his last years—as

                     Culler to recruit a short lyric by Frost (“Spring Pools”) as the occasion of his 2008 <em>PMLA</em> Roundtable essay on how “it is deadly for poetry to try to compete with narrative”
                     once “narrative has become the norm of literature.”

                     the genre’s signature moves of apostrophe, ghostly deictic gestures, allusions, ritualistic
                     repetitions, etc.—while at the same time his inclusion in such a venture implicitly
                     widens the domain of theory into the territory of perhaps <em>the</em> poet least hospitable to theoretical intonation.</p>

                  <p>In her 2005 book <em>Dickinson’s Misery</em>, Virginia Jackson in effect shows how closely the “negative” labor of theoretical
                     scrutiny can resemble an anti-theory, à la Stanley Fish or Walter Benn Michaels.

                              Knapp exempt from their working definition of “theory” all “literary subjects with
                              no direct bearing on the interpretation of individual works, such as narratology,
                              stylistics, and prosody” (11). Introducing a recent collection on new directions in
                              literary studies published in a 2010 issue of PMLA, Jonathan Culler similarly points
                              out that poetics as a field of inquiry actually includes narratology within it. Thus
                              poetics and narrative theory (or lyric poems and novels) need not be taught in isolation

                     </div> Jackson recasts this construction of the dual, mutually subtending categories of the
                     poem and poet as an obfuscating history of “lyric reading” practices dependent on
                     the rise of institutional print culture. Like pop stars, post-Romantic poets are almost
                     universally seen as figures whose pretension to that identity precedes its real achievement;
                     so it is fascinating and fruitfully problematic to consider examples of major poets
                     such as Dickinson who may never exactly have willed to be thought poets on the given
                     terms, or their writings “poems.” My Frost story would appear to bear Virginia Jackson’s
                     thesis out that “from the mid-nineteenth through the beginning of the twenty-first
                     century, to be lyric is to be read as lyric” in an arc toward increasing generic abstraction.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Jackson, Dickinson’s Misery 6. Since he aimed so concertedly at success as a lyric
                              poet, Frost’s oeuvre (to my knowledge) contains no examples as radical as any of the
                              “poems” of Dickinson. But consider a relatively unexceptional poem like “The Pasture”,
                              which was published both as a prologue to North of Boston in 1914, and as the prologue
                              to Frost’s Complete Poems after his death. Famously and rather vapidly ending with
                              the line, “I sha’n’t be long.—You come too,” this lyric offers a paradigm of abstracted
                              non-specific address to the notional reader. Yet its concrete address is exceptionally
                              …</span></div>
                     </div> In Frost’s case, that abstraction governs the shift from an “actual” material circuit
                     of telephone communications (the “sender” and “receiver” lend their roles to modern
                     linguistic theory as its paradigmatic example of language as a communicational act),
                     to the figural “music” conjured off a printed page. Jackson’s book on Emily Dickinson
                     thus presents a challenging, painstaking brief concerning the widespread disciplinary
                     “lyricization” that over time has reduced the many richly addressed sub-genres of
                     literary and non-literary writing into a single, abstract, and overwhelmingly <em>poetic</em> “literariness”; and her core contention about the discursive framing of “lyric” or
                     “poetic” ontology has basic, if also complex, implications for our teaching the theory
                     of Romanticism. If the Jena Circle’s project of Romanticism carries within it an inaugural
                     and ineradicable theoretical investment, the classificatory model most often bestowed
                     upon British Romantic poets has leveled social, historical and artistic differences
                     to the point of nearly erasing the conceptual issues at stake.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>From one point of view, “Romanticism” in such an account has essentially a schematic
                     function. As opposed to the Keatsian nightingale and Shelley’s skylark, Dickinson’s
                     “homely American ‘bobolink’” and her letter-poem enclosure of a whole dead cricket
                     (Jackson 199, 91) manifestly show the difference of her archive from the shared, interpretive-cum-creative,
                     norms of post-Romantic era publication culture.

                     </div> Insofar as these comprise signature effects of Romantic discourse, the framing conventions
                     of metaphorical lyric reference and the yearning for disembodiment come in for brilliant
                     restructuring at the hands of Dickinson (as opposed to the hands of a series of editors
                     and readers who then render her straight through their conventional praise). Yet the
                     argument of <em>Dickinson’s Misery</em> is held firmly in place by insisting that we deal exclusively with the worn normative
                     stereotypes of Romantic idealization: the pressure is kept squarely on a (very real)
                     disciplinary and popular mainstream, in an effective though repetitive fashion. Jackson’s
                     many allusions to Keats are all equally—and almost as problematically—subject to the
                     miserable ease of pre-interpretation as holds in the case of Emily Dickinson lyrics.

                  <p>But if the fundamental question of <em>Dickinson’s Misery</em> asks how we have come to receive truly outsider textual <em>productions</em> as canonical <em>poems</em> always to be read by a certain light, given the posthumous conditions of poetic fame
                     and the disciplinary professionalization of literature, then Jackson’s study bears
                     down powerfully on Romantic coordinates. In his 1979 essay “Shelley Disfigured,” Paul
                     de Man began by noting the resistance of the Romantic fragment to such monumentalization,
                     while at the same time he acknowledged up front that “Shelley’s last poem, is, as
                     is well known, a fragment that has been unearthed, edited, reconstructed and much
                     discussed”: i.e., it has served as the occasion of such a monumentalizing impulse
                     nevertheless, and (short of the text’s total loss) could hardly have eventuated in
                     anything else. Romanticism is thus the name for both a bracing contestatory failure
                     and that other kind of failure in which, as Barbara Johnson once remarked with wryness
                     and wisdom of deconstruction, “nothing fails like success”; Romanticism is associated
                     with that inevitable aftermath known as “interpretive labor.”

                     narrative available to analytical demystification. He sublimates the real content
                     of those overheard daily exchanges, to make from these materials a dynamic frictional
                     prosody that “breaks” sentence sound across the units of meter and line. He exploits
                     class privilege not only to record the slowly disintegrating culture of failing New
                     England farmers and itinerant country laborers, but also to reinvigorate the quotidian
                     life force of Anglo-American poetry. Aligned broadly with Yeats and early Poundian
                     Imagism’s disapproval of mere poetic ornament, Frost’s commitment to the “sound of
                     sense” pushes back against the perception of an idealizing, ersatz (i.e., “nonsense”)
                     musicality of many late Victorian poets he grew up admiring. Frost thus (just) saves
                     the classic poetic tropes of “voice” and “music” by exposing them to the contemporary
                     truth of their over-elaboration.

                     twenty to thirty years of rapid metabolization dating from the first translations

                     on balance more reflective than experimental. The philosophical side of our field
                     especially has a dauntingly large buy-in cost of past learning for aspiring young
                     scholars. Romantic poetic theory played a covertly key role in New Critical formalism;
                     (positively, from these critics’ point of view) it sponsored the organic element of
                     thinking about poetic structure, and (negatively) its sublime, or catachrestic, aspect
                     set off the limits of taste and a regulative sense of decorum. It was hot and cool

                     has been unhurriedly dying since 1989. In the coda to his 2011 book <em>Romantic Sobriety</em>, Orrin Wang persuasively maintains that Romanticism’s extravagant way of foregrounding
                     the spectral character of literary values and non-values appears now as the widespread
                     “embarrassment” of the humanities in broader institutional context. Yet, methodologically

                     to give our field its edge: “The discursive operations of [Romanticism] thus provide

                     Romanticism.”

                     teach aspects of such a concept, and its associated theoretical concerns, even though
                     the terminology may sound daunting. Because lyric poems are short and non-narrative,
                     students going back to those trained to do so by <em>The Well-Wrought Urn</em> have had a difficult time <em>not</em> making a microcosm of poetic form (which need not be “closed” rather than open)

                  claim that Elizabeth Bishop’s posthumously published lyrics in <em>Edgar Allan Poe and the Jukebox</em> aren’t even “poems” but “repudiated” objects. Vendler’s <em>New Republic</em> review has a clear theoretical application to debates about authorial intent and
                  the Foucauldian author function, but I find it even more resonant as an unwitting
                  rehearsal of how drastically a simple “genre” term can frame the field of available
                  meaning. A class exercise involving the contrast of Elizabeth Bishop’s and Felicia
                  Hemans’s <em>Casabianca</em> poems effectively relates the social and historical categories of lyric and narrative
                  poetry. This generic or even sub-generic divide has become—at its most flat and unproductive
                  extreme—a tacit judging standard of “good” and “bad” poems for many people in higher
                  education on both sides of the classroom; or, in Vendler's case, a test of poetry
                  that accedes to the status of a real “poem,” versus verse (!) which is denied that
                  status in such an exaggerative, indeed theological, way. Having two students energetically
                  read the absolutely sincere and yet morosely funny, two-column poem on the death of
                  Bishop’s toucan, “Uncle Sam” (collected in <em>Edgar Allan Poe</em>), will aid this lesson and lighten the group dynamic of a graduate seminar inclined
                  to seriousness. In future iterations of this Romantically-oriented graduate “Theory
                  of Lyric” course, I am looking forward to incorporating two new lessons on these issue
                  of poetic ontology and lyric address: I want to open up the syllabus more to avant-garde
                  and post-war, post-modernist lyric strategies, by looking at Frank O’Hara’s tongue-in-cheek
                  “Personism” Manifesto in the famous Donald Allen anthology; and to share George Oppen’s
                  “daybooks” and his unusually physical, accretive, method of revising his poetry, where
                  often new “versions” of a poem are marked by superimposed layers of planks and wire
                  and nails—not by an erasure.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">“Resistance” of course is a trigger word. It is worth recalling that, for Paul de
               Man, the important distinction wasn’t one between “theory” and “praxis” (though he
               feints in this direction when describing his failed <em>PMLA</em> commission at the start of “The Resistance to Theory,”) but rather the extent to
               which the “literariness” that became the “object of literary theory” (9) after Saussure
               is conceivably <em>not in itself subject to phenomenalization</em>. In his Foreward, Wlad Godzich evokes this staggering possibility—which de Man was
               insistently to call “materialism” in his last years—as the radical <em>matter of reading</em> and “the resistance of the material to the ideological overlay” (<em>Resistance to Theory</em> x-xi). De Man himself is typically clearer and yet more mysterious: “Literature is
               fiction not because it somehow refuses to acknowledge ‘reality,’ but because it is
               not <em>a priori</em> certain that language functions according to principles which are those, or which
               are <em>like</em> those, of the phenomenal world” (11); “The resistance to theory is a resistance to
               the use of language about language” (12). The pedagogical upshot, as de Man flatly
               levels it, is that “it is better to fail in teaching what should not be taught than
               to succeed in teaching what is not true” (4). Words to gird the soul and buckle the
               knees of any teacher.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               of the backbone of my current syllabus. (It can be assigned either at the very beginning
               or at the end of the semester, depending on the students’ collective experience and
               relationship to professionalization. The essential variable here is the professor’s
               choice whether to foreground a difficult, but table setting, reading or to position
               the <em>PMLA</em> issue more comfortably as late-semester review asking where we are “now.”) Among
               the other books I rotate through assigning in this course—whose syllabus is built
               from the outside in—from “secondary” criticism and theory back to the literary texts
               that feature in these accounts—are Brooks, <em>The Well-Wrought Urn</em>; Hosek and Parker, <em>Lyric Poetry: Beyond New Criticism</em> (I make .pdf copies of chapters from this scarce title); Benjamin, <em>The Writer of Modern Life</em>; Bloom, et al., <em>Deconstruction and Criticism</em>; Jackson, <em>Dickinson’s Misery</em>; Derrida, <em>Sovereignties in Question</em>; Johnson, <em>Persons and Things</em>; Stewart, <em>The Poet’s Freedom</em>.

         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">In their notorious essay “Against Theory” (1982), Walter Benn Michaels and Stephen
               Knapp exempt from their working definition of “theory” all “literary subjects with
               no direct bearing on the interpretation of individual works, such as narratology,
               stylistics, and prosody” (11). Introducing a recent collection on new directions in
               literary studies published in a 2010 issue of <em>PMLA</em>, Jonathan Culler similarly points out that poetics as a field of inquiry actually
               includes narratology within it. Thus poetics and narrative theory (or lyric poems
               and novels) need not be taught in isolation or confrontationally. See Jarvis (2009)
               and Wang for incisive and (in their own right) ambitiously “theoretical” responses
               by British Romanticists to the work of Benn Michaels in “Against Theory” and <em>The Shape of the Signifier</em>. Jackson deals with the implicitly enabling poetic terms of “Against Theory”—and
               deftly exposes Benn Michaels’s “smash and grab” style of argumentation—in <em>Dickinson’s Misery</em> 110-16. Her resonant claim, pace <em>both</em> New Critical/ deconstructive formalism and the neo-pragmatism of Knapp and Benn Michaels,
               is that generic form is intentional or has come to be treated as the final locus of
               intentionality. “[I]n order to interpret these lines [of “A Slumber Did My Spirit
               Seal”] we will immediately ask a double-sided question concerning the intentions of
               the author and the intentions of the form” (114). Marc Redfield offers a summary to
               date (fall 2012) of the astoundingly large field of theoretical inquiry around the
               eight lines of “A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Jackson, <em>Dickinson’s Misery</em> 6. Since he aimed so concertedly at success as a lyric poet, Frost’s oeuvre (to my
               knowledge) contains no examples as radical as any of the “poems” of Dickinson. But
               consider a relatively unexceptional poem like “The Pasture”, which was published both
               as a prologue to <em>North of Boston</em> in 1914, and as the prologue to Frost’s <em>Complete Poems</em> after his death. Famously and rather vapidly ending with the line, “I sha’n’t be
               long.—You come too,” this lyric offers a paradigm of abstracted non-specific address
               to the notional reader. Yet its concrete address is exceptionally intense, sexual
               and even tacitly suicidal. Biographer Lawrance Thompson situates “The Pasture” in
               a context of passionate address to Elinor, inviting her to remember “moments of lovemaking”
               (311). Just a few pages earlier in <em>Robert Frost: The Early Years</em>, Thompson had recounted a horrible memory of Lesley’s, in which her father woke her
               in the night and brought her down to the parlor, then—pointing a gun toward her mother
               and then toward himself—had asked her to choose: “‘Before morning, one of us will
               be dead’” (308).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">The recent film version of Keats’s life, Jane Campion's <em>Bright Star</em> (2009), in effect reverses the scenario of lyric reading by recasting so many famous
               poetics statements from the letters in a setting of intimate personal communication
               with Fanny Brawne (see Grant F. Scott’s scrupulously sharp review of the film in <em>Studies in Romanticism</em>). “I’ve come for my poetry class,” Fanny says to Charles Brown and to Keats upon
               entering the room, at the start of a key scene in the film in which Keats goes on
               to extemporize conversationally on the ideas of the chameleon poet that we know so
               well from the letters. As teachers of Romanticism and poetic theory, are we more in
               danger, then, of overriding and abstracting the intimacy of personal address such
               as Dickinson’s “letter poems” to Susan Gilbert? Or should we instead (or concomitantly)
               pay attention to the danger of over-personalizing and <em>only</em> reading biographically the often curiously neutral, <em>written</em>, spaces of literature and its genres?</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">See de Man (in Bloom, et al., <em>Deconstruction and Criticism</em>) 39; Johnson, “Nothing Fails Like Success”; Wang 163.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">However the matter of deconstruction is by no means done away with in framing the
               contrast between a symbolic/thematic register of lyric reading and what I here call
               the poem’s “material index” (i.e., an indexical versus an abstract model of reference).
               Virginia Jackson thus writes about the freezing and fixing effect that anthropomorphism
               has upon the lateral movement of the signifying chain—the most famous conclusion of
               Paul de Man’s “Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric” essay:<span class="quote">‘The ‘this’ that Dickinson offers Susan [Gilbert Dickinson] is not a vehicle for vicarious
                  feeling; it is, and is not, to recall de Man’s definition of lyric anthropomorphism,
                  ‘an identification on the level of substance,’ since it reverses the tropological
                  process de Man described when a figure ‘is no longer a proposition but a proper name,
                  as when the metamorphosis in Ovid’s stories culminates and halts in the singleness
                  of the proper name, Narcissus or Daphne or whatever.’ Dickinson did not write to Susan,
                  ‘This is my cheek,’ or ‘this is my sorrow,’ or ‘this is my death,’ or ‘this is you.’
                  She did not name the flower; by taking it from the woods, rather than killing it she
                  seems to have rescued it from being metamorphosed into other names—or other poems.
                  (<em>Dickinson’s Misery</em> 231-2).’</span>For the later de Man, there is indeed a material dimension that the paradigmatically
               “lyric” poem (and poet, and critic) represses. It is precisely the materiality of
               language, as a non-human (alternately divine or mechanical, but <em>not</em> human) and extra-intentional system. So while, from one perspective, Jackson’s procedure
               in this passage and throughout her book brilliantly and cagily outstrips de Man by
               taking further his own methodological insights, on another viewing Jackson’s approach
               seems to desire to go so far outside the “Romantic” self-reflective theoretical project
               of literature, that it is essentially <em>pre</em>-critical, or—better said—its source of power is pre-critical. Much as Jackson accuses
               de Man of doing (108), <em>Dickinson’s Misery</em> conducts a rational endgame according to the internal dynamics of lyric reading,
               but it also casts its own spell. Jackson retrieves the “open secret” of passion and
               traces a rich counterpoetics of queer relationship in her commentary on Susan Gilbert
               Dickinson’s 1860 “Private” message (“I send / you this”) and the earlier “deanthropomorphiz[ing]”
               lines Dickinson had sent to Susan in 1859—“Whose cheek is this?”—which rescue a real
               flower from poetic personification (“I found her—‘pleiad’—in the woods / And bore
               her safe away—” (230-1). But notice how Jackson’s passage lingers over the now missing,
               carbonized flower—“Although the flower to which ‘this’ pointed is no longer on the
               page for the word to point <em>to</em>, on the manuscript its imprint is still visible” (228)—whereas de Man’s “materiality”
               captures an aspect intrinsic to language. The strength of Jackson’s commentary hence
               repeatedly stems from her recognition of how Dickinson “folded other poetic genres”
               and signifying codes into her own texts “that often point away” quite radically from
               modern generic conventions and their interpretive violence (228). Symbolic reference
               is at once meta-critically and literally folded into, or cited, in a typical Dickinson
               archive “poem.” But success in anticipating this hegemonic kind of “readability” is
               not at all the vector of her poetry’s aspiration; if anything, it runs the opposite
               way. The danger of this reading, however, is that it risks making the pathos of losing
               Hegelian “sense-certainty” (the <em>this</em>; the flower rather than the conventional poetic sign; and, in <em>Dickinson’s Misery</em>, the “open secret” of lesbianism) a terminus for critical activity rather than its
               incitement. Hegel and, especially, Derrida are largely omitted to a cost from Jackson’s
               discussion.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">Almost uniquely among contemporary literary scholarship, Anne-Lise François’s work
               in <em>Open Secrets</em> allows for the possibility of such non-assertive utterance. Also (and not coincidentally)
               relevant here is Ann Banfield, who in <em>Unspeakable Sentences</em> once postulated of narrative theory that the conditions of print culture and writing
               are the enabling conditions of the modern subject: i.e., a third person “objective”
               instantiation of the subject, a “self,” whose form is not that of the morphological
               speaker (234). For Banfield, if “[t]he ingredients for represented speech and thought
               are thus given in universal grammar,” they <em>appear</em> historically rather than a priori. The horizon of the modern “self” becomes visible
               and operative only after the supersession of an exclusive “I”/ “you” (and “here,”
               “now”) communicative scene. It is the intrinsic <em>writtenness </em>of the modern third-person novel—which was historically unexampled even though poetry
               of course too had long been an artifact of writing—that supplies the kind of perspective
               first required to <em>have</em> and see our<em>selves</em>. I will quickly add, however, that this massive transition in the ideological and
               formal horizons of material print culture should not be misunderstood in a facile
               way as the supersession of lyric and its paradigmatic “I.” We are dealing not with
               a myth and an empirical reality, but with conjuration and cross-conjuration, a situation
               in which lyric pretenses themselves can become the other of a hegemonic order of narrative.
               Whereas the lyric poem (especially what W.R. Johnson calls “absolute lyric,” a post-Romantic
               written discourse now entirely beyond the social environments of a concrete addressee)
               persists in a spectral formal continuation of the unmediated speech-act scene, this
               formal ritual is already a displacement of the “constative” norm. What the ascendant
               “realist” novel and narrative theory do, nevertheless, is to promise the release of
               literature from the demand for <em>any</em> linkage to ritual.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               the poet’s utter unconsciousness of a listener. Poetry is feeling confessing itself

               male poets such as John Clare and Walter Scott, but also poetry by women. Labbe’s
               account reinforces the now-canonical teaching status in particular of Anna Letitia
               Barbauld, Felicia Hemans, Letitia Landon, Mary Robinson, and Charlotte Smith—though
               it is the later writers on this list, Hemans and L.E.L., who represent the “Poetess”

               or pseudo-scientific method in the poetic theory of Sidney Lanier. For Prins, importantly,
               the “musicality” or “harmony” of verse is not invoked as a generalizing “voice” metaphor,
               but as an estranging mechanical techne that points up a mediating system at work beyond

               with Jamaica Kincaid’s novel <em>Lucy</em> very rewarding. Partly due to the importance of Milton and (unacknowledged) Romantic

               handled the assigned topic in a compelling way by reality testing its force, and asked
               “what bad things happen to me if I avoid using this word?” See Jarvis, “How to Do
               Things with Tunes: Or, Prose Rhythm Today.” Following Boris Eikhenbaum, Jarvis invited
               those in attendance to embrace the Russian Formalist distinction, “we are not formalists,
               we are specifiers.” But would the conceptual cave-in that did not occur in Jarvis’s
               enlivening talk have been the vengeance of form and not the result of the intellectual
               configurations of those people present? Presumably, if form were a real category of
               experience and analysis rather than merely a badge to wear or discredit, then Jarvis
               was inviting its return from repression in the only way possible.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note23_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               poem in stone” (151). And Brooks’s aesthetics of paradox can be harmonizing <em>and</em> uncomforting: the urn is “deathless because it is lifeless” (157). This motif of
