            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">If a conversation between poetry and philosophy can be said to
                    have inhabited the language and literature of Romanticism since its
                    inception—and to have constituted the driving force of Romanticism-as-theory,
                    what happens to this conversation when it crosses linguistic and cultural
                    borders? What are the limits of the theory internal to Romanticism and of the
                    theories that Romanticism generates beyond the confines of an increasingly
                    monophone globalism? This paper engages with such questions by presenting and
                    reflecting on passages of textual and cultural dissensus—à propos the specific
                    difficulty of translating the very signifiers, “sense” and the “senses”—in the
                    reading of “Tintern Abbey” in a non-Western context. It suggests that such sites
                    of untranslatability may serve precisely as new grounds for restarting
                    Romanticism’s theoretical potential in our contemporary global context of
                    connected yet heterogeneous cultural traditions.</p>

                <p> Along with “nature” and “imagination,” “sense” is a keyword in Romantic poetry
                    and poetics that is notoriously slippery and equivocal. William Empson makes it
                    one of his specimen terms of ambiguity in <title level="m">The Structure of
                        Complex Words</title>, writing in the chapter “Sense in <title level="m">The
                        Prelude</title>” that the “apparently flat little word <emph>sense</emph>
                    .&#160;.&#160;. comes into practically all the great passages of <title
                        level="m">Tintern Abbey</title> and <title level="m">The Prelude</title> on
                    the mind’s relation to Nature .&#160;.&#160;.. [W]hether or not Wordsworth is
                    drawing on Hartley or Coleridge, his whole position depends on some rather
                    undeveloped theory about how the mind interprets what it gets from the senses”
                        (289).<note place="foot">Thanks to Sam Baker for reminding me of Empson’s
                        essay in a conversation at NASSR 2013.</note> “Sense,” that apparently flat
                    little word, marks a <foreign>locus classicus</foreign> where Romantic poetry
                    reflects on its own means and—in however undeveloped a way—gets theoretical.</p>
                <p> Slippery enough in English, “sense” gets even slipperier in crossing over to
                    another language, and then back again. I will recount in this essay a surprising
                    and memorable moment in the spring of 2013 when I taught the warhorse text
                    “Tintern Abbey” to a class of undergraduates in Taiwan. Insofar as “sense” in
                    Wordsworth veers towards equivocation rather than stable signification, its use
                    suggests, paradoxically, a crisis of sense in its primary definition in
                    Webster’s as “a meaning conveyed or intended”; it marks, rather, the opening up
                    of a disjunction within sense itself that leads dialectically, through the
                    mind’s ongoing relationship with the senses, to another sense. I would like to
                    designate this equivocation within “sense” itself with the shorthand
                    “dissensus,” for reasons I will elaborate later as I recount how dissensus took
                    place not just in one but two registers in our class on “Tintern Abbey” and
                    reflect on how that event may serve as the occasion, again, for getting
                    theoretical.</p>
                <p> First, some information to set the scene. There were 26 students in the class,
                    all junior or senior concentrators in the Department of Foreign Languages and
                    Literature at National Tsing Hua University, a public research university in
                    Taiwan. Nearly all students who take classes in the Department were born and
                    raised in Taiwan, with some from other Sinophone areas (Hong Kong and Macau, a
                    few exchange students from China) and a smattering from other parts of the
                    world, e.g., Southeast Asia and Central America, where Taiwanese government
                    scholarships are available. The students have a high level of proficiency in
                    English, a mandatory subject in the public school system beginning in the fifth
                    grade. As Tsing Hua is one of the most competitive universities, the students
                    typically graduated at the top of their high school classes. Their ability to
                    follow difficult arguments and write well-reasoned prose reflects the benefits
                    of a rigorous math and science high school education (although many of them also
                    spend the first year or two at university recovering from the grueling aspects
                    of that same education). Concentrators in Foreign Languages and Literature at
                    the university are required to learn a second foreign language besides English,
                    but literature courses have been taught for some time almost exclusively with
                    readings in English or English translation, the default and de facto foreign
                        <foreign>lingua franca</foreign> in Taiwan—and globally. Since arriving at
                    Tsing Hua in 2012, I’ve taught, for instance, Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and
                    Charlotte Smith in English and Rousseau, Herder, Goethe, and Hoffmann in English
                    translation. I conduct lectures and discussion in English but, sharing with the
                    students a common language and much of a common culture, I speak Mandarin
                    whenever points seem to call for translation or, on the contrary, seem
                    particularly untranslatable. My students give presentations in English, write
                    their papers in English, and speak English in discussions, but I ask them to
                    participate in Mandarin if particular insights cannot find expression in another
                    tongue.</p>
                <p> It’s a challenge teaching Romanticism beyond the Anglophone context. To begin
                    with, the students simply need more time to comprehend the texts by looking up
                    words and figuring out syntax. One assigns less. On another level, while the
                    students are curious about texts of the period and culture in question, they
                    have had less prior contact, through sheer osmosis, with, say, the sublime or
                    prophetic visionariness, given however secular a turn, as elements of a living
                    tradition. The hermeneutic circle that literary reading and interpretation by
                    and large entails intersects with other linguistic-cultural circles here, giving
                    rise to alternate geometries. At the beginning of a semester, students will have
                    heard of and read specific works by individual Romantic-era writers: <title
                        level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> comes up often, and Rousseau as the
                    author of the <title level="m">Social Contract</title>, a text they know from
                    high school to be fundamental to the history of modern political thought and,
                    hence, a history in which they are implicated. Thanks to <title level="m"
                        >Twilight</title> and <title level="m">Harry Potter,</title> they have had
                    previous exposure to the Gothic. On the whole, I have had to provide a lot more
                    information about historical context and cultural background than I have had to
                    in North American classrooms. At the same time, I have needed to be more careful
                        <emph>not</emph> to provide too much historical narrative—either regarding
                    Romanticism’s position in Western literary, cultural, and intellectual history
                    or the role of the late eighteenth-, early nineteenth-century moment in the West
                    in contemporary social scientific theories of globalization.<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn2" n="2">The world-systems theory of sociologist Immanuel

                        Pascale Casanova, and Eric Hayot. See Wallerstein’s multi-volume <title

                    modulate my editorial capacity as pedagogue in order to take care that students
                    have enough room to discover the lessons of Romantic poetry and poetics first
                        <emph>as</emph> lessons in poetry and poetics that may overlap at points
                    with, and remain in other ways alien to, their habitual ways of experiencing
                    language, culture, history, and the world. </p>
                <p> In the spring 2013 class, the students came to “Tintern Abbey” after having
                    experienced the “gentle shock of mild surprise” in reading “The Boy of
                    Winander,” reckoned with the narrator’s intrusion in “Simon Lee,” reflected on
                    what it means to “let Nature be your teacher,” and grappled with the definitions
                    of poetry and the poet in “Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>.”
                    For all students, whatever their first language, “Tintern Abbey” is a difficult
                    poem that works on multiple levels. My plan that day was to guide the students
                    through the poem by beginning with the concrete situation of the Wordsworthian
                    speaker, addressing aspects of the poem’s form and structure, engaging with
                    conceptual intricacies in Wordsworth’s reflection on the conditions of his own
                    creativity, and then discussing the implications of his address to Dorothy. We
                    started with the title and the genre of the loco-descriptive poem. Noting how
                    the poem marks Wordsworth’s turn to autobiography, we talked about how the poet
                    uses the particular landscape as a measure to chart and reflect on his own
                    growth. To draw them into the experience of the poem, I asked them to think
                    about whether there was a particular landscape that might serve each of them as
                    an analogous reference point. The class was by now focused, engaged, and poised
                    to follow Wordsworth’s ruminations more closely. </p>
                <p> I asked for a volunteer to read the first stanza aloud. We considered
                    Wordsworth’s use of blank verse to simulate everyday speech, enjambment to
                    create an effect of fluidity, and repetition to accentuate how long the five
                    years felt and to stress the importance of revisitation. And I asked them to pay
                    attention to the transitions in this stanza between what takes place in
                    Wordsworth’s mind to what he perceives by eye and ear—in preparation for the
                    multiple transitions and reflections thereon that would follow in the rest of
                    the poem. If the first stanza offers the description of a landscape phenomenally
                    available in the present to Wordsworth, as it had been, <foreign>mutatis
                        mutandis</foreign>, five years ago, the second turns to how that landscape
                    was internalized as a “picture of the mind” during the intervening time. This
                    move from contemplation of the external landscape to contemplation of the
                    internal served as the occasion for broaching the subject of how the poem
                    entertains epistemological questions about the relationship between the mind and
                    the senses.</p>
                <p> In asking students how Wordsworth begins in the next stanza to reflect on the
                    function of sense or sensory experience in his own growth as poet, I was puzzled
                    to find at first a semantic confusion of the “sensory” with the “sensational” or
                    “sensationalist.” One student thought that, in reflecting on what he was like
                    “when first/ I came among these hills,” Wordsworth was criticizing an earlier,
                    youthful susceptibility to the kind of sensationalism involved in the “craving
                    for extraordinary incident, which the rapid communication of intelligence hourly
                    gratifies” that we had talked about the previous week in the <title level="m"
                        >Preface</title>. According to her view, Wordsworth would then be advocating
                    a turn away from such sensationalism towards a tranquil mood in which one may be
                    equipped to hear the “still, sad music of humanity.” Several other students
                    chimed in to agree with her. While such a reading was valuable and insightful in
                    discerning an opposition between the contemplative individual and an
                    increasingly sensationalist mass culture on a socio-historical dimension, I
                    wanted to make sure they were also able to recognize the epistemological stakes
                    of the poem. </p>
                <p> I started to underline to them Wordsworth’s references to eye and ear and,
                    beyond the bodily eye, to the “eye made quiet by the power/ Of harmony”; and I
                    pointed out the ambiguity of the word “sense” as it recurs in lines 63-4, 96-7,
                    and 109-110 to designate moments in a process of interplay between the mind and
                    the senses. In exploring the relationship between the mind and the senses,
                    Wordsworth, I explained, was participating through poetry in a philosophical
                    conversation that involved, in his contemporary context, empiricist and
                    associationist iterations; he was exploring questions that remain vitally
                    relevant today, e.g., in classes in analytic and Continental philosophy just
                    down the hall. One could see ethical implications in his exploration of these
                    questions in his extension of his claims regarding himself to Dorothy at the end
                    while proposing “Nature” as basis for a <foreign>sensus communis</foreign>.</p>
                <p> I had the instinct to bring up at this point, for annotative purposes, the
                    etymology of the phrase for the “senses” in Chinese, <foreign>wuguan</foreign>.
                    Literally, the two characters constituting <foreign>wuguan</foreign> mean the
                    “five officials” or “five courtiers,” in relation to which
                        <foreign>xin</foreign>—the word in classical Chinese that denotes “heart”
                    and “mind” as well as “will” or “volition”—is configured as the “sovereign,”
                        <foreign>jun</foreign>. (In contemporary Chinese, <foreign>xin</foreign>
                    still has this cluster of connotations, but “mind” can be translated also by
                    words imported since the late nineteenth century from European and English
                    sources designating “cognition” and “consciousness.”) The earliest record of
                    this metaphor, which establishes an analogy between the human body and the body
                    politic, occurs in the Han Dynasty <title level="m">Yellow Emperor’s Classic of
                        Internal Medicine</title>, from the Warring States or early Han periods,
                    from the fifth century BCE to 220 CE.<note place="foot">Thanks to Yuyu Cheng for

                    as “will” or “volition,” <foreign>xin</foreign> figures as the locus of both the
                    emotional and the cognitive mental faculties that, as “sovereign,” organize and
                    govern the senses.<note place="foot">See Andrew Plaks’s essay,
                            “<foreign>Xin</foreign> as the Seat of the Emotions in Confucian

                    in <foreign>xin</foreign> stands in contrast to their separation into “mind”
                    (descended from the Greek <foreign>nous</foreign>) as figure for cognition and
                    “heart” as figure for feelings in European philosophical discourse and
                    reiterated in the very separation of “mind” and “heart” Wordsworth makes in
                    “Tintern Abbey.” </p>
                <p> This philological intervention proved illuminating to the students. Eyes lit up.
                    “Aha!” and “that’s so cool!” and “I never knew that!” and other expressions of
                    wonder were heard. We continued talking about the relationship between “mind”
                    and “the senses” in the rest of the poem, as well as their relationship, in
                    turn, to “sensations,” “feelings,” and “affections”—all associated with the
                    “heart.” The discussion went more smoothly for the rest of the class, with
                    greater appreciation of the multiple dimensions of the poem—including the
                    epistemological, the autobiographical, the ethical, and the socio-historical—and
                    how they might relate to each other. We did not return in that class to talking
                    about the moment in which I introduced the comment concerning the configuration
                    of mind/heart and the senses in Chinese language and discourse. Clearly, though,
                    it had the effect of opening up channels of understanding; indeed, it became a
                    reference point for students when they talked about the course later in the
                    semester.</p>
                <p> As their teacher, I offer a few thoughts about the significance of this moment.
                    I myself was surprised to witness their surprise in discovering the metaphor
                    implicit in their casual, everyday use of the term <foreign>wuguan</foreign> for
                    senses. In studying a literature foreign to them, they had taken their own
                    language for granted. An estrangement from their own language occurred that
                    revealed both the history of particular phrases as well as the historicity and
                    cultural specificity of these phrases. This estrangement occurred in relation to
                    a certain opacity in the Wordsworthian text for them, which was then rendered
                    discussable for them in its historical and cultural specificity. They discovered
                    also at this point the basic analogy between the human body and the body politic
                    that subtends both the Wordsworthian configuration of the mind and the senses,
                    on the one hand, <emph>and</emph> the traditional Chinese configuration of
                        <foreign>xin</foreign> or mind/heart as sovereign in relation to the senses,
                    on the other. While discovering this common analogy, they also discovered at the
                    same time two significantly different configurations. In short, they learned a
                    lesson about the historicity of language and the incommensurability of languages
                    and traditions; they learned a lesson about how metaphor structures and, in this
                    case, straddles philosophical, physiological, and socio-political discourses;
                    and they learned that the same metaphor may be troped differently, with profound
                    philosophical and cultural implications.</p>
                <p> “Sense” is the word that tripped them. As Empson notes, Wordsworth uses it most
                    often at the end of a line and frequently “in the form ‘a sense of
                    .&#160;.&#160;.,’ which the Oxford English Dictionary explains as ‘not by direct
                    perception but more or less vaguely or instinctively’” (289). In “Tintern
                    Abbey,” Wordsworth writes: <quote><lg>
                            <l> While here I stand, not only with the sense</l>
                            <l> Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts</l>
                            <l> That in this moment there is life and food </l>
                            <l> For future years. (63-6)</l>
                        </lg></quote> In lines 96-7, he speaks of feeling “a sense sublime/ Of
                    something far more deeply interfused.” And, at the climactic moment in the poem,
                    he proclaims how he is <quote><lg>
                            <l rendition="#indent2"> well pleased to recognize</l>
                            <l>In nature and the language of the sense,</l>
                            <l>The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,</l>
                            <l>The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul</l>
                            <l>Of all my moral being. (108-12)</l>
                        </lg></quote> “Sense” appears pleasingly each time as an interfusing of what
                    the eye and ear half create and what perceive, a combination of the prior sense
                    and the senses that becomes available to re-cognition. “Sense” plays a mediating
                    function between cognition and perception, coordinating the relationship between
                    the mind and the senses and bringing them into community with one another. The
                    very word “sense” marks, ironically, the instability of this community of the
                    mind and the senses, a community that is predicated on a fundamental dissensus
                    between parts that conjoin and disjoin in a continuous process. Making sense of
                    “sense” in Wordsworth in English involves registering the disjunction or
                    dissensus between mind and the senses that the word marks, a dissensus that
                    activates the process of re-organization. In making sense of “sense” in
                    Wordsworth through the medium of another language, the class had to pause to
                    register yet another dissensus in reckoning with different configurations of
                    mind or <foreign>xin</foreign>, “mind/heart,” and the senses, with each
                    configuration defining an operative epistemic disposition.</p>
                <p> “Tintern Abbey” is a warhorse text that can be used to demonstrate commonplaces
                    long considered definitive of Romanticism: the turn to nature, the emphasis on
                    subjectivity, the attentiveness to mental processes, the allegorization by
                    poetry of its own conditions of possibility. Since New Historicist readings by
                    Marjorie Levinson and Kenneth Johnston, it has often been resituated in
                    materialist contexts in relation to historical circumstances it may be taken to
                    bracket out. It can be taught alongside “Frost at Midnight” or put into dialogue
                    with “Beachy Head.” No matter what one does with it, the poem’s critical
                    reflection on its own poetics and performance of its own theory make it ever
                    relevant to thinking about the relationship between Romanticism and literary
                    theory.</p>
                <p> The engagement with the poem and its theory of poetic creativity occasioned in
                    my students a critical reflection on their own habitual ways of thinking. What
                    came to my aid in facilitating this encounter was an etymology about a set of
                    terms no less consequential in Chinese as their epistemological counterparts in
                    English. For this etymology, I have Chinese philological scholarship to thank
                    for its source documentation. The annotation I provided showed obviously a point
                    of untranslatability but, beyond that, introduced students to both intra- and
                    cross-cultural depths and dimensions that amplify and render more capacious the
                    experience of reading.</p>
                <p> The relationship between Romanticism and literary theory can be said to begin in
                    the late eighteenth century with texts in philosophical aesthetics or poetics
                    such as the <title level="m">Critique of Judgment</title>, the <title level="m"
                        >Letters on Aesthetic Education</title>, the <title level="m"
                        >Athenäum</title> fragments, “The Defense of Poetry,” among others, which
                    variously attempt to reflect on, define, and project the conditions of literary
                    and aesthetic experience for a new era. This relationship is intertwined further
                    with the secular, historicizing textual practices ranging from biblical
                    hermeneutics to classical studies to Sanskritology and Sinology that may be
                    described by the umbrella term, “philology.” Philology designates a variety of
                    approaches to texts, ranging from positivist scholarship to secularized
                    messianic reading, with all approaches distinguishing the modernity of their
                    orientation to the premodern or canonical in historicist terms. The Western
                    study of canonical traditions in other parts of the world is complicated further
                    by its dovetailing with heterogeneous traditions of textual commentary.</p>
                <p> Philology would seem to inhabit the very relationship between Romanticism and
                    literary theory. In his 1982 essay “The Return to Philology” Paul de Man even
                    describes the then-recent turn to theory in literary studies that took place
                    through the field of Romanticism as inherently “a return to philology, to an
                    examination of the structure of language prior to the meaning it produces” (24).
                    He defines philology here not as the study of any particular set of texts but in
                    terms of a “mere reading” that, “prior to any theory, would appear deeply
                    subversive to those who think of the teaching of literature as a substitute for
                    the teaching of theology, ethics, psychology, or intellectual history” (24).
                    Such mere or close reading he finds common in critics and theorists as different
                    as Reuben Brower, Foucault, and Derrida. Beyond his contemporaries, De Man
                    refers to a critical tradition that includes, notably, Nietzsche as philologist.
                    What De Man advocates in the title of his essay is not so much a return to the
                    positivist philological scholarship of the nineteenth century that amassed
                    material for the teaching of literature as the teaching of theology, ethics,
                    psychology, or intellectual history but to philology as a practice of
                    attentiveness to language as medium that radically structures and produces
                    meaning. The essay inscribes, furthermore, its own call for a turn or return to
                    philology in a complex genealogy that goes back to the modern definition of
                    aesthetics, since Baumgarten, as a separate branch of Western philosophy in the
                    eighteenth century. De Man aims to recover a fundamental practice underlying the
                    network of cultural-historical narratives bound up with aesthetics since the
                    eighteenth century that traverses Romanticism as field of study.</p>
                <p> In 2004, Edward Said would define philology in deliberate, marked contrast to De
                    Man in an essay he titled likewise, “The Return to Philology.” Stressing the
                    importance of aspects of a textual practice he had criticized vociferously and
                    generally in the form of Near Eastern scholarship in <title level="m"
                        >Orientalism</title>, Said advocates a philology that he characterizes as
                    attentive to “conventions, semantic frameworks, and social or even political
                    communities operating as practical constraints” on utterance (69). He cites
                    examples from three philological traditions: the Arabic-Islamic tradition of
                    Koran scholarship, the philological-hermeneutic scholarship of Spitzer and
                    Auerbach, and the American pragmatist approach of Emerson and Richard Poirier. I
                    cannot pursue within the parameters of this essay the rich implications of the
                    differences between De Man and Said’s conceptions of philology and the critical
                    genealogies they respectively adumbrate. Suffice it to say here that Said points
                    in 2004 to a need that persists twelve years later in literary studies to return to
                    philology as part of an acknowledgment of and reckoning with the plurality and
                    heterogeneity of linguistic and textual traditions in the world. The dialogue
                    between De Man and Said is crucial to thinking the contours of such a return.
                    And such a return is crucial to redefining why Romanticism matters in complex
                    and pluralistic terms and ways that give scandal—and pause—to the pace of an
                    Anglophone globalism.</p>
