               <p rend="noCount">Romantic texts have repeatedly played important roles in the
                    development of what we call literary theory. For instance, all of the essays
                    collected in the 1979 <emph>Deconstruction and Criticism</emph> volume, which
                    did so much to announce deconstruction in the United States, were originally

                    Romanticists have often been hired as literary theorists, and so the teaching of
                    Romanticism has frequently been paired with the teaching of literary theory. For

                  <p>Romantic texts have repeatedly played important roles in the development of what
                    we call literary theory. For instance, all of the essays collected in the 1979
                        <title level="m">Deconstruction and Criticism</title> volume, which did so

                    asked contributors to reflect on the ways they integrate literary theory into
                    their teaching of Romanticism and to reflect on the continued importance of
                    literary theory to Romanticism and the work of Romanticists. I did not define

                    literary theory alter our ideas of both?</p>
                  <p> Contributors received their PhDs from departments well known for getting
                    theoretical (Chicago, Virginia, UC Irvine, and Yale (x2)) and now teach at a
                    range of institutions, some private, some public, some in the United States,
                    some abroad. In selecting contributors I was self-consciously interested in
                    hearing from those who received their PhD after the turn of the century, after
                    the publication of the first edition of the <title level="m">Norton Anthology of
                        Theory and Criticism</title> (2001) and so after literary theory courses had
                    become a regular part of departmental curricula. The range of responses tells us
                    much not only about prevailing definitions of Romanticism and literary theory
                    but also about collective goals for the teaching of literature today.</p>
                  <p>To say that contributors received the PhD after the 2001 publication of the
                        <title level="m">Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism </title>is also to
                    say that they entered the profession after the most violent decades of the
                    culture wars, when labels for theoretical positions became hardened (one
                    strategy among many, one might say, for resisting theory). In reading the essays
                    I was struck by the degree to which all contributors resist dogmatic claims. In
                    fact, the essays demonstrate a commitment not to theory per se, and certainly
                    not to theory as a lens through which to view the literary object, but to
                    discovering texts (both “theoretical” and “Romantic”) together and anew.
                    Collectively, contributors are more interested in what works, which texts when
                    paired draw from each other new interpretations and new insights, than in
                    claiming allegiance with any particular theoretical position. As Andrew Warren
                    writes, “I find theory most useful, both in my own thinking and in the
                    classroom, when it creates the right kinds of resistances to texts and ideas I
                    have been taking for granted.” </p>
                  <p>Metonymy and resistance play an important role in several essays in the volume.
                    In his contribution, David Sigler describes teaching Wordsworth’s “Steamboats,
                    Viaducts, and Railways” <emph>alongside</emph> a chapter from George Bataille’s
                        <title level="m">Theory of Religion</title>, entitled “The Rise of
                    Industry.” Reading Bataille alongside Wordsworth is meant to challenge the
                    available readings of Wordsworth; but similarly, reading Wordsworth alongside
                    Bataille is meant to challenge students’ interpretations of Bataille. The
                    theoretical text does not explain the literary one; but neither does the
                    literary text explain the theoretical one. Ideally, both texts emerge changed
                    after the pedagogical encounter; such is the point, suggests Sigler, of placing
                    the texts side by side. In her teaching, Anahid Nersessian self-consciously
                    embraces the aleatory, producing the chance for unforeseen confluences between
                    Romantic and theoretical texts: <quote>One of my goals is to push students
                        toward a non-instrumental relationship to criticism . . . I
                        believe we are all fatigued by studies promising to give an interpretation
                        of some poem or novel through one “angle” at a time, Morris Zapp-style. This
                        sort of pedantic relationship to theory, or to the more constrained genre of
                        criticism, is one current students should consider it their historical
                        privilege to reject.</quote> In many of the essays collected here, “theory”
                    describes less a critical position than a shared openness to discovering texts
                    together in new constellations of reference and signification. For some, this
                    commitment to discovery might seem yet another strategy for resisting theory, as
                    theory recedes from critical view (especially when so explicitly replaced by
                    “method” in Nersessian’s essay). For others, such a commitment to discovering
                    texts in constellations of reference and signification may simply be one theoretical position
                    among many, if unclaimed.</p>
                  <p>What is meant by “theory” here, other than a loose set of texts and proper names?
                    In “Nothing Fails Like Success,” Barbara Johnson concludes that <quote>if the
                        deconstructive impulse is to retain its vital, subversive power, we must
                        . . . become ignorant of it again and again. It is only by
                        forgetting what we know how to do, by setting aside the thoughts that have
                        most changed us, that those thoughts and that knowledge can go on making
                        accessible to us the surprise of an otherness we can only encounter in the
                        moment of suddenly discovering we are ignorant of it. (16)</quote> Efforts
                    to transform deconstruction into a set of rule bound procedures must be
                    resisted, argues Johnson. Collectively, it seems to me, the essays in <title level="j">Teaching Romanticism and Literary Theory</title> explore a similar
                    paradox with respect to theory (deconstruction has often been code for theory).
                    Perhaps we must become ignorant of theory too, again and again, if the term is
                    to retain vital and subversive force, especially as each “theory” (formalism,
                    deconstruction, Marxism, feminism, etc.) is reduced to a discrete set of
                    critical procedures. As the courses described in contributions to this volume
                    show, “forgetting theory” does not mean not reading texts we call theoretical.
                    It may just mean reading theory as literature, as still capable of producing
                    surprise. The essays collected here share a commitment to surprise (both for
                    students and teachers). “Teaching,” then, is not the transmission of information
                    but a shared encounter with texts. </p>
                  <p>Essays by Emily Sun and Eric Lindstrom stage this question about the literariness
                    of theory most explicitly. Sun does not place importance on teaching
                    Wordsworth’s poem alongside a theoretical text, though the fact that Sun has
                    read William Empson, Paul de Man, and Edward Said certainly informs her class
                    design and preparation. Sun’s interest is in discovering the words of
                    Wordsworth’s poem anew and in competing contexts. Teaching in English in Taiwan,
                    Sun explains how the attempt to read Wordsworth’s “sense” in “Tintern Abbey”
                    affected her students’ understanding of the Chinese phrase for senses,
                        <foreign>wuguan</foreign>. Drawing on de Man’s “The Return to Philology” Sun
                    reminds us that theory emerges from the deceptively simple (or perhaps
                    deceptively difficult?) effort to read just what is on the page. Pairing
                    literary and theoretical texts may, likewise, demonstrate a desire to cut
                    through received or practiced opinion and, however impossible an effort, get to
                    the words themselves and the questions they raise. In his contribution, Eric
                    Lindstrom reminds readers that literature (or the literary) is one name among
                    many for the gap between object and interpretation, between theory and
                    method.</p>
                  <p>All five essays move past “discovering” literary theoretical pronouncements
                    buried within Romantic texts, as if one buried a bone just so one could have the
                    pleasure of digging it up again. In response to definitions of Romanticism
                    aligned with an aesthetic purposelessness, Warren in “The Uses and Abuses of
                    Theory (for Life)” moves from Alain Badiou back to German Idealism to ask how
                    Romanticism can or should be instrumentalized to get students to think
                    differently about our most familiar definitions of Romanticism. In “The Intimacy
                    of Infrastructure: Teaching Wordsworth with Bataille,” Sigler shows how reading
                    Bataille alongside Wordsworth allows Wordsworth’s nuanced thinking about
                    capitalist ideology in a poem like “Steamboats, Viaducts, and Railways” to
                    emerge: “When read in combination, Bataille and Wordsworth show how poetic
                    devices present an occasion for radically rethinking subjectivity in an
                    industrial world.” In “Dissensus in Two Registers: Tintern Abbey in Taiwan,” Sun
                    shows the continued importance of philology to our thinking about Romantic poems
                    in historical and contemporary cultural contexts. Sun describes the experience
                    of teaching Wordsworth in Taiwan and demonstrates the continued importance of
                    poetry to “getting theoretical,” as Sun’s Taiwanese students found themselves
                    estranged from their own language and culture by virtue of the encounter with
                    Wordsworth’s poem. Lindstrom simultaneously moves us beyond the traditional
                    canon of British Romanticism to the writing of Robert Frost and moves us back to
                    thinking about the priority of poetry and poetic thinking, not only to our
                    conceptions of Romanticism but also to literary theory. Lindstrom reminds us
                    that how we read is too often preconditioned by our assumptions about what we
                    are reading, and teaching Romanticism and literary theory stretches those
                    assumptions about what makes a lyric poem or a theoretical text. Nersessian
                    calls for thinking of Romanticism not as theory but as method: “replacing theory
                    with method means making Romanticism useful.” Nersessian challenges readers to
                    think about how encounters between Romanticism and literary theory enable new
                    forms of poetic making. With tremendous style and intellectual rigor, each of
                    these short essays shows how discovering Romantic and literary theoretical texts
                    together allows one to discover these texts anew. </p>

               <p rend="noCount">This piece relates some strategies for creating a generative
                    tension between theory and romanticism in the classroom. Its examples are
                    Badiou's strident critiques of romanticism as the "philosopheme" of historicism
                    and Kant's imbrication of "theory" and "practice." At stake more broadly is the
                    problematic notion of use (and misuse), so common in recent discussions about
                    the humanities: how to "use" literature—which literature, or which theory, and
                    for what ends.</p>

                  <head>Introduction – Resistances to “the Theory Generation”</head>
                  <p>In a recent and widely read <title level="j">n+1</title> piece, Nicholas
                        Dames reflects on what happened when a generation of writers raised on
                        theory began asking questions about how theory shaped them, as both writers
                        and human beings. In those works (by Franzen, Eugenides, Egan, Moore, Cole,
                        etc.) <quote>Theory is judged from within the forms it tried to dismantle
                            (psychological realism; the bildungsroman), by criteria Theory could
                            only recognize as regressive or naïve: What kind of a person does Theory
                            make? What did it once mean to have read theorists? What does it mean
                            now? How does Theory help you hold a job? Deal with lovers, children,
                            bosses, and parents?<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">Nicholas
                                Dames, “The Theory Generation,” <title level="j">n+1</title>, 24
                                October 2012:
                            http://nplusonemag.com/the-theory-generation</note>
                     </quote> In Dames’s
                        account, Theory, which he capitalizes throughout, becomes a kind of unified
                        thing or shared experience, and “novelistic realism” becomes the form with
                        which to best investigate it. Dames is careful not to caricature that
                        realism, just as he resists caricaturing Theory. Realism for him is
                        capacious, both in the forms it takes and the ideas it swallows; <title level="m">Middlemarch</title> obviously counts as a realist novel of
                        ideas, but so do <title level="m">Tristram Shandy</title>, <title level="m">JR</title>, and <title level="m">The Crying of Lot 49</title>. For
                        Dames, the question is: can realism, or rather today’s realism, swallow
                        theory? Is it, in Dames’s words, one of realism’s Others?</p>
                  <p> Absent from Dames’s narrative is another one of realism’s Others,
                        Romanticism. If it shows up at all, it does so under the guise of “that most
                        antique of realist modes,” the bildungsroman. In a related study, Judith
                        Ryan’s <title level="m">The Novel After Theory</title>, Romanticism is
                        similarly a kind of ur-stage of Theory. And Theory itself must in turn be
                        integrated into the concreteness of a novel’s scenes and story.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">See, e.g., Ryan’s description of how
                            Marilynne Robinson’s <title level="m">Housekeeping </title>both reenacts
                            the <title level="m">Prelude</title>’s boat-stealing scene, but also
                            “burst[s] the bounds of Romanticism” by moving closer to Derrida and
                                <foreign>bricolage</foreign>. What exactly Romanticism’s “bounds”
                            are, or whether they don’t extend to Derrida, or whether Romanticism is
                            something “bounded” at all, remains undiscussed. Ryan, 65.</note> Given
                        the contemporary writers who interest Dames and Ryan, it makes sense that
                        Romanticism would be off the menu. But I think their approaches raise larger
                        questions about a constellation of topics—Realism, Romanticism, Theory,
                        History, Form, and Narrative—that have recently been re-opened in our field.
                        I have in mind, among other things, Tilottama Rajan’s strong defense of
                        Romantic “narrativity” (a kind of working Theory) against what she sees as
                        the normalizing influence of the “(Victorian) Novel.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">Rajan, <title level="m">Romantic Narrative: Shelley,
                                Hays, Godwin, Wollstonecraft</title> (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP,
                            2010), xii.</note> As an institution or practice of reading, the Novel’s
                        impact, for Rajan, happens in the real world. It shapes disciplinary
                        boundaries, such as the ongoing collapse of Romantic and Victorian into
                        Nineteenth-Century Studies, and it conditions our expectations of people and
                        organizations.</p>
                  <p>At stake in all of these diverse accounts is the problematic notion of use.
                        “Use” (and “misuse”) resonates with a recurring theme in recent discussions
                        of the humanities: how to use literature—which literature, or which theory,
                        and for what ends. The question seems particularly pressing for Romanticism,
                        which consistently resists an idea of instrumentality more amenable, one
                        would think, to other periods or modes. Because of that resistance
                        Romanticism becomes a kind of paradigm of literary studies more generally.
                        So we now ask how and whether Romanticism—or Romantic texts, or Romantic
                        reading practices, or even Romantic ways of being with the world—can or
                        should be instrumentalized. Late in his essay Dames brings up that very
                        question with respect to the related problem of teaching: “what does Theory
                        do for its former students in these novels?” His answer is as surprising as
                        it is unsettling: “Theory, it turns out, is less intellectually powerful
                        than emotionally useful; it habituates you to the anomic, precarious
                        existence you were destined to lead in any case.” Of course, this isn’t
                        exactly Dames’s answer, nor (God forbid) my own. It is the novelists’, and it sounds
                        perversely marketable to critics of the usefulness of the humanities. Not to
                        show the fly the way out of the flybottle but to model its twists and turns
                        and make it livable. Theory in this reading is mimetic or therapeutic—a
                        puzzling position for something often defined by its resistance to
                        representation or its unsettling of habit. </p>
                  <p>Problematic, too, seems the novelists’ treatment of emotion or affect in
                        Dames’s account, a topic explored and complicated by recent work in
                        Romanticism (often by Romanticists the same age as Dames’s novelists, a very
                        different “Theory Generation”). Speaking of Rei Terada’s <title level="m">Feeling in Theory</title> in his own <title level="m">Blake’s
                            Agitation: Criticism and the Emotions</title>, Steven Goldsmith explores
                        the way in which emotion exceeds subjectivity. “The real strangeness of
                        emotion’s subjectlessness,” he writes, “rubs critically against the
                        ideological fullness and familiarity of identity-affirming
                        experience. . .The emotion that survives in and as criticism still
                        carries an unsettling electric charge” (Goldsmith 278). Yet it seems safe to
                        say that what’s missing in Dames’s characterization of a generation’s
                        relationship to Theory, Goldsmith’s “criticism,” is that “unsettling
                        electric charge.” If we think of Theory (and perhaps Romanticism) as a kind
                        of “lightning which has yet found no conductor,” the question becomes how to
                        “conduct” that charge in a class. Following Ohm’s 1827 discovery, I suggest
                        that the answer might have something to do with resistance, especially
                        theory’s inherent resistances and the formal resistances posed by literary
                            texts.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4">De Man, among others,
                            argues that theory resists itself, that theory enacts a recalcitrance or
                            resistance not unlike literary form’s. Even “rhetorical readings,” the
                            most elastic kind of reading for de Man, “still avoid and resist the
                            reading they advocate. Nothing can overcome the resistance to theory
                            since theory <emph>is </emph>itself this resistance” (“The Resistance to
                            Theory,” 19). Thinking with Susan Wolfson’s “formalist activism,”
                            Goldsmith argues that “By attending to the specificity of literary
                            language, readers participate in a text’s resistance to cultural
                            generalization. No one’s words should be conscripted, least of all ‘as
                            information’” (279). Of course, my allying of theory and form is not
                            without its problems, as Wolfson knows well. Theory’s cultural
                            conscription is precisely the goal of Dames’s novelists, an issue
                            thornily involved in their use of the realist form.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>My point in bringing up Dames’s (quite teachable) essay is to show what
                        Theory and Romanticism seem to be up against. But in these reflections I
                        would like to bracket the question about generations’ differing relations to
                        Theory, pressing as it might be, and focus on a problem complexly related to
                        the question of resistance: how to use theory to get students to think
                        differently about—or with—Romanticism. In my experience it is a rare student
                        who readily grasps—much less is enthusiastic for—critical theory if they are
                        not putting it to use either in reading a line of poetry, in a discussion,
                        in an essay, in a thesis, in their own lives. This has little to do, I
                        believe, with an anemic curiosity, much less with a lack of ability or
                        willingness to think abstractly. It has to do, in my experience, with a lack
                        of resistance. For students unfamiliar with it, Theory often appears in the
                        guise of either a punishing authority figure or as a kind of crystalline,
                        frictionless surface. In the first instance, Theory seems inaccessible
                        because It is pure resistance: It knows everything you don’t; It thinks in
                        ways that seem unthinkable; It has anticipated your own criticism of
                            it.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5">A nervous mockery of these

                  <p> My goal here is therefore to discuss a few instances where it seemed like I
                        created a healthy resistance between Theory and Romantic texts. I have
                        divided it into two sections: <list type="ordered">
                        <item n="1">Opposition Is True Friendship: Badiou, Romanticism,
                                History</item>

                     </list> So: opposition and force, concepts complexly related to resistance
                        and use, formulated and marshaled differently by different thinkers. My
                        examples are Badiou and Kant.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"> On the
                            topic of the vexed connection between these concepts, particularly as
                            they relate to feeling, I recommend McLaughlin’s <title level="m">Poetic
                                Force</title>. For instance: “the capacity of poetic language to
                            exceed the grasp of empirical consciousness—for example, by breaking
                            free from spatial and temporal metaphors that draw on an empirical world
                            view—does not simply make it into a medium of rational or philosophical
                            communication after Kant. The ability to communicate the feeling of
                            reason transcending cognitive experience also brings with it internally
                            a ‘withdrawal’ of communicability. The language of the poets expresses
                            the capacity and the incapacity to communicate the feeling of the
                            divisive finitude of reason as a force and an unforce” (xiii).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among contemporary theorists, Romanticism has found few opponents as strident
                        as Badiou. Romanticism for him collapsed philosophy and history, truth and
                        poetry; it also lifted “Romantic” fusion up as the ideal of love. I have
                        found this blunt resistance useful for thinking through a number of Romantic
                        texts, particularly those where it turns out that Badiou’s thinking is only
                        minimally different from what he’d purportedly critique. My case study there
                        is Shelley, who shares a philosophical heritage with Badiou in the figures
                        of Plato and Lucretius. He also holds, of course, a Badiou-ian “fidelity” to
                        the spirit of the French Revolution. In the second part, I move on to a
                        discussion of Kant, a seldom-taught but oft-referenced figure in Romantic
                        literature courses. I look at some moments where he explicitly discusses the
                        interrelationship between theory and practice, and explain how and why I
                        teach German Idealism in my literature courses. These kinds of minimal
                        differences create productive tensions, like those between two drafts of a
                        poem. They are perhaps akin, on a larger scale, to those between Theory and
                        Romanticism. What David Clark has called Theory’s thrumming afterlife feeds
                        on those tensions.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn8" n="8">See “’Waving, not
                            Drowning’: On the Lives of Theory,” <title level="m">Studies in
                                Romanticism </title>44 (Summer 2005), 263. Theory’s afterlife in
                            Romanticism is even more robust today than it was a decade ago when
                            Clark made that pronouncement.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Badiou has claimed his project is tied to education, a fact articulated in
                        his recent translation of Plato’s <title level="m">Republic.</title> In his
                        introduction to that work, Kenneth Reinhard notes that “for Badiou,
                        education is not merely an activity of proper cultivation. . . it
                        requires the <emph>interruption</emph> of ‘the consensual routine’ of
                        culture through the experience of an ‘event’ and the subjective
                        reorientation that it involves” (Badiou , <title level="m">Plato’s
                            Republic</title>, xx). The same is true, Reinhard continues, for
                        Badiou’s free translation of Plato. It “forces” Plato’s text, and our
                        reading of it, to expand. I will later describe Badiou’s more technical use
                        of <emph>force</emph>, and how it is used in Kant. Force and resistance link
                        the two halves of this essay. But I also want to preserve the word’s basic
                        impulse. I often teach a work to “force” myself to think differently about
                        it; students sometimes take classes so that they are “forced” to read a
                        difficult text that they might not get through on their own; and I am
                        consistently “forced” to teach something differently based on how students,
                        or other texts, resist (or do not resist) it. The classroom—and the readings
                        and assignments that condition it—can be a space for recognizing and
                        enabling this energetic play of forces and resistances.</p>
                  <p>Before getting into my case studies of Kant and Badiou, it might help to step
                        back again and ask: what is theory? One answer comes in the talk Derrida
                        gave in the 1966 Johns Hopkins conference that allegedly started it all. In
                        “Structure, Sign and Play,” Derrida says that two things happen when the
                        distinction between Nature and Culture (or any two fundamental supports to a
                        structure) begin to break down: either a) you think you can “deconstitute”
                        those concepts by historicizing them and “stepping outside” of
                        philosophy—which, according to Derrida, most typically simply reinstitutes
                        the very metaphysics one was avoiding. Or, b) you can, like Levi-Strauss,
                        try to use those broken concepts, with the understanding that they can be
                        discarded; “to preserve as an instrument something whose truth value he
                        criticizes.” Or, says Derrida in reference to Genette,
                            “<foreign>bricolage</foreign> is critical language itself,” and
                            “<foreign>bricolage</foreign> criticizes itself.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn9" n="9">Derrida, “Structure, Sign and Play,” 284-85; <title level="m">Of Grammatology</title>, 139.</note> And yet
                            <foreign>bricolage</foreign> does not adequate to theory, inasmuch as it
                        is still dominated by use.</p>
                  <p> Theory’s vexed relationship to use and <foreign>bricolage</foreign> turns up
                        in a formulation by Fredric Jameson, one which I think is worth quoting at
                        length: <quote>. . . dialectic belongs to theory rather than
                            philosophy: the latter is always haunted by the dream of some foolproof
                            self-sufficient system, a set of interlocking concepts which are their
                            own cause. . .Theory, on the other hand, has no vested
                            interests inasmuch as it never lays claim to an absolute system, a
                            non-ideological formulation of itself and its ‘truths’; indeed, always
                            itself complicit in the being of current language, it has only the
                            vocation and never-finished task of undermining philosophy as such, by
                            unraveling affirmative statements and propositions of all kinds. We may
                            put this another way by saying that the two great bodies of
                            post-philosophical thought, marked by the names of Marx and Freud, are
                            better characterized as unities of theory and practice: that is to say
                            that their practical component always interrupts the ‘unity of theory’
                            and prevents it from coming together in some satisfying philosophical
                            system. Alain Badiou has recently coined the expression
                            ‘anti-philosophy’ for these new and constitutively scandalous modes of
                            intervening conceptually in the world. (Jameson 7-8)</quote> I find this
                        interrupting of theory by practice—and, as we shall see with Kant, theory’s
                        interrupting practice—appealing, particularly within the context of
                        teaching. At least for me, teaching is always experimental. In its best
                        instances it has interrupted both my theories and my practices of
                        reading.</p>

                  <p>“History does not exist. There are only disparate presents whose radiance is
                        measured by their power to unfold a past worthy of them.” This is Badiou’s
                        challenge at the end of <title level="m">Logics of Worlds</title> (509). It
                        is a challenge not only to historicism, but also to Romanticism, which
                        Badiou elsewhere calls the “philosopheme” of historicism. It is a
                        contemporary problem since, for Badiou, “the historicist kernel of
                        romanticism continues to be the referential site of our thinking”
                        (“Philosophy and Mathematics” 97). Earlier in <title level="m">Logics of
                            Worlds</title> Badiou makes a now-famous distinction between “democratic
                        materialism” and “materialist dialectic.” The former, which he identifies
                        with the present (and thus with his versions of historicism and
                        Romanticism), makes the “natural” assumption that <emph>there are only
                            bodies and languages</emph>. The latter, which Badiou describes as his
                        own position, declares that <emph>there are only bodies and languages,
                            except that there are truths</emph> (4). For Badiou, a truth isn’t the
                        correspondence between proposition and world. That would reduce it to being
                        a simple relationship between language and bodies, a kind of knowledge.
                        Rather, a truth is a procedure that punctures our knowledge of the world and
                        opens up new possibilities for it; because being always exceeds knowledge,
                        truths are infinite and eternal, immanent and everywhere. Exploring what

                            existence, but rather in the internal impasses which render the

                            what follows from this impossibility.” <title level="m">The Mathematics

                        Constructing truths forces the future to reorganize itself in such a way
                        that it can decide upon them. “A forcing is a powerful fiction of a
                            <emph>completed</emph> truth. Starting with such a fiction, I can
                            <emph>force </emph>new bits of knowledge, without even <emph>verifying
                        </emph>this knowledge” (Philosophy and Truth” 48-49).</p>
                  <p> I bring up Badiou’s koans about history and the present, about bodies,
                        languages and truths, because I have found them to be productive challenges
                        to Romanticism’s received ideas—both in my own thinking, and in the
                        classroom. Indeed, Badiou’s description of <emph>forcing truths
                        </emph>sounds a lot like pedagogy. They ask us to confront our most basic
                        assumptions: why we read what we read, and why do so in the way that we do.
                        Such questions can be posed very generally: <emph>is </emph>Romanticism
                        really, at core, an approach to history? What about competing kinds of
                        Romanticisms? And is Romanticism really <emph>the </emph>“referential site”
                        for “our thinking”? What would that mean? Who would “we” be, in such a case?
                        Can we think differently than we do—and if so, how do we want to think? </p>
                  <p>These are, obviously, important large-scale questions that can be broached in
                        a course on Romanticism. But in my experience Badiou is even more effective
                        at a smaller scale. When teaching “Mont Blanc” in a graduate course,
                        recently, I had the students read widely in the history of skepticism: the
                        first half of Hume’s <title level="m">Enquiry Concerning Human
                            Understanding</title>; a chapter from Cavell’s <title level="m">In Quest
                            of the Ordinary: Lines of Skepticism and Romanticism</title>; Eckhart
                        Förster on the genesis of Kant’s first critique; the final paragraphs of de
                        Man’s “Shelley Disfigured”; and Wasserman’s “The Poetry of Skepticism.” Plus
                        Badiou’s <title level="m">Second Manifesto for Philosophy </title>and the
                        preface and conclusion to <title level="m">Logics of Worlds</title>, where
                        he tries to describe our contemporary skepticism. When in our reading of
                        “Mont Blanc” we reached the section about the “still cave of the witch
                        Poesy,” someone brought up Badiou’s declaration that <emph>there are only
                            bodies and languages, except that there are truths.</emph> The
                        question—whether in “Mont Blanc” there is anything other than language and
                        bodies—immediately catalyzed the discussion of the poem. What, in Shelley,
                        constitutes a body, or a language, or a “truth”? The question can be
                        fruitfully posed with respect to individual lines: <list type="unordered">

                        Badiou will detect a certain resonance between his and Shelley’s terms:
                        love, void, universal, relations, thought, and so forth. Teasing out the
                        differences and similarities between Badiou’s and Shelley’s use, when it’s
                        going well, compels us to read each anew. The goal is not to send the
                        students into the icy abstractions of <title level="m">Being and
                            Event</title> or category theory, but rather to prompt them to rethink
                        texts they’ve already read. </p>
                  <p>Surprisingly, for Badiou the link between philosophy and art, since Plato,
                        has always been education. This is true, he says, no matter what our actual
                        beliefs about art are—whether we think it is a simulation of the truth (the
                            <emph>didactic </emph>schema), the only path toward the truth (the
                            <emph>romantic </emph>schema), or a human endeavor distinct from
                        truth-seeking (the <emph>classical </emph>schema). Badiou himself tries to
                        synthesize these views by declaring that art creates its own truths,
                        separate from both philosophy and the other “conditions” of truth (science,
                        politics, and love). Therefore, “art is pedagogical for the simple reason
                        that it produces truths and because ‘education’ (save in its oppressive or
                        perverted expressions) has never meant anything but this: to arrange the
                        forms of knowledge in such a way that some truth may come to pierce a hole
                        in them. What art educates us for is therefore nothing apart from its own
                        existence. The only question is that of <emph>encountering </emph>this
                        existence” (“Art and Philosophy” 9). I think that one thing that theory can
                        do for students is help generate that encounter, or (for us as well)
                        generate it anew.</p>
                  <p>But on first blush Badiou’s formula would seem to play into the hands of
                        critics claiming that the arts and humanities simply create their own
                        standards, ones distinct from the more useful truths pursued by science and
                        the social sciences. On such an account the arts (and many of the
                        humanities) therefore become allied with something personal and transitory
                        like love, which—though perhaps “important”—does not deserve sustained
                        scholarship or funding. Of course, it would be hard to imagine such critics
                        endorsing Badiou’s notions of science or politics. Neither are producers of
                        knowledge, but rather of truth—truth defined, again, as a kind of puncturing
                        of our knowledge of the world we find ourselves in. </p>
                  <p>But why this cordoning off of domains of inquiry? Could Francis Bacon be, as
                        Shelley calls him, “a poet”? Perhaps Badiou’s more recent thoughts on the
                        relationship between truth procedures (art, politics, science, love) would
                        strike us as closer to a Romantic notion of the interlinking of fields:
                            <quote>We need a theory of what I call the networking or the tying
                            together of truth procedures. Eventually, I see no reason why this could
                            not be called ‘culture’. . . Indeed, we can consider culture
                            to be a network of various forcings, that is, at a given moment in time,
                            the manner in which the encyclopedic knowledge of the situation is
                            modified under the constraints of various operations of forcing which
                            depend on procedures that are different from one another. (“Can Change
                            Be Thought?” 315)</quote> In a work like <title level="m">Prometheus
                            Unbound</title>, the relationship and potential differences between love
                        and politics (and art) is a real problem for Shelley, one which Badiou can
                        help frame. While my experience has been with using Badiou to think with
                        Shelley, and vice versa—pairing, say, “What Is Love?” with <title level="m">Epipsychidion</title> or <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>—I
                        imagine the same might be done with other Romantic writers. That same
                        conflict of fields, for instance, occurs in Blake, or Coleridge, or Keats,
                        or Byron, or Scott, or Mary Shelley. More important than any resonance that
                        might arise from placing Badiou with one of them would be the resultant
                        resistances. The oppositions Badiou poses to Romanticism are often
                        surprisingly clear, capturable in short selections or even single sentences.
                        That clarity has helped hone my own thinking as well as, I hope, my
                        students’.</p>

                        German Idealism?</head>
                  <p>German philosophy’s influence on the English poets and thinkers has been long
                        discussed, contested, and caricatured. I find a basic familiarity with it is
                        helpful for entering those debates, and for thinking about how we do
                        literary criticism more generally. In other words, I think its use extends
                        beyond Romanticism. So I turn now from an instance of contemporary theory,
                        to theory that would have been contemporary for the Romantics. I address
                        notions of theory and use as Kant may have conceived of them, before
                        reflecting on what I have come to see as the specific use of German Idealism
                        for thinking with British Romanticism. My concrete pedagogical example, with
                        which I conclude, comes from my experience teaching Eckart Förster’s <title level="m">The 25 Years of Philosophy: A Systematic Reconstruction
                        </title>(2012)—a chapter a week, alongside the literary texts—in a
                        semester-length graduate course.</p>
                  <p>In the 1793 Immanuel Kant found himself an object of a satire by the polymath
                        Abraham Gotthelf Kästner. Its title was <title level="m">Thoughts on the
                            Inability of Writers to Produce Rebellion</title>, and its basic
                        argument was a common one: theorists such as Kant had uncoupled themselves
                        from the real world. Kant’s response that same year in the <title level="m">Berlinische Monaatschrift</title>, “On the Common Saying: ‘This May be
                        True in Theory, but it does not Apply in Practice’,” cunningly turned the
                        tables: “It is therefore not the fault of the theory if it is of little
                        practical use. . . The fault is that there is <emph>not enough
                        </emph>theory; the person concerned ought to have learnt from experience”
                        (Kant 61). The point is supremely Kantian: so-called natural experience is
                        always already shaped by theoretical frameworks. Practical experience, in
                        order to be practical, must build itself up into general, theoretical
                        principles so that it can be communicated, reflected upon, actualized.</p>
                  <p> Two years later, in 1795, Kant applied a similar bit of logical torque to a
                        neighboring topic. I include the opening paragraph in full, in part because
                        it is so eminently teachable: <quote>THE PERPETUAL PEACE. A Dutch innkeeper
                            once put this satirical inscription on his signboard, along with the
                            picture of a graveyard. We shall not trouble to ask whether it applies
                            to men in general, or particularly to heads of states (who can never
                            have enough of war), or only to the philosophers who blissfully dream of
                            perpetual peace. The author of the present essay does, however, make one
                            reservation in advance. The practical politician tends to look down with
                            great complacency upon the political theorist as a mere academic. The
                            theorist's abstract ideas, the practitioner believes, cannot endanger
                            the state, since the state must be founded upon principles of
                            experience; it thus seems safe to let him fire off his whole broadside,
                            and the worldly wise statesman need not turn a hair. It thus follows
                            that if the practical politician is to be consistent, he must not claim,
                            in the event of a dispute with the theorists, to scent any danger to the
                            state in the opinions which the theorists has randomly uttered in
                            public. By this saving clause, the author of this essay will consider
                            himself expressly safeguarded, in correct and proper style, against all
                            malicious interpretation. (Kant 93). </quote> These are the sorts of
                        moments in Kant that we, as literary critics, like. In the former example,
                        Kant cuts to the heart of what we today would call false consciousness or
                        ideology—a belief that the mind can have direct, unstructured access to the
                        world. In this example from “Perpetual Peace,” Kant uses irony to shield
                        himself from “malicious interpretation.” He finds a blind spot in the
                        practitioner’s perspective, and wagers that if an efficacious critique is
                        possible at all, it might be leveraged from that occluded site. He cheekily
                        labels his essay a “sketch,” an <foreign>Entwurf</foreign>—that is, a
                        design, plan or blueprint, with its obvious mimicking of a document from a
                        practical vocation.</p>
                  <p>Kant’s opening gambit is to take a mismatch between text, image, and site
                        (“THE PERPETUAL PEACE,” the graveyard, and the inn), allegedly commissioned
                        by a non-academic foreigner (the innkeeper), and use it to structure and
                        defend a philosophical “sketch.” As critics we like this because here Kant
                        challenges genres. We have even invented the term “fourth critique” to
                        describe the constellation of political writings Kant wrote in the 1790’s, a
                        series of fragments that simultaneously complete and disrupt the system that
                        conditioned them. One thing that makes these texts often appear more
                        “literary” than even something like the third <title level="m">Critique</title> is Kant’s finding a rhetorical register that can put
                        his theoretical apparatus to use. In the case of <title level="m">Perpetual
                            Peace</title>, the most immediate application is a self-generated
                        “safeguarding” of Kant’s theses against misuse. In those moments I have a
                        doubled feeling: of the texts being actuated or put in motion, and of their
                        sudden halting. Jean-Luc Nancy has pointed out that, despite his alleged
                        absence of style, few philosophers have found their way into more literary
                        texts than Kant. He then mentions a 1917 letter of Walter Benjamin, who
                        declares that Kant’s linguistic austerity <quote>“represents a
                                <foreign>limes </foreign>of literary prose”. . . because
                            he perceives in Kant a yet-unheard-of philosophical stake, still to
                            come, Benjamin wishes to receive his prose—usually judged to be heavy—as
                            if possessing artistic force, that is to say, the force of awakening,
                            indeed of enthusiasm. Moreover, he immediately adds, “If this were not
                            the case, would the <title level="m">Critique of Pure Reason</title>
                            have so shaken Kleist to the deepest parts of his being?” (xxiv).
                        </quote> We seek out these moments. I, for instance, have just cited Nancy,
                        citing Benjamin, citing Kleist’s encounter with Kant. One thing that
                        “theory” can do is bring these kinds of moments, simultaneously fleeting and
                        eternal, into the present via an empirically verifiable lineage of
                        influence. Their problems become our problems; their having been shaken
                        shakes us. Of course, such neatly drawn lines of causation are precisely
                        what theory teaches us to suspect. Yet many, myself included, find ourselves
                        conceiving of these networks of relations “as if possessing artistic force.”
                        I find this “as if” to be a motivating factor in my own work, and also a
                        powerful pedagogical tool: read Kant <emph>as if</emph> it were powerful
                        enough to shake someone’s inner sense; let’s talk <emph>as if </emph>Shelley
                        were writing within a Badiouan framework; think of the German Romantics
                            <emph>as if </emph>they were simply composing an alternative historical
                        response to the French Revolution than the British; draft a sketch of what
                        perpetual peace might look like if the Kantian paradigm were efficacious and
                        true. The point is less about forcing similarities than unearthing
                        differences: between genres, strategies and styles; between historical
                        moments and places; between our first reading of a text and subsequent
                        readings of it. “To think differently than one thinks, and to perceive
                        differently than one sees.” This mantra, which I adopt from Foucault’s
                            <title level="m">The Use of Pleasure</title>, is probably the most
                        concise articulation of how and why I bring theory into the classroom (and
                        my own work) (8); and what North Americans call <emph>theory,</emph> the
                        French often call <emph>thought</emph>.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn13" n="13">See Sylvère Lotringer and Sande Cohen’s introduction to <title level="m">French Theory in America</title> (NY: Routledge, 2001), 1.
                            And <foreign>theoria </foreign>in Greek meant viewing, or
                            speculating.</note> Even in courses where I do not explicitly teach
                        theory—say, in an introduction to poetry—I find myself writing it on the
                        board at one point or another. Together with the “as if” it is, after all,
                        as much a literary orientation as a theoretical or philosophical one.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn14" n="14">I will not open here the Pandora’s
                            box that is the debate over the relationship between Romanticism,
                            philosophy and theory, despite my examples of Kant and Badiou. I will
                            merely cite Marc Redfield’s apt genealogy of it: “at the crossroads of
                            philosophy and literature, the early German Romantics not only theorized
                            a fully modern idea of ‘literature’; in doing so they also unleashed, as
                            Hegel suspected, the entrancing and threatening specter of ‘theory’ as
                            the monstrous concatenation of philosophy-as-literature. Inevitably, an
                            ambivalent romance with theory became, at a certain point in its
                            development, part of the drama of ‘Romanticism’ as a field of study in
                            the university. And that in turn has meant that philosophy and
                            Romanticism continue to enjoy and suffer their strange elective
                            affinity” (337).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Simon Jarvis has discussed verse’s “second repertoire of thinking,” the fact
                        that we can read poetry in at least two incompatible ways at the same
                        time—semantically and formally, with the latter interrupting and interfering
                        with the former (934). I think reading Romantic texts with theory—be it
                        Kant, or Judith Butler, or <title level="m">The Defense of Poetry</title>,
                        or Keats describing the Vale of Soul-Making to his brother and sister—mimics
                        and models this kind of semantic and formal layering. Theory echoes the
                        literary, but out of phase or in a different register—and what is an echo
                        but a vibration, a shaking just at the threshold of perception. I think one
                        thing that theory trains students to do is to become attentive to particular
                        kinds of shifts and frictions among texts. Placing, say, “I Wandered Lonely
                        As a Cloud” alongside Spinoza’s <title level="m">Ethics,</title> is often
                        simply a way of amplifying the tremors already threaded in Wordsworth’s
                        verse. The danger, we are told, is in becoming enamored of “the application
                        of gross and violent stimulants”—the solution is a return to therapeutic
                        hermeneutics, or to the calming materiality of history. But it is unclear
                        what an “untheoretical” return to the text or to history might look like,
                        even in teaching. If nothing else, teaching theory forces us to lay our
                        commitments on the table, and talk about them. So why, for me, this apparent
                        commitment to post-Kantian thought? What’s its use?</p>
                  <p>There is a notion, common enough in Romantic circles, that there has been an
                        unwarranted “Germanification” of British Romanticism, that critics have
                        applied Kantian or idealist paradigms to English Romantic texts that don’t
                        properly conform to or need those paradigms. A running assumption here is
                        that these literary texts have been historically conditioned by the German
                        texts, and so a perfectly reasonable conclusion is that we need to examine
                        those texts that <emph>did </emph>condition that literature. A way of
                        closing the loop is to claim, with a fair deal of support, that the German
                        philosophers and critics were themselves conditioned by English and Scottish
                        texts: Hume, Sterne, Reid, Mandeville, and so forth. But I think that there
                        are two factors in favor of the alleged Germanification, and against a
                        narrower historicist reading. First, that even if particular texts—say,
                        Coleridge’s “Frost at Midnight” or Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey”—weren’t
                            <emph>directly </emph>influenced by German thought, our reception of
                        them, and our very mode of practicing literary criticism at all, is directly
                        influenced by them. Too directly, might proclaim those who have recently had
                        to teach the <title level="m">Biographia </title>or “The Concept of Irony.”
                        But that is another issue—one which, I think, perhaps lies deeper than the
                        first. It is a moral or aesthetic issue, rather than a historical one. </p>
                  <p>Secondly, I find myself, recently, pro-Germanification because I am beginning
                        to see German Romantic paradigms as “possible worlds” versions of British
                        Romantic paradigms. Call it the age’s second repertoire, or one of
                        them—related, but out of phase or in another register. Those models and ways
                        of thinking stretch and test the ones we encounter in the British texts we
                        read, and I think that the novelists, poets and essayists may have
                        approached the matter from a similar perspective. Germany presented them
                        with an alternate history of the present, one confronted with many of the
                        same problems: the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars; a simultaneous
                        fascination and frustration with empiricism; a new understanding of and
                        feeling for history; a burgeoning print market; a taste for irony. So when I
                        say that I am for the moment “pro-Germanification” what I am perhaps really
                        saying is that I am in favor of this sort of stretching and testing of
                        limits. A Hegelian might call this <emph>dialectic</emph>; it strikes me as
                        more like common sense.</p>
                  <p>But how to initiate students—many of whom, understandably, have little
                        experience with philosophy as a discipline—into one of thought’s densest,
                        deepest periods? Last year I chose to spend the first fifteen or twenty
                        minutes of class each week discussing a chapter from Eckart Förster’s <title level="m">The 25 Years of Philosophy </title>(2012). That book explains
                        the thought of Kant, Fichte, Goethe, Jacobi, Schelling and Hegel, and
                        situates it within a concrete historical context. Förster’s account is
                        eminently readable without glossing over the interesting bits. Much of it,
                        in fact, is a new interpretation of those thinkers, particularly its placing
                        Goethe, and scientific inquiry, at the center of crucial debates. It was,
                        for instance, Goethe’s copy of Spinoza on Schelling’s desk when he was
                        developing his <foreign>Identitätphilosophie</foreign>. And Hegel arrived at
                        several breakthroughs while tending Goethe’s botanical garden. I designed
                        the syllabus so that most weeks there has been a medium-strong correlation
                        between the <title level="m">25YP </title>chapters and the literary texts.
                        For example, Förster’s chapter on the resurgence of Spinozism in Germany
                        coincided with our reading of Wordsworth’s allegedly “pantheist” texts, and
                        Levinson’s “Of Being Numerous”; the chapter on Fichte was juxtaposed with
                        Shelley’s <title level="m">Cenci</title>, a tragedy about consuming egos and
                        unchecked, or self-checking, will.</p>
                  <p>Literary texts, like theoretical ones, produce their own checks, their own
                        resistances. But these are not always the most obvious, or even the most
                        pressing, forms of resistance. Theory seems most useful, both in my own thinking and
                        in the classroom, when it creates the right kinds of resistances to texts
                        and ideas I have been taking for granted. </p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">If a conversation between poetry and philosophy can be said to
                    have inhabited the language and literature of Romanticism since its
                    inception—and to have constituted the driving force of Romanticism-as-theory,
                    what happens to this conversation when it crosses linguistic and cultural
                    borders? What are the limits of the theory internal to Romanticism and of the
                    theories that Romanticism generates beyond the confines of an increasingly
                    monophone globalism? This paper engages with such questions by presenting and
                    reflecting on passages of textual and cultural dissensus—à propos the specific
                    difficulty of translating the very signifiers, “sense” and the “senses”—in the
                    reading of “Tintern Abbey” in a non-Western context. It suggests that such sites
                    of untranslatability may serve precisely as new grounds for restarting
                    Romanticism’s theoretical potential in our contemporary global context of
                    connected yet heterogeneous cultural traditions.</p>

                  <p> Along with “nature” and “imagination,” “sense” is a keyword in Romantic poetry
                    and poetics that is notoriously slippery and equivocal. William Empson makes it
                    one of his specimen terms of ambiguity in <title level="m">The Structure of
                        Complex Words</title>, writing in the chapter “Sense in <title level="m">The
                        Prelude</title>” that the “apparently flat little word <emph>sense</emph>
                    . . . comes into practically all the great passages of <title level="m">Tintern Abbey</title> and <title level="m">The Prelude</title> on
                    the mind’s relation to Nature . . .. [W]hether or not Wordsworth is
                    drawing on Hartley or Coleridge, his whole position depends on some rather
                    undeveloped theory about how the mind interprets what it gets from the senses”
                        (289).<note place="foot">Thanks to Sam Baker for reminding me of Empson’s
                        essay in a conversation at NASSR 2013.</note> “Sense,” that apparently flat
                    little word, marks a <foreign>locus classicus</foreign> where Romantic poetry
                    reflects on its own means and—in however undeveloped a way—gets theoretical.</p>
                  <p> Slippery enough in English, “sense” gets even slipperier in crossing over to
                    another language, and then back again. I will recount in this essay a surprising
                    and memorable moment in the spring of 2013 when I taught the warhorse text
                    “Tintern Abbey” to a class of undergraduates in Taiwan. Insofar as “sense” in
                    Wordsworth veers towards equivocation rather than stable signification, its use
                    suggests, paradoxically, a crisis of sense in its primary definition in
                    Webster’s as “a meaning conveyed or intended”; it marks, rather, the opening up
                    of a disjunction within sense itself that leads dialectically, through the
                    mind’s ongoing relationship with the senses, to another sense. I would like to
                    designate this equivocation within “sense” itself with the shorthand
                    “dissensus,” for reasons I will elaborate later as I recount how dissensus took
                    place not just in one but two registers in our class on “Tintern Abbey” and
                    reflect on how that event may serve as the occasion, again, for getting
                    theoretical.</p>
                  <p> First, some information to set the scene. There were 26 students in the class,
                    all junior or senior concentrators in the Department of Foreign Languages and
                    Literature at National Tsing Hua University, a public research university in
                    Taiwan. Nearly all students who take classes in the Department were born and
                    raised in Taiwan, with some from other Sinophone areas (Hong Kong and Macau, a
                    few exchange students from China) and a smattering from other parts of the
                    world, e.g., Southeast Asia and Central America, where Taiwanese government
                    scholarships are available. The students have a high level of proficiency in
                    English, a mandatory subject in the public school system beginning in the fifth
                    grade. As Tsing Hua is one of the most competitive universities, the students
                    typically graduated at the top of their high school classes. Their ability to
                    follow difficult arguments and write well-reasoned prose reflects the benefits
                    of a rigorous math and science high school education (although many of them also
                    spend the first year or two at university recovering from the grueling aspects
                    of that same education). Concentrators in Foreign Languages and Literature at
                    the university are required to learn a second foreign language besides English,
                    but literature courses have been taught for some time almost exclusively with
                    readings in English or English translation, the default and de facto foreign
                        <foreign>lingua franca</foreign> in Taiwan—and globally. Since arriving at
                    Tsing Hua in 2012, I’ve taught, for instance, Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and
                    Charlotte Smith in English and Rousseau, Herder, Goethe, and Hoffmann in English
                    translation. I conduct lectures and discussion in English but, sharing with the
                    students a common language and much of a common culture, I speak Mandarin
                    whenever points seem to call for translation or, on the contrary, seem
                    particularly untranslatable. My students give presentations in English, write
                    their papers in English, and speak English in discussions, but I ask them to
                    participate in Mandarin if particular insights cannot find expression in another
                    tongue.</p>
                  <p> It’s a challenge teaching Romanticism beyond the Anglophone context. To begin
                    with, the students simply need more time to comprehend the texts by looking up
                    words and figuring out syntax. One assigns less. On another level, while the
                    students are curious about texts of the period and culture in question, they
                    have had less prior contact, through sheer osmosis, with, say, the sublime or
                    prophetic visionariness, given however secular a turn, as elements of a living
                    tradition. The hermeneutic circle that literary reading and interpretation by
                    and large entails intersects with other linguistic-cultural circles here, giving
                    rise to alternate geometries. At the beginning of a semester, students will have
                    heard of and read specific works by individual Romantic-era writers: <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> comes up often, and Rousseau as the
                    author of the <title level="m">Social Contract</title>, a text they know from
                    high school to be fundamental to the history of modern political thought and,
                    hence, a history in which they are implicated. Thanks to <title level="m">Twilight</title> and <title level="m">Harry Potter,</title> they have had
                    previous exposure to the Gothic. On the whole, I have had to provide a lot more
                    information about historical context and cultural background than I have had to
                    in North American classrooms. At the same time, I have needed to be more careful
                        <emph>not</emph> to provide too much historical narrative—either regarding
                    Romanticism’s position in Western literary, cultural, and intellectual history
                    or the role of the late eighteenth-, early nineteenth-century moment in the West
                    in contemporary social scientific theories of globalization.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">The world-systems theory of sociologist Immanuel
                        Wallerstein has served as the major account of globalization since the
                        seventeenth century in the work of such literary scholars as Franco Moretti,
                        Pascale Casanova, and Eric Hayot. See Wallerstein’s multi-volume <title level="m">The Modern World System </title>and the short <title level="m">World-Systems Theory: An Introduction</title>. </note> I have had to
                    modulate my editorial capacity as pedagogue in order to take care that students
                    have enough room to discover the lessons of Romantic poetry and poetics first
                        <emph>as</emph> lessons in poetry and poetics that may overlap at points
                    with, and remain in other ways alien to, their habitual ways of experiencing
                    language, culture, history, and the world. </p>
                  <p> In the spring 2013 class, the students came to “Tintern Abbey” after having
                    experienced the “gentle shock of mild surprise” in reading “The Boy of
                    Winander,” reckoned with the narrator’s intrusion in “Simon Lee,” reflected on
                    what it means to “let Nature be your teacher,” and grappled with the definitions
                    of poetry and the poet in “Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>.”
                    For all students, whatever their first language, “Tintern Abbey” is a difficult
                    poem that works on multiple levels. My plan that day was to guide the students
                    through the poem by beginning with the concrete situation of the Wordsworthian
                    speaker, addressing aspects of the poem’s form and structure, engaging with
                    conceptual intricacies in Wordsworth’s reflection on the conditions of his own
                    creativity, and then discussing the implications of his address to Dorothy. We
                    started with the title and the genre of the loco-descriptive poem. Noting how
                    the poem marks Wordsworth’s turn to autobiography, we talked about how the poet
                    uses the particular landscape as a measure to chart and reflect on his own
                    growth. To draw them into the experience of the poem, I asked them to think
                    about whether there was a particular landscape that might serve each of them as
                    an analogous reference point. The class was by now focused, engaged, and poised
                    to follow Wordsworth’s ruminations more closely. </p>
                  <p> I asked for a volunteer to read the first stanza aloud. We considered
                    Wordsworth’s use of blank verse to simulate everyday speech, enjambment to
                    create an effect of fluidity, and repetition to accentuate how long the five
                    years felt and to stress the importance of revisitation. And I asked them to pay
                    attention to the transitions in this stanza between what takes place in
                    Wordsworth’s mind to what he perceives by eye and ear—in preparation for the
                    multiple transitions and reflections thereon that would follow in the rest of
                    the poem. If the first stanza offers the description of a landscape phenomenally
                    available in the present to Wordsworth, as it had been, <foreign>mutatis
                        mutandis</foreign>, five years ago, the second turns to how that landscape
                    was internalized as a “picture of the mind” during the intervening time. This
                    move from contemplation of the external landscape to contemplation of the
                    internal served as the occasion for broaching the subject of how the poem
                    entertains epistemological questions about the relationship between the mind and
                    the senses.</p>
                  <p> In asking students how Wordsworth begins in the next stanza to reflect on the
                    function of sense or sensory experience in his own growth as poet, I was puzzled
                    to find at first a semantic confusion of the “sensory” with the “sensational” or
                    “sensationalist.” One student thought that, in reflecting on what he was like
                    “when first/ I came among these hills,” Wordsworth was criticizing an earlier,
                    youthful susceptibility to the kind of sensationalism involved in the “craving
                    for extraordinary incident, which the rapid communication of intelligence hourly
                    gratifies” that we had talked about the previous week in the <title level="m">Preface</title>. According to her view, Wordsworth would then be advocating
                    a turn away from such sensationalism towards a tranquil mood in which one may be
                    equipped to hear the “still, sad music of humanity.” Several other students
                    chimed in to agree with her. While such a reading was valuable and insightful in
                    discerning an opposition between the contemplative individual and an
                    increasingly sensationalist mass culture on a socio-historical dimension, I
                    wanted to make sure they were also able to recognize the epistemological stakes
                    of the poem. </p>
                  <p> I started to underline to them Wordsworth’s references to eye and ear and,
                    beyond the bodily eye, to the “eye made quiet by the power/ Of harmony”; and I
                    pointed out the ambiguity of the word “sense” as it recurs in lines 63-4, 96-7,
                    and 109-110 to designate moments in a process of interplay between the mind and
                    the senses. In exploring the relationship between the mind and the senses,
                    Wordsworth, I explained, was participating through poetry in a philosophical
                    conversation that involved, in his contemporary context, empiricist and
                    associationist iterations; he was exploring questions that remain vitally
                    relevant today, e.g., in classes in analytic and Continental philosophy just
                    down the hall. One could see ethical implications in his exploration of these
                    questions in his extension of his claims regarding himself to Dorothy at the end
                    while proposing “Nature” as basis for a <foreign>sensus communis</foreign>.</p>
                  <p> I had the instinct to bring up at this point, for annotative purposes, the
                    etymology of the phrase for the “senses” in Chinese, <foreign>wuguan</foreign>.
                    Literally, the two characters constituting <foreign>wuguan</foreign> mean the
                    “five officials” or “five courtiers,” in relation to which
                        <foreign>xin</foreign>—the word in classical Chinese that denotes “heart”
                    and “mind” as well as “will” or “volition”—is configured as the “sovereign,”
                        <foreign>jun</foreign>. (In contemporary Chinese, <foreign>xin</foreign>
                    still has this cluster of connotations, but “mind” can be translated also by
                    words imported since the late nineteenth century from European and English
                    sources designating “cognition” and “consciousness.”) The earliest record of
                    this metaphor, which establishes an analogy between the human body and the body
                    politic, occurs in the Han Dynasty <title level="m">Yellow Emperor’s Classic of
                        Internal Medicine</title>, from the Warring States or early Han periods,
                    from the fifth century BCE to 220 CE.<note place="foot">Thanks to Yuyu Cheng for

                     </note> In designating both “heart” and “mind” as well
                    as “will” or “volition,” <foreign>xin</foreign> figures as the locus of both the
                    emotional and the cognitive mental faculties that, as “sovereign,” organize and
                    govern the senses.<note place="foot">See Andrew Plaks’s essay,
                            “<foreign>Xin</foreign> as the Seat of the Emotions in Confucian
                        Self-Cultivation.”</note> The coalescence of the emotional and the cognitive
                    in <foreign>xin</foreign> stands in contrast to their separation into “mind”
                    (descended from the Greek <foreign>nous</foreign>) as figure for cognition and
                    “heart” as figure for feelings in European philosophical discourse and
                    reiterated in the very separation of “mind” and “heart” Wordsworth makes in
                    “Tintern Abbey.” </p>
                  <p> This philological intervention proved illuminating to the students. Eyes lit up.
                    “Aha!” and “that’s so cool!” and “I never knew that!” and other expressions of
                    wonder were heard. We continued talking about the relationship between “mind”
                    and “the senses” in the rest of the poem, as well as their relationship, in
                    turn, to “sensations,” “feelings,” and “affections”—all associated with the
                    “heart.” The discussion went more smoothly for the rest of the class, with
                    greater appreciation of the multiple dimensions of the poem—including the
                    epistemological, the autobiographical, the ethical, and the socio-historical—and
                    how they might relate to each other. We did not return in that class to talking
                    about the moment in which I introduced the comment concerning the configuration
                    of mind/heart and the senses in Chinese language and discourse. Clearly, though,
                    it had the effect of opening up channels of understanding; indeed, it became a
                    reference point for students when they talked about the course later in the
                    semester.</p>
                  <p> As their teacher, I offer a few thoughts about the significance of this moment.
                    I myself was surprised to witness their surprise in discovering the metaphor
                    implicit in their casual, everyday use of the term <foreign>wuguan</foreign> for
                    senses. In studying a literature foreign to them, they had taken their own
                    language for granted. An estrangement from their own language occurred that
                    revealed both the history of particular phrases as well as the historicity and
                    cultural specificity of these phrases. This estrangement occurred in relation to
                    a certain opacity in the Wordsworthian text for them, which was then rendered
                    discussable for them in its historical and cultural specificity. They discovered
                    also at this point the basic analogy between the human body and the body politic
                    that subtends both the Wordsworthian configuration of the mind and the senses,
                    on the one hand, <emph>and</emph> the traditional Chinese configuration of
                        <foreign>xin</foreign> or mind/heart as sovereign in relation to the senses,
                    on the other. While discovering this common analogy, they also discovered at the
                    same time two significantly different configurations. In short, they learned a
                    lesson about the historicity of language and the incommensurability of languages
                    and traditions; they learned a lesson about how metaphor structures and, in this
                    case, straddles philosophical, physiological, and socio-political discourses;
                    and they learned that the same metaphor may be troped differently, with profound
                    philosophical and cultural implications.</p>
                  <p> “Sense” is the word that tripped them. As Empson notes, Wordsworth uses it most
                    often at the end of a line and frequently “in the form ‘a sense of
                    . . .,’ which the Oxford English Dictionary explains as ‘not by direct
                    perception but more or less vaguely or instinctively’” (289). In “Tintern
                    Abbey,” Wordsworth writes: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l> While here I stand, not only with the sense</l>
                           <l> Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts</l>
                           <l> That in this moment there is life and food </l>
                           <l> For future years. (63-6)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> In lines 96-7, he speaks of feeling “a sense sublime/ Of
                    something far more deeply interfused.” And, at the climactic moment in the poem,
                    he proclaims how he is <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l rendition="#indent2"> well pleased to recognize</l>
                           <l>In nature and the language of the sense,</l>
                           <l>The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,</l>
                           <l>The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul</l>
                           <l>Of all my moral being. (108-12)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> “Sense” appears pleasingly each time as an interfusing of what
                    the eye and ear half create and what perceive, a combination of the prior sense
                    and the senses that becomes available to re-cognition. “Sense” plays a mediating
                    function between cognition and perception, coordinating the relationship between
                    the mind and the senses and bringing them into community with one another. The
                    very word “sense” marks, ironically, the instability of this community of the
                    mind and the senses, a community that is predicated on a fundamental dissensus
                    between parts that conjoin and disjoin in a continuous process. Making sense of
                    “sense” in Wordsworth in English involves registering the disjunction or
                    dissensus between mind and the senses that the word marks, a dissensus that
                    activates the process of re-organization. In making sense of “sense” in
                    Wordsworth through the medium of another language, the class had to pause to
                    register yet another dissensus in reckoning with different configurations of
                    mind or <foreign>xin</foreign>, “mind/heart,” and the senses, with each
                    configuration defining an operative epistemic disposition.</p>
                  <p> “Tintern Abbey” is a warhorse text that can be used to demonstrate commonplaces
                    long considered definitive of Romanticism: the turn to nature, the emphasis on
                    subjectivity, the attentiveness to mental processes, the allegorization by
                    poetry of its own conditions of possibility. Since New Historicist readings by
                    Marjorie Levinson and Kenneth Johnston, it has often been resituated in
                    materialist contexts in relation to historical circumstances it may be taken to
                    bracket out. It can be taught alongside “Frost at Midnight” or put into dialogue
                    with “Beachy Head.” No matter what one does with it, the poem’s critical
                    reflection on its own poetics and performance of its own theory make it ever
                    relevant to thinking about the relationship between Romanticism and literary
                    theory.</p>
                  <p> The engagement with the poem and its theory of poetic creativity occasioned in
                    my students a critical reflection on their own habitual ways of thinking. What
                    came to my aid in facilitating this encounter was an etymology about a set of
                    terms no less consequential in Chinese as their epistemological counterparts in
                    English. For this etymology, I have Chinese philological scholarship to thank
                    for its source documentation. The annotation I provided showed obviously a point
                    of untranslatability but, beyond that, introduced students to both intra- and
                    cross-cultural depths and dimensions that amplify and render more capacious the
                    experience of reading.</p>
                  <p> The relationship between Romanticism and literary theory can be said to begin in
                    the late eighteenth century with texts in philosophical aesthetics or poetics
                    such as the <title level="m">Critique of Judgment</title>, the <title level="m">Letters on Aesthetic Education</title>, the <title level="m">Athenäum</title> fragments, “The Defense of Poetry,” among others, which
                    variously attempt to reflect on, define, and project the conditions of literary
                    and aesthetic experience for a new era. This relationship is intertwined further
                    with the secular, historicizing textual practices ranging from biblical
                    hermeneutics to classical studies to Sanskritology and Sinology that may be
                    described by the umbrella term, “philology.” Philology designates a variety of
                    approaches to texts, ranging from positivist scholarship to secularized
                    messianic reading, with all approaches distinguishing the modernity of their
                    orientation to the premodern or canonical in historicist terms. The Western
                    study of canonical traditions in other parts of the world is complicated further
                    by its dovetailing with heterogeneous traditions of textual commentary.</p>
                  <p> Philology would seem to inhabit the very relationship between Romanticism and
                    literary theory. In his 1982 essay “The Return to Philology” Paul de Man even
                    describes the then-recent turn to theory in literary studies that took place
                    through the field of Romanticism as inherently “a return to philology, to an
                    examination of the structure of language prior to the meaning it produces” (24).
                    He defines philology here not as the study of any particular set of texts but in
                    terms of a “mere reading” that, “prior to any theory, would appear deeply
                    subversive to those who think of the teaching of literature as a substitute for
                    the teaching of theology, ethics, psychology, or intellectual history” (24).
                    Such mere or close reading he finds common in critics and theorists as different
                    as Reuben Brower, Foucault, and Derrida. Beyond his contemporaries, De Man
                    refers to a critical tradition that includes, notably, Nietzsche as philologist.
                    What De Man advocates in the title of his essay is not so much a return to the
                    positivist philological scholarship of the nineteenth century that amassed
                    material for the teaching of literature as the teaching of theology, ethics,
                    psychology, or intellectual history but to philology as a practice of
                    attentiveness to language as medium that radically structures and produces
                    meaning. The essay inscribes, furthermore, its own call for a turn or return to
                    philology in a complex genealogy that goes back to the modern definition of
                    aesthetics, since Baumgarten, as a separate branch of Western philosophy in the
                    eighteenth century. De Man aims to recover a fundamental practice underlying the
                    network of cultural-historical narratives bound up with aesthetics since the
                    eighteenth century that traverses Romanticism as field of study.</p>
                  <p> In 2004, Edward Said would define philology in deliberate, marked contrast to De
                    Man in an essay he titled likewise, “The Return to Philology.” Stressing the
                    importance of aspects of a textual practice he had criticized vociferously and
                    generally in the form of Near Eastern scholarship in <title level="m">Orientalism</title>, Said advocates a philology that he characterizes as
                    attentive to “conventions, semantic frameworks, and social or even political
                    communities operating as practical constraints” on utterance (69). He cites
                    examples from three philological traditions: the Arabic-Islamic tradition of
                    Koran scholarship, the philological-hermeneutic scholarship of Spitzer and
                    Auerbach, and the American pragmatist approach of Emerson and Richard Poirier. I
                    cannot pursue within the parameters of this essay the rich implications of the
                    differences between De Man and Said’s conceptions of philology and the critical
                    genealogies they respectively adumbrate. Suffice it to say here that Said points
                    in 2004 to a need that persists twelve years later in literary studies to return to
                    philology as part of an acknowledgment of and reckoning with the plurality and
                    heterogeneity of linguistic and textual traditions in the world. The dialogue
                    between De Man and Said is crucial to thinking the contours of such a return.
                    And such a return is crucial to redefining why Romanticism matters in complex
                    and pluralistic terms and ways that give scandal—and pause—to the pace of an
                    Anglophone globalism.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay outlines how one might lead a discussion of William
                    Wordsworth’s sonnet “Steamboats, Viaducts, and Railways” (1833) in relation to
                    Georges Bataille’s chapter “The Rise of Industry” from his <emph>Theory of Religion</emph>
                    (1973). Such a pairing would attune the classroom conversation to questions of
                    intimacy as they arise in the poem and in Bataille, and can show students how to
                    read a poem for more than its apparent argument. The combination of Wordsworth
                    and Bataille can show students how capitalist ideology generates its own
                    internal resistance, how British Romantic writing can construe subjectivity as
                    an injury, how poetry speaks through its formal procedures, and how theory
                    interacts with literary texts ambiguously, in ways that go beyond serving as a
                    metaphorical lens. </p>

                  <p>I have sometimes taught William Wordsworth’s sonnet “Steamboats, Viaducts, and
                    Railways,” first published in 1833, alongside a chapter from Georges Bataille’s
                        <title level="m">Theory of Religion</title>, posthumously published in 1973.
                    The selection from Bataille is chapter four of <title level="m">Theory of
                        Religion </title>(87-104), entitled “The Rise of Industry,” which I upload
                    to our course learning management system. I have attempted this combination
                    several times in senior-level undergraduate courses and Master’s-level graduate
                    courses at the University of Idaho, and will be trying it again in the upcoming
                    semester at the University of Calgary.</p>
                  <p>I usually organize my Romanticism survey courses thematically rather than
                    chronologically or by author. The themes have included global British
                    Romanticism, including topics like hospitality, Orientalism, and empire;
                    sexuality and the family, including sororal-fraternal sexuality and the history
                    of the idea of “sexuality” itself; the aesthetic demands of the French
                    Revolution; class, labor, and the Peterloo massacre. I find a thematic structure
                    can encourage students to see literary writing as a form of problem solving, as
                    they see texts working through common problems and responding to each other. In
                    such a context, reading twentieth- or twenty-first century theory alongside
                    older literary texts becomes a way to reconsider what these texts are able to
                    accomplish or imagine. As we read Byron’s <title level="m">Manfred</title>, for
                    instance, we will also be reading Felicia Hemans’s “A Spirit’s Return” and the
                    introduction to Jacques Derrida’s <title level="m">Specters of Marx</title>, so
                    that we’re ready to think through the difficulties inherent in summoning ghosts
                    and making demands of them. Before reading Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s “Dejection:
                    An Ode,” John Keats’s “Ode on Melancholy,” and Mary Shelley’s <title level="m">Mathilda</title>, for instance, we spend a day discussing Sigmund Freud’s
                    “Mourning and Melancholia” and Slavoj Žižek’s “Melancholy and the Act,” so we
                    will be ready to discuss in detail the processes, and ethico-political stakes,
                    of Romantic-era despair, and especially so we can consider what might be gained
                    by summoning dejection deliberately. At the end of the course, we spend two
                    weeks thinking through the big picture of Romanticism—its political and cultural
                    upheavals, its critical potential, its exclusions, its limits, its blind spots
                    and complicities. It’s during this last part of the course in which my students
                    have read Wordsworth’s “Steamboats, Viaducts, and Railways” alongside Bataille. </p>
                  <p>Bataille delineates two orders of experience in “The Rise of Industry”: there is,
                    he explains, an “order of things” devoted to clarity and precision, in which
                    economics, labor, politics, and scientific research play out; there is also an
                    “order of intimacy” involving spiritual rapture, divinity, and, if one is doing
                    it right, eroticism. Modernity is defined by the separation of intimacy from
                    things. As capitalist ideology becomes hegemonic, European culture gradually
                    accepts the total elimination of divine grace (i.e., intimacy) from one’s works
                    (i.e., things). For Bataille, the world of things, too much with us, expands
                    everywhere and crowds intimacy out: capitalism, imperialism, secularization, and
                    science collude to keep intimacy at bay. It’s a thoroughly Wordsworthian
                    concern. The tone of Bataille’s chapter isn’t nostalgic or lapsarian, but it
                    outlines a tragic forfeiture at the heart of modernity, one by now so firmly
                    entrenched in European thought that it cannot very easily be challenged. In
                    Bataille’s view, capitalism satisfies theological and psychological needs. Yet
                    it has severe costs even beyond the concentration of wealth: a society organized
                    around getting and spending opens the “reign of autonomous things,” leading to
                    military expansion, imperialism, and commodity fetishism (90). Even science,
                    which might have seemed to have critical potential, requires “the reduction of
                    all life to the real order” through its attachment to clarity and precision
                    (96). These developments have severe psychological effects, warns Bataille: with
                    the separation of intimacy from things, people become estranged from their own
                    consciousness and begin to fear the consequences of modernity. Though no dates
                    are mentioned, one can surmise that Bataille considers the European eighteenth
                    and nineteenth centuries as eras in which “the order of things” began to take
                    over and dominate intimacy, and this makes “The Rise of Industry” especially
                    useful for courses in Romanticism. He explains, for instance, that the situation
                    brought about a change in the nature of state power, such that sovereignty
                    became a function of capital, not the throne. </p>
                  <p> Bataille’s chapter encourages us to rethink the meaning of “Steamboats,
                    Viaducts, and Railways” because it gets students to attend to the poem’s
                    ambiguous literary language. I have gone back and forth, in planning
                    discussions, as to the order of operations: sometimes when teaching a poem
                    alongside some theory, I will have everyone work through the theory before
                    getting at the poem. But in this sonnet, there’s a (seemingly) direct claim
                    being advanced about the need—psychological, aesthetic, or economic—to reconcile
                    industrial infrastructure with the “natural” landscape: the speaker, at least at
                    one level, encourages us to find these congruent and “sublime.” This association
                    between infrastructure and habit of mind is probably the most manifest of
                    possible readings, so I want students to recognize and understand it as quickly
                    as possible; I also want to give students ample opportunity to explore other
                    readings that may occur to them, before we shift the conversation into
                    Bataille’s particular set of concerns. So, to begin class, we spend a few
                    minutes just reading the poem aloud and discussing its basic argument. I will
                    display on a screen an 1830s-era image of a viaduct or railway in the context of
                    a British landscape. This sort of print was a whole genre of 1830s visual
                    culture, and examples are readily found online. With the image projected
                    onscreen, I will ask a student to read the poem aloud for us. I do this even
                    though the students have read the poem at home already, because the poem is
                    brief, and listening to it read aloud well can attune us afresh to its meter and
                    tone: <quote>

                        </lg>
                     </quote> At first glance, the poem certainly seems to exonerate
                    industrialists. The local environment is important, the poem says, but not
                    nearly as important as our ability to cultivate a poetic habit of mind—and
                    industrial infrastructure presents no impediment to that. Although industrial
                    constructions admittedly “mar/ The loveliness of Nature,” in the speaker’s
                    analysis these eyesores don’t interfere with a poet’s attainment of a sublime
                    “prophetic sense,” and thus are perfectly acceptable. As the violent destruction
                    of the landscape is acknowledged but forgiven, ecological damage comes to seem
                    unimportant relative to “that point of vision” which poetry affords. Moreover,
                    the point of vision is valuable not intrinsically but because it will allow an
                    inquisitive person to have “discovered what in soul ye are.” In this reading,
                    which I think is the most straightforward one, self-discovery is held to be the
                    paramount thing, overriding all other concerns. This in itself is a
                    controversial idea, especially in light of today’s ecological crises, and one
                    that will stir up lively conversation among students in a classroom. To
                    cultivate a sense of one’s authentic selfhood through a process of poetic
                    reflection is not, after all, a genuine solution to the violence of capitalism
                    but, on the contrary, its ideological supplement and necessary outgrowth.</p>
                  <p>The challenge is to get students to discuss the poem as a poem, not as an essay.
                    It’s with this that Bataille is helpful. Read alongside Bataille, “Steamboats,
                    Viaducts, and Railways” becomes a viciously ironic poem and a poem that dares to
                    imagine a solution to modern capitalist ideology. The solution surprises
                    students because it emerges from within the very workings of industrial
                    capitalism—the steamboats, viaducts, and railways—rather than as an alternative
                    to capitalist development. There are of course many ways to encourage students
                    to become attuned to poetic devices. Bataille offers one such way, and it’s an
                    especially good one, because here, attention to poetic devices is not an end in
                    itself. When read in combination, Bataille and Wordsworth show how poetic
                    devices present an occasion for radically rethinking subjectivity in an
                    industrial world. Literature and industry aren’t opposing forces here, as the
                    argument of the poem makes plain. But they don’t necessarily support each other,
                    either, and in learning to read poetry as poetry, we can learn to see the poem’s
                    critical edge. The poem, at one level, appears to be trying to cordon poetry off
                    from economic, developmental, aesthetic, and ecological crises—a poet can enjoy
                    the sublimity of these crises from a wise and profound remove, it would seem (at
                    first glance). But in reserving this space within capitalism, the poem is also
                    maintaining a space for intimacy. Dreadful as it may seem, this space is not
                    autonomous from industry but develops right within and through it. In tracing
                    this development and seeing how we as readers become caught within it, we can
                    arrive at a mode of thinking—a “point of vision”—that Bataille would call
                    “fundamentally unreal” and genuinely radical (96).</p>
                  <p>Because the questions I enumerate below will seem, I fear, inflexibly Socratic, I
                    will insist at this juncture of the essay that one can never predict how a good
                    discussion will take shape. My aim is to start a conversation in which
                    interpretation can take unexpected turns. To accomplish this, though, I like to
                    make a long list of clustered questions to pose and a possible order for their
                    asking, not because any discussion will ever obey this trajectory but because
                    the list of questions ready at hand will encourage me to keep the conversation
                    moving briskly and purposefully. In general, I find it best to start with small
                    and answerable questions: what is a viaduct? What do viaducts have in common
                    with steamboats and railways? What do steamboats, viaducts, and railways make
                    possible? In whose service are they built? I explain that infrastructure was
                    being built rapidly, all across Britain, in the 1830s: I will mention some
                    examples and show more images, very briefly. Who is building these railways and
                    viaducts, and for whose profit? How do they relate to the public good? Would
                    there be resistance to these developments, and from whom? What is this “war” is
                    actually about, and who’s waging it? Is it significant that it is figured in
                    this poem as a war, instead of as “opposition” or “tension” or some other less
                    metaphorical kind of hostility?</p>
                  <p>Even though everyone already has it on their desks, I’ll project the sonnet on
                    the screen because I think it can help to focus the group’s attention on the
                    actual words of the poem, as written. I’ll ask someone—often the reader, if the
                    reader has perhaps volunteered in the hopes of avoiding other contributions—to
                    offer some thoughts about the sonnet’s first sentence (ll.1-3). Students will
                    often stumble for a moment when reading the first sentence aloud, I think
                    because of the opening trochee and the unwelcoming unfamiliarity of the main
                    characters: the speaker is telling a story about “Motions and Means” at war with
                    “old poetic feeling.” The poetic apostrophe at work here makes this
                    unfamiliarity especially pressing: what would it mean to speak directly to
                    “Motions and Means”—to offer them reassurances—without addressing the movers or
                    planners? Can one really speak to motions and means? I find it strange to
                    imagine “motions and means” being opposed by a “feeling,” and stranger yet for a
                    speaker to discuss the conflict with “motions and means” directly. This poem
                    aggressively effaces human subjects, speaking only of their movements and
                    emotions, as if movements and feelings could exist without belonging to anyone.
                    In the sestet, we learn about a complicated contest between various vast
                    abstractions: Nature, it seems, distances herself from beauty, who in turn is
                    critical of motions and means, to form an alliance with art, as a strategy to
                    defeat Time, who is sympathetic to the predicament of Space. Weirdly, they are
                    presented as a family, each with offspring and siblings. What is implied by
                    this?, I will ask. The reader is already embroiled in a family romance. Is it in
                    any way fathomable that Time or Space could experience something like the
                    Oedipus complex, for instance?</p>
                  <p>It’s a difficult story to follow at first, because of its allegorical nature and
                    the way that the figures seem, against all odds, to be capable of strategy and
                    sensitivity. There are traces here of human beings, but they are only traces: we
                    have at stake “the Mind,” and we’re warned of possible interference by
                    judgmental but tolerant “Poets,” but still we’re being left with the impression
                    of huge impersonal forces at work, each working through complicated resentments
                    that only vaguely relate to human thought and action. To frame it all, we have
                    two modes of semi-autonomous being and thinking: “motions and means,” with which
                    we might identify because the address is also implicitly to the reader, and
                    “poetic feeling.” Why is the poem doing this? What are we supposed to glean from
                    this tendency? The opening trochee of “Motions and Means” aggressively insists
                    on the substantiality and violence of the motions and means: they are very real
                    and present. If there is any resistance movement here—and we are assured by the
                    speaker that there is not—it is allotted the anapest (and extra syllable) of
                    “Poets, even,” and thus bridled with a kind of weakness and inefficiency. It’s
                    good that poets have decided not to cause too much trouble for the motions and
                    means, as it would hardly be a fair fight by the sound of it. We are left with a
                    poet sycophantically currying the favor of the motions and means, directly.</p>
                  <p>I’ll ask the students about the effect of the enjambment and caesura in these
                    opening lines of the sonnet: the poem is offering a meditation about
                    interruption and dividedness, in some way, I would suggest, and we can try to
                    figure out what the poem might be implying about such conditions. Especially in
                    the octave, but also in the sestet, the strongest and most meaningful pauses
                    tend to come midway through a line. One syntactical reason for all of the
                    caesura is that this is a poem filled with subordinate clauses, and therefore
                    commas, as if the speaker feels compelled to explain ever further, or as if
                    further context were always necessary (e.g., “howsoe’er it mar / The loveliness
                    of Nature”). We can discuss why this might be: from where does this anxiety
                    stem? On the other hand, we can begin to consider the form of the sonnet as a
                    possible solution to dividedness. Petrarchan sonnets, in particular, are
                    difficult to break into more than two pieces: the extreme concision and the
                    tight, woven rhyme scheme encourage us to think about how things are connected
                    to other things; the mechanism of the volta, though itself a line of division,
                    also encourages us to think that the problems have direct and discrete
                    solutions. The sonnet isn’t a form that encourages one to think about
                    irreconcilable differences or critical aporia. Can we think through the
                    combination of this sonnet’s the enjambments and caesura, on the one hand, and
                    its apparent formal cohesion, on the other? Where the poem seeks to locate
                    division and aporia, I will suggest, is not in the big picture of things.
                    Rather, these are internal, and things that contribute to, rather than interfere
                    with, larger systems of meaning—poetic form, or, one might even say, commerce.
                    After all, “motions and means” are likewise, at one at the same time, running
                    all over the place and internally broken: the short circuiting of industrial
                    capitalism is internal to capitalism itself—consider how, for Marx and Engels,
                    the bourgeoisie trains its own grave-diggers (483)—even while its internal
                    failures and excesses do not really prevent Britain, through the very force and
                    ambition of its industries, from becoming a (seemingly) monolithic and
                    devastating entity in the world. I don’t fetishize the alignment of poetic form
                    and content by any means, but such alignment can be a useful teaching tool when
                    the opportunity presents itself.</p>
                  <p>What I will suggest is that the poem may not be about finding common ground or
                    forgiveness between “old poetic feeling” and “motions and means,” as steamboats,
                    viaducts, and railways begin to crisscross the landscape. Rather, the apparent
                    tension between “motions and means” and “poetic feeling” can be said to enable
                    industrial progress, so-called: poetic feeling can be turned into a kind of
                    ideological supplement to “motions and means,” stubbornly reaffirming a
                    community’s investment in nature at the very moment that this commitment has
                    been abandoned. In this way, perhaps Wordsworth is right to see poetry as the
                    support for industrial capitalism, against all odds. I ask: who stands to
                    benefit from explaining away the tension between industry and poetry, as the
                    poem endeavors to do? What is initially so startling about this poem is that it
                    appropriates the infrastructure of capitalism to its poetic register. But the
                    reverse situation is even more startling, and is also a part of the poem: it is
                    poetry, here, which becomes part of a general industrial and commercial project.
                    More than anything, the tension that Wordsworth is seeking to explain away is
                    explained away to the benefit of industrial capitalism, so it can better
                    continue in its motions and means. Yet—to complicate this further—this
                    reconciliation happens “in spite” of the tension between industry and aesthetic
                    judgment, not because industry is ever made beautiful. We will discuss, briefly,
                    what might be meant by Wordsworth’s “in spite,” in this context. Perhaps some
                    other form of resistance is taking shape, here? We might brainstorm about this
                    for a minute or two, as a class.</p>
                  <p>I will note that the poem immediately offers judgment about this tension,
                    ironically by disavowing judgment and the tension itself (i.e., “not for this”).
                    The “not for this” is a textbook case of Freudian-style negation: by saying “not
                    for this, / . . . shall you, be judged amiss” unprompted, we are left
                    with the strong impression of harsh judgment. We talk about what the poem
                    accomplishes through this failed exculpation, or backhanded incrimination. Which
                    is it?, I ask my students. Then we discuss why the speaker identifies poets
                    (“Poets even”) as the most obvious and likely place where we would find
                    disapproval. Because Wordsworth was by this time a highly visible poet, someone
                    quite closely associated with the very category of the poet, we can infer that
                    this poem has the potential to deliver a particularly devastating critique of
                    these dehumanized “motions and means.”</p>
                  <p> We come back, then, to the steamboats, viaducts, and railways: these are figures
                    for shipment and therefore connection, a national and European economy, of the
                    infrastructure of global commerce. I ask: in what way might this world of
                    commerce challenge old poetic feeling? After all, isn’t poetry also about
                    connecting people across time and space? Isn’t poetry a viaduct and railway of
                    sorts? Once we have discussed that question we can get into a direct discussion
                    of Bataille’s thoughts on industry.</p>
                  <p>I’ll ask a student to summarize Bataille’s concerns, and I will fill in as
                    needed, to ensure that we’re all on the same page before working through this
                    problem via Wordsworth. Once we’ve had a satisfactory summary, I back away and
                    allow students to ask each other about Bataille’s ideas. Once I’m convinced that
                    people understand Bataille’s concerns, I ask: is this division between intimacy
                    and things a real problem? We can devote perhaps five minutes in debating that
                    question. Next, I ask: can poetry be a solution to this problem? Do you think
                    so? Does Wordsworth think so? We might spend seven or eight minutes talking
                    through these questions. I then will ask: are there other modes of discourse,
                    besides poetry, that attempt to reconcile the order of intimacy and the order of
                    things? After gathering some ideas, I’ll point out Bataille’s opinion, that
                    there are people who have tried to approach the order of intimacy through the
                    techniques of science, trying to bring clarity and precision to something
                    fundamentally unreal (96). This attempt at reintegration, he says perhaps
                    insensitively, has produced only “stammerings”: we’re trying and failing to
                    represent the intimate order in the real world. We can access intimacy in this
                    way, he says, but only through meek, weakened voices, and at a severe
                    psychological cost.</p>
                  <p>Is this poem an instance of such “stammering”? It’s an opportunity for us to
                    consider the syntax and punctuation of the poem, including the many subordinate
                    clauses of the octave. We move from there to considerations of its tone, as the
                    poem attempts to reconcile intimacy with things. Wordsworth says that there is
                    no “bar / To the Mind’s gaining that prophetic sense.” Is this convincing?
                    Surely it cannot be so easy as Wordsworth suggests: Bataille says that these
                    registers can only be reconciled through “an impossible operation” (99).
                    Self-consciousness has a bad habit of tending toward things, not intimacy:
                    intimacy is, in a way, the very horizon that self-consciousness cannot attain,
                    and hence the impulse for us to swerve away from intimacy. Bataille regrets that
                    when people have tried to solve this problem previously, they have simply tried
                    to undo the swerve, and end up caught in “a contrary operation, a reduction of
                    the reduction” (99). Does this happen to Wordsworth? Moreover, for Bataille,
                    intimacy is unruly and violent—it threatens to annihilate the order of things,
                    even while it has historically been a condition for the order of things too. I
                    return, then, to the abstractions that populate this poem: does this indicate a
                    new mode of subjectivity? Is this the destruction, or perhaps dissolution, of
                    the Enlightenment subject—the subject of the Cartesian
                    <foreign>cogito</foreign>? Here we follow the liberation of concepts and words
                    from their subjects, of motions and means from industrialists, and poets from
                    poetry.</p>
                  <p>This leads us to reconsider the meaning of Wordsworth’s “ye”: whom and what does
                    it address? At one level, it refers only to the motions and means of industrial
                    capitalism. But as we encounter a “ye” on the page, we become, as readers,
                    necessarily interpellated into that apostrophe. What are the risks of such
                    belonging? I will ask the students. After some discussion, I will try to suggest
                    that the “ye” is folding together the motions and means of industrialization
                    with a newly industrialized subject-reader: a subject who becomes the subject of
                    these motions and means, and ultimately subjected to them as well. If the poem
                    is to make any sense, the reader is forced to recognize herself in the harsh
                    features of industry. More alarmingly, we are told that, given industrial
                    progress, Time “smiles on you with cheer sublime.” Again, the “you” being smiled
                    upon must necessarily refer to the motions and means of industry and the reader
                    herself. This is, I will suggest, basically horrific: capitalism doesn’t “smile
                    on you”—it truly doesn’t care about you except as a market or demographic—and
                    it’s not our duty to smile on it, either! Here, we confront the alienation of
                    modern industrial capitalism <emph>by means of our total integration within
                        it</emph>. Meanwhile, haunting the edge of the discussion, is the
                    possibility that the poem has generated enough irony to destabilize these
                    motions and means from within. After all, we are not really assured that poetry
                    won’t be critical of industry or of the subjects it produces: we are promised
                    only that it will criticize industry “not for this”—that is, it won’t criticize
                    it on aesthetic grounds primarily. </p>
                  <p>By this late point in the semester, the students have read quite a lot of
                    Wordsworth, Dorothy and William alike. So they can see immediately what’s
                    unusual about “Steamboats, Viaducts, and Railways”: the poem seems to resist or
                    complicate quintessential William Wordsworth fascinations such as nostalgia,
                    selfhood, sympathy, and the indispensability of nature to spiritual recovery.
                    Then again, it can seem to revisit famous Wordsworth meditations such as
                    “Tintern Abbey,” which too seeks to find in the cultivation of “pleasing
                    thoughts” “abundant recompense” for the “loss” of one’s ability to appreciate a
                    natural landscape. In “Steamboats, Viaducts, and Railways,” as in “Tintern
                    Abbey,” it’s a habit of mind really at stake and it seems especially important
                    to cultivate a way of thinking able to confront the “future years.” I ask my
                    students decide if “Steamboats, Viaducts, and Railways” is aligned or out of
                    step with Wordsworth’s earlier thoughts on the confluence of nature and mind.
                    Despite its reputation, is high Romanticism, even that of William Wordsworth,
                    devoted to nature at all?</p>
                  <p>Bataille says, “The difficulty in making distinct knowledge and the intimate
                    order coincide is due to their contrary modes of existence in time. Divine life
                    is immediate, whereas knowledge is an operation that requires suspension and
                    waiting” (98). This allows us to consider the ways that the poem emphasizes time
                    and temporality. Why is poetic feeling “old,” for instance? It seems to reach
                    into the future, as “the Mind [is] gaining that prophetic sense / Of future
                    change.” This poem is sort of about the mind and its development: we are moving
                    through old processes in an endeavor to attain some sort of futurity. Steamboats
                    and viaducts might seem like the future, and they are the future, but they’re
                    also here and now, and in this way they actually do interfere with the prophetic
                    sense. They work in the here and now to bring about the future, but deny us the
                    experience of the future in the here and now. Yet what’s at risk is the way in
                    which we understand which “soul ye are”—that is, what we are already, and in the
                    present tense. Not “will be”—are. But what we are must be discovered, uncovered,
                    through “old” modes of discourse which open up an awareness of “future
                    change.”</p>
                  <p>For all of Wordsworth’s emphasis on points of vision, it is important to think
                    through Bataille’s warning, that we “will regain intimacy only in darkness”
                    (100). Yes, restoring intimacy to the world will enable us to achieve
                    much-desired clarity and passion, but it will also force us to rediscover “the
                    night of the animal intimate with the world—into which it will enter” (100).
                    This sounds like a threat, or a warning at least. But why would this “night of
                    the animal” necessarily be a bad thing? Does Wordsworth worry about this
                    problem, I ask them? There is a necessary blindness, says Bataille, because
                    self-consciousness cannot ever become intimate: intimacy is indeed the modern
                    name for the edge of “things,” and as such, it must remain somewhat at bay (99).
                    Yet the combination of Wordsworth and Bataille is helping us to pose, and test
                    answers to, difficult questions about subjectivity and politics. At one level
                    I’m interested in starting a discussion about the way that subjectivity is
                    formed, in Wordsworth’s understanding, around a gap or a renunciation. How could
                    we know if there might be, despite Wordsworth’s reassurances, a “bar / To the
                    Mind”? The speaker here asserts that there is no such bar, but the poem is
                    perhaps less certain. This possible gap, I would suggest, is perhaps
                    constitutive of subjectivity as Wordsworth construes it, not an impediment to
                    it. This form of subjectivity is also, arguably, a historical development—an
                    outgrowth of Enlightenment rights discourse, a new way to respond to ecological
                    destruction and alienating labor practices. At a second level, I’m interested in
                    the political ramifications of such wounded subjectivity: is this poem
                    enunciating a new way of being in the world? Who and what can count as a
                    subject? Here, a fruitful connection can be made to “We Are Seven,” too. Is this
                    process of extending recognition necessarily democratic in every instance?</p>
                  <p>Teaching these texts together can open a discussion about the presence—or
                    absence—of intimacy in Wordsworth’s thought, in British Romanticism, and in the
                    modern world generally. Bataille, by alerting students to ideological debates
                    playing out in Wordsworth’s poem, can show students how to consider features of
                    a poem beyond its apparent argument. Conversely, students trained in the basics
                    of poetry analysis can, through engagement with Wordsworth’s sonnet, learn to
                    see aspects of Bataille’s thought that they may have otherwise misperceived—they
                    see, for instance, that Bataille isn’t wistfully wishing for some impossible
                    world, and that capitalist progress generates its own resistance. When read
                    alongside Bataille, Wordsworth seems to challenge capitalist hegemony from
                    inside its own ideologies. More broadly, reading Wordsworth beside Bataille can
                    teach students that theory isn’t a “lens” through which we can examine British
                    Romanticism, but rather a way of tracking subtle shifts of meaning within
                    literary text and theory alike.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">Whether or not we believe the reports of theory's imminent or
                    absolute demise, recent calls (from Latour, Sedgwick, Best and Marcus) to move
                    beyond ideology critique invite us to rethink our teaching as well as our
                    research practices. This essay asks what it would mean to exchange an emphasis
                    on "theory" for one on "method." My suggestion is that focusing on method
                    encourages a cultivation of knowledge as, specifically, a <emph>knowing-how</emph>,
                    a form of intellectual labor that values adventurous collaboration over private
                    virtuosity. </p>

                  <head>1. Introducing Method</head>
                  <p> In the fall of 2012 I taught a graduate seminar called “Romanticism as
                        Method.” Why method? Etymologically speaking, method
                            (<foreign>meta</foreign>-, after, beyond, alongside;
                            <foreign>hodos</foreign>-, way) can mean either a travelling-past or
                        else a travelling-alongside. The latter definition nicely approximates the
                        various modes of unsuspicious reading lately proposed in lieu of ideology
                        critique, from Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s reparative reading to Sharon Marcus
                        and Stephen Best’s surface reading to Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht’s reading for
                        the <foreign>Stimmung</foreign>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See
                            Sedgwick, 123-51; Best and Marcus, 1-21; and Gumbrecht, “Reading,”
                            213-21. </note> The former gestures at the kind of criticism that adopts
                        a “future-oriented vigilance” with respect to the inevitable “bad surprise”
                        of an artifact’s complicity in multiple forms of historical injustice; such
                        criticism has already “travelled past” the artifact and knows what
                        conditions it displaces or conceals (Sedgwick 130). The “method” of my title
                        thus aims to connote two widely available paths for contemporary literary
                        criticism. We might call those paths “Keatsian” and “Coleridgean,” in a nod
                        to Keats’s oft-invoked description of Negative Capability: a competence to
                        “being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching
                        after fact &amp; reason” defined against Coleridge’s habit of “let[ting] go
                        by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery,
                        from being incapable of remaining content with half knowledge” (Keats
                        I:193). Romanticism, too, is caught between championing uncertainty as an
                        intellectual position and a skepticism concerning the mere appearance of
                        reality, especially when it threatens to obscure metaphysical or historical
                        insight; if Coleridge is more interested in metaphysics than history, the
                        distrust of verisimilitude of which Keats accuses him jibes with Best and
                        Marcus’s controversial disapproval of criticism concerned only with “meaning
                        [that is] hidden, repressed, deep, and in need of detection and disclosure
                        by an interpreter.”</p>
                  <p>Another question to ask regarding the foundations of the course might be: why
                        method instead of theory? In 1986, Morris Eaves and Michael Fischer
                        introduced their <title level="m">Romanticism and Contemporary
                            Criticism</title> with “the simple observation that English Romanticism
                        is important to contemporary literary theory.” The contributors to this
                        volume—Northrop Frye, W.J.T. Mitchell, J. Hillis Miller, M.H. Abrams, and
                        Stanley Cavell—are described as “not only defin[ing] Romanticism in
                        different ways but also” using “it to underwrite strikingly different
                        theories of literature” (Eaves and Fischer 1). In 1986, Eaves and Fischer
                        were on solid ground. Today, the literature of the Romantic period has at
                        best an anecdotal relationship to the development of recently dominant
                        theories of literature, and by “dominant” I mean those that have had the
                        most institutional and public traction. The transhistorical character of
                        cognitive literary studies demands little care for distinctions of period or
                        genre, although it has taken a special interest in the neophyte
                        representations of consciousness in the eighteenth-century novel; the novel,
                        too, continues to be a productive site for distant reading, data mining, and
                        statistical analysis. Pioneering work by Jerome McGann and Alan Liu
                        notwithstanding, digital humanities and new media theory, not to mention
                        history of the book, find fruitful research programs in the archives of the
                        later nineteenth century more often than in Keats’s Great Odes or Hazlitt’s
                        essays. To presume that literary scholars in general, regardless of field or
                        specialization, would believe Romanticism to be constitutive of theory, or
                        theory to be indebted to Romanticism, seems old-fashioned, a relic of better
                        times for Romanticism, theory, and the humanities in general.</p>
                  <p> “Romanticism as Method” begins, then, from the disheartening premise that
                        the obsolescence of theory—motored, at least in part, by high-profile spasms
                        of apostasy like Bruno Latour’s “Why Has Critique Run Out Of
                        Steam?”—presents an especially acute problem for students and scholars of
                        Romanticism (Gumbrecht, “Response” 212-6). No longer does it seem wise to
                        justify one’s teaching or research on the assumption that “Romanticism,”
                        whether English, European, or Transatlantic, is integral to theory, because
                        theory itself no longer seems generally integral. If theory is evermore seen as
                        a residual mode of critical and pedagogical practice, how might Romanticism
                        contribute to an important public conversation on the “why” of research and
                        teaching on its own terms? This course is my own tentative exploration of
                        that question. The turn away from theory is motivated by interests that are
                        variously reasonable and reactionary, and too numerous to take on here.
                        “Romanticism as Method” acknowledges that such a turn has taken place,
                        attends to the many social and disciplinary histories involved in such a
                        turn, but ultimately concentrates on developing alternative conceptions of
                        Romanticism and of scholarship that might be of some good to students
                        seeking doctoral degrees. Replacing theory with method means looking to
                        Romanticism for its utility, not simply its power. More crucially, it means
                        reclaiming the language of utility from those metrics of instrumental
                        value—test scores, learning outcomes, impact factors, etc.—with which
                        teachers at all levels are increasingly familiar. </p>
                  <p> The course I describe here is designed for first- and second-year graduate
                        students, though in this case I allowed more advanced auditors to
                        participate. As a graduate class, it focuses less on introducing students to
                        a particular body of historical literature than on acquainting them with
                        ways that literature has been read, and on finding new ways for us to read
                        it together. Every week includes both required assignments and suggestions
                        for further reading, intended to help those students who do not arrive
                        already familiar with Romantic literature become conversant with its
                        canonical and semi-canonical authors. That said, although it emphasizes
                        texts and topics I would probably deem to difficult or too specialized for
                        an undergraduate class, the principle of utility is one which, I think, may
                        be helpfully drawn into all manner of classroom activities; so too is the
                        ideal of experimentation and group improvisation a class on “method”
                        demands. Every classroom may become a laboratory, and while the professor
                        directs the experiment results are valued insofar as they are produced
                        collaboratively.</p>

                  <head>2. Romanticism, or Knowing How</head>
                  <p>When someone says that an activity <emph>x</emph> is “like riding a bike,”
                        she means that <emph>x</emph> is an unnatural behavior it is possible to do,
                        figuratively speaking, naturally; she also implies that the doing of
                            <emph>x</emph> is successful only if the person doing it forgets exactly
                        how it is done. This is a problem for pedagogy. If you have ever tried to
                        teach someone how to ride a bike, tie a knot, or write an essay, you have
                        experienced just how hard it is to teach something you are able to do
                        because, to some extent, you have forgotten how to do it. It is from such a
                        forgetting that instincts are trained, through the eviction from conscious
                        thought of the astonishing alchemy of training and habit, sinews and
                        synapses, conventionality and improvisation that all together keep us going,
                        aloft on the bike. Incidentally, this process also describes Wordsworth’s
                        method for falling in love with your child: you just do it over and over
                        again until, “with patient mind enforced/To acts of tenderness” you no
                        longer have to think twice (Wordsworth 166-7). </p>
                  <p>The philosopher Jason Stanley defines “know-how” as the knowledge that
                        something is true—a proposition based, in turn, on the claim that all
                        knowledge is founded in our capacity to imagine acting on such knowledge in
                        a practical way (Stanley). Heidegger suggests that “the less we just stare
                        at the hammer-thing, and the more we seize hold of it and use it, the more
                        primordial does our relationship to it become, and the more unveiledly is it
                        encountered as that which it is—as equipment” (Heidegger 98). Certainly when
                        it comes to research, writing, and teaching, such activities benefit from a
                        certain disinhibition, akin to the paradoxical acquisition of a “primordial”
                        muscle memory. That said, when it comes to teaching graduate students, it
                        seems necessary both to teach the know-how of scholarship and to keep
                        students productively alienated from what they are doing when they are doing
                        it. In the context of graduate coursework, this means creating opportunities
                        not only to think about thinking but, more explicitly, to read about reading
                        and write about writing. “Romanticism as Method” is designed to meet these
                        ends. All assignments had to reflect actual demands made upon actual
                        academics: students would write weekly response papers, give brief in-class
                        presentations on primary-source material no one else in the room (besides
                        the professor) had read, analyze the structure and style of a published
                        article in their field and, at the end of term, give a talk on preliminary
                        research for their seminar paper, which would be an article-length piece of
                        work. </p>
                  <p>This is all very standard. The less orthodox dimensions of the course are
                        evident in the reading list, which places four works of criticism at its
                        center: two classic texts that position themselves explicitly with reference
                        to theory, specifically to post-structuralism and new historicism, and two
                        more recent books which take up the legacies of that earlier moment but do
                        something very new with them. I chose books that had been important to me,
                        so important their names came immediately to mind when I began planning the
                        course: Paul De Man’s <title level="m">The Rhetoric of Romanticism</title>
                        (1984), James Chandler’s <title level="m">England in 1819: The Politics of
                            Literary Culture and the Case of Romantic Historicism</title> (1998),
                        Anne-Lise François’s <title level="m">Open Secrets: The Literature of
                            Uncounted Experience</title> (2007), and Mary Favret’s <title level="m">War at a Distance: Romanticism and the Making of Modern Wartime</title>
                        (2009). I also asked students to purchase Paul Fry’s <title level="m">Theory
                            of Literature</title> (2012), a transcription of his undergraduate
                        lecture course, or to access individual lectures for free online through
                        Open Yale Courses.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Open Yale Courses may be

                        the classroom with disparate levels of familiarity and facility with the
                        building blocks of advanced literary study. Asking everyone to keep <title level="m">Theory of Literature</title> on hand was intended as a
                        democratizing gesture, and it also served a practical purpose: students who
                        needed to take an ad-hoc crash-course in, say, Saussurian linguistics, or to
                        remind themselves what exactly Foucault means by “discourse,” could turn to
                        Fry as a reliable and, helpfully, not completely neutral source of
                        information. After seven weeks of reading through these four critical texts
                        alongside primary materials (discussed below), we turned to articles or book
                        excerpts by Celeste Langan, Colin Jager, Rei Terada, Kevis Goodman, and
                        Marjorie Levinson; on the first day of class students also read Maureen
                        McLane’s “Romanticism, or Now.” The principle of selection in this instance
                        was determined by what I take to be emerging trends within the field, as
                        well as by a special interest in tactical uses of critical voice and
                        style.</p>
                  <p> As for the primary texts, it seemed to me that an emphasis on the “Big Six”
                        version of the Romantic canon—the one which limits itself to Blake,
                        Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, and Keats—would provide a solid,
                        albeit conservative, counterpoint to the improvisatory aegis of the course.
                        Each week featured a chapter from two of the books mentioned above or one
                        scholarly article, and a selection of Romantic poetry or, occasionally,
                        prose. In contrast to an undergraduate course, where I like to assign
                        secondary materials that explicate or contextualize the historical ones, the
                        principle of pairing and selection here is less strict. We read Keats with
                        Chandler and <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> with François, but we
                        also welcome unexpected or surprising dialogues between De Man’s “Symbolic
                        Landscape in Wordsworth and Yeats” and Hazlitt’s <title level="m">Spirit of
                            the Age</title>. Stumbling into an unforeseen confluence between texts,
                        whether critical or literary, is not only something we ought to value in our
                        research process, it also just happens. One of my goals here is to push
                        students toward a non-instrumental relationship to criticism, to persuade
                        them that reading a good book in any field, on any subject, will open up new
                        pathways of thought that will be helpful to them at one time or another. I
                        believe we are all fatigued by studies promising to give an interpretation
                        of some poem or novel through one “angle” at a time, Morris Zapp-style.<note place="foot" resp="editors">I refer here to one of the protagonists of
                            David Lodge’s <title level="m">Changing Places</title>, a literature
                            professor determined to corner the market on Jane Austen by publishing
                            “a series of commentaries” on her work, each of which will “examine the
                            novels from every conceivable angle, historical, biographical,
                            rhetorical, mythical, Freudian, Jungian, existentialist, Marxist,
                            structuralist, Christian-allegorical, ethical, exponential, linguistic,
                            phenomenological, archetypal, you name it” (Lodge 34).</note> This sort
                        of pedantic relationship to theory, or to the more constrained genre of
                        criticism, is one current students should consider it their historical
                        privilege to reject. At the same time, limits must obtain for even the most
                        expansive, ecumenical model of criticism, if indeed it wants to say
                        something genuinely interesting. Finding oneself forced to read Hazlitt with
                        de Man is an exercise in testing the limits of what constitutes a good match
                        of text with critic. It may be that Hazlitt and de Man have nothing to say
                        to each other, and in this awkward silence some new intelligence about both
                        writers emerges. Staging such labored, even impossible conversations is, the
                        syllabus suggests, vital to both the precision and the creativity of our
                        research practices.</p>
                  <p> To use Romanticism as a method is to assemble a toolkit out of phrases like
                        “Negative Capability,” “gusto,” “they may be called poetry by that figure of
                        speech which considers the effect as a synonym of the cause,” or “Labour
                        well the Minute Particulars,” as Goodman has done with William Cowper’s
                        “loopholes of retreat” and Levinson with Wordsworth’s numerical tropes
                        (Goodman, especially 67-105; Levinson, “Of Being Numerous,” especially 652;
                        and Levinson, “Notes and Queries”). But the kit must be filled with phrases
                        of our own making, too, and this is where the weekly reading responses,
                        posted on our online discussion board, come in. Students are encouraged to
                        consider these as low-stakes venues for being propositional and adventurous.
                        They may write, if they choose, in the style of one of the Romantic or
                        contemporary authors we are reading. The goal is not parody but posture,
                        walking in someone else’s shoes. It is, moreover, an attempt to realize that
                        style, including phrasemaking, is constitutive of method. Writing like
                        Hazlitt alters how you read a poem (or a person) and determines what kinds
                        of claims you may advance about them. A criticism that “smokes,” in the
                        Keatsian sense, might approach the condition of poetry by always being one
                        step ahead of its reader or might treat the readerly impulse to understand
                        as the very condition of its own opacity (Keats, <title level="m">Letters</title> II, 174). Are there times when it is productive to
                        smoke the readers of our work? And what about owning up to those moments
                        when the poem smokes us (“That is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to
                        know”), and we feel unable to understand it in any robustly satisfying way?
                        What goes into the vocabulary of confusion, blockage, dismay, or, as both
                        Terada and McLane put it, “impasse,” and how might we apply it creatively
                        (McLane 143; Terada 275-309)? After a reader confesses she has no idea what
                        is going on in a particular line or passage, can that blindness borrow the
                        form of an insight, however limited or diffident? The language of confusion,
                        and sometimes of irritation or resentment, enters our class’s semi-private
                        lexicon, which grows from week to week and preserves both our frustrations
                        and our attempts to relinquish them.</p>
                  <p> Class discussion is also directed toward the collective elaboration of a
                        variety of interpretive procedures and points of view, specifically as they
                        might be drawn from, and not merely applied to, the text at hand. To present
                        one example, our seventh class is spent reading one of the less obviously
                        interesting books of the 1805 <title level="m">Prelude</title>, namely Book
                        XII. We choose a passage to look at closely based on the evidence the group
                        gives for being bored—perhaps smoked—by this part of the text. In this
                        instance, the class swiftly converges on Wordsworth’s critique of pastoral
                        in lines 184-215. The professor throws out a phrase: dead time, as in “there
                        are moments of dead time in <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, moments
                        that seem unnecessary to the elaboration of the poem or the book.” A student
                        offers a comparison between “dead time” and “spots of time”; perhaps both
                        are indispensable to “the growth of a poet’s mind.” Since we have been
                        reading <title level="m">Open Secrets</title>, the group begins to wonder
                        about the relationship between dead time and the temporality of “nonemphatic
                        revelation.” A consensus emerges that they are not the same thing, but that
                        François offers a way to make sense of Wordsworth’s rejection of fussy,
                        pictographic pastoral. A cluster of early modernists address the
                        significance of the Shakespeare plays to which Wordsworth alludes here,
                        while another student, a committed dramaturge, proffers information on how
                        pastoral elements figure in the theatrical productions of the late
                        eighteenth century. Another student, this one preparing for her
                        comprehensive exams and interested in the history of science and medicine,
                        speculates on the cognitive implications of “dead time,” while another
                        aligns Wordsworth’s literary-critical digression with Hazlitt’s essays in
                            <title level="m">The Spirit of the Age</title>.</p>
                  <p>The professor takes to the board, and gradually a piece of crowd-sourced
                        scholarship emerges, a group effort that would be impossible without a
                        serious engagement with multiple forms of knowledge. If this phantom piece
                        of writing ever becomes a manuscript, some elements will be amplified,
                        others edited out. The point of the exercise is to show that: having many
                        ways into a text is not the same thing as being without method; scholarship
                        is by definition collaborative, even if it is just you, Wordsworth, and a
                        pencil; exegesis means false starts and wrong turns; it’s good not to bring
                        too much ego into the room; be patient and curious, good poems can be
                        tedious for good reasons; learning means learning how to teach, how to tell
                        your reader, your students, your colleagues what you know in such a way that
                        they may be said to know it now, too. For graduate students who are going on
                        to careers as teachers, either in the academy or elsewhere, the classroom
                        should always be a primarily pedagogical space with lines of instruction and
                        reception running in several directions, some predictable and others less
                        so. </p>
                  <p> It may seem overly tidy to assert that these are the lessons I myself
                        learned from Romanticism, and from Romanticism’s best critics, although that
                        is what I believe. Likewise, too, the principle that it is all right for
                        work to be difficult and understanding slow—things one may plausibly tell
                        graduate students, if not our increasingly harried undergraduates, at the
                        very beginning of their academic careers. For those who have the luxury of
                        encouraging digressive learning in the classroom, the model of
                        learning-by-doing brings together more aleatory and indirect modes of
                        instruction with a pragmatic ability to make something, knock it down, and
                        start again, using the highly modular and sustainable resources of one’s own
                        brain. “My head,” as Thoreau bafflingly says, “is an organ for burrowing,”
                        and how many wider and deeper trails might be dug by the collaborative work
                        that allows us to read, think, teach, and travel along—or rather,
                        alongside—multiple pathways (Thoreau 82)? “Romanticism as Method” really
                        means Romanticism as implement, tool, gizmo, hammer-thing, equipment. With
                        it we work to make, among other things, more Romanticism.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">Cumbersome terminology aside, this essay demonstrates the use and
                    interest of teaching the debated concept of lyric ontology in the Romantic
                    Poetry classroom across undergraduate and graduate levels. It moves from a
                    narrative introduction on Robert Frost's very material practice of "lyric
                    overhearing" on his Derry, New Hampshire party-phone line, to extended
                    consideration of the recent scholarly turn to historical poetics in the study of
                    nineteenth century British and American Poetry. I discuss Virginia Jackson's
                    influential and compelling anti-lyric anti-theory——Jackson's version of the
                    resistance to theory——as it presents a teachable conflict with the Romantic
                    "literary absolute." The essay ends by reconsidering the metonymic linkage
                    between the position of Romanticism and the position of poetry/ literature/ the
                    Humanities in the institution of the contemporary university, and with brief
                    suggestions for lesson plan ideas and student readings. (Post-production note:
                    contemporary American poet Ben Lerner's <emph>The Hatred of Poetry</emph>
                    [Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2016] makes for a timely addition to the essay's
                    bibliographic suggestions and also may impart something like a critical mass to
                    the essay's approach to teaching in the rift between poetic ontology and
                    historical poetics.)</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <p>On a recent car trip to the Boston area for an academic conference, I stopped
                        off at the Robert Frost Farm in Derry, New Hampshire, a visit I had been
                        meaning to make for a long time, since moving to Frost’s “other” New England
                        home state of Vermont. At one point early in the tour, our small group was
                        standing in the kitchen of the home, in which Frost and his young family had
                        lived from 1900-1911. We saw the striking red wallpaper (which Rob
                        “romantically” thought perfect for Christmas, our tour guide said); the
                        handsome large stove worth a local shoe factory worker’s year’s pay; the
                        soapstone farmhouse sink that had been improbably salvaged from the back
                        pasture after it was converted to the “Frosty Acres” automobile junkyard in
                        the 1950s and ’60s, and only authenticated because Elinor Frost’s knives had
                        been sharpened on the front apron; and then we were directed toward the far
                        wall with a telephone. Though the chronology suggests a time too early for a
                        phone in regular domestic use, our guide informed the group that Frost’s
                        daughter Lesley, as a consultant to the heritage site, had told a story
                        about the poet that dictated there should be one. The phone was part of his
                        vocation. Robert Frost apparently often listened in secretly to the
                        telephone conversations of neighbors on the party line around Derry. When
                        exhorted by his wife or daughter to stop eavesdropping, he is claimed to
                        have replied: “Don’t bother me, I’m working.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">In standard accounts, Frost learns colloquial inflection
                            especially from his neighbor Napoleon Guay and the poultryman John Hall;
                            See Thompson, <emph>Robert Frost: The Early Years</emph> 284; Sanders,
                                <title level="m">A Divided Poet</title> 3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> The joke (if that is what this is) resonates because it captures a lot of
                        Frost’s character and several of the recurrent ingredients of his famous
                        persona. On the private side one might include his position as the ultimate
                        insider-outsider in the New England community and his role as an
                        often-severe patriarchal family head. On the better-known and beloved public
                        side are his georgic conflation of languid ease and hard “work”; his magical
                        “folksy” touch with the quick reply; and not least, his devilish initiative
                        as an artist-tactician. If Frost’s poetry invites the reader in via its
                        surface of familiarity and offerings of countrified wisdom, only to toy with
                        and trap him or her in metaphysical plights, this story (were we those
                        neighbors!) presents a Frost who is unnervingly near and
                        <emph>un</emph>invited. </p>
                  <p>But for my aims in the context of this short essay, the thrust of the
                        anecdote should be directed straight to its analytical purchase on a long
                        Romantic and modern trajectory of lyric poetry’s interpretive creation.
                        Virginia Jackson characterizes this history as one of enabling confusion in
                        her entry on “LYRIC” for the (2012) fourth edition of the <title level="m">Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics</title>: <quote>A
                            persistent confusion—among verse genres, between historical genres and
                            natural ‘forms,’ between adjective and noun, between cognitive and
                            affective registers, between grammar and rhet. [rhetoric], between
                            privacy and publicity, and among various ideas about poetry—may be the
                            best way to define our current sense of the lyric. It is a confusion
                            that has proven enormously generative for both poets and critics. (826)
                        </quote> One reason why it remains vitally important to debate and teach the
                        theory of Romanticism, even in these widely proclaimed post-theoretical days
                        in the humanities, is due to the surreptitious depth of a circular
                        corroboration between interpretive “criticism” and poetic making. For
                        Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy in <title level="m">The Literary Absolute</title>,
                        the post-Kantian Romantic enterprise of critique/creation reflects an
                        “inauguration of the <emph>theoretical</emph> project in literature” (2);
                        and “the theoretical Romanticism of Jena characterized itself as the
                            <emph>critical</emph> question of literature” (5). The interposition of
                        “theory” between the literary object and hermeneutics comprises the
                        inaugural moment of Literature according to Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy—thus
                        scrambling the notions of “literary object” and interpretive “hermeneutics”
                        as stable entities and prior operations in themselves, in the name of the
                        radically mixed project of Romanticism. Especially when we think that
                        creation and explication form a complete pair requiring no subtractive
                        third, theory will be as urgently needed as it is resisted.<note place="foot" resp="editors">“Resistance” of course is a trigger word. It
                            is worth recalling that, for Paul de Man, the important distinction
                            wasn’t one between “theory” and “praxis” (though he feints in this
                            direction when describing his failed <title level="m">PMLA</title>
                            commission at the start of “The Resistance to Theory,”) but rather the
                            extent to which the “literariness” that became the “object of literary
                            theory” (9) after Saussure is conceivably <emph>not in itself subject to
                                phenomenalization</emph>. In his Foreward, Wlad Godzich evokes this
                            staggering possibility—which de Man was insistently to call
                            “materialism” in his last years—as the radical <emph>matter of
                                reading</emph> and “the resistance of the material to the
                            ideological overlay” (<title level="m">Resistance to Theory</title>
                            x-xi). De Man himself is typically clearer and yet more mysterious:
                            “Literature is fiction not because it somehow refuses to acknowledge
                            ‘reality,’ but because it is not <emph>a priori</emph> certain that
                            language functions according to principles which are those, or which are
                                <emph>like</emph> those, of the phenomenal world” (11); “The
                            resistance to theory is a resistance to the use of language about
                            language” (12). The pedagogical upshot, as de Man flatly levels it, is
                            that “it is better to fail in teaching what should not be taught than to
                            succeed in teaching what is not true” (4). Words to gird the soul and
                            buckle the knees of any teacher. </note> Hence it was not only
                        pedagogically approachable, but theoretically telling, for Jonathan Culler
                        to recruit a short lyric by Frost (“Spring Pools”) as the occasion of his

                            essential variable here is the professor’s choice whether to foreground

                        moves of apostrophe, ghostly deictic gestures, allusions, ritualistic
                        repetitions, etc.—while at the same time his inclusion in such a venture
                        implicitly widens the domain of theory into the territory of perhaps
                            <emph>the</emph> poet least hospitable to theoretical intonation.</p>
                  <p>In her 2005 book <title level="m">Dickinson’s Misery</title>, Virginia
                        Jackson in effect shows how closely the “negative” labor of theoretical
                        scrutiny can resemble an anti-theory, à la Stanley Fish or Walter Benn
                            Michaels.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In their notorious essay
                            “Against Theory” (1982), Walter Benn Michaels and Stephen Knapp exempt
                            from their working definition of “theory” all “literary subjects with no
                            direct bearing on the interpretation of individual works, such as
                            narratology, stylistics, and prosody” (11). Introducing a recent
                            collection on new directions in literary studies published in a 2010
                            issue of <title level="j">PMLA</title>, Jonathan Culler similarly points
                            out that poetics as a field of inquiry actually includes narratology
                            within it. Thus poetics and narrative theory (or lyric poems and novels)
                            need not be taught in isolation or confrontationally. See Jarvis (2009)
                            and Wang for incisive and (in their own right) ambitiously “theoretical”
                            responses by British Romanticists to the work of Benn Michaels in
                            “Against Theory” and <title level="m">The Shape of the
                            Signifier</title>. Jackson deals with the implicitly enabling poetic
                            terms of “Against Theory”—and deftly exposes Benn Michaels’s “smash and
                            grab” style of argumentation—in <emph>Dickinson’s Misery</emph> 110-16.
                            Her resonant claim, pace <emph>both</emph> New Critical/ deconstructive
                            formalism and the neo-pragmatism of Knapp and Benn Michaels, is that
                            generic form is intentional or has come to be treated as the final locus
                            of intentionality. “[I]n order to interpret these lines [of “A Slumber
                            Did My Spirit Seal”] we will immediately ask a double-sided question
                            concerning the intentions of the author and the intentions of the form”
                            (114). Marc Redfield offers a summary to date (fall 2012) of the
                            astoundingly large field of theoretical inquiry around the eight lines
                            of “A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal.” </note> Jackson recasts this
                        construction of the dual, mutually subtending categories of the poem and
                        poet as an obfuscating history of “lyric reading” practices dependent on the
                        rise of institutional print culture. Like pop stars, post-Romantic poets are
                        almost universally seen as figures whose pretension to that identity
                        precedes its real achievement; so it is fascinating and fruitfully
                        problematic to consider examples of major poets such as Dickinson who may
                        never exactly have willed to be thought poets on the given terms, or their
                        writings “poems.” My Frost story would appear to bear Virginia Jackson’s
                        thesis out that “from the mid-nineteenth through the beginning of the
                        twenty-first century, to be lyric is to be read as lyric” in an arc toward
                        increasing generic abstraction.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Jackson,
                                <title level="m">Dickinson’s Misery</title> 6. Since he aimed so
                            concertedly at success as a lyric poet, Frost’s oeuvre (to my knowledge)
                            contains no examples as radical as any of the “poems” of Dickinson. But
                            consider a relatively unexceptional poem like “The Pasture”, which was
                            published both as a prologue to <title level="m">North of Boston</title>
                            in 1914, and as the prologue to Frost’s <title level="m">Complete
                                Poems</title> after his death. Famously and rather vapidly ending
                            with the line, “I sha’n’t be long.—You come too,” this lyric offers a
                            paradigm of abstracted non-specific address to the notional reader. Yet
                            its concrete address is exceptionally intense, sexual and even tacitly
                            suicidal. Biographer Lawrance Thompson situates “The Pasture” in a
                            context of passionate address to Elinor, inviting her to remember
                            “moments of lovemaking” (311). Just a few pages earlier in <title level="m">Robert Frost: The Early Years</title>, Thompson had
                            recounted a horrible memory of Lesley’s, in which her father woke her in
                            the night and brought her down to the parlor, then—pointing a gun toward
                            her mother and then toward himself—had asked her to choose: “‘Before
                            morning, one of us will be dead’” (308).</note> In Frost’s case, that
                        abstraction governs the shift from an “actual” material circuit of telephone
                        communications (the “sender” and “receiver” lend their roles to modern
                        linguistic theory as its paradigmatic example of language as a
                        communicational act), to the figural “music” conjured off a printed page.
                        Jackson’s book on Emily Dickinson thus presents a challenging, painstaking
                        brief concerning the widespread disciplinary “lyricization” that over time
                        has reduced the many richly addressed sub-genres of literary and
                        non-literary writing into a single, abstract, and overwhelmingly
                            <emph>poetic</emph> “literariness”; and her core contention about the
                        discursive framing of “lyric” or “poetic” ontology has basic, if also
                        complex, implications for our teaching the theory of Romanticism. If the
                        Jena Circle’s project of Romanticism carries within it an inaugural and
                        ineradicable theoretical investment, the classificatory model most often
                        bestowed upon British Romantic poets has leveled social, historical and
                        artistic differences to the point of nearly erasing the conceptual issues at
                        stake. </p>
                  <p>From one point of view, “Romanticism” in such an account has essentially a
                        schematic function. As opposed to the Keatsian nightingale and Shelley’s
                        skylark, Dickinson’s “homely American ‘bobolink’” and her letter-poem
                        enclosure of a whole dead cricket (Jackson 199, 91) manifestly show the
                        difference of her archive from the shared, interpretive-cum-creative, norms
                        of post-Romantic era publication culture.<note place="foot" resp="editors">But <emph>are</emph> bobolinks “homely”? See <ref target="https://youtu.be/ewW7XfD0EQU">Bird on
                                the Rebound</ref>.</note> Insofar as these comprise signature
                        effects of Romantic discourse, the framing conventions of metaphorical lyric
                        reference and the yearning for disembodiment come in for brilliant
                        restructuring at the hands of Dickinson (as opposed to the hands of a series
                        of editors and readers who then render her straight through their
                        conventional praise). Yet the argument of <title level="m">Dickinson’s
                            Misery</title> is held firmly in place by insisting that we deal
                        exclusively with the worn normative stereotypes of Romantic idealization:
                        the pressure is kept squarely on a (very real) disciplinary and popular
                        mainstream, in an effective though repetitive fashion. Jackson’s many
                        allusions to Keats are all equally—and almost as problematically—subject to
                        the miserable ease of pre-interpretation as holds in the case of Emily
                        Dickinson lyrics.<note place="foot">The recent film version of Keats’s life,
                            Jane Campion's <title level="m">Bright Star</title> (2009), in effect
                            reverses the scenario of lyric reading by recasting so many famous
                            poetics statements from the letters in a setting of intimate personal
                            communication with Fanny Brawne (see Grant F. Scott’s scrupulously sharp
                            review of the film in <title level="m">Studies in Romanticism</title>).
                            “I’ve come for my poetry class,” Fanny says to Charles Brown and to
                            Keats upon entering the room, at the start of a key scene in the film in
                            which Keats goes on to extemporize conversationally on the ideas of the
                            chameleon poet that we know so well from the letters. As teachers of
                            Romanticism and poetic theory, are we more in danger, then, of
                            overriding and abstracting the intimacy of personal address such as
                            Dickinson’s “letter poems” to Susan Gilbert? Or should we instead (or
                            concomitantly) pay attention to the danger of over-personalizing and
                                <emph>only</emph> reading biographically the often curiously
                            neutral, <emph>written</emph>, spaces of literature and its
                            genres?</note> British Romanticism gives the control group and makes for
                        the inert argumentative scarecrow of Jackson’s book in this sense; and
                        neither the concept of Romanticism nor any of the relevant poems themselves

                            Misery</title> asks how we have come to receive truly outsider textual
                            <emph>productions</emph> as canonical <emph>poems</emph> always to be
                        read by a certain light, given the posthumous conditions of poetic fame and
                        the disciplinary professionalization of literature, then Jackson’s study
                        bears down powerfully on Romantic coordinates. In his 1979 essay “Shelley
                        Disfigured,” Paul de Man began by noting the resistance of the Romantic
                        fragment to such monumentalization, while at the same time he acknowledged
                        up front that “Shelley’s last poem, is, as is well known, a fragment that
                        has been unearthed, edited, reconstructed and much discussed”: i.e., it has
                        served as the occasion of such a monumentalizing impulse nevertheless, and
                        (short of the text’s total loss) could hardly have eventuated in anything
                        else. Romanticism is thus the name for both a bracing contestatory failure
                        and that other kind of failure in which, as Barbara Johnson once remarked
                        with wryness and wisdom of deconstruction, “nothing fails like success”;
                        Romanticism is associated with that inevitable aftermath known as
                        “interpretive labor.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">See de Man (in Bloom,

                        toward the end, <emph>Dickinson’s Misery</emph> too emerges in a form of
                        what I judge to be quietist Romanticism, despite the book’s tone of
                        scholarly outrage, with Jackson’s courageously indigestible assertion she
                        does not want to be heard as saying that Dickinson’s posthumous career
                            <emph>should</emph> have unfolded much differently (204 ff). </p>
                  <p>The set of linked inquiries to follow from her study might well break down
                        some of our fundamental teaching goals (like seeing meaning as a matter of
                        thematic reference: the song of the bird), while fostering others (like the
                        specificity of material index: the cricket).<note place="foot">However the
                            matter of deconstruction is by no means done away with in framing the
                            contrast between a symbolic/thematic register of lyric reading and what
                            I here call the poem’s “material index” (i.e., an indexical versus an
                            abstract model of reference). Virginia Jackson thus writes about the
                            freezing and fixing effect that anthropomorphism has upon the lateral
                            movement of the signifying chain—the most famous conclusion of Paul de
                            Man’s “Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric” essay:<quote>The ‘this’
                                that Dickinson offers Susan [Gilbert Dickinson] is not a vehicle for
                                vicarious feeling; it is, and is not, to recall de Man’s definition
                                of lyric anthropomorphism, ‘an identification on the level of
                                substance,’ since it reverses the tropological process de Man
                                described when a figure ‘is no longer a proposition but a proper
                                name, as when the metamorphosis in Ovid’s stories culminates and
                                halts in the singleness of the proper name, Narcissus or Daphne or
                                whatever.’ Dickinson did not write to Susan, ‘This is my cheek,’ or
                                ‘this is my sorrow,’ or ‘this is my death,’ or ‘this is you.’ She
                                did not name the flower; by taking it from the woods, rather than
                                killing it she seems to have rescued it from being metamorphosed
                                into other names—or other poems. (<title level="m">Dickinson’s
                                    Misery</title> 231-2).</quote>For the later de Man, there is
                            indeed a material dimension that the paradigmatically “lyric” poem (and
                            poet, and critic) represses. It is precisely the materiality of
                            language, as a non-human (alternately divine or mechanical, but
                                <emph>not</emph> human) and extra-intentional system. So while, from
                            one perspective, Jackson’s procedure in this passage and throughout her
                            book brilliantly and cagily outstrips de Man by taking further his own
                            methodological insights, on another viewing Jackson’s approach seems to
                            desire to go so far outside the “Romantic” self-reflective theoretical
                            project of literature, that it is essentially <emph>pre</emph>-critical,
                            or—better said—its source of power is pre-critical. Much as Jackson
                            accuses de Man of doing (108), <title level="m">Dickinson’s
                                Misery</title> conducts a rational endgame according to the internal
                            dynamics of lyric reading, but it also casts its own spell. Jackson
                            retrieves the “open secret” of passion and traces a rich counterpoetics
                            of queer relationship in her commentary on Susan Gilbert Dickinson’s
                            1860 “Private” message (“I send / you this”) and the earlier
                            “deanthropomorphiz[ing]” lines Dickinson had sent to Susan in
                            1859—“Whose cheek is this?”—which rescue a real flower from poetic
                            personification (“I found her—‘pleiad’—in the woods / And bore her safe
                            away—” (230-1). But notice how Jackson’s passage lingers over the now
                            missing, carbonized flower—“Although the flower to which ‘this’ pointed
                            is no longer on the page for the word to point <emph>to</emph>, on the
                            manuscript its imprint is still visible” (228)—whereas de Man’s
                            “materiality” captures an aspect intrinsic to language. The strength of
                            Jackson’s commentary hence repeatedly stems from her recognition of how
                            Dickinson “folded other poetic genres” and signifying codes into her own
                            texts “that often point away” quite radically from modern generic
                            conventions and their interpretive violence (228). Symbolic reference is
                            at once meta-critically and literally folded into, or cited, in a
                            typical Dickinson archive “poem.” But success in anticipating this
                            hegemonic kind of “readability” is not at all the vector of her poetry’s
                            aspiration; if anything, it runs the opposite way. The danger of this
                            reading, however, is that it risks making the pathos of losing Hegelian
                            “sense-certainty” (the <emph>this</emph>; the flower rather than the
                            conventional poetic sign; and, in <title level="m">Dickinson’s
                                Misery</title>, the “open secret” of lesbianism) a terminus for
                            critical activity rather than its incitement. Hegel and, especially,
                            Derrida are largely omitted to a cost from Jackson’s discussion.</note>
                        What kinds of blinkers do we put on for students simply in running
                        (Romantic) poetry classes—insofar as the object of study is thereby already
                        constructed? What kinds of critical acts do communities of readers perform
                        to condition what counts as possible meaning, before our interpretation (a
                        “reading”) even starts? What individual cases besides Dickinson’s present an
                        unclassifiable archive as the heuristic prompt? Can we sustain the mission
                        of a “poetics” classroom (i.e., an enterprise whose descriptive methodology
                        is not supposed to be configured around a “hermeneutic” relation to meaning)
                        that is <emph>not </emph>constantly dragged back into interpretation? In
                        other words: can poetics be responsibly taught and pursued as a field all to
                        itself; or is its role essentially to produce a little saving distance in
                        view of the inevitable imperative that we interpret (we <emph>are</emph>
                        interpreting, “always already”) by some model? And if the latter, which of
                        the stages in the process of interpretive self-recognition as a class or a
                        course unfolds is the appropriately <emph>theoretical </emph>moment?
                        Finally, are there Romantic poets who don’t aspire, exactly, to be
                            <emph>poets</emph> or to write <emph>poems</emph> but who have been made
                        to—in the same way that all contestants definitely aspire to be pop stars on

                        their mouths?<note place="foot" resp="editors">Almost uniquely among
                            contemporary literary scholarship, Anne-Lise François’s work in <title level="m">Open Secrets</title> allows for the possibility of such
                            non-assertive utterance. Also (and not coincidentally) relevant here is
                            Ann Banfield, who in <title level="m">Unspeakable Sentences</title> once
                            postulated of narrative theory that the conditions of print culture and
                            writing are the enabling conditions of the modern subject: i.e., a third
                            person “objective” instantiation of the subject, a “self,” whose form is
                            not that of the morphological speaker (234). For Banfield, if “[t]he
                            ingredients for represented speech and thought are thus given in
                            universal grammar,” they <emph>appear</emph> historically rather than a
                            priori. The horizon of the modern “self” becomes visible and operative
                            only after the supersession of an exclusive “I”/ “you” (and “here,”
                            “now”) communicative scene. It is the intrinsic <emph>writtenness
                            </emph>of the modern third-person novel—which was historically
                            unexampled even though poetry of course too had long been an artifact of
                            writing—that supplies the kind of perspective first required to
                                <emph>have</emph> and see our<emph>selves</emph>. I will quickly
                            add, however, that this massive transition in the ideological and formal
                            horizons of material print culture should not be misunderstood in a
                            facile way as the supersession of lyric and its paradigmatic “I.” We are
                            dealing not with a myth and an empirical reality, but with conjuration
                            and cross-conjuration, a situation in which lyric pretenses themselves
                            can become the other of a hegemonic order of narrative. Whereas the
                            lyric poem (especially what W.R. Johnson calls “absolute lyric,” a
                            post-Romantic written discourse now entirely beyond the social
                            environments of a concrete addressee) persists in a spectral formal
                            continuation of the unmediated speech-act scene, this formal ritual is
                            already a displacement of the “constative” norm. What the ascendant
                            “realist” novel and narrative theory do, nevertheless, is to promise the
                            release of literature from the demand for <emph>any</emph> linkage to
                            ritual. </note> Few if any of the British Romantic poets incite
                        questions, like Dickinson, on a level as disarmingly basic as whether they
                        in fact composed and published “poems.” But the critical urgency and utility
                        of asking questions about <emph>generic</emph> rather than artistically
                        personal intent does register powerfully in a variety of teaching contexts

                  <p>That Frost as the master versifier of colloquial northern American speech—the
                        practitioner of what he termed “sentence sounds” capturing a syntactical
                        form beyond individual words and their semantic, intentional meanings—might
                        have also honed his craft this way offers a telling counterpoint to the
                        presuppositions of “high” Romantic mythmaking on the composition of lyric.
                        Frost writes about “sentence sounds” and “the sound of sense” often in his
                        letters during a stretch of years leading up to his publication of <title level="m">North of Boston</title> in 1914. The theory was in effect his
                        attempt to educate a small group of capable (and, as it turned out, mostly
                        British) readers. As strings of sound whose verbal character he theorized to
                        precede the meaning of the individual words out of which they were
                        comprised, for Frost “sentence sounds” are a kind of sub-musical linguistic
                        intonation contour, apprehended by the poet from his verbal culture as if
                        one were hearing a spoken conversation taking place on the other side of a
                        closed door. </p>

                        begin seminar discussion by pointing out how there is a striking resonance
                        of this intriguing prosodic theory of Frost’s to John Stuart Mill’s
                        enormously influential characterization of something like the “primal scene”
                        of lyric as a modern genre. We all know the gist of Mill’s 1833 “What is
                        Poetry?” essay, of course, where he evokes a stereotypically “Romantic” idea
                        of poetry more as a spirit than as a genre, a spirit found in the
                            “<emph>over</emph>heard” expression of “utterance of feeling,” against
                        the “<emph>heard</emph>” address of persuasive eloquence.<note place="foot">An accessible teaching source for Mill’s essay is <title level="m">The

                            1044-51. For Mill, famously, “[t]he peculiarity of poetry appears to us
                            to lie in the poet’s utter unconsciousness of a listener. Poetry is
                            feeling confessing itself to itself in moments of solitude” (1048).

                        allusive manner, Frost’s verbal, vocational, and fundamentally retrospective
                        (i.e., interpretive) attitude toward his own eavesdropping surely exists
                        with reference to Mill. Frost, devilishly, would know that it was he who had
                        been actively and secretly overhearing. Reversing Mill’s poles of the
                        (notional) writer and (literalized) audience, Frost was at liberty to listen

                        of inspiration; but there is also the authority of anonymity, imitative
                        authorship, authoritative translation, editorial, ethnographic, and

                     <emph>Where, when, and whom</emph> are we imagining the poetic “voice” to
                        come from if we claim to find it in the impossible sequestration of lyric
                        consumption away from markets of both publication culture and mass
                        sociality? In creating the dramatic monologue as an intensifying spoof of
                        Mill’s scene of lyric confession, early Tennyson and Browning merely follow
                        to its logical generic extreme the inference that the psyche of the
                        quintessential poetic speaker is unbalanced, sociopathic or just plain
                        crazy. In the classroom, a pairing of Edgar Allan Poe’s “Philosophy of
                        Composition” with “The Raven” can serve as a lively early-semester reading
                        assignment for almost any student level, to test out and instantiate what
                        results from this idea of poetry as self-communion. With an objective
                        precision that does not exclude his own role as a literary hoaxer and
                        puffer, Poe realigns the scene of poetic production with optimal consumption
                        in the “Philosophy of Composition” essay, which constructs after the fact of
                        “The Raven” a double portrait of melodramatic suffering and clearheaded
                        sadomasochistic willfulness. </p>
                  <p>To put my own Romanticist’s spin on what the Derry tour guide said, Robert
                        Frost, at least the young Frost of these striving apprentice years before
                            <title level="m">North of Boston</title>, both despised and emulated the
                        “language really used by men” that lay behind Wordsworth’s experiment in
                            <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>. The recurrently despondent
                        young Frost was not sure yet if he resembled Wordsworth the mature poet or
                        his marginal subjects, if he was the witness to representation or the person
                        who gazed with suicidal thoughts into small pools of water and mused whether
                        they were deep enough to drown in. If in his poetry Frost sought to produce
                        the effect of an immediate but non-specifiable “oversound,”<note place="foot" resp="editors">A word from the poem “Never Again Would
                            Birdsong Be the Same,” a poem which through the figure of Eve implies
                            there are gendered elements to Frost’s conception of the “sentence
                            sound.”</note> the living anthropological archive behind his lyric feat
                        was made of addressed communications, comprised of everyday intimacies that
                        “the poet” had gained access to and seems to have fecklessly violated. But
                        Frost’s approach, as most poetic theories do, has a multiplicity and
                        layering of functionalities that complicate any progressive linear narrative
                        available to analytical demystification. He sublimates the real content of
                        those overheard daily exchanges, to make from these materials a dynamic
                        frictional prosody that “breaks” sentence sound across the units of meter
                        and line. He exploits class privilege not only to record the slowly
                        disintegrating culture of failing New England farmers and itinerant country
                        laborers, but also to reinvigorate the quotidian life force of
                        Anglo-American poetry. Aligned broadly with Yeats and early Poundian
                        Imagism’s disapproval of mere poetic ornament, Frost’s commitment to the
                        “sound of sense” pushes back against the perception of an idealizing, ersatz
                        (i.e., “nonsense”) musicality of many late Victorian poets he grew up
                        admiring. Frost thus (just) saves the classic poetic tropes of “voice” and
                        “music” by exposing them to the contemporary truth of their
                            over-elaboration.<note place="foot">Yopie Prins offers a counterpoint
                            here; her work in a series of linked essays collectively entitled “Voice

                            to Simon Jarvis’s work), invests in the impersonality of musical
                            practice as a scientific or pseudo-scientific method in the poetic
                            theory of Sidney Lanier. For Prins, importantly, the “musicality” or
                            “harmony” of verse is not invoked as a generalizing “voice” metaphor,
                            but as an estranging mechanical techne that points up a mediating system
                            at work beyond expression.</note> By the same measure through which he
                        assumes the shared risk of bad faith ambitions to wrest common speech into
                        the domain of his own poetic voice, Frost also carries forward the

                  <p>A scan over my own syllabi serves merely as a personal reminder of the larger
                        realization that Romantic Poetry isn’t obviously at the forefront of current
                        literary theory. The field’s very centrality to twentieth century
                        methodological change—and to the twenty to thirty years of rapid
                        metabolization dating from the first translations of structuralism/
                        post-structuralism to America, the period known most narrowly as the heady
                        days of “theory”—is in part the cause of Romanticism’s current positioning,
                        on balance more reflective than experimental. The philosophical side of our
                        field especially has a dauntingly large buy-in cost of past learning for
                        aspiring young scholars. Romantic poetic theory played a covertly key role
                        in New Critical formalism; (positively, from these critics’ point of view)
                        it sponsored the organic element of thinking about poetic structure, and
                        (negatively) its sublime, or catachrestic, aspect set off the limits of
                        taste and a regulative sense of decorum. It was hot and cool at once to
                        study Romantic Poetry in the heyday of deconstruction;<note place="foot" resp="editors">I borrow the characterization of deconstruction as at

                        concepts and offered exemplary readings; and the energetic absorption of

                        chestnut, the French Revolution, has recharged a project of politics and
                        aesthetics on the left—somewhere between vibrant and violent—in the writings

                        imbrications of Romantic-era culture and writing with the rise of our modern
                        finance economy comprise a rich and urgent topic. </p>
                  <p>An entirely different—though not inconsistent—way to talk about the eclectic
                        standing of current Romantic Studies in relation to Theory would stress the
                        reminder that critical “theory” is itself of Romantic invention, not just a
                        creature of 1917 or 1968 that has been unhurriedly dying since 1989. In the
                        coda to his 2011 book <title level="m">Romantic Sobriety</title>, Orrin Wang
                        persuasively maintains that Romanticism’s extravagant way of foregrounding
                        the spectral character of literary values and non-values appears now as the
                        widespread “embarrassment” of the humanities in broader institutional
                        context. Yet, methodologically and imaginatively if not in administrative
                        terms, that very untimeliness continues to give our field its edge: “The
                        discursive operations of [Romanticism] thus provide a tropological resource
                        for understanding literature’s present predicament during the global
                        reorganization of knowledge in and beyond the humanities. [. . .]
                        If Romanticism has always been structured by its own legitimation crisis, so
                        has literature, a predicament whose present form we know today mostly
                        because of the meta-commentary of, and on, Romanticism.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Wang, <title level="m">Romantic Sobriety</title> 286-7.
                            Comparable in this respect, Sara Guyer’s work in <title level="m">Romanticism after Auschwitz</title> intricately as well as
                            insistently shows how the untimeliness of rhetoric and figure are the
                            theoretical legacy of Romanticism.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here one can read Wang as offering an important reply to Jackson’s argument
                        about the role of Romanticism in the normalizing and naturalizing project
                        she calls “lyricization.” Romanticism, Wang shows, continues to perform its
                        own “legitimation crisis,” and therefore its study may lend an invaluable
                        perspective to the present reorganization of the humanities in which all
                        literary modes of knowledge are made to appear ghostly and marginalized. </p>
                  <p>However in this essay I have shared some of my introductory approaches to the
                        practice of teaching “literary” or “poetic” ontology. I think it’s important
                        that we try to teach aspects of such a concept, and its associated
                        theoretical concerns, even though the terminology may sound daunting.
                        Because lyric poems are short and non-narrative, students going back to
                        those trained to do so by <title level="m">The Well-Wrought Urn</title> have
                        had a difficult time <emph>not</emph> making a microcosm of poetic form
                        (which need not be “closed” rather than open)<note place="foot">In his
                            lecture before the Harvard English Institute meeting on “Form,” Simon
                            Jarvis handled the assigned topic in a compelling way by reality testing
                            its force, and asked “what bad things happen to me if I avoid using this
                            word?” See Jarvis, “How to Do Things with Tunes: Or, Prose Rhythm
                            Today.” Following Boris Eikhenbaum, Jarvis invited those in attendance
                            to embrace the Russian Formalist distinction, “we are not formalists, we
                            are specifiers.” But would the conceptual cave-in that did not occur in
                            Jarvis’s enlivening talk have been the vengeance of form and not the
                            result of the intellectual configurations of those people present?
                            Presumably, if form were a real category of experience and analysis
                            rather than merely a badge to wear or discredit, then Jarvis was
                            inviting its return from repression in the only way possible.</note> and
                        treating a poem as a certain kind of organic or architectural
                            <emph>thing</emph>: an urn, a tree (and so treating its interpretation
                        implicitly). The New Critical move, in which the poem’s subject matter or
                        metaphorical tactics are handled as a blueprint for reading the poetry, is
                        too neat a student exercise when it works and is deeply corrosive of the
                        shared critical project when it is done unconsciously.<note place="foot">Brooks’s most influentially vapid remark on Keats’s “Ode on a Grecian
                            Urn,” for instance, is that it offers “a parable on the nature of
                            poetry” (153). However Brooks can anticipate Rancière: “the famous ode
                            was, for Keats, just such a poem, ‘palpable and mute,’ a poem in stone”
                            (151). And Brooks’s aesthetics of paradox can be harmonizing
                                <emph>and</emph> uncomforting: the urn is “deathless because it is
                            lifeless” (157). This motif of mute speech is also present in the
                            Wordsworth and Thomas Gray chapters of <title level="m">The Well-Wrought
                                Urn</title>
                     </note>We still need Paul de Man’s reminder (worth a few
                        dramatic bangs on the table in class, or what I call a principled “stupid”
                        insistence from my point of view as the teacher) that you can’t grow grapes
                        by the light of the <emph>word</emph> “day.”<note place="foot"> De Man, “The
                            Resistance to Theory” 11.</note> Especially after we’ve gotten through
                        reading the “Among School Children” chapter of <title level="m">The
                            Well-Wrought Urn</title>, which is a prototype of symbolic form and the
                        conflation of the logic of the poetical symbol with that of critical
                        practice, de Man’s remarks on the <emph>literal</emph> urgency of Yeats’s
                        so-called rhetorical question, “How can we know the dancer from the dance?,”
                        ought to have something like the analytical urgency and (near-) despair of
                        Shelley’s “Then what is life?” The categories of nature and history are too
                        poor and too lavish alike to answer such questions.</p>
                  <p>In class, I end this discussion of poetic ontology with a look at Helen
                        Vendler’s claim that Elizabeth Bishop’s posthumously published lyrics in
                            <title level="m">Edgar Allan Poe and the Jukebox</title> aren’t even
                        “poems” but “repudiated” objects. Vendler’s <title level="m">New
                            Republic</title> review has a clear theoretical application to debates
                        about authorial intent and the Foucauldian author function, but I find it
                        even more resonant as an unwitting rehearsal of how drastically a simple
                        “genre” term can frame the field of available meaning. A class exercise
                        involving the contrast of Elizabeth Bishop’s and Felicia Hemans’s <title level="m">Casabianca</title> poems effectively relates the social and
                        historical categories of lyric and narrative poetry. This generic or even
                        sub-generic divide has become—at its most flat and unproductive extreme—a
                        tacit judging standard of “good” and “bad” poems for many people in higher
                        education on both sides of the classroom; or, in Vendler's case, a test of
                        poetry that accedes to the status of a real “poem,” versus verse (!) which
                        is denied that status in such an exaggerative, indeed theological, way.
                        Having two students energetically read the absolutely sincere and yet
                        morosely funny, two-column poem on the death of Bishop’s toucan, “Uncle Sam”
                        (collected in <title level="m">Edgar Allan Poe</title>), will aid this
                        lesson and lighten the group dynamic of a graduate seminar inclined to
                        seriousness. In future iterations of this Romantically-oriented graduate
                        “Theory of Lyric” course, I am looking forward to incorporating two new
                        lessons on these issue of poetic ontology and lyric address: I want to open
                        up the syllabus more to avant-garde and post-war, post-modernist lyric
                        strategies, by looking at Frank O’Hara’s tongue-in-cheek “Personism”
                        Manifesto in the famous Donald Allen anthology; and to share George Oppen’s
                        “daybooks” and his unusually physical, accretive, method of revising his
                        poetry, where often new “versions” of a poem are marked by superimposed
                        layers of planks and wire and nails—not by an erasure. </p>
