               calls (from Latour, Sedgwick, Best and Marcus) to move beyond ideology critique invite
               us to rethink our teaching as well as our research practices. This essay asks what
               it would mean to exchange an emphasis on "theory" for one on "method." My suggestion
               is that focusing on method encourages a cultivation of knowledge as, specifically,
               a <em>knowing-how</em>, a form of intellectual labor that values adventurous collaboration over private

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In the fall of 2012 I taught a graduate seminar called “Romanticism as Method.” Why
                     method? Etymologically speaking, method (<span class="foreign">meta</span>-, after, beyond, alongside; <span class="foreign">hodos</span>-, way) can mean either a travelling-past or else a travelling-alongside. The latter
                     definition nicely approximates the various modes of unsuspicious reading lately proposed
                     in lieu of ideology critique, from Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s reparative reading to Sharon
                     Marcus and Stephen Best’s surface reading to Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht’s reading for the <span class="foreign">Stimmung</span>.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See Sedgwick, 123-51; Best and Marcus, 1-21; and Gumbrecht, “Reading,” 213-21. </span></div>
                     </div> The former gestures at the kind of criticism that adopts a “future-oriented vigilance”
                     with respect to the inevitable “bad surprise” of an artifact’s complicity in multiple
                     forms of historical injustice; such criticism has already “travelled past” the artifact
                     and knows what conditions it displaces or conceals (Sedgwick 130). The “method” of
                     my title thus aims to connote two widely available paths for contemporary literary
                     criticism. We might call those paths “Keatsian” and “Coleridgean,” in a nod to Keats’s
                     oft-invoked description of Negative Capability: a competence to “being in uncertainties,
                     Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact &amp; reason” defined against
                     Coleridge’s habit of “let[ting] go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the
                     Penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with half knowledge”
                     (Keats I:193). Romanticism, too, is caught between championing uncertainty as an intellectual
                     position and a skepticism concerning the mere appearance of reality, especially when
                     it threatens to obscure metaphysical or historical insight; if Coleridge is more interested
                     in metaphysics than history, the distrust of verisimilitude of which Keats accuses
                     him jibes with Best and Marcus’s controversial disapproval of criticism concerned
                     only with “meaning [that is] hidden, repressed, deep, and in need of detection and
                     disclosure by an interpreter.”</p>
               </div>
               <p>Another question to ask regarding the foundations of the course might be: why method
                  instead of theory? In 1986, Morris Eaves and Michael Fischer introduced their <em>Romanticism and Contemporary Criticism</em> with “the simple observation that English Romanticism is important to contemporary
                  literary theory.” The contributors to this volume—Northrop Frye, W.J.T. Mitchell,
                  J. Hillis Miller, M.H. Abrams, and Stanley Cavell—are described as “not only defin[ing]
                  Romanticism in different ways but also” using “it to underwrite strikingly different
                  theories of literature” (Eaves and Fischer 1). In 1986, Eaves and Fischer were on
                  solid ground. Today, the literature of the Romantic period has at best an anecdotal
                  relationship to the development of recently dominant theories of literature, and by
                  “dominant” I mean those that have had the most institutional and public traction.
                  The transhistorical character of cognitive literary studies demands little care for
                  distinctions of period or genre, although it has taken a special interest in the neophyte
                  representations of consciousness in the eighteenth-century novel; the novel, too,
                  continues to be a productive site for distant reading, data mining, and statistical
                  analysis. Pioneering work by Jerome McGann and Alan Liu notwithstanding, digital humanities
                  and new media theory, not to mention history of the book, find fruitful research programs
                  in the archives of the later nineteenth century more often than in Keats’s Great Odes
                  or Hazlitt’s essays. To presume that literary scholars in general, regardless of field
                  or specialization, would believe Romanticism to be constitutive of theory, or theory
                  to be indebted to Romanticism, seems old-fashioned, a relic of better times for Romanticism,
                  theory, and the humanities in general.</p>
               <p>“Romanticism as Method” begins, then, from the disheartening premise that the obsolescence
                  of theory—motored, at least in part, by high-profile spasms of apostasy like Bruno
                  Latour’s “Why Has Critique Run Out Of Steam?”—presents an especially acute problem
                  for students and scholars of Romanticism (Gumbrecht, “Response” 212-6). No longer
                  does it seem wise to justify one’s teaching or research on the assumption that “Romanticism,”
                  whether English, European, or Transatlantic, is integral to theory, because theory
                  itself no longer seems generally integral. If theory is evermore seen as a residual
                  mode of critical and pedagogical practice, how might Romanticism contribute to an
                  important public conversation on the “why” of research and teaching on its own terms?
                  This course is my own tentative exploration of that question. The turn away from theory
                  is motivated by interests that are variously reasonable and reactionary, and too numerous
                  to take on here. “Romanticism as Method” acknowledges that such a turn has taken place,
                  attends to the many social and disciplinary histories involved in such a turn, but
                  ultimately concentrates on developing alternative conceptions of Romanticism and of
                  scholarship that might be of some good to students seeking doctoral degrees. Replacing
                  theory with method means looking to Romanticism for its utility, not simply its power.
                  More crucially, it means reclaiming the language of utility from those metrics of
                  instrumental value—test scores, learning outcomes, impact factors, etc.—with which
                  teachers at all levels are increasingly familiar. </p>
               <p>The course I describe here is designed for first- and second-year graduate students,
                  though in this case I allowed more advanced auditors to participate. As a graduate
                  class, it focuses less on introducing students to a particular body of historical
                  literature than on acquainting them with ways that literature has been read, and on
                  finding new ways for us to read it together. Every week includes both required assignments
                  and suggestions for further reading, intended to help those students who do not arrive
                  already familiar with Romantic literature become conversant with its canonical and
                  semi-canonical authors. That said, although it emphasizes texts and topics I would
                  probably deem to difficult or too specialized for an undergraduate class, the principle
                  of utility is one which, I think, may be helpfully drawn into all manner of classroom
                  activities; so too is the ideal of experimentation and group improvisation a class
                  on “method” demands. Every classroom may become a laboratory, and while the professor
                  directs the experiment results are valued insofar as they are produced collaboratively.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">2. Romanticism, or Knowing How</span></h2>
               <p>When someone says that an activity <em>x</em> is “like riding a bike,” she means that <em>x</em> is an unnatural behavior it is possible to do, figuratively speaking, naturally;
                  she also implies that the doing of <em>x</em> is successful only if the person doing it forgets exactly how it is done. This is
                  a problem for pedagogy. If you have ever tried to teach someone how to ride a bike,
                  tie a knot, or write an essay, you have experienced just how hard it is to teach something
                  you are able to do because, to some extent, you have forgotten how to do it. It is
                  from such a forgetting that instincts are trained, through the eviction from conscious
                  thought of the astonishing alchemy of training and habit, sinews and synapses, conventionality
                  and improvisation that all together keep us going, aloft on the bike. Incidentally,
                  this process also describes Wordsworth’s method for falling in love with your child:
                  you just do it over and over again until, “with patient mind enforced/To acts of tenderness”
                  you no longer have to think twice (Wordsworth 166-7).</p>
               <p>The philosopher Jason Stanley defines “know-how” as the knowledge that something is
                  true—a proposition based, in turn, on the claim that all knowledge is founded in our
                  capacity to imagine acting on such knowledge in a practical way (Stanley). Heidegger
                  suggests that “the less we just stare at the hammer-thing, and the more we seize hold
                  of it and use it, the more primordial does our relationship to it become, and the
                  more unveiledly is it encountered as that which it is—as equipment” (Heidegger 98).
                  Certainly when it comes to research, writing, and teaching, such activities benefit
                  from a certain disinhibition, akin to the paradoxical acquisition of a “primordial”
                  muscle memory. That said, when it comes to teaching graduate students, it seems necessary
                  both to teach the know-how of scholarship and to keep students productively alienated
                  from what they are doing when they are doing it. In the context of graduate coursework,
                  this means creating opportunities not only to think about thinking but, more explicitly,
                  to read about reading and write about writing. “Romanticism as Method” is designed
                  to meet these ends. All assignments had to reflect actual demands made upon actual
                  academics: students would write weekly response papers, give brief in-class presentations
                  on primary-source material no one else in the room (besides the professor) had read,
                  analyze the structure and style of a published article in their field and, at the
                  end of term, give a talk on preliminary research for their seminar paper, which would
                  be an article-length piece of work. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>This is all very standard. The less orthodox dimensions of the course are evident
                     in the reading list, which places four works of criticism at its center: two classic
                     texts that position themselves explicitly with reference to theory, specifically to
                     post-structuralism and new historicism, and two more recent books which take up the
                     legacies of that earlier moment but do something very new with them. I chose books
                     that had been important to me, so important their names came immediately to mind when
                     I began planning the course: Paul De Man’s <em>The Rhetoric of Romanticism</em> (1984), James Chandler’s <em>England in 1819: The Politics of Literary Culture and the Case of Romantic Historicism</em> (1998), Anne-Lise François’s <em>Open Secrets: The Literature of Uncounted Experience</em> (2007), and Mary Favret’s <em>War at a Distance: Romanticism and the Making of Modern Wartime</em> (2009). I also asked students to purchase Paul Fry’s <em>Theory of Literature</em> (2012), a transcription of his undergraduate lecture course, or to access individual
                     lectures for free online through Open Yale Courses.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                              where they may download the talks as audio files.</span></div>
                     </div> Graduate students come into the classroom with disparate levels of familiarity and
                     facility with the building blocks of advanced literary study. Asking everyone to keep <em>Theory of Literature</em> on hand was intended as a democratizing gesture, and it also served a practical purpose:
                     students who needed to take an ad-hoc crash-course in, say, Saussurian linguistics,
                     or to remind themselves what exactly Foucault means by “discourse,” could turn to
                     Fry as a reliable and, helpfully, not completely neutral source of information. After
                     seven weeks of reading through these four critical texts alongside primary materials
                     (discussed below), we turned to articles or book excerpts by Celeste Langan, Colin
                     Jager, Rei Terada, Kevis Goodman, and Marjorie Levinson; on the first day of class
                     students also read Maureen McLane’s “Romanticism, or Now.” The principle of selection
                     in this instance was determined by what I take to be emerging trends within the field,
                     as well as by a special interest in tactical uses of critical voice and style.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As for the primary texts, it seemed to me that an emphasis on the “Big Six” version
                     of the Romantic canon—the one which limits itself to Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge,
                     Byron, Shelley, and Keats—would provide a solid, albeit conservative, counterpoint
                     to the improvisatory aegis of the course. Each week featured a chapter from two of
                     the books mentioned above or one scholarly article, and a selection of Romantic poetry
                     or, occasionally, prose. In contrast to an undergraduate course, where I like to assign
                     secondary materials that explicate or contextualize the historical ones, the principle
                     of pairing and selection here is less strict. We read Keats with Chandler and <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> with François, but we also welcome unexpected or surprising dialogues between De Man’s
                     “Symbolic Landscape in Wordsworth and Yeats” and Hazlitt’s <em>Spirit of the Age</em>. Stumbling into an unforeseen confluence between texts, whether critical or literary,
                     is not only something we ought to value in our research process, it also just happens.
                     One of my goals here is to push students toward a non-instrumental relationship to
                     criticism, to persuade them that reading a good book in any field, on any subject,
                     will open up new pathways of thought that will be helpful to them at one time or another.
                     I believe we are all fatigued by studies promising to give an interpretation of some
                     poem or novel through one “angle” at a time, Morris Zapp-style.

                              commentaries” on her work, each of which will “examine the novels from every conceivable

                     </div> This sort of pedantic relationship to theory, or to the more constrained genre of
                     criticism, is one current students should consider it their historical privilege to
                     reject. At the same time, limits must obtain for even the most expansive, ecumenical
                     model of criticism, if indeed it wants to say something genuinely interesting. Finding
                     oneself forced to read Hazlitt with de Man is an exercise in testing the limits of
                     what constitutes a good match of text with critic. It may be that Hazlitt and de Man
                     have nothing to say to each other, and in this awkward silence some new intelligence
                     about both writers emerges. Staging such labored, even impossible conversations is,
                     the syllabus suggests, vital to both the precision and the creativity of our research
                     practices.</p>

               <p>To use Romanticism as a method is to assemble a toolkit out of phrases like “Negative
                  Capability,” “gusto,” “they may be called poetry by that figure of speech which considers
                  the effect as a synonym of the cause,” or “Labour well the Minute Particulars,” as
                  Goodman has done with William Cowper’s “loopholes of retreat” and Levinson with Wordsworth’s
                  numerical tropes (Goodman, especially 67-105; Levinson, “Of Being Numerous,” especially
                  652; and Levinson, “Notes and Queries”). But the kit must be filled with phrases of
                  our own making, too, and this is where the weekly reading responses, posted on our
                  online discussion board, come in. Students are encouraged to consider these as low-stakes
                  venues for being propositional and adventurous. They may write, if they choose, in
                  the style of one of the Romantic or contemporary authors we are reading. The goal
                  is not parody but posture, walking in someone else’s shoes. It is, moreover, an attempt
                  to realize that style, including phrasemaking, is constitutive of method. Writing
                  like Hazlitt alters how you read a poem (or a person) and determines what kinds of
                  claims you may advance about them. A criticism that “smokes,” in the Keatsian sense,
                  might approach the condition of poetry by always being one step ahead of its reader
                  or might treat the readerly impulse to understand as the very condition of its own
                  opacity (Keats, <em>Letters</em> II, 174). Are there times when it is productive to smoke the readers of our work?
                  And what about owning up to those moments when the poem smokes us (“That is all ye
                  know on earth, and all ye need to know”), and we feel unable to understand it in any
                  robustly satisfying way? What goes into the vocabulary of confusion, blockage, dismay,
                  or, as both Terada and McLane put it, “impasse,” and how might we apply it creatively
                  (McLane 143; Terada 275-309)? After a reader confesses she has no idea what is going
                  on in a particular line or passage, can that blindness borrow the form of an insight,
                  however limited or diffident? The language of confusion, and sometimes of irritation
                  or resentment, enters our class’s semi-private lexicon, which grows from week to week
                  and preserves both our frustrations and our attempts to relinquish them.</p>
               <p>Class discussion is also directed toward the collective elaboration of a variety of
                  interpretive procedures and points of view, specifically as they might be drawn from,
                  and not merely applied to, the text at hand. To present one example, our seventh class
                  is spent reading one of the less obviously interesting books of the 1805 <em>Prelude</em>, namely Book XII. We choose a passage to look at closely based on the evidence the
                  group gives for being bored—perhaps smoked—by this part of the text. In this instance,
                  the class swiftly converges on Wordsworth’s critique of pastoral in lines 184-215.
                  The professor throws out a phrase: dead time, as in “there are moments of dead time
                  in <em>The Prelude</em>, moments that seem unnecessary to the elaboration of the poem or the book.” A student
                  offers a comparison between “dead time” and “spots of time”; perhaps both are indispensable
                  to “the growth of a poet’s mind.” Since we have been reading <em>Open Secrets</em>, the group begins to wonder about the relationship between dead time and the temporality
                  of “nonemphatic revelation.” A consensus emerges that they are not the same thing,
                  but that François offers a way to make sense of Wordsworth’s rejection of fussy, pictographic
                  pastoral. A cluster of early modernists address the significance of the Shakespeare
                  plays to which Wordsworth alludes here, while another student, a committed dramaturge,
                  proffers information on how pastoral elements figure in the theatrical productions
                  of the late eighteenth century. Another student, this one preparing for her comprehensive
                  exams and interested in the history of science and medicine, speculates on the cognitive
                  implications of “dead time,” while another aligns Wordsworth’s literary-critical digression
                  with Hazlitt’s essays in <em>The Spirit of the Age</em>.</p>
               <p>The professor takes to the board, and gradually a piece of crowd-sourced scholarship
                  emerges, a group effort that would be impossible without a serious engagement with
                  multiple forms of knowledge. If this phantom piece of writing ever becomes a manuscript,
                  some elements will be amplified, others edited out. The point of the exercise is to
                  show that: having many ways into a text is not the same thing as being without method;
                  scholarship is by definition collaborative, even if it is just you, Wordsworth, and
                  a pencil; exegesis means false starts and wrong turns; it’s good not to bring too
                  much ego into the room; be patient and curious, good poems can be tedious for good
                  reasons; learning means learning how to teach, how to tell your reader, your students,
                  your colleagues what you know in such a way that they may be said to know it now,
                  too. For graduate students who are going on to careers as teachers, either in the
                  academy or elsewhere, the classroom should always be a primarily pedagogical space
                  with lines of instruction and reception running in several directions, some predictable
                  and others less so. </p>
               <p>It may seem overly tidy to assert that these are the lessons I myself learned from
                  Romanticism, and from Romanticism’s best critics, although that is what I believe.
                  Likewise, too, the principle that it is all right for work to be difficult and understanding
                  slow—things one may plausibly tell graduate students, if not our increasingly harried
                  undergraduates, at the very beginning of their academic careers. For those who have
                  the luxury of encouraging digressive learning in the classroom, the model of learning-by-doing
                  brings together more aleatory and indirect modes of instruction with a pragmatic ability
                  to make something, knock it down, and start again, using the highly modular and sustainable
                  resources of one’s own brain. “My head,” as Thoreau bafflingly says, “is an organ
                  for burrowing,” and how many wider and deeper trails might be dug by the collaborative
                  work that allows us to read, think, teach, and travel along—or rather, alongside—multiple
                  pathways (Thoreau 82)? “Romanticism as Method” really means Romanticism as implement,
                  tool, gizmo, hammer-thing, equipment. With it we work to make, among other things,
                  more Romanticism.</p>
