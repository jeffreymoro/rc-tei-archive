               and "practice." At stake more broadly is the problematic notion of use (and misuse),

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In a recent and widely read <em>n+1</em> piece, Nicholas Dames reflects on what happened when a generation of writers raised
                     on theory began asking questions about how theory shaped them, as both writers and
                     human beings. In those works (by Franzen, Eugenides, Egan, Moore, Cole, etc.) <span class="quote">‘Theory is judged from within the forms it tried to dismantle (psychological realism;
                        the bildungsroman), by criteria Theory could only recognize as regressive or naïve:
                        What kind of a person does Theory make? What did it once mean to have read theorists?
                        What does it mean now? How does Theory help you hold a job? Deal with lovers, children,
                        bosses, and parents?

                        </div>’</span> In Dames’s account, Theory, which he capitalizes throughout, becomes a kind of unified
                     thing or shared experience, and “novelistic realism” becomes the form with which to
                     best investigate it. Dames is careful not to caricature that realism, just as he resists
                     caricaturing Theory. Realism for him is capacious, both in the forms it takes and
                     the ideas it swallows; <em>Middlemarch</em> obviously counts as a realist novel of ideas, but so do <em>Tristram Shandy</em>, <em>JR</em>, and <em>The Crying of Lot 49</em>. For Dames, the question is: can realism, or rather today’s realism, swallow theory?
                     Is it, in Dames’s words, one of realism’s Others?</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Absent from Dames’s narrative is another one of realism’s Others, Romanticism. If
                     it shows up at all, it does so under the guise of “that most antique of realist modes,”
                     the bildungsroman. In a related study, Judith Ryan’s <em>The Novel After Theory</em>, Romanticism is similarly a kind of ur-stage of Theory. And Theory itself must in
                     turn be integrated into the concreteness of a novel’s scenes and story.

                              moving closer to Derrida and bricolage. What exactly Romanticism’s “bounds” are, or
                              whether they don’t extend to Derrida, or whether Romanticism is something “bounded”

                     </div> Given the contemporary writers who interest Dames and Ryan, it makes sense that Romanticism
                     would be off the menu. But I think their approaches raise larger questions about a
                     constellation of topics—Realism, Romanticism, Theory, History, Form, and Narrative—that
                     have recently been re-opened in our field. I have in mind, among other things, Tilottama
                     Rajan’s strong defense of Romantic “narrativity” (a kind of working Theory) against
                     what she sees as the normalizing influence of the “(Victorian) Novel.”

                     </div> As an institution or practice of reading, the Novel’s impact, for Rajan, happens in
                     the real world. It shapes disciplinary boundaries, such as the ongoing collapse of
                     Romantic and Victorian into Nineteenth-Century Studies, and it conditions our expectations
                     of people and organizations.</p>
               </div>
               <p>At stake in all of these diverse accounts is the problematic notion of use. “Use”
                  (and “misuse”) resonates with a recurring theme in recent discussions of the humanities:
                  how to use literature—which literature, or which theory, and for what ends. The question
                  seems particularly pressing for Romanticism, which consistently resists an idea of
                  instrumentality more amenable, one would think, to other periods or modes. Because
                  of that resistance Romanticism becomes a kind of paradigm of literary studies more
                  generally. So we now ask how and whether Romanticism—or Romantic texts, or Romantic
                  reading practices, or even Romantic ways of being with the world—can or should be
                  instrumentalized. Late in his essay Dames brings up that very question with respect
                  to the related problem of teaching: “what does Theory do for its former students in
                  these novels?” His answer is as surprising as it is unsettling: “Theory, it turns
                  out, is less intellectually powerful than emotionally useful; it habituates you to
                  the anomic, precarious existence you were destined to lead in any case.” Of course,
                  this isn’t exactly Dames’s answer, nor (God forbid) my own. It is the novelists’,
                  and it sounds perversely marketable to critics of the usefulness of the humanities.
                  Not to show the fly the way out of the flybottle but to model its twists and turns
                  and make it livable. Theory in this reading is mimetic or therapeutic—a puzzling position
                  for something often defined by its resistance to representation or its unsettling
                  of habit. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Problematic, too, seems the novelists’ treatment of emotion or affect in Dames’s account,
                     a topic explored and complicated by recent work in Romanticism (often by Romanticists
                     the same age as Dames’s novelists, a very different “Theory Generation”). Speaking
                     of Rei Terada’s <em>Feeling in Theory</em> in his own <em>Blake’s Agitation: Criticism and the Emotions</em>, Steven Goldsmith explores the way in which emotion exceeds subjectivity. “The real
                     strangeness of emotion’s subjectlessness,” he writes, “rubs critically against the
                     ideological fullness and familiarity of identity-affirming experience. . .The emotion
                     that survives in and as criticism still carries an unsettling electric charge” (Goldsmith
                     278). Yet it seems safe to say that what’s missing in Dames’s characterization of
                     a generation’s relationship to Theory, Goldsmith’s “criticism,” is that “unsettling
                     electric charge.” If we think of Theory (and perhaps Romanticism) as a kind of “lightning
                     which has yet found no conductor,” the question becomes how to “conduct” that charge
                     in a class. Following Ohm’s 1827 discovery, I suggest that the answer might have something
                     to do with resistance, especially theory’s inherent resistances and the formal resistances
                     posed by literary texts.

                              or resistance not unlike literary form’s. Even “rhetorical readings,” the most elastic
                              kind of reading for de Man, “still avoid and resist the reading they advocate. Nothing
                              can overcome the resistance to theory since theory is itself this resistance” (“The
                              Resistance to Theory,” 19). Thinking with Susan Wolfson’s “formalist activism,” Goldsmith
                              argues that “By attending to the specificity of literary language, readers participate
                              in a text’s resistance to cultural generalization. No one’s words should …</span></div>

                  <p>My point in bringing up Dames’s (quite teachable) essay is to show what Theory and
                     Romanticism seem to be up against. But in these reflections I would like to bracket
                     the question about generations’ differing relations to Theory, pressing as it might
                     be, and focus on a problem complexly related to the question of resistance: how to
                     use theory to get students to think differently about—or with—Romanticism. In my experience
                     it is a rare student who readily grasps—much less is enthusiastic for—critical theory
                     if they are not putting it to use either in reading a line of poetry, in a discussion,
                     in an essay, in a thesis, in their own lives. This has little to do, I believe, with
                     an anemic curiosity, much less with a lack of ability or willingness to think abstractly.
                     It has to do, in my experience, with a lack of resistance. For students unfamiliar
                     with it, Theory often appears in the guise of either a punishing authority figure
                     or as a kind of crystalline, frictionless surface. In the first instance, Theory seems
                     inaccessible because It is pure resistance: It knows everything you don’t; It thinks
                     in ways that seem unthinkable; It has anticipated your own criticism of it.

                     a healthy resistance between Theory and Romantic texts. I have divided it into two
                     sections:

                     </ol> So: opposition and force, concepts complexly related to resistance and use, formulated
                     and marshaled differently by different thinkers. My examples are Badiou and Kant.

                              of poetic language to exceed the grasp of empirical consciousness—for example, by
                              breaking free from spatial and temporal metaphors that draw on an empirical world

                              after Kant. The ability to communicate the feeling of reason transcending cognitive
                              experience also brings with it internally a ‘withdrawal’ of communicability. The language

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Among contemporary theorists, Romanticism has found few opponents as strident as Badiou.
                     Romanticism for him collapsed philosophy and history, truth and poetry; it also lifted
                     “Romantic” fusion up as the ideal of love. I have found this blunt resistance useful
                     for thinking through a number of Romantic texts, particularly those where it turns
                     out that Badiou’s thinking is only minimally different from what he’d purportedly
                     critique. My case study there is Shelley, who shares a philosophical heritage with
                     Badiou in the figures of Plato and Lucretius. He also holds, of course, a Badiou-ian
                     “fidelity” to the spirit of the French Revolution. In the second part, I move on to
                     a discussion of Kant, a seldom-taught but oft-referenced figure in Romantic literature
                     courses. I look at some moments where he explicitly discusses the interrelationship
                     between theory and practice, and explain how and why I teach German Idealism in my
                     literature courses. These kinds of minimal differences create productive tensions,
                     like those between two drafts of a poem. They are perhaps akin, on a larger scale,
                     to those between Theory and Romanticism. What David Clark has called Theory’s thrumming
                     afterlife feeds on those tensions.

               <p>Badiou has claimed his project is tied to education, a fact articulated in his recent
                  translation of Plato’s <em>Republic.</em> In his introduction to that work, Kenneth Reinhard notes that “for Badiou, education
                  is not merely an activity of proper cultivation. . . it requires the <em>interruption</em> of ‘the consensual routine’ of culture through the experience of an ‘event’ and the
                  subjective reorientation that it involves” (Badiou , <em>Plato’s Republic</em>, xx). The same is true, Reinhard continues, for Badiou’s free translation of Plato.
                  It “forces” Plato’s text, and our reading of it, to expand. I will later describe
                  Badiou’s more technical use of <em>force</em>, and how it is used in Kant. Force and resistance link the two halves of this essay.
                  But I also want to preserve the word’s basic impulse. I often teach a work to “force”
                  myself to think differently about it; students sometimes take classes so that they
                  are “forced” to read a difficult text that they might not get through on their own;
                  and I am consistently “forced” to teach something differently based on how students,
                  or other texts, resist (or do not resist) it. The classroom—and the readings and assignments
                  that condition it—can be a space for recognizing and enabling this energetic play
                  of forces and resistances.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Before getting into my case studies of Kant and Badiou, it might help to step back
                     again and ask: what is theory? One answer comes in the talk Derrida gave in the 1966
                     Johns Hopkins conference that allegedly started it all. In “Structure, Sign and Play,”
                     Derrida says that two things happen when the distinction between Nature and Culture
                     (or any two fundamental supports to a structure) begin to break down: either a) you
                     think you can “deconstitute” those concepts by historicizing them and “stepping outside”
                     of philosophy—which, according to Derrida, most typically simply reinstitutes the
                     very metaphysics one was avoiding. Or, b) you can, like Levi-Strauss, try to use those
                     broken concepts, with the understanding that they can be discarded; “to preserve as
                     an instrument something whose truth value he criticizes.” Or, says Derrida in reference
                     to Genette, “<span class="foreign">bricolage</span> is critical language itself,” and “<span class="foreign">bricolage</span> criticizes itself.”

               </div>
               <p>Theory’s vexed relationship to use and <span class="foreign">bricolage</span> turns up in a formulation by Fredric Jameson, one which I think is worth quoting
                  at length: <span class="quote">‘. . . dialectic belongs to theory rather than philosophy: the latter is always haunted
                     by the dream of some foolproof self-sufficient system, a set of interlocking concepts
                     which are their own cause. . .Theory, on the other hand, has no vested interests inasmuch
                     as it never lays claim to an absolute system, a non-ideological formulation of itself
                     and its ‘truths’; indeed, always itself complicit in the being of current language,
                     it has only the vocation and never-finished task of undermining philosophy as such,
                     by unraveling affirmative statements and propositions of all kinds. We may put this
                     another way by saying that the two great bodies of post-philosophical thought, marked
                     by the names of Marx and Freud, are better characterized as unities of theory and
                     practice: that is to say that their practical component always interrupts the ‘unity
                     of theory’ and prevents it from coming together in some satisfying philosophical system.
                     Alain Badiou has recently coined the expression ‘anti-philosophy’ for these new and
                     constitutively scandalous modes of intervening conceptually in the world. (Jameson
                     7-8)’</span> I find this interrupting of theory by practice—and, as we shall see with Kant, theory’s
                  interrupting practice—appealing, particularly within the context of teaching. At least
                  for me, teaching is always experimental. In its best instances it has interrupted
                  both my theories and my practices of reading.</p>

                  <p>“History does not exist. There are only disparate presents whose radiance is measured
                     by their power to unfold a past worthy of them.” This is Badiou’s challenge at the
                     end of <em>Logics of Worlds</em> (509). It is a challenge not only to historicism, but also to Romanticism, which Badiou
                     elsewhere calls the “philosopheme” of historicism. It is a contemporary problem since,
                     for Badiou, “the historicist kernel of romanticism continues to be the referential
                     site of our thinking” (“Philosophy and Mathematics” 97). Earlier in <em>Logics of Worlds</em> Badiou makes a now-famous distinction between “democratic materialism” and “materialist
                     dialectic.” The former, which he identifies with the present (and thus with his versions
                     of historicism and Romanticism), makes the “natural” assumption that <em>there are only bodies and languages</em>. The latter, which Badiou describes as his own position, declares that <em>there are only bodies and languages, except that there are truths</em> (4). For Badiou, a truth isn’t the correspondence between proposition and world. That
                     would reduce it to being a simple relationship between language and bodies, a kind
                     of knowledge. Rather, a truth is a procedure that punctures our knowledge of the world
                     and opens up new possibilities for it; because being always exceeds knowledge, truths
                     are infinite and eternal, immanent and everywhere. Exploring what exactly a truth
                     is (or does) takes up major portions of both volumes of <em>Being and Event</em>; he is, in fact, planning a third devoted to just that question, entitled <em>The Immanence of Truths</em>.

                              its relationship to both Lacan and Cohen, is particularly incisive: “To be sure, Badiou
                              is a thinker of force or action, but the genesis of this force finds its origin not
                              in any vital energy as the possibility of existence, but rather in the internal impasses
                              which render the conceptual closure of any situation impossible. Subjective action
                              is what follows from this impossibility.” The Mathematics of Novelty, 15; see also

                     </div> They are wagers. Constructing truths forces the future to reorganize itself in such
                     a way that it can decide upon them. “A forcing is a powerful fiction of a <em>completed</em> truth. Starting with such a fiction, I can <em>force </em>new bits of knowledge, without even <em>verifying </em>this knowledge” (Philosophy and Truth” 48-49).</p>
               </div>
               <p>I bring up Badiou’s koans about history and the present, about bodies, languages and
                  truths, because I have found them to be productive challenges to Romanticism’s received
                  ideas—both in my own thinking, and in the classroom. Indeed, Badiou’s description
                  of <em>forcing truths </em>sounds a lot like pedagogy. They ask us to confront our most basic assumptions: why
                  we read what we read, and why do so in the way that we do. Such questions can be posed
                  very generally: <em>is </em>Romanticism really, at core, an approach to history? What about competing kinds of
                  Romanticisms? And is Romanticism really <em>the </em>“referential site” for “our thinking”? What would that mean? Who would “we” be, in
                  such a case? Can we think differently than we do—and if so, how do we want to think?</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>These are, obviously, important large-scale questions that can be broached in a course
                     on Romanticism. But in my experience Badiou is even more effective at a smaller scale.
                     When teaching “Mont Blanc” in a graduate course, recently, I had the students read
                     widely in the history of skepticism: the first half of Hume’s <em>Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding</em>; a chapter from Cavell’s <em>In Quest of the Ordinary: Lines of Skepticism and Romanticism</em>; Eckhart Förster on the genesis of Kant’s first critique; the final paragraphs of
                     de Man’s “Shelley Disfigured”; and Wasserman’s “The Poetry of Skepticism.” Plus Badiou’s <em>Second Manifesto for Philosophy </em>and the preface and conclusion to <em>Logics of Worlds</em>, where he tries to describe our contemporary skepticism. When in our reading of “Mont
                     Blanc” we reached the section about the “still cave of the witch Poesy,” someone brought
                     up Badiou’s declaration that <em>there are only bodies and languages, except that there are truths.</em> The question—whether in “Mont Blanc” there is anything other than language and bodies—immediately
                     catalyzed the discussion of the poem. What, in Shelley, constitutes a body, or a language,
                     or a “truth”? The question can be fruitfully posed with respect to individual lines:

                     from “On Love” (“the chasm of an insufficient void”) and <em>The Defense of Poetry</em>: “the before unapprehended relations of things” (§3); “the universal element with
                     which [poetry] has perpetual sympathy” (§8); “new intervals and interstices whose

                     </div> Those familiar with Badiou will detect a certain resonance between his and Shelley’s
                     terms: love, void, universal, relations, thought, and so forth. Teasing out the differences
                     and similarities between Badiou’s and Shelley’s use, when it’s going well, compels
                     us to read each anew. The goal is not to send the students into the icy abstractions
                     of <em>Being and Event</em> or category theory, but rather to prompt them to rethink texts they’ve already read.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Surprisingly, for Badiou the link between philosophy and art, since Plato, has always
                  been education. This is true, he says, no matter what our actual beliefs about art
                  are—whether we think it is a simulation of the truth (the <em>didactic </em>schema), the only path toward the truth (the <em>romantic </em>schema), or a human endeavor distinct from truth-seeking (the <em>classical </em>schema). Badiou himself tries to synthesize these views by declaring that art creates
                  its own truths, separate from both philosophy and the other “conditions” of truth
                  (science, politics, and love). Therefore, “art is pedagogical for the simple reason
                  that it produces truths and because ‘education’ (save in its oppressive or perverted
                  expressions) has never meant anything but this: to arrange the forms of knowledge
                  in such a way that some truth may come to pierce a hole in them. What art educates
                  us for is therefore nothing apart from its own existence. The only question is that
                  of <em>encountering </em>this existence” (“Art and Philosophy” 9). I think that one thing that theory can do
                  for students is help generate that encounter, or (for us as well) generate it anew.</p>
               <p>But on first blush Badiou’s formula would seem to play into the hands of critics claiming
                  that the arts and humanities simply create their own standards, ones distinct from
                  the more useful truths pursued by science and the social sciences. On such an account
                  the arts (and many of the humanities) therefore become allied with something personal
                  and transitory like love, which—though perhaps “important”—does not deserve sustained
                  scholarship or funding. Of course, it would be hard to imagine such critics endorsing
                  Badiou’s notions of science or politics. Neither are producers of knowledge, but rather
                  of truth—truth defined, again, as a kind of puncturing of our knowledge of the world
                  we find ourselves in. </p>
               <p>But why this cordoning off of domains of inquiry? Could Francis Bacon be, as Shelley
                  calls him, “a poet”? Perhaps Badiou’s more recent thoughts on the relationship between
                  truth procedures (art, politics, science, love) would strike us as closer to a Romantic
                  notion of the interlinking of fields: <span class="quote">‘We need a theory of what I call the networking or the tying together of truth procedures.
                     Eventually, I see no reason why this could not be called ‘culture’. . . Indeed, we
                     can consider culture to be a network of various forcings, that is, at a given moment
                     in time, the manner in which the encyclopedic knowledge of the situation is modified
                     under the constraints of various operations of forcing which depend on procedures
                     that are different from one another. (“Can Change Be Thought?” 315)’</span> In a work like <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, the relationship and potential differences between love and politics (and art) is
                  a real problem for Shelley, one which Badiou can help frame. While my experience has
                  been with using Badiou to think with Shelley, and vice versa—pairing, say, “What Is
                  Love?” with <em>Epipsychidion</em> or <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>—I imagine the same might be done with other Romantic writers. That same conflict
                  of fields, for instance, occurs in Blake, or Coleridge, or Keats, or Byron, or Scott,
                  or Mary Shelley. More important than any resonance that might arise from placing Badiou
                  with one of them would be the resultant resistances. The oppositions Badiou poses
                  to Romanticism are often surprisingly clear, capturable in short selections or even
                  single sentences. That clarity has helped hone my own thinking as well as, I hope,

               <p>German philosophy’s influence on the English poets and thinkers has been long discussed,
                  contested, and caricatured. I find a basic familiarity with it is helpful for entering
                  those debates, and for thinking about how we do literary criticism more generally.
                  In other words, I think its use extends beyond Romanticism. So I turn now from an
                  instance of contemporary theory, to theory that would have been contemporary for the
                  Romantics. I address notions of theory and use as Kant may have conceived of them,
                  before reflecting on what I have come to see as the specific use of German Idealism
                  for thinking with British Romanticism. My concrete pedagogical example, with which
                  I conclude, comes from my experience teaching Eckart Förster’s <em>The 25 Years of Philosophy: A Systematic Reconstruction </em>(2012)—a chapter a week, alongside the literary texts—in a semester-length graduate
                  course.</p>
               <p>In the 1793 Immanuel Kant found himself an object of a satire by the polymath Abraham
                  Gotthelf Kästner. Its title was <em>Thoughts on the Inability of Writers to Produce Rebellion</em>, and its basic argument was a common one: theorists such as Kant had uncoupled themselves
                  from the real world. Kant’s response that same year in the <em>Berlinische Monaatschrift</em>, “On the Common Saying: ‘This May be True in Theory, but it does not Apply in Practice’,”
                  cunningly turned the tables: “It is therefore not the fault of the theory if it is
                  of little practical use. . . The fault is that there is <em>not enough </em>theory; the person concerned ought to have learnt from experience” (Kant 61). The
                  point is supremely Kantian: so-called natural experience is always already shaped
                  by theoretical frameworks. Practical experience, in order to be practical, must build
                  itself up into general, theoretical principles so that it can be communicated, reflected
                  upon, actualized.</p>
               <p>Two years later, in 1795, Kant applied a similar bit of logical torque to a neighboring
                  topic. I include the opening paragraph in full, in part because it is so eminently
                  teachable: <span class="quote">‘THE PERPETUAL PEACE. A Dutch innkeeper once put this satirical inscription on his
                     signboard, along with the picture of a graveyard. We shall not trouble to ask whether
                     it applies to men in general, or particularly to heads of states (who can never have
                     enough of war), or only to the philosophers who blissfully dream of perpetual peace.
                     The author of the present essay does, however, make one reservation in advance. The
                     practical politician tends to look down with great complacency upon the political
                     theorist as a mere academic. The theorist's abstract ideas, the practitioner believes,
                     cannot endanger the state, since the state must be founded upon principles of experience;
                     it thus seems safe to let him fire off his whole broadside, and the worldly wise statesman
                     need not turn a hair. It thus follows that if the practical politician is to be consistent,
                     he must not claim, in the event of a dispute with the theorists, to scent any danger
                     to the state in the opinions which the theorists has randomly uttered in public. By
                     this saving clause, the author of this essay will consider himself expressly safeguarded,
                     in correct and proper style, against all malicious interpretation. (Kant 93). ’</span> These are the sorts of moments in Kant that we, as literary critics, like. In the
                  former example, Kant cuts to the heart of what we today would call false consciousness
                  or ideology—a belief that the mind can have direct, unstructured access to the world.
                  In this example from “Perpetual Peace,” Kant uses irony to shield himself from “malicious
                  interpretation.” He finds a blind spot in the practitioner’s perspective, and wagers
                  that if an efficacious critique is possible at all, it might be leveraged from that
                  occluded site. He cheekily labels his essay a “sketch,” an <span class="foreign">Entwurf</span>—that is, a design, plan or blueprint, with its obvious mimicking of a document from
                  a practical vocation.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Kant’s opening gambit is to take a mismatch between text, image, and site (“THE PERPETUAL
                     PEACE,” the graveyard, and the inn), allegedly commissioned by a non-academic foreigner
                     (the innkeeper), and use it to structure and defend a philosophical “sketch.” As critics
                     we like this because here Kant challenges genres. We have even invented the term “fourth
                     critique” to describe the constellation of political writings Kant wrote in the 1790’s,
                     a series of fragments that simultaneously complete and disrupt the system that conditioned
                     them. One thing that makes these texts often appear more “literary” than even something
                     like the third <em>Critique</em> is Kant’s finding a rhetorical register that can put his theoretical apparatus to
                     use. In the case of <em>Perpetual Peace</em>, the most immediate application is a self-generated “safeguarding” of Kant’s theses
                     against misuse. In those moments I have a doubled feeling: of the texts being actuated
                     or put in motion, and of their sudden halting. Jean-Luc Nancy has pointed out that,
                     despite his alleged absence of style, few philosophers have found their way into more
                     literary texts than Kant. He then mentions a 1917 letter of Walter Benjamin, who declares
                     that Kant’s linguistic austerity <span class="quote">‘“represents a <span class="foreign">limes </span>of literary prose”. . . because he perceives in Kant a yet-unheard-of philosophical
                        stake, still to come, Benjamin wishes to receive his prose—usually judged to be heavy—as
                        if possessing artistic force, that is to say, the force of awakening, indeed of enthusiasm.
                        Moreover, he immediately adds, “If this were not the case, would the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> have so shaken Kleist to the deepest parts of his being?” (xxiv).’</span> We seek out these moments. I, for instance, have just cited Nancy, citing Benjamin,
                     citing Kleist’s encounter with Kant. One thing that “theory” can do is bring these
                     kinds of moments, simultaneously fleeting and eternal, into the present via an empirically
                     verifiable lineage of influence. Their problems become our problems; their having
                     been shaken shakes us. Of course, such neatly drawn lines of causation are precisely
                     what theory teaches us to suspect. Yet many, myself included, find ourselves conceiving
                     of these networks of relations “as if possessing artistic force.” I find this “as
                     if” to be a motivating factor in my own work, and also a powerful pedagogical tool:
                     read Kant <em>as if</em> it were powerful enough to shake someone’s inner sense; let’s talk <em>as if </em>Shelley were writing within a Badiouan framework; think of the German Romantics <em>as if </em>they were simply composing an alternative historical response to the French Revolution
                     than the British; draft a sketch of what perpetual peace might look like if the Kantian
                     paradigm were efficacious and true. The point is less about forcing similarities than
                     unearthing differences: between genres, strategies and styles; between historical
                     moments and places; between our first reading of a text and subsequent readings of
                     it. “To think differently than one thinks, and to perceive differently than one sees.”
                     This mantra, which I adopt from Foucault’s <em>The Use of Pleasure</em>, is probably the most concise articulation of how and why I bring theory into the
                     classroom (and my own work) (8); and what North Americans call <em>theory,</em> the French often call <em>thought</em>.

               </div>
               <p>Simon Jarvis has discussed verse’s “second repertoire of thinking,” the fact that
                  we can read poetry in at least two incompatible ways at the same time—semantically
                  and formally, with the latter interrupting and interfering with the former (934).
                  I think reading Romantic texts with theory—be it Kant, or Judith Butler, or <em>The Defense of Poetry</em>, or Keats describing the Vale of Soul-Making to his brother and sister—mimics and
                  models this kind of semantic and formal layering. Theory echoes the literary, but
                  out of phase or in a different register—and what is an echo but a vibration, a shaking
                  just at the threshold of perception. I think one thing that theory trains students
                  to do is to become attentive to particular kinds of shifts and frictions among texts.
                  Placing, say, “I Wandered Lonely As a Cloud” alongside Spinoza’s <em>Ethics,</em> is often simply a way of amplifying the tremors already threaded in Wordsworth’s
                  verse. The danger, we are told, is in becoming enamored of “the application of gross
                  and violent stimulants”—the solution is a return to therapeutic hermeneutics, or to
                  the calming materiality of history. But it is unclear what an “untheoretical” return
                  to the text or to history might look like, even in teaching. If nothing else, teaching
                  theory forces us to lay our commitments on the table, and talk about them. So why,
                  for me, this apparent commitment to post-Kantian thought? What’s its use?</p>
               <p>There is a notion, common enough in Romantic circles, that there has been an unwarranted
                  “Germanification” of British Romanticism, that critics have applied Kantian or idealist
                  paradigms to English Romantic texts that don’t properly conform to or need those paradigms.
                  A running assumption here is that these literary texts have been historically conditioned
                  by the German texts, and so a perfectly reasonable conclusion is that we need to examine
                  those texts that <em>did </em>condition that literature. A way of closing the loop is to claim, with a fair deal
                  of support, that the German philosophers and critics were themselves conditioned by
                  English and Scottish texts: Hume, Sterne, Reid, Mandeville, and so forth. But I think
                  that there are two factors in favor of the alleged Germanification, and against a
                  narrower historicist reading. First, that even if particular texts—say, Coleridge’s
                  “Frost at Midnight” or Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey”—weren’t <em>directly </em>influenced by German thought, our reception of them, and our very mode of practicing
                  literary criticism at all, is directly influenced by them. Too directly, might proclaim
                  those who have recently had to teach the <em>Biographia </em>or “The Concept of Irony.” But that is another issue—one which, I think, perhaps lies
                  deeper than the first. It is a moral or aesthetic issue, rather than a historical
                  one.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I find myself, recently, pro-Germanification because I am beginning to see
                  German Romantic paradigms as “possible worlds” versions of British Romantic paradigms.
                  Call it the age’s second repertoire, or one of them—related, but out of phase or in
                  another register. Those models and ways of thinking stretch and test the ones we encounter
                  in the British texts we read, and I think that the novelists, poets and essayists
                  may have approached the matter from a similar perspective. Germany presented them
                  with an alternate history of the present, one confronted with many of the same problems:
                  the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars; a simultaneous fascination and frustration
                  with empiricism; a new understanding of and feeling for history; a burgeoning print
                  market; a taste for irony. So when I say that I am for the moment “pro-Germanification”
                  what I am perhaps really saying is that I am in favor of this sort of stretching and
                  testing of limits. A Hegelian might call this <em>dialectic</em>; it strikes me as more like common sense.</p>
               <p>But how to initiate students—many of whom, understandably, have little experience
                  with philosophy as a discipline—into one of thought’s densest, deepest periods? Last
                  year I chose to spend the first fifteen or twenty minutes of class each week discussing
                  a chapter from Eckart Förster’s <em>The 25 Years of Philosophy </em>(2012). That book explains the thought of Kant, Fichte, Goethe, Jacobi, Schelling
                  and Hegel, and situates it within a concrete historical context. Förster’s account
                  is eminently readable without glossing over the interesting bits. Much of it, in fact,
                  is a new interpretation of those thinkers, particularly its placing Goethe, and scientific
                  inquiry, at the center of crucial debates. It was, for instance, Goethe’s copy of
                  Spinoza on Schelling’s desk when he was developing his <span class="foreign">Identitätphilosophie</span>. And Hegel arrived at several breakthroughs while tending Goethe’s botanical garden.
                  I designed the syllabus so that most weeks there has been a medium-strong correlation
                  between the <em>25YP </em>chapters and the literary texts. For example, Förster’s chapter on the resurgence
                  of Spinozism in Germany coincided with our reading of Wordsworth’s allegedly “pantheist”
                  texts, and Levinson’s “Of Being Numerous”; the chapter on Fichte was juxtaposed with
                  Shelley’s <em>Cenci</em>, a tragedy about consuming egos and unchecked, or self-checking, will.</p>
               <p>Literary texts, like theoretical ones, produce their own checks, their own resistances.
                  But these are not always the most obvious, or even the most pressing, forms of resistance.
                  Theory seems most useful, both in my own thinking and in the classroom, when it creates
                  the right kinds of resistances to texts and ideas I have been taking for granted.

               to Derrida and <span class="foreign">bricolage</span>. What exactly Romanticism’s “bounds” are, or whether they don’t extend to Derrida,
               or whether Romanticism is something “bounded” at all, remains undiscussed. Ryan, 65.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#ftn2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="ftn4"><span class="noteLabel">4.. </span><span class="noteBody">De Man, among others, argues that theory resists itself, that theory enacts a recalcitrance
               or resistance not unlike literary form’s. Even “rhetorical readings,” the most elastic
               kind of reading for de Man, “still avoid and resist the reading they advocate. Nothing
               can overcome the resistance to theory since theory <em>is </em>itself this resistance” (“The Resistance to Theory,” 19). Thinking with Susan Wolfson’s
               “formalist activism,” Goldsmith argues that “By attending to the specificity of literary
               language, readers participate in a text’s resistance to cultural generalization. No
               one’s words should be conscripted, least of all ‘as information’” (279). Of course,
               my allying of theory and form is not without its problems, as Wolfson knows well.
               Theory’s cultural conscription is precisely the goal of Dames’s novelists, an issue
               thornily involved in their use of the realist form.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#ftn4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="ftn6"><span class="noteLabel">6.. </span><span class="noteBody">I borrow this phrase from Dave Egger’s introduction to <em>Infinite Jest</em>: ". . . let's say a reader is a sort of mechanic. And let's say this particular reader-mechanic
               has worked on lots of books, and after a few hundred contemporary novels, the mechanic
               feels like he can take apart just about any book and put it back together again. That
               is, the mechanic recognizes the components of modern fiction and can say, for example, <em>I've seen this part before, so I know why it's there and what it does. And this one,
                  too-- I recognize it. This part connects to this and performs this function. This
                  one usually goes here, and does that. All of this is familiar enough.</em> That's no knock to the contemporary fiction that is recognizable and breakdownable.
               This includes about 98 percent of the fiction we know and love. . .. But this is not
               possible with <em>Infinite Jest</em>. This book is like a spaceship with no components, no rivets or bolts, no entry points,
               no way to take it apart” (xiii). Wallace, by the way, is notably absent from Dames’s
               account.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#ftn6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               relate to feeling, I recommend McLaughlin’s <em>Poetic Force</em>. For instance: “the capacity of poetic language to exceed the grasp of empirical
               consciousness—for example, by breaking free from spatial and temporal metaphors that
               draw on an empirical world view—does not simply make it into a medium of rational
               or philosophical communication after Kant. The ability to communicate the feeling
               of reason transcending cognitive experience also brings with it internally a ‘withdrawal’
               of communicability. The language of the poets expresses the capacity and the incapacity
               to communicate the feeling of the divisive finitude of reason as a force and an unforce”

               is a thinker of force or action, but the genesis of this force finds its origin not
               in any vital energy as the possibility of existence, but rather in the internal impasses
               which render the conceptual closure of any situation impossible. Subjective action
               is what follows from this impossibility.” <em>The Mathematics of Novelty</em>, 15; see also 120, 125.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#ftn11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               Romanticism, philosophy and theory, despite my examples of Kant and Badiou. I will
               merely cite Marc Redfield’s apt genealogy of it: “at the crossroads of philosophy
               and literature, the early German Romantics not only theorized a fully modern idea
               of ‘literature’; in doing so they also unleashed, as Hegel suspected, the entrancing
               and threatening specter of ‘theory’ as the monstrous concatenation of philosophy-as-literature.
               Inevitably, an ambivalent romance with theory became, at a certain point in its development,
               part of the drama of ‘Romanticism’ as a field of study in the university. And that
               in turn has meant that philosophy and Romanticism continue to enjoy and suffer their
               strange elective affinity” (337).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#ftn14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
