                <p rend="noCount">Whether or not we believe the reports of theory's imminent or
                    absolute demise, recent calls (from Latour, Sedgwick, Best and Marcus) to move
                    beyond ideology critique invite us to rethink our teaching as well as our
                    research practices. This essay asks what it would mean to exchange an emphasis
                    on "theory" for one on "method." My suggestion is that focusing on method
                    encourages a cultivation of knowledge as, specifically, a <emph>knowing-how</emph>,
                    a form of intellectual labor that values adventurous collaboration over private

                <div>
                    <head>1. Introducing Method</head>

                    <p> In the fall of 2012 I taught a graduate seminar called “Romanticism as
                        Method.” Why method? Etymologically speaking, method
                            (<foreign>meta</foreign>-, after, beyond, alongside;
                            <foreign>hodos</foreign>-, way) can mean either a travelling-past or
                        else a travelling-alongside. The latter definition nicely approximates the
                        various modes of unsuspicious reading lately proposed in lieu of ideology
                        critique, from Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s reparative reading to Sharon Marcus
                        and Stephen Best’s surface reading to Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht’s reading for
                        the <foreign>Stimmung</foreign>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See
                            Sedgwick, 123-51; Best and Marcus, 1-21; and Gumbrecht, “Reading,”
                            213-21. </note> The former gestures at the kind of criticism that adopts
                        a “future-oriented vigilance” with respect to the inevitable “bad surprise”
                        of an artifact’s complicity in multiple forms of historical injustice; such
                        criticism has already “travelled past” the artifact and knows what
                        conditions it displaces or conceals (Sedgwick 130). The “method” of my title
                        thus aims to connote two widely available paths for contemporary literary
                        criticism. We might call those paths “Keatsian” and “Coleridgean,” in a nod
                        to Keats’s oft-invoked description of Negative Capability: a competence to
                        “being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching
                        after fact &amp; reason” defined against Coleridge’s habit of “let[ting] go
                        by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery,
                        from being incapable of remaining content with half knowledge” (Keats
                        I:193). Romanticism, too, is caught between championing uncertainty as an
                        intellectual position and a skepticism concerning the mere appearance of
                        reality, especially when it threatens to obscure metaphysical or historical
                        insight; if Coleridge is more interested in metaphysics than history, the
                        distrust of verisimilitude of which Keats accuses him jibes with Best and
                        Marcus’s controversial disapproval of criticism concerned only with “meaning
                        [that is] hidden, repressed, deep, and in need of detection and disclosure
                        by an interpreter.”</p>
                    <p>Another question to ask regarding the foundations of the course might be: why
                        method instead of theory? In 1986, Morris Eaves and Michael Fischer
                        introduced their <title level="m">Romanticism and Contemporary
                            Criticism</title> with “the simple observation that English Romanticism
                        is important to contemporary literary theory.” The contributors to this
                        volume—Northrop Frye, W.J.T. Mitchell, J. Hillis Miller, M.H. Abrams, and
                        Stanley Cavell—are described as “not only defin[ing] Romanticism in
                        different ways but also” using “it to underwrite strikingly different
                        theories of literature” (Eaves and Fischer 1). In 1986, Eaves and Fischer
                        were on solid ground. Today, the literature of the Romantic period has at
                        best an anecdotal relationship to the development of recently dominant
                        theories of literature, and by “dominant” I mean those that have had the
                        most institutional and public traction. The transhistorical character of
                        cognitive literary studies demands little care for distinctions of period or
                        genre, although it has taken a special interest in the neophyte
                        representations of consciousness in the eighteenth-century novel; the novel,
                        too, continues to be a productive site for distant reading, data mining, and
                        statistical analysis. Pioneering work by Jerome McGann and Alan Liu
                        notwithstanding, digital humanities and new media theory, not to mention
                        history of the book, find fruitful research programs in the archives of the
                        later nineteenth century more often than in Keats’s Great Odes or Hazlitt’s
                        essays. To presume that literary scholars in general, regardless of field or
                        specialization, would believe Romanticism to be constitutive of theory, or
                        theory to be indebted to Romanticism, seems old-fashioned, a relic of better
                        times for Romanticism, theory, and the humanities in general.</p>
                    <p> “Romanticism as Method” begins, then, from the disheartening premise that
                        the obsolescence of theory—motored, at least in part, by high-profile spasms
                        of apostasy like Bruno Latour’s “Why Has Critique Run Out Of
                        Steam?”—presents an especially acute problem for students and scholars of
                        Romanticism (Gumbrecht, “Response” 212-6). No longer does it seem wise to
                        justify one’s teaching or research on the assumption that “Romanticism,”
                        whether English, European, or Transatlantic, is integral to theory, because
                        theory itself no longer seems generally integral. If theory is evermore seen as
                        a residual mode of critical and pedagogical practice, how might Romanticism
                        contribute to an important public conversation on the “why” of research and
                        teaching on its own terms? This course is my own tentative exploration of
                        that question. The turn away from theory is motivated by interests that are
                        variously reasonable and reactionary, and too numerous to take on here.
                        “Romanticism as Method” acknowledges that such a turn has taken place,
                        attends to the many social and disciplinary histories involved in such a
                        turn, but ultimately concentrates on developing alternative conceptions of
                        Romanticism and of scholarship that might be of some good to students
                        seeking doctoral degrees. Replacing theory with method means looking to
                        Romanticism for its utility, not simply its power. More crucially, it means
                        reclaiming the language of utility from those metrics of instrumental
                        value—test scores, learning outcomes, impact factors, etc.—with which
                        teachers at all levels are increasingly familiar. </p>
                    <p> The course I describe here is designed for first- and second-year graduate
                        students, though in this case I allowed more advanced auditors to
                        participate. As a graduate class, it focuses less on introducing students to
                        a particular body of historical literature than on acquainting them with
                        ways that literature has been read, and on finding new ways for us to read
                        it together. Every week includes both required assignments and suggestions
                        for further reading, intended to help those students who do not arrive
                        already familiar with Romantic literature become conversant with its
                        canonical and semi-canonical authors. That said, although it emphasizes
                        texts and topics I would probably deem to difficult or too specialized for
                        an undergraduate class, the principle of utility is one which, I think, may
                        be helpfully drawn into all manner of classroom activities; so too is the
                        ideal of experimentation and group improvisation a class on “method”
                        demands. Every classroom may become a laboratory, and while the professor
                        directs the experiment results are valued insofar as they are produced
                        collaboratively.</p>

                    <head>2. Romanticism, or Knowing How</head>
                    <p>When someone says that an activity <emph>x</emph> is “like riding a bike,”
                        she means that <emph>x</emph> is an unnatural behavior it is possible to do,
                        figuratively speaking, naturally; she also implies that the doing of
                            <emph>x</emph> is successful only if the person doing it forgets exactly
                        how it is done. This is a problem for pedagogy. If you have ever tried to
                        teach someone how to ride a bike, tie a knot, or write an essay, you have
                        experienced just how hard it is to teach something you are able to do
                        because, to some extent, you have forgotten how to do it. It is from such a
                        forgetting that instincts are trained, through the eviction from conscious
                        thought of the astonishing alchemy of training and habit, sinews and
                        synapses, conventionality and improvisation that all together keep us going,
                        aloft on the bike. Incidentally, this process also describes Wordsworth’s
                        method for falling in love with your child: you just do it over and over
                        again until, “with patient mind enforced/To acts of tenderness” you no
                        longer have to think twice (Wordsworth 166-7). </p>
                    <p>The philosopher Jason Stanley defines “know-how” as the knowledge that
                        something is true—a proposition based, in turn, on the claim that all
                        knowledge is founded in our capacity to imagine acting on such knowledge in
                        a practical way (Stanley). Heidegger suggests that “the less we just stare
                        at the hammer-thing, and the more we seize hold of it and use it, the more
                        primordial does our relationship to it become, and the more unveiledly is it
                        encountered as that which it is—as equipment” (Heidegger 98). Certainly when
                        it comes to research, writing, and teaching, such activities benefit from a
                        certain disinhibition, akin to the paradoxical acquisition of a “primordial”
                        muscle memory. That said, when it comes to teaching graduate students, it
                        seems necessary both to teach the know-how of scholarship and to keep
                        students productively alienated from what they are doing when they are doing
                        it. In the context of graduate coursework, this means creating opportunities
                        not only to think about thinking but, more explicitly, to read about reading
                        and write about writing. “Romanticism as Method” is designed to meet these
                        ends. All assignments had to reflect actual demands made upon actual
                        academics: students would write weekly response papers, give brief in-class
                        presentations on primary-source material no one else in the room (besides
                        the professor) had read, analyze the structure and style of a published
                        article in their field and, at the end of term, give a talk on preliminary
                        research for their seminar paper, which would be an article-length piece of
                        work. </p>
                    <p>This is all very standard. The less orthodox dimensions of the course are
                        evident in the reading list, which places four works of criticism at its
                        center: two classic texts that position themselves explicitly with reference
                        to theory, specifically to post-structuralism and new historicism, and two
                        more recent books which take up the legacies of that earlier moment but do
                        something very new with them. I chose books that had been important to me,
                        so important their names came immediately to mind when I began planning the
                        course: Paul De Man’s <title level="m">The Rhetoric of Romanticism</title>
                        (1984), James Chandler’s <title level="m">England in 1819: The Politics of
                            Literary Culture and the Case of Romantic Historicism</title> (1998),
                        Anne-Lise François’s <title level="m">Open Secrets: The Literature of
                            Uncounted Experience</title> (2007), and Mary Favret’s <title level="m"
                            >War at a Distance: Romanticism and the Making of Modern Wartime</title>
                        (2009). I also asked students to purchase Paul Fry’s <title level="m">Theory
                            of Literature</title> (2012), a transcription of his undergraduate
                        lecture course, or to access individual lectures for free online through
                        Open Yale Courses.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Open Yale Courses may be

                        the classroom with disparate levels of familiarity and facility with the
                        building blocks of advanced literary study. Asking everyone to keep <title
                            level="m">Theory of Literature</title> on hand was intended as a
                        democratizing gesture, and it also served a practical purpose: students who
                        needed to take an ad-hoc crash-course in, say, Saussurian linguistics, or to
                        remind themselves what exactly Foucault means by “discourse,” could turn to
                        Fry as a reliable and, helpfully, not completely neutral source of
                        information. After seven weeks of reading through these four critical texts
                        alongside primary materials (discussed below), we turned to articles or book
                        excerpts by Celeste Langan, Colin Jager, Rei Terada, Kevis Goodman, and
                        Marjorie Levinson; on the first day of class students also read Maureen
                        McLane’s “Romanticism, or Now.” The principle of selection in this instance
                        was determined by what I take to be emerging trends within the field, as
                        well as by a special interest in tactical uses of critical voice and
                        style.</p>
                    <p> As for the primary texts, it seemed to me that an emphasis on the “Big Six”
                        version of the Romantic canon—the one which limits itself to Blake,
                        Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, and Keats—would provide a solid,
                        albeit conservative, counterpoint to the improvisatory aegis of the course.
                        Each week featured a chapter from two of the books mentioned above or one
                        scholarly article, and a selection of Romantic poetry or, occasionally,
                        prose. In contrast to an undergraduate course, where I like to assign
                        secondary materials that explicate or contextualize the historical ones, the
                        principle of pairing and selection here is less strict. We read Keats with
                        Chandler and <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> with François, but we
                        also welcome unexpected or surprising dialogues between De Man’s “Symbolic
                        Landscape in Wordsworth and Yeats” and Hazlitt’s <title level="m">Spirit of
                            the Age</title>. Stumbling into an unforeseen confluence between texts,
                        whether critical or literary, is not only something we ought to value in our
                        research process, it also just happens. One of my goals here is to push
                        students toward a non-instrumental relationship to criticism, to persuade
                        them that reading a good book in any field, on any subject, will open up new
                        pathways of thought that will be helpful to them at one time or another. I
                        believe we are all fatigued by studies promising to give an interpretation
                        of some poem or novel through one “angle” at a time, Morris Zapp-style.<note
                            place="foot" resp="editors">I refer here to one of the protagonists of
                            David Lodge’s <title level="m">Changing Places</title>, a literature
                            professor determined to corner the market on Jane Austen by publishing
                            “a series of commentaries” on her work, each of which will “examine the
                            novels from every conceivable angle, historical, biographical,
                            rhetorical, mythical, Freudian, Jungian, existentialist, Marxist,
                            structuralist, Christian-allegorical, ethical, exponential, linguistic,
                            phenomenological, archetypal, you name it” (Lodge 34).</note> This sort
                        of pedantic relationship to theory, or to the more constrained genre of
                        criticism, is one current students should consider it their historical
                        privilege to reject. At the same time, limits must obtain for even the most
                        expansive, ecumenical model of criticism, if indeed it wants to say
                        something genuinely interesting. Finding oneself forced to read Hazlitt with
                        de Man is an exercise in testing the limits of what constitutes a good match
                        of text with critic. It may be that Hazlitt and de Man have nothing to say
                        to each other, and in this awkward silence some new intelligence about both
                        writers emerges. Staging such labored, even impossible conversations is, the
                        syllabus suggests, vital to both the precision and the creativity of our
                        research practices.</p>
                    <p> To use Romanticism as a method is to assemble a toolkit out of phrases like
                        “Negative Capability,” “gusto,” “they may be called poetry by that figure of
                        speech which considers the effect as a synonym of the cause,” or “Labour
                        well the Minute Particulars,” as Goodman has done with William Cowper’s
                        “loopholes of retreat” and Levinson with Wordsworth’s numerical tropes
                        (Goodman, especially 67-105; Levinson, “Of Being Numerous,” especially 652;
                        and Levinson, “Notes and Queries”). But the kit must be filled with phrases
                        of our own making, too, and this is where the weekly reading responses,
                        posted on our online discussion board, come in. Students are encouraged to
                        consider these as low-stakes venues for being propositional and adventurous.
                        They may write, if they choose, in the style of one of the Romantic or
                        contemporary authors we are reading. The goal is not parody but posture,
                        walking in someone else’s shoes. It is, moreover, an attempt to realize that
                        style, including phrasemaking, is constitutive of method. Writing like
                        Hazlitt alters how you read a poem (or a person) and determines what kinds
                        of claims you may advance about them. A criticism that “smokes,” in the
                        Keatsian sense, might approach the condition of poetry by always being one
                        step ahead of its reader or might treat the readerly impulse to understand
                        as the very condition of its own opacity (Keats, <title level="m"
                            >Letters</title> II, 174). Are there times when it is productive to
                        smoke the readers of our work? And what about owning up to those moments
                        when the poem smokes us (“That is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to
                        know”), and we feel unable to understand it in any robustly satisfying way?
                        What goes into the vocabulary of confusion, blockage, dismay, or, as both
                        Terada and McLane put it, “impasse,” and how might we apply it creatively
                        (McLane 143; Terada 275-309)? After a reader confesses she has no idea what
                        is going on in a particular line or passage, can that blindness borrow the
                        form of an insight, however limited or diffident? The language of confusion,
                        and sometimes of irritation or resentment, enters our class’s semi-private
                        lexicon, which grows from week to week and preserves both our frustrations
                        and our attempts to relinquish them.</p>
                    <p> Class discussion is also directed toward the collective elaboration of a
                        variety of interpretive procedures and points of view, specifically as they
                        might be drawn from, and not merely applied to, the text at hand. To present
                        one example, our seventh class is spent reading one of the less obviously
                        interesting books of the 1805 <title level="m">Prelude</title>, namely Book
                        XII. We choose a passage to look at closely based on the evidence the group
                        gives for being bored—perhaps smoked—by this part of the text. In this
                        instance, the class swiftly converges on Wordsworth’s critique of pastoral
                        in lines 184-215. The professor throws out a phrase: dead time, as in “there
                        are moments of dead time in <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, moments
                        that seem unnecessary to the elaboration of the poem or the book.” A student
                        offers a comparison between “dead time” and “spots of time”; perhaps both
                        are indispensable to “the growth of a poet’s mind.” Since we have been
                        reading <title level="m">Open Secrets</title>, the group begins to wonder
                        about the relationship between dead time and the temporality of “nonemphatic
                        revelation.” A consensus emerges that they are not the same thing, but that
                        François offers a way to make sense of Wordsworth’s rejection of fussy,
                        pictographic pastoral. A cluster of early modernists address the
                        significance of the Shakespeare plays to which Wordsworth alludes here,
                        while another student, a committed dramaturge, proffers information on how
                        pastoral elements figure in the theatrical productions of the late
                        eighteenth century. Another student, this one preparing for her
                        comprehensive exams and interested in the history of science and medicine,
                        speculates on the cognitive implications of “dead time,” while another
                        aligns Wordsworth’s literary-critical digression with Hazlitt’s essays in
                            <title level="m">The Spirit of the Age</title>.</p>
                    <p>The professor takes to the board, and gradually a piece of crowd-sourced
                        scholarship emerges, a group effort that would be impossible without a
                        serious engagement with multiple forms of knowledge. If this phantom piece
                        of writing ever becomes a manuscript, some elements will be amplified,
                        others edited out. The point of the exercise is to show that: having many
                        ways into a text is not the same thing as being without method; scholarship
                        is by definition collaborative, even if it is just you, Wordsworth, and a
                        pencil; exegesis means false starts and wrong turns; it’s good not to bring
                        too much ego into the room; be patient and curious, good poems can be
                        tedious for good reasons; learning means learning how to teach, how to tell
                        your reader, your students, your colleagues what you know in such a way that
                        they may be said to know it now, too. For graduate students who are going on
                        to careers as teachers, either in the academy or elsewhere, the classroom
                        should always be a primarily pedagogical space with lines of instruction and
                        reception running in several directions, some predictable and others less
                        so. </p>
                    <p> It may seem overly tidy to assert that these are the lessons I myself
                        learned from Romanticism, and from Romanticism’s best critics, although that
                        is what I believe. Likewise, too, the principle that it is all right for
                        work to be difficult and understanding slow—things one may plausibly tell
                        graduate students, if not our increasingly harried undergraduates, at the
                        very beginning of their academic careers. For those who have the luxury of
                        encouraging digressive learning in the classroom, the model of
                        learning-by-doing brings together more aleatory and indirect modes of
                        instruction with a pragmatic ability to make something, knock it down, and
                        start again, using the highly modular and sustainable resources of one’s own
                        brain. “My head,” as Thoreau bafflingly says, “is an organ for burrowing,”
                        and how many wider and deeper trails might be dug by the collaborative work
                        that allows us to read, think, teach, and travel along—or rather,
                        alongside—multiple pathways (Thoreau 82)? “Romanticism as Method” really
                        means Romanticism as implement, tool, gizmo, hammer-thing, equipment. With
                        it we work to make, among other things, more Romanticism.</p>
