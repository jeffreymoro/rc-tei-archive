                <p rend="noCount">Romantic texts have repeatedly played important roles in the
                    development of what we call literary theory. For instance, all of the essays

                <p>Romantic texts have repeatedly played important roles in the development of what
                    we call literary theory. For instance, all of the essays collected in the 1979
                        <title level="m">Deconstruction and Criticism</title> volume, which did so

                    asked contributors to reflect on the ways they integrate literary theory into
                    their teaching of Romanticism and to reflect on the continued importance of

                    literary theory alter our ideas of both?</p>
                <p> Contributors received their PhDs from departments well known for getting
                    theoretical (Chicago, Virginia, UC Irvine, and Yale (x2)) and now teach at a
                    range of institutions, some private, some public, some in the United States,
                    some abroad. In selecting contributors I was self-consciously interested in
                    hearing from those who received their PhD after the turn of the century, after
                    the publication of the first edition of the <title level="m">Norton Anthology of
                        Theory and Criticism</title> (2001) and so after literary theory courses had
                    become a regular part of departmental curricula. The range of responses tells us
                    much not only about prevailing definitions of Romanticism and literary theory
                    but also about collective goals for the teaching of literature today.</p>
                <p>To say that contributors received the PhD after the 2001 publication of the
                        <title level="m">Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism </title>is also to
                    say that they entered the profession after the most violent decades of the
                    culture wars, when labels for theoretical positions became hardened (one
                    strategy among many, one might say, for resisting theory). In reading the essays
                    I was struck by the degree to which all contributors resist dogmatic claims. In
                    fact, the essays demonstrate a commitment not to theory per se, and certainly
                    not to theory as a lens through which to view the literary object, but to
                    discovering texts (both “theoretical” and “Romantic”) together and anew.
                    Collectively, contributors are more interested in what works, which texts when
                    paired draw from each other new interpretations and new insights, than in
                    claiming allegiance with any particular theoretical position. As Andrew Warren
                    writes, “I find theory most useful, both in my own thinking and in the
                    classroom, when it creates the right kinds of resistances to texts and ideas I
                    have been taking for granted.” </p>
                <p>Metonymy and resistance play an important role in several essays in the volume.
                    In his contribution, David Sigler describes teaching Wordsworth’s “Steamboats,
                    Viaducts, and Railways” <emph>alongside</emph> a chapter from George Bataille’s
                        <title level="m">Theory of Religion</title>, entitled “The Rise of
                    Industry.” Reading Bataille alongside Wordsworth is meant to challenge the
                    available readings of Wordsworth; but similarly, reading Wordsworth alongside
                    Bataille is meant to challenge students’ interpretations of Bataille. The
                    theoretical text does not explain the literary one; but neither does the
                    literary text explain the theoretical one. Ideally, both texts emerge changed
                    after the pedagogical encounter; such is the point, suggests Sigler, of placing
                    the texts side by side. In her teaching, Anahid Nersessian self-consciously
                    embraces the aleatory, producing the chance for unforeseen confluences between
                    Romantic and theoretical texts: <quote>One of my goals is to push students
                        toward a non-instrumental relationship to criticism .&#160;.&#160;. I
                        believe we are all fatigued by studies promising to give an interpretation
                        of some poem or novel through one “angle” at a time, Morris Zapp-style. This
                        sort of pedantic relationship to theory, or to the more constrained genre of
                        criticism, is one current students should consider it their historical
                        privilege to reject.</quote> In many of the essays collected here, “theory”
                    describes less a critical position than a shared openness to discovering texts
                    together in new constellations of reference and signification. For some, this
                    commitment to discovery might seem yet another strategy for resisting theory, as
                    theory recedes from critical view (especially when so explicitly replaced by
                    “method” in Nersessian’s essay). For others, such a commitment to discovering
                    texts in constellations of reference and signification may simply be one theoretical position
                    among many, if unclaimed.</p>
                <p>What is meant by “theory” here, other than a loose set of texts and proper names?
                    In “Nothing Fails Like Success,” Barbara Johnson concludes that <quote>if the
                        deconstructive impulse is to retain its vital, subversive power, we must
                        .&#160;.&#160;. become ignorant of it again and again. It is only by
                        forgetting what we know how to do, by setting aside the thoughts that have
                        most changed us, that those thoughts and that knowledge can go on making
                        accessible to us the surprise of an otherness we can only encounter in the
                        moment of suddenly discovering we are ignorant of it. (16)</quote> Efforts
                    to transform deconstruction into a set of rule bound procedures must be
                    resisted, argues Johnson. Collectively, it seems to me, the essays in <title
                        level="j">Teaching Romanticism and Literary Theory</title> explore a similar
                    paradox with respect to theory (deconstruction has often been code for theory).
                    Perhaps we must become ignorant of theory too, again and again, if the term is
                    to retain vital and subversive force, especially as each “theory” (formalism,
                    deconstruction, Marxism, feminism, etc.) is reduced to a discrete set of
                    critical procedures. As the courses described in contributions to this volume
                    show, “forgetting theory” does not mean not reading texts we call theoretical.
                    It may just mean reading theory as literature, as still capable of producing
                    surprise. The essays collected here share a commitment to surprise (both for
                    students and teachers). “Teaching,” then, is not the transmission of information
                    but a shared encounter with texts. </p>
                <p>Essays by Emily Sun and Eric Lindstrom stage this question about the literariness
                    of theory most explicitly. Sun does not place importance on teaching
                    Wordsworth’s poem alongside a theoretical text, though the fact that Sun has
                    read William Empson, Paul de Man, and Edward Said certainly informs her class
                    design and preparation. Sun’s interest is in discovering the words of
                    Wordsworth’s poem anew and in competing contexts. Teaching in English in Taiwan,
                    Sun explains how the attempt to read Wordsworth’s “sense” in “Tintern Abbey”
                    affected her students’ understanding of the Chinese phrase for senses,
                        <foreign>wuguan</foreign>. Drawing on de Man’s “The Return to Philology” Sun
                    reminds us that theory emerges from the deceptively simple (or perhaps
                    deceptively difficult?) effort to read just what is on the page. Pairing
                    literary and theoretical texts may, likewise, demonstrate a desire to cut
                    through received or practiced opinion and, however impossible an effort, get to
                    the words themselves and the questions they raise. In his contribution, Eric
                    Lindstrom reminds readers that literature (or the literary) is one name among
                    many for the gap between object and interpretation, between theory and
                    method.</p>
                <p>All five essays move past “discovering” literary theoretical pronouncements
                    buried within Romantic texts, as if one buried a bone just so one could have the
                    pleasure of digging it up again. In response to definitions of Romanticism
                    aligned with an aesthetic purposelessness, Warren in “The Uses and Abuses of
                    Theory (for Life)” moves from Alain Badiou back to German Idealism to ask how
                    Romanticism can or should be instrumentalized to get students to think
                    differently about our most familiar definitions of Romanticism. In “The Intimacy
                    of Infrastructure: Teaching Wordsworth with Bataille,” Sigler shows how reading
                    Bataille alongside Wordsworth allows Wordsworth’s nuanced thinking about
                    capitalist ideology in a poem like “Steamboats, Viaducts, and Railways” to
                    emerge: “When read in combination, Bataille and Wordsworth show how poetic
                    devices present an occasion for radically rethinking subjectivity in an
                    industrial world.” In “Dissensus in Two Registers: Tintern Abbey in Taiwan,” Sun
                    shows the continued importance of philology to our thinking about Romantic poems
                    in historical and contemporary cultural contexts. Sun describes the experience
                    of teaching Wordsworth in Taiwan and demonstrates the continued importance of
                    poetry to “getting theoretical,” as Sun’s Taiwanese students found themselves
                    estranged from their own language and culture by virtue of the encounter with
                    Wordsworth’s poem. Lindstrom simultaneously moves us beyond the traditional
                    canon of British Romanticism to the writing of Robert Frost and moves us back to
                    thinking about the priority of poetry and poetic thinking, not only to our
                    conceptions of Romanticism but also to literary theory. Lindstrom reminds us
                    that how we read is too often preconditioned by our assumptions about what we
                    are reading, and teaching Romanticism and literary theory stretches those
                    assumptions about what makes a lyric poem or a theoretical text. Nersessian
                    calls for thinking of Romanticism not as theory but as method: “replacing theory
                    with method means making Romanticism useful.” Nersessian challenges readers to
                    think about how encounters between Romanticism and literary theory enable new
                    forms of poetic making. With tremendous style and intellectual rigor, each of
                    these short essays shows how discovering Romantic and literary theoretical texts
                    together allows one to discover these texts anew. </p>
