                <p rend="noCount">This essay outlines how one might lead a discussion of William
                    Wordsworth’s sonnet “Steamboats, Viaducts, and Railways” (1833) in relation to
                    Georges Bataille’s chapter “The Rise of Industry” from his <emph>Theory of Religion</emph>
                    (1973). Such a pairing would attune the classroom conversation to questions of
                    intimacy as they arise in the poem and in Bataille, and can show students how to
                    read a poem for more than its apparent argument. The combination of Wordsworth
                    and Bataille can show students how capitalist ideology generates its own
                    internal resistance, how British Romantic writing can construe subjectivity as
                    an injury, how poetry speaks through its formal procedures, and how theory
                    interacts with literary texts ambiguously, in ways that go beyond serving as a
                    metaphorical lens. </p>

                <p>I have sometimes taught William Wordsworth’s sonnet “Steamboats, Viaducts, and
                    Railways,” first published in 1833, alongside a chapter from Georges Bataille’s
                        <title level="m">Theory of Religion</title>, posthumously published in 1973.
                    The selection from Bataille is chapter four of <title level="m">Theory of
                        Religion </title>(87-104), entitled “The Rise of Industry,” which I upload
                    to our course learning management system. I have attempted this combination
                    several times in senior-level undergraduate courses and Master’s-level graduate
                    courses at the University of Idaho, and will be trying it again in the upcoming
                    semester at the University of Calgary.</p>
                <p>I usually organize my Romanticism survey courses thematically rather than
                    chronologically or by author. The themes have included global British
                    Romanticism, including topics like hospitality, Orientalism, and empire;
                    sexuality and the family, including sororal-fraternal sexuality and the history
                    of the idea of “sexuality” itself; the aesthetic demands of the French
                    Revolution; class, labor, and the Peterloo massacre. I find a thematic structure
                    can encourage students to see literary writing as a form of problem solving, as
                    they see texts working through common problems and responding to each other. In
                    such a context, reading twentieth- or twenty-first century theory alongside
                    older literary texts becomes a way to reconsider what these texts are able to
                    accomplish or imagine. As we read Byron’s <title level="m">Manfred</title>, for
                    instance, we will also be reading Felicia Hemans’s “A Spirit’s Return” and the
                    introduction to Jacques Derrida’s <title level="m">Specters of Marx</title>, so
                    that we’re ready to think through the difficulties inherent in summoning ghosts
                    and making demands of them. Before reading Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s “Dejection:
                    An Ode,” John Keats’s “Ode on Melancholy,” and Mary Shelley’s <title level="m"
                        >Mathilda</title>, for instance, we spend a day discussing Sigmund Freud’s
                    “Mourning and Melancholia” and Slavoj Žižek’s “Melancholy and the Act,” so we
                    will be ready to discuss in detail the processes, and ethico-political stakes,
                    of Romantic-era despair, and especially so we can consider what might be gained
                    by summoning dejection deliberately. At the end of the course, we spend two
                    weeks thinking through the big picture of Romanticism—its political and cultural
                    upheavals, its critical potential, its exclusions, its limits, its blind spots
                    and complicities. It’s during this last part of the course in which my students
                    have read Wordsworth’s “Steamboats, Viaducts, and Railways” alongside Bataille. </p>
                <p>Bataille delineates two orders of experience in “The Rise of Industry”: there is,
                    he explains, an “order of things” devoted to clarity and precision, in which
                    economics, labor, politics, and scientific research play out; there is also an
                    “order of intimacy” involving spiritual rapture, divinity, and, if one is doing
                    it right, eroticism. Modernity is defined by the separation of intimacy from
                    things. As capitalist ideology becomes hegemonic, European culture gradually
                    accepts the total elimination of divine grace (i.e., intimacy) from one’s works
                    (i.e., things). For Bataille, the world of things, too much with us, expands
                    everywhere and crowds intimacy out: capitalism, imperialism, secularization, and
                    science collude to keep intimacy at bay. It’s a thoroughly Wordsworthian
                    concern. The tone of Bataille’s chapter isn’t nostalgic or lapsarian, but it
                    outlines a tragic forfeiture at the heart of modernity, one by now so firmly
                    entrenched in European thought that it cannot very easily be challenged. In
                    Bataille’s view, capitalism satisfies theological and psychological needs. Yet
                    it has severe costs even beyond the concentration of wealth: a society organized
                    around getting and spending opens the “reign of autonomous things,” leading to
                    military expansion, imperialism, and commodity fetishism (90). Even science,
                    which might have seemed to have critical potential, requires “the reduction of
                    all life to the real order” through its attachment to clarity and precision
                    (96). These developments have severe psychological effects, warns Bataille: with
                    the separation of intimacy from things, people become estranged from their own
                    consciousness and begin to fear the consequences of modernity. Though no dates
                    are mentioned, one can surmise that Bataille considers the European eighteenth
                    and nineteenth centuries as eras in which “the order of things” began to take
                    over and dominate intimacy, and this makes “The Rise of Industry” especially
                    useful for courses in Romanticism. He explains, for instance, that the situation
                    brought about a change in the nature of state power, such that sovereignty
                    became a function of capital, not the throne. </p>
                <p> Bataille’s chapter encourages us to rethink the meaning of “Steamboats,
                    Viaducts, and Railways” because it gets students to attend to the poem’s
                    ambiguous literary language. I have gone back and forth, in planning
                    discussions, as to the order of operations: sometimes when teaching a poem
                    alongside some theory, I will have everyone work through the theory before
                    getting at the poem. But in this sonnet, there’s a (seemingly) direct claim
                    being advanced about the need—psychological, aesthetic, or economic—to reconcile
                    industrial infrastructure with the “natural” landscape: the speaker, at least at
                    one level, encourages us to find these congruent and “sublime.” This association
                    between infrastructure and habit of mind is probably the most manifest of
                    possible readings, so I want students to recognize and understand it as quickly
                    as possible; I also want to give students ample opportunity to explore other
                    readings that may occur to them, before we shift the conversation into
                    Bataille’s particular set of concerns. So, to begin class, we spend a few
                    minutes just reading the poem aloud and discussing its basic argument. I will
                    display on a screen an 1830s-era image of a viaduct or railway in the context of
                    a British landscape. This sort of print was a whole genre of 1830s visual
                    culture, and examples are readily found online. With the image projected
                    onscreen, I will ask a student to read the poem aloud for us. I do this even
                    though the students have read the poem at home already, because the poem is
                    brief, and listening to it read aloud well can attune us afresh to its meter and
                    tone: <quote><lg>

                        </lg></quote> At first glance, the poem certainly seems to exonerate
                    industrialists. The local environment is important, the poem says, but not
                    nearly as important as our ability to cultivate a poetic habit of mind—and
                    industrial infrastructure presents no impediment to that. Although industrial
                    constructions admittedly “mar/ The loveliness of Nature,” in the speaker’s
                    analysis these eyesores don’t interfere with a poet’s attainment of a sublime
                    “prophetic sense,” and thus are perfectly acceptable. As the violent destruction
                    of the landscape is acknowledged but forgiven, ecological damage comes to seem
                    unimportant relative to “that point of vision” which poetry affords. Moreover,
                    the point of vision is valuable not intrinsically but because it will allow an
                    inquisitive person to have “discovered what in soul ye are.” In this reading,
                    which I think is the most straightforward one, self-discovery is held to be the
                    paramount thing, overriding all other concerns. This in itself is a
                    controversial idea, especially in light of today’s ecological crises, and one
                    that will stir up lively conversation among students in a classroom. To
                    cultivate a sense of one’s authentic selfhood through a process of poetic
                    reflection is not, after all, a genuine solution to the violence of capitalism
                    but, on the contrary, its ideological supplement and necessary outgrowth.</p>
                <p>The challenge is to get students to discuss the poem as a poem, not as an essay.
                    It’s with this that Bataille is helpful. Read alongside Bataille, “Steamboats,
                    Viaducts, and Railways” becomes a viciously ironic poem and a poem that dares to
                    imagine a solution to modern capitalist ideology. The solution surprises
                    students because it emerges from within the very workings of industrial
                    capitalism—the steamboats, viaducts, and railways—rather than as an alternative
                    to capitalist development. There are of course many ways to encourage students
                    to become attuned to poetic devices. Bataille offers one such way, and it’s an
                    especially good one, because here, attention to poetic devices is not an end in
                    itself. When read in combination, Bataille and Wordsworth show how poetic
                    devices present an occasion for radically rethinking subjectivity in an
                    industrial world. Literature and industry aren’t opposing forces here, as the
                    argument of the poem makes plain. But they don’t necessarily support each other,
                    either, and in learning to read poetry as poetry, we can learn to see the poem’s
                    critical edge. The poem, at one level, appears to be trying to cordon poetry off
                    from economic, developmental, aesthetic, and ecological crises—a poet can enjoy
                    the sublimity of these crises from a wise and profound remove, it would seem (at
                    first glance). But in reserving this space within capitalism, the poem is also
                    maintaining a space for intimacy. Dreadful as it may seem, this space is not
                    autonomous from industry but develops right within and through it. In tracing
                    this development and seeing how we as readers become caught within it, we can
                    arrive at a mode of thinking—a “point of vision”—that Bataille would call
                    “fundamentally unreal” and genuinely radical (96).</p>
                <p>Because the questions I enumerate below will seem, I fear, inflexibly Socratic, I
                    will insist at this juncture of the essay that one can never predict how a good
                    discussion will take shape. My aim is to start a conversation in which
                    interpretation can take unexpected turns. To accomplish this, though, I like to
                    make a long list of clustered questions to pose and a possible order for their
                    asking, not because any discussion will ever obey this trajectory but because
                    the list of questions ready at hand will encourage me to keep the conversation
                    moving briskly and purposefully. In general, I find it best to start with small
                    and answerable questions: what is a viaduct? What do viaducts have in common
                    with steamboats and railways? What do steamboats, viaducts, and railways make
                    possible? In whose service are they built? I explain that infrastructure was
                    being built rapidly, all across Britain, in the 1830s: I will mention some
                    examples and show more images, very briefly. Who is building these railways and
                    viaducts, and for whose profit? How do they relate to the public good? Would
                    there be resistance to these developments, and from whom? What is this “war” is
                    actually about, and who’s waging it? Is it significant that it is figured in
                    this poem as a war, instead of as “opposition” or “tension” or some other less
                    metaphorical kind of hostility?</p>
                <p>Even though everyone already has it on their desks, I’ll project the sonnet on
                    the screen because I think it can help to focus the group’s attention on the
                    actual words of the poem, as written. I’ll ask someone—often the reader, if the
                    reader has perhaps volunteered in the hopes of avoiding other contributions—to
                    offer some thoughts about the sonnet’s first sentence (ll.1-3). Students will
                    often stumble for a moment when reading the first sentence aloud, I think
                    because of the opening trochee and the unwelcoming unfamiliarity of the main
                    characters: the speaker is telling a story about “Motions and Means” at war with
                    “old poetic feeling.” The poetic apostrophe at work here makes this
                    unfamiliarity especially pressing: what would it mean to speak directly to
                    “Motions and Means”—to offer them reassurances—without addressing the movers or
                    planners? Can one really speak to motions and means? I find it strange to
                    imagine “motions and means” being opposed by a “feeling,” and stranger yet for a
                    speaker to discuss the conflict with “motions and means” directly. This poem
                    aggressively effaces human subjects, speaking only of their movements and
                    emotions, as if movements and feelings could exist without belonging to anyone.
                    In the sestet, we learn about a complicated contest between various vast
                    abstractions: Nature, it seems, distances herself from beauty, who in turn is
                    critical of motions and means, to form an alliance with art, as a strategy to
                    defeat Time, who is sympathetic to the predicament of Space. Weirdly, they are
                    presented as a family, each with offspring and siblings. What is implied by
                    this?, I will ask. The reader is already embroiled in a family romance. Is it in
                    any way fathomable that Time or Space could experience something like the
                    Oedipus complex, for instance?</p>
                <p>It’s a difficult story to follow at first, because of its allegorical nature and
                    the way that the figures seem, against all odds, to be capable of strategy and
                    sensitivity. There are traces here of human beings, but they are only traces: we
                    have at stake “the Mind,” and we’re warned of possible interference by
                    judgmental but tolerant “Poets,” but still we’re being left with the impression
                    of huge impersonal forces at work, each working through complicated resentments
                    that only vaguely relate to human thought and action. To frame it all, we have
                    two modes of semi-autonomous being and thinking: “motions and means,” with which
                    we might identify because the address is also implicitly to the reader, and
                    “poetic feeling.” Why is the poem doing this? What are we supposed to glean from
                    this tendency? The opening trochee of “Motions and Means” aggressively insists
                    on the substantiality and violence of the motions and means: they are very real
                    and present. If there is any resistance movement here—and we are assured by the
                    speaker that there is not—it is allotted the anapest (and extra syllable) of
                    “Poets, even,” and thus bridled with a kind of weakness and inefficiency. It’s
                    good that poets have decided not to cause too much trouble for the motions and
                    means, as it would hardly be a fair fight by the sound of it. We are left with a
                    poet sycophantically currying the favor of the motions and means, directly.</p>
                <p>I’ll ask the students about the effect of the enjambment and caesura in these
                    opening lines of the sonnet: the poem is offering a meditation about
                    interruption and dividedness, in some way, I would suggest, and we can try to
                    figure out what the poem might be implying about such conditions. Especially in
                    the octave, but also in the sestet, the strongest and most meaningful pauses
                    tend to come midway through a line. One syntactical reason for all of the
                    caesura is that this is a poem filled with subordinate clauses, and therefore
                    commas, as if the speaker feels compelled to explain ever further, or as if
                    further context were always necessary (e.g., “howsoe’er it mar / The loveliness
                    of Nature”). We can discuss why this might be: from where does this anxiety
                    stem? On the other hand, we can begin to consider the form of the sonnet as a
                    possible solution to dividedness. Petrarchan sonnets, in particular, are
                    difficult to break into more than two pieces: the extreme concision and the
                    tight, woven rhyme scheme encourage us to think about how things are connected
                    to other things; the mechanism of the volta, though itself a line of division,
                    also encourages us to think that the problems have direct and discrete
                    solutions. The sonnet isn’t a form that encourages one to think about
                    irreconcilable differences or critical aporia. Can we think through the
                    combination of this sonnet’s the enjambments and caesura, on the one hand, and
                    its apparent formal cohesion, on the other? Where the poem seeks to locate
                    division and aporia, I will suggest, is not in the big picture of things.
                    Rather, these are internal, and things that contribute to, rather than interfere
                    with, larger systems of meaning—poetic form, or, one might even say, commerce.
                    After all, “motions and means” are likewise, at one at the same time, running
                    all over the place and internally broken: the short circuiting of industrial
                    capitalism is internal to capitalism itself—consider how, for Marx and Engels,
                    the bourgeoisie trains its own grave-diggers (483)—even while its internal
                    failures and excesses do not really prevent Britain, through the very force and
                    ambition of its industries, from becoming a (seemingly) monolithic and
                    devastating entity in the world. I don’t fetishize the alignment of poetic form
                    and content by any means, but such alignment can be a useful teaching tool when
                    the opportunity presents itself.</p>
                <p>What I will suggest is that the poem may not be about finding common ground or
                    forgiveness between “old poetic feeling” and “motions and means,” as steamboats,
                    viaducts, and railways begin to crisscross the landscape. Rather, the apparent
                    tension between “motions and means” and “poetic feeling” can be said to enable
                    industrial progress, so-called: poetic feeling can be turned into a kind of
                    ideological supplement to “motions and means,” stubbornly reaffirming a
                    community’s investment in nature at the very moment that this commitment has
                    been abandoned. In this way, perhaps Wordsworth is right to see poetry as the
                    support for industrial capitalism, against all odds. I ask: who stands to
                    benefit from explaining away the tension between industry and poetry, as the
                    poem endeavors to do? What is initially so startling about this poem is that it
                    appropriates the infrastructure of capitalism to its poetic register. But the
                    reverse situation is even more startling, and is also a part of the poem: it is
                    poetry, here, which becomes part of a general industrial and commercial project.
                    More than anything, the tension that Wordsworth is seeking to explain away is
                    explained away to the benefit of industrial capitalism, so it can better
                    continue in its motions and means. Yet—to complicate this further—this
                    reconciliation happens “in spite” of the tension between industry and aesthetic
                    judgment, not because industry is ever made beautiful. We will discuss, briefly,
                    what might be meant by Wordsworth’s “in spite,” in this context. Perhaps some
                    other form of resistance is taking shape, here? We might brainstorm about this
                    for a minute or two, as a class.</p>
                <p>I will note that the poem immediately offers judgment about this tension,
                    ironically by disavowing judgment and the tension itself (i.e., “not for this”).
                    The “not for this” is a textbook case of Freudian-style negation: by saying “not
                    for this, / .&#160;.&#160;. shall you, be judged amiss” unprompted, we are left
                    with the strong impression of harsh judgment. We talk about what the poem
                    accomplishes through this failed exculpation, or backhanded incrimination. Which
                    is it?, I ask my students. Then we discuss why the speaker identifies poets
                    (“Poets even”) as the most obvious and likely place where we would find
                    disapproval. Because Wordsworth was by this time a highly visible poet, someone
                    quite closely associated with the very category of the poet, we can infer that
                    this poem has the potential to deliver a particularly devastating critique of
                    these dehumanized “motions and means.”</p>
                <p> We come back, then, to the steamboats, viaducts, and railways: these are figures
                    for shipment and therefore connection, a national and European economy, of the
                    infrastructure of global commerce. I ask: in what way might this world of
                    commerce challenge old poetic feeling? After all, isn’t poetry also about
                    connecting people across time and space? Isn’t poetry a viaduct and railway of
                    sorts? Once we have discussed that question we can get into a direct discussion
                    of Bataille’s thoughts on industry.</p>
                <p>I’ll ask a student to summarize Bataille’s concerns, and I will fill in as
                    needed, to ensure that we’re all on the same page before working through this
                    problem via Wordsworth. Once we’ve had a satisfactory summary, I back away and
                    allow students to ask each other about Bataille’s ideas. Once I’m convinced that
                    people understand Bataille’s concerns, I ask: is this division between intimacy
                    and things a real problem? We can devote perhaps five minutes in debating that
                    question. Next, I ask: can poetry be a solution to this problem? Do you think
                    so? Does Wordsworth think so? We might spend seven or eight minutes talking
                    through these questions. I then will ask: are there other modes of discourse,
                    besides poetry, that attempt to reconcile the order of intimacy and the order of
                    things? After gathering some ideas, I’ll point out Bataille’s opinion, that
                    there are people who have tried to approach the order of intimacy through the
                    techniques of science, trying to bring clarity and precision to something
                    fundamentally unreal (96). This attempt at reintegration, he says perhaps
                    insensitively, has produced only “stammerings”: we’re trying and failing to
                    represent the intimate order in the real world. We can access intimacy in this
                    way, he says, but only through meek, weakened voices, and at a severe
                    psychological cost.</p>
                <p>Is this poem an instance of such “stammering”? It’s an opportunity for us to
                    consider the syntax and punctuation of the poem, including the many subordinate
                    clauses of the octave. We move from there to considerations of its tone, as the
                    poem attempts to reconcile intimacy with things. Wordsworth says that there is
                    no “bar / To the Mind’s gaining that prophetic sense.” Is this convincing?
                    Surely it cannot be so easy as Wordsworth suggests: Bataille says that these
                    registers can only be reconciled through “an impossible operation” (99).
                    Self-consciousness has a bad habit of tending toward things, not intimacy:
                    intimacy is, in a way, the very horizon that self-consciousness cannot attain,
                    and hence the impulse for us to swerve away from intimacy. Bataille regrets that
                    when people have tried to solve this problem previously, they have simply tried
                    to undo the swerve, and end up caught in “a contrary operation, a reduction of
                    the reduction” (99). Does this happen to Wordsworth? Moreover, for Bataille,
                    intimacy is unruly and violent—it threatens to annihilate the order of things,
                    even while it has historically been a condition for the order of things too. I
                    return, then, to the abstractions that populate this poem: does this indicate a
                    new mode of subjectivity? Is this the destruction, or perhaps dissolution, of
                    the Enlightenment subject—the subject of the Cartesian
                    <foreign>cogito</foreign>? Here we follow the liberation of concepts and words
                    from their subjects, of motions and means from industrialists, and poets from
                    poetry.</p>
                <p>This leads us to reconsider the meaning of Wordsworth’s “ye”: whom and what does
                    it address? At one level, it refers only to the motions and means of industrial
                    capitalism. But as we encounter a “ye” on the page, we become, as readers,
                    necessarily interpellated into that apostrophe. What are the risks of such
                    belonging? I will ask the students. After some discussion, I will try to suggest
                    that the “ye” is folding together the motions and means of industrialization
                    with a newly industrialized subject-reader: a subject who becomes the subject of
                    these motions and means, and ultimately subjected to them as well. If the poem
                    is to make any sense, the reader is forced to recognize herself in the harsh
                    features of industry. More alarmingly, we are told that, given industrial
                    progress, Time “smiles on you with cheer sublime.” Again, the “you” being smiled
                    upon must necessarily refer to the motions and means of industry and the reader
                    herself. This is, I will suggest, basically horrific: capitalism doesn’t “smile
                    on you”—it truly doesn’t care about you except as a market or demographic—and
                    it’s not our duty to smile on it, either! Here, we confront the alienation of
                    modern industrial capitalism <emph>by means of our total integration within
                        it</emph>. Meanwhile, haunting the edge of the discussion, is the
                    possibility that the poem has generated enough irony to destabilize these
                    motions and means from within. After all, we are not really assured that poetry
                    won’t be critical of industry or of the subjects it produces: we are promised
                    only that it will criticize industry “not for this”—that is, it won’t criticize
                    it on aesthetic grounds primarily. </p>
                <p>By this late point in the semester, the students have read quite a lot of
                    Wordsworth, Dorothy and William alike. So they can see immediately what’s
                    unusual about “Steamboats, Viaducts, and Railways”: the poem seems to resist or
                    complicate quintessential William Wordsworth fascinations such as nostalgia,
                    selfhood, sympathy, and the indispensability of nature to spiritual recovery.
                    Then again, it can seem to revisit famous Wordsworth meditations such as
                    “Tintern Abbey,” which too seeks to find in the cultivation of “pleasing
                    thoughts” “abundant recompense” for the “loss” of one’s ability to appreciate a
                    natural landscape. In “Steamboats, Viaducts, and Railways,” as in “Tintern
                    Abbey,” it’s a habit of mind really at stake and it seems especially important
                    to cultivate a way of thinking able to confront the “future years.” I ask my
                    students decide if “Steamboats, Viaducts, and Railways” is aligned or out of
                    step with Wordsworth’s earlier thoughts on the confluence of nature and mind.
                    Despite its reputation, is high Romanticism, even that of William Wordsworth,
                    devoted to nature at all?</p>
                <p>Bataille says, “The difficulty in making distinct knowledge and the intimate
                    order coincide is due to their contrary modes of existence in time. Divine life
                    is immediate, whereas knowledge is an operation that requires suspension and
                    waiting” (98). This allows us to consider the ways that the poem emphasizes time
                    and temporality. Why is poetic feeling “old,” for instance? It seems to reach
                    into the future, as “the Mind [is] gaining that prophetic sense / Of future
                    change.” This poem is sort of about the mind and its development: we are moving
                    through old processes in an endeavor to attain some sort of futurity. Steamboats
                    and viaducts might seem like the future, and they are the future, but they’re
                    also here and now, and in this way they actually do interfere with the prophetic
                    sense. They work in the here and now to bring about the future, but deny us the
                    experience of the future in the here and now. Yet what’s at risk is the way in
                    which we understand which “soul ye are”—that is, what we are already, and in the
                    present tense. Not “will be”—are. But what we are must be discovered, uncovered,
                    through “old” modes of discourse which open up an awareness of “future
                    change.”</p>
                <p>For all of Wordsworth’s emphasis on points of vision, it is important to think
                    through Bataille’s warning, that we “will regain intimacy only in darkness”
                    (100). Yes, restoring intimacy to the world will enable us to achieve
                    much-desired clarity and passion, but it will also force us to rediscover “the
                    night of the animal intimate with the world—into which it will enter” (100).
                    This sounds like a threat, or a warning at least. But why would this “night of
                    the animal” necessarily be a bad thing? Does Wordsworth worry about this
                    problem, I ask them? There is a necessary blindness, says Bataille, because
                    self-consciousness cannot ever become intimate: intimacy is indeed the modern
                    name for the edge of “things,” and as such, it must remain somewhat at bay (99).
                    Yet the combination of Wordsworth and Bataille is helping us to pose, and test
                    answers to, difficult questions about subjectivity and politics. At one level
                    I’m interested in starting a discussion about the way that subjectivity is
                    formed, in Wordsworth’s understanding, around a gap or a renunciation. How could
                    we know if there might be, despite Wordsworth’s reassurances, a “bar / To the
                    Mind”? The speaker here asserts that there is no such bar, but the poem is
                    perhaps less certain. This possible gap, I would suggest, is perhaps
                    constitutive of subjectivity as Wordsworth construes it, not an impediment to
                    it. This form of subjectivity is also, arguably, a historical development—an
                    outgrowth of Enlightenment rights discourse, a new way to respond to ecological
                    destruction and alienating labor practices. At a second level, I’m interested in
                    the political ramifications of such wounded subjectivity: is this poem
                    enunciating a new way of being in the world? Who and what can count as a
                    subject? Here, a fruitful connection can be made to “We Are Seven,” too. Is this
                    process of extending recognition necessarily democratic in every instance?</p>
                <p>Teaching these texts together can open a discussion about the presence—or
                    absence—of intimacy in Wordsworth’s thought, in British Romanticism, and in the
                    modern world generally. Bataille, by alerting students to ideological debates
                    playing out in Wordsworth’s poem, can show students how to consider features of
                    a poem beyond its apparent argument. Conversely, students trained in the basics
                    of poetry analysis can, through engagement with Wordsworth’s sonnet, learn to
                    see aspects of Bataille’s thought that they may have otherwise misperceived—they
                    see, for instance, that Bataille isn’t wistfully wishing for some impossible
                    world, and that capitalist progress generates its own resistance. When read
                    alongside Bataille, Wordsworth seems to challenge capitalist hegemony from
                    inside its own ideologies. More broadly, reading Wordsworth beside Bataille can
                    teach students that theory isn’t a “lens” through which we can examine British
                    Romanticism, but rather a way of tracking subtle shifts of meaning within
                    literary text and theory alike.</p>
