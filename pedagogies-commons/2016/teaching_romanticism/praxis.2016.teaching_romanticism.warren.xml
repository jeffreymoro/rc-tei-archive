                <p rend="noCount">This piece relates some strategies for creating a generative
                    tension between theory and romanticism in the classroom. Its examples are
                    Badiou's strident critiques of romanticism as the "philosopheme" of historicism
                    and Kant's imbrication of "theory" and "practice." At stake more broadly is the
                    problematic notion of use (and misuse), so common in recent discussions about
                    the humanities: how to "use" literature—which literature, or which theory, and
                    for what ends.</p>

                    <head>Introduction – Resistances to “the Theory Generation”</head>
                    <p>In a recent and widely read <title level="j">n+1</title> piece, Nicholas
                        Dames reflects on what happened when a generation of writers raised on
                        theory began asking questions about how theory shaped them, as both writers
                        and human beings. In those works (by Franzen, Eugenides, Egan, Moore, Cole,
                        etc.) <quote>Theory is judged from within the forms it tried to dismantle
                            (psychological realism; the bildungsroman), by criteria Theory could
                            only recognize as regressive or naïve: What kind of a person does Theory
                            make? What did it once mean to have read theorists? What does it mean
                            now? How does Theory help you hold a job? Deal with lovers, children,
                            bosses, and parents?<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">Nicholas
                                Dames, “The Theory Generation,” <title level="j">n+1</title>, 24
                                October 2012:
                            http://nplusonemag.com/the-theory-generation</note></quote> In Dames’s
                        account, Theory, which he capitalizes throughout, becomes a kind of unified
                        thing or shared experience, and “novelistic realism” becomes the form with
                        which to best investigate it. Dames is careful not to caricature that
                        realism, just as he resists caricaturing Theory. Realism for him is
                        capacious, both in the forms it takes and the ideas it swallows; <title
                            level="m">Middlemarch</title> obviously counts as a realist novel of
                        ideas, but so do <title level="m">Tristram Shandy</title>, <title level="m"
                            >JR</title>, and <title level="m">The Crying of Lot 49</title>. For
                        Dames, the question is: can realism, or rather today’s realism, swallow
                        theory? Is it, in Dames’s words, one of realism’s Others?</p>
                    <p> Absent from Dames’s narrative is another one of realism’s Others,
                        Romanticism. If it shows up at all, it does so under the guise of “that most
                        antique of realist modes,” the bildungsroman. In a related study, Judith
                        Ryan’s <title level="m">The Novel After Theory</title>, Romanticism is
                        similarly a kind of ur-stage of Theory. And Theory itself must in turn be
                        integrated into the concreteness of a novel’s scenes and story.<note
                            place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">See, e.g., Ryan’s description of how
                            Marilynne Robinson’s <title level="m">Housekeeping </title>both reenacts
                            the <title level="m">Prelude</title>’s boat-stealing scene, but also
                            “burst[s] the bounds of Romanticism” by moving closer to Derrida and
                                <foreign>bricolage</foreign>. What exactly Romanticism’s “bounds”
                            are, or whether they don’t extend to Derrida, or whether Romanticism is
                            something “bounded” at all, remains undiscussed. Ryan, 65.</note> Given
                        the contemporary writers who interest Dames and Ryan, it makes sense that
                        Romanticism would be off the menu. But I think their approaches raise larger
                        questions about a constellation of topics—Realism, Romanticism, Theory,
                        History, Form, and Narrative—that have recently been re-opened in our field.
                        I have in mind, among other things, Tilottama Rajan’s strong defense of
                        Romantic “narrativity” (a kind of working Theory) against what she sees as
                        the normalizing influence of the “(Victorian) Novel.”<note place="foot"
                            xml:id="ftn3" n="3">Rajan, <title level="m">Romantic Narrative: Shelley,
                                Hays, Godwin, Wollstonecraft</title> (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP,
                            2010), xii.</note> As an institution or practice of reading, the Novel’s
                        impact, for Rajan, happens in the real world. It shapes disciplinary
                        boundaries, such as the ongoing collapse of Romantic and Victorian into
                        Nineteenth-Century Studies, and it conditions our expectations of people and
                        organizations.</p>
                    <p>At stake in all of these diverse accounts is the problematic notion of use.
                        “Use” (and “misuse”) resonates with a recurring theme in recent discussions
                        of the humanities: how to use literature—which literature, or which theory,
                        and for what ends. The question seems particularly pressing for Romanticism,
                        which consistently resists an idea of instrumentality more amenable, one
                        would think, to other periods or modes. Because of that resistance
                        Romanticism becomes a kind of paradigm of literary studies more generally.
                        So we now ask how and whether Romanticism—or Romantic texts, or Romantic
                        reading practices, or even Romantic ways of being with the world—can or
                        should be instrumentalized. Late in his essay Dames brings up that very
                        question with respect to the related problem of teaching: “what does Theory
                        do for its former students in these novels?” His answer is as surprising as
                        it is unsettling: “Theory, it turns out, is less intellectually powerful
                        than emotionally useful; it habituates you to the anomic, precarious
                        existence you were destined to lead in any case.” Of course, this isn’t
                        exactly Dames’s answer, nor (God forbid) my own. It is the novelists’, and it sounds
                        perversely marketable to critics of the usefulness of the humanities. Not to
                        show the fly the way out of the flybottle but to model its twists and turns
                        and make it livable. Theory in this reading is mimetic or therapeutic—a
                        puzzling position for something often defined by its resistance to
                        representation or its unsettling of habit. </p>
                    <p>Problematic, too, seems the novelists’ treatment of emotion or affect in
                        Dames’s account, a topic explored and complicated by recent work in
                        Romanticism (often by Romanticists the same age as Dames’s novelists, a very
                        different “Theory Generation”). Speaking of Rei Terada’s <title level="m"
                            >Feeling in Theory</title> in his own <title level="m">Blake’s
                            Agitation: Criticism and the Emotions</title>, Steven Goldsmith explores
                        the way in which emotion exceeds subjectivity. “The real strangeness of
                        emotion’s subjectlessness,” he writes, “rubs critically against the
                        ideological fullness and familiarity of identity-affirming
                        experience.&#160;.&#160;.The emotion that survives in and as criticism still
                        carries an unsettling electric charge” (Goldsmith 278). Yet it seems safe to
                        say that what’s missing in Dames’s characterization of a generation’s
                        relationship to Theory, Goldsmith’s “criticism,” is that “unsettling
                        electric charge.” If we think of Theory (and perhaps Romanticism) as a kind
                        of “lightning which has yet found no conductor,” the question becomes how to
                        “conduct” that charge in a class. Following Ohm’s 1827 discovery, I suggest
                        that the answer might have something to do with resistance, especially
                        theory’s inherent resistances and the formal resistances posed by literary
                            texts.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4">De Man, among others,
                            argues that theory resists itself, that theory enacts a recalcitrance or
                            resistance not unlike literary form’s. Even “rhetorical readings,” the
                            most elastic kind of reading for de Man, “still avoid and resist the
                            reading they advocate. Nothing can overcome the resistance to theory
                            since theory <emph>is </emph>itself this resistance” (“The Resistance to
                            Theory,” 19). Thinking with Susan Wolfson’s “formalist activism,”
                            Goldsmith argues that “By attending to the specificity of literary
                            language, readers participate in a text’s resistance to cultural
                            generalization. No one’s words should be conscripted, least of all ‘as
                            information’” (279). Of course, my allying of theory and form is not
                            without its problems, as Wolfson knows well. Theory’s cultural
                            conscription is precisely the goal of Dames’s novelists, an issue
                            thornily involved in their use of the realist form.</note></p>
                    <p>My point in bringing up Dames’s (quite teachable) essay is to show what
                        Theory and Romanticism seem to be up against. But in these reflections I
                        would like to bracket the question about generations’ differing relations to
                        Theory, pressing as it might be, and focus on a problem complexly related to
                        the question of resistance: how to use theory to get students to think
                        differently about—or with—Romanticism. In my experience it is a rare student
                        who readily grasps—much less is enthusiastic for—critical theory if they are
                        not putting it to use either in reading a line of poetry, in a discussion,
                        in an essay, in a thesis, in their own lives. This has little to do, I
                        believe, with an anemic curiosity, much less with a lack of ability or
                        willingness to think abstractly. It has to do, in my experience, with a lack
                        of resistance. For students unfamiliar with it, Theory often appears in the
                        guise of either a punishing authority figure or as a kind of crystalline,
                        frictionless surface. In the first instance, Theory seems inaccessible
                        because It is pure resistance: It knows everything you don’t; It thinks in
                        ways that seem unthinkable; It has anticipated your own criticism of
                            it.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5">A nervous mockery of these

                    </p>
                    <p> My goal here is therefore to discuss a few instances where it seemed like I
                        created a healthy resistance between Theory and Romantic texts. I have
                        divided it into two sections: <list type="ordered">
                            <item n="1">Opposition Is True Friendship: Badiou, Romanticism,
                                History</item>

                        and use, formulated and marshaled differently by different thinkers. My
                        examples are Badiou and Kant.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"> On the
                            topic of the vexed connection between these concepts, particularly as
                            they relate to feeling, I recommend McLaughlin’s <title level="m">Poetic
                                Force</title>. For instance: “the capacity of poetic language to
                            exceed the grasp of empirical consciousness—for example, by breaking
                            free from spatial and temporal metaphors that draw on an empirical world
                            view—does not simply make it into a medium of rational or philosophical
                            communication after Kant. The ability to communicate the feeling of
                            reason transcending cognitive experience also brings with it internally
                            a ‘withdrawal’ of communicability. The language of the poets expresses
                            the capacity and the incapacity to communicate the feeling of the
                            divisive finitude of reason as a force and an unforce” (xiii).</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Among contemporary theorists, Romanticism has found few opponents as strident
                        as Badiou. Romanticism for him collapsed philosophy and history, truth and
                        poetry; it also lifted “Romantic” fusion up as the ideal of love. I have
                        found this blunt resistance useful for thinking through a number of Romantic
                        texts, particularly those where it turns out that Badiou’s thinking is only
                        minimally different from what he’d purportedly critique. My case study there
                        is Shelley, who shares a philosophical heritage with Badiou in the figures
                        of Plato and Lucretius. He also holds, of course, a Badiou-ian “fidelity” to
                        the spirit of the French Revolution. In the second part, I move on to a
                        discussion of Kant, a seldom-taught but oft-referenced figure in Romantic
                        literature courses. I look at some moments where he explicitly discusses the
                        interrelationship between theory and practice, and explain how and why I
                        teach German Idealism in my literature courses. These kinds of minimal
                        differences create productive tensions, like those between two drafts of a
                        poem. They are perhaps akin, on a larger scale, to those between Theory and
                        Romanticism. What David Clark has called Theory’s thrumming afterlife feeds
                        on those tensions.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn8" n="8">See “’Waving, not
                            Drowning’: On the Lives of Theory,” <title level="m">Studies in
                                Romanticism </title>44 (Summer 2005), 263. Theory’s afterlife in
                            Romanticism is even more robust today than it was a decade ago when
                            Clark made that pronouncement.</note></p>
                    <p>Badiou has claimed his project is tied to education, a fact articulated in
                        his recent translation of Plato’s <title level="m">Republic.</title> In his
                        introduction to that work, Kenneth Reinhard notes that “for Badiou,
                        education is not merely an activity of proper cultivation.&#160;.&#160;. it
                        requires the <emph>interruption</emph> of ‘the consensual routine’ of
                        culture through the experience of an ‘event’ and the subjective
                        reorientation that it involves” (Badiou , <title level="m">Plato’s
                            Republic</title>, xx). The same is true, Reinhard continues, for
                        Badiou’s free translation of Plato. It “forces” Plato’s text, and our
                        reading of it, to expand. I will later describe Badiou’s more technical use
                        of <emph>force</emph>, and how it is used in Kant. Force and resistance link
                        the two halves of this essay. But I also want to preserve the word’s basic
                        impulse. I often teach a work to “force” myself to think differently about
                        it; students sometimes take classes so that they are “forced” to read a
                        difficult text that they might not get through on their own; and I am
                        consistently “forced” to teach something differently based on how students,
                        or other texts, resist (or do not resist) it. The classroom—and the readings
                        and assignments that condition it—can be a space for recognizing and
                        enabling this energetic play of forces and resistances.</p>
                    <p>Before getting into my case studies of Kant and Badiou, it might help to step
                        back again and ask: what is theory? One answer comes in the talk Derrida
                        gave in the 1966 Johns Hopkins conference that allegedly started it all. In
                        “Structure, Sign and Play,” Derrida says that two things happen when the
                        distinction between Nature and Culture (or any two fundamental supports to a
                        structure) begin to break down: either a) you think you can “deconstitute”
                        those concepts by historicizing them and “stepping outside” of
                        philosophy—which, according to Derrida, most typically simply reinstitutes
                        the very metaphysics one was avoiding. Or, b) you can, like Levi-Strauss,
                        try to use those broken concepts, with the understanding that they can be
                        discarded; “to preserve as an instrument something whose truth value he
                        criticizes.” Or, says Derrida in reference to Genette,
                            “<foreign>bricolage</foreign> is critical language itself,” and
                            “<foreign>bricolage</foreign> criticizes itself.”<note place="foot"

                            <foreign>bricolage</foreign> does not adequate to theory, inasmuch as it
                        is still dominated by use.</p>
                    <p> Theory’s vexed relationship to use and <foreign>bricolage</foreign> turns up
                        in a formulation by Fredric Jameson, one which I think is worth quoting at
                        length: <quote>.&#160;.&#160;. dialectic belongs to theory rather than
                            philosophy: the latter is always haunted by the dream of some foolproof
                            self-sufficient system, a set of interlocking concepts which are their
                            own cause.&#160;.&#160;.Theory, on the other hand, has no vested
                            interests inasmuch as it never lays claim to an absolute system, a
                            non-ideological formulation of itself and its ‘truths’; indeed, always
                            itself complicit in the being of current language, it has only the
                            vocation and never-finished task of undermining philosophy as such, by
                            unraveling affirmative statements and propositions of all kinds. We may
                            put this another way by saying that the two great bodies of
                            post-philosophical thought, marked by the names of Marx and Freud, are
                            better characterized as unities of theory and practice: that is to say
                            that their practical component always interrupts the ‘unity of theory’
                            and prevents it from coming together in some satisfying philosophical
                            system. Alain Badiou has recently coined the expression
                            ‘anti-philosophy’ for these new and constitutively scandalous modes of
                            intervening conceptually in the world. (Jameson 7-8)</quote> I find this
                        interrupting of theory by practice—and, as we shall see with Kant, theory’s
                        interrupting practice—appealing, particularly within the context of
                        teaching. At least for me, teaching is always experimental. In its best
                        instances it has interrupted both my theories and my practices of
                        reading.</p>

                        measured by their power to unfold a past worthy of them.” This is Badiou’s
                        challenge at the end of <title level="m">Logics of Worlds</title> (509). It
                        is a challenge not only to historicism, but also to Romanticism, which
                        Badiou elsewhere calls the “philosopheme” of historicism. It is a
                        contemporary problem since, for Badiou, “the historicist kernel of
                        romanticism continues to be the referential site of our thinking”
                        (“Philosophy and Mathematics” 97). Earlier in <title level="m">Logics of
                            Worlds</title> Badiou makes a now-famous distinction between “democratic
                        materialism” and “materialist dialectic.” The former, which he identifies
                        with the present (and thus with his versions of historicism and
                        Romanticism), makes the “natural” assumption that <emph>there are only
                            bodies and languages</emph>. The latter, which Badiou describes as his
                        own position, declares that <emph>there are only bodies and languages,
                            except that there are truths</emph> (4). For Badiou, a truth isn’t the
                        correspondence between proposition and world. That would reduce it to being
                        a simple relationship between language and bodies, a kind of knowledge.
                        Rather, a truth is a procedure that punctures our knowledge of the world and
                        opens up new possibilities for it; because being always exceeds knowledge,
                        truths are infinite and eternal, immanent and everywhere. Exploring what
                        exactly a truth is (or does) takes up major portions of both volumes of

                            force finds its origin not in any vital energy as the possibility of
                            existence, but rather in the internal impasses which render the

                        Constructing truths forces the future to reorganize itself in such a way
                        that it can decide upon them. “A forcing is a powerful fiction of a
                            <emph>completed</emph> truth. Starting with such a fiction, I can
                            <emph>force </emph>new bits of knowledge, without even <emph>verifying
                        </emph>this knowledge” (Philosophy and Truth” 48-49).</p>
                    <p> I bring up Badiou’s koans about history and the present, about bodies,
                        languages and truths, because I have found them to be productive challenges
                        to Romanticism’s received ideas—both in my own thinking, and in the
                        classroom. Indeed, Badiou’s description of <emph>forcing truths
                        </emph>sounds a lot like pedagogy. They ask us to confront our most basic
                        assumptions: why we read what we read, and why do so in the way that we do.
                        Such questions can be posed very generally: <emph>is </emph>Romanticism
                        really, at core, an approach to history? What about competing kinds of
                        Romanticisms? And is Romanticism really <emph>the </emph>“referential site”
                        for “our thinking”? What would that mean? Who would “we” be, in such a case?
                        Can we think differently than we do—and if so, how do we want to think? </p>
                    <p>These are, obviously, important large-scale questions that can be broached in
                        a course on Romanticism. But in my experience Badiou is even more effective
                        at a smaller scale. When teaching “Mont Blanc” in a graduate course,
                        recently, I had the students read widely in the history of skepticism: the
                        first half of Hume’s <title level="m">Enquiry Concerning Human
                            Understanding</title>; a chapter from Cavell’s <title level="m">In Quest
                            of the Ordinary: Lines of Skepticism and Romanticism</title>; Eckhart
                        Förster on the genesis of Kant’s first critique; the final paragraphs of de
                        Man’s “Shelley Disfigured”; and Wasserman’s “The Poetry of Skepticism.” Plus
                        Badiou’s <title level="m">Second Manifesto for Philosophy </title>and the
                        preface and conclusion to <title level="m">Logics of Worlds</title>, where
                        he tries to describe our contemporary skepticism. When in our reading of
                        “Mont Blanc” we reached the section about the “still cave of the witch
                        Poesy,” someone brought up Badiou’s declaration that <emph>there are only
                            bodies and languages, except that there are truths.</emph> The
                        question—whether in “Mont Blanc” there is anything other than language and
                        bodies—immediately catalyzed the discussion of the poem. What, in Shelley,
                        constitutes a body, or a language, or a “truth”? The question can be
                        fruitfully posed with respect to individual lines: <list type="unordered">

                        Badiou will detect a certain resonance between his and Shelley’s terms:
                        love, void, universal, relations, thought, and so forth. Teasing out the
                        differences and similarities between Badiou’s and Shelley’s use, when it’s
                        going well, compels us to read each anew. The goal is not to send the
                        students into the icy abstractions of <title level="m">Being and
                            Event</title> or category theory, but rather to prompt them to rethink
                        texts they’ve already read. </p>
                    <p>Surprisingly, for Badiou the link between philosophy and art, since Plato,
                        has always been education. This is true, he says, no matter what our actual
                        beliefs about art are—whether we think it is a simulation of the truth (the
                            <emph>didactic </emph>schema), the only path toward the truth (the
                            <emph>romantic </emph>schema), or a human endeavor distinct from
                        truth-seeking (the <emph>classical </emph>schema). Badiou himself tries to
                        synthesize these views by declaring that art creates its own truths,
                        separate from both philosophy and the other “conditions” of truth (science,
                        politics, and love). Therefore, “art is pedagogical for the simple reason
                        that it produces truths and because ‘education’ (save in its oppressive or
                        perverted expressions) has never meant anything but this: to arrange the
                        forms of knowledge in such a way that some truth may come to pierce a hole
                        in them. What art educates us for is therefore nothing apart from its own
                        existence. The only question is that of <emph>encountering </emph>this
                        existence” (“Art and Philosophy” 9). I think that one thing that theory can
                        do for students is help generate that encounter, or (for us as well)
                        generate it anew.</p>
                    <p>But on first blush Badiou’s formula would seem to play into the hands of
                        critics claiming that the arts and humanities simply create their own
                        standards, ones distinct from the more useful truths pursued by science and
                        the social sciences. On such an account the arts (and many of the
                        humanities) therefore become allied with something personal and transitory
                        like love, which—though perhaps “important”—does not deserve sustained
                        scholarship or funding. Of course, it would be hard to imagine such critics
                        endorsing Badiou’s notions of science or politics. Neither are producers of
                        knowledge, but rather of truth—truth defined, again, as a kind of puncturing
                        of our knowledge of the world we find ourselves in. </p>
                    <p>But why this cordoning off of domains of inquiry? Could Francis Bacon be, as
                        Shelley calls him, “a poet”? Perhaps Badiou’s more recent thoughts on the
                        relationship between truth procedures (art, politics, science, love) would
                        strike us as closer to a Romantic notion of the interlinking of fields:
                            <quote>We need a theory of what I call the networking or the tying
                            together of truth procedures. Eventually, I see no reason why this could
                            not be called ‘culture’.&#160;.&#160;. Indeed, we can consider culture
                            to be a network of various forcings, that is, at a given moment in time,
                            the manner in which the encyclopedic knowledge of the situation is
                            modified under the constraints of various operations of forcing which
                            depend on procedures that are different from one another. (“Can Change
                            Be Thought?” 315)</quote> In a work like <title level="m">Prometheus
                            Unbound</title>, the relationship and potential differences between love
                        and politics (and art) is a real problem for Shelley, one which Badiou can
                        help frame. While my experience has been with using Badiou to think with
                        Shelley, and vice versa—pairing, say, “What Is Love?” with <title level="m"
                            >Epipsychidion</title> or <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>—I
                        imagine the same might be done with other Romantic writers. That same
                        conflict of fields, for instance, occurs in Blake, or Coleridge, or Keats,
                        or Byron, or Scott, or Mary Shelley. More important than any resonance that
                        might arise from placing Badiou with one of them would be the resultant
                        resistances. The oppositions Badiou poses to Romanticism are often
                        surprisingly clear, capturable in short selections or even single sentences.
                        That clarity has helped hone my own thinking as well as, I hope, my
                        students’.</p>

                        German Idealism?</head>
                    <p>German philosophy’s influence on the English poets and thinkers has been long
                        discussed, contested, and caricatured. I find a basic familiarity with it is
                        helpful for entering those debates, and for thinking about how we do
                        literary criticism more generally. In other words, I think its use extends
                        beyond Romanticism. So I turn now from an instance of contemporary theory,
                        to theory that would have been contemporary for the Romantics. I address
                        notions of theory and use as Kant may have conceived of them, before
                        reflecting on what I have come to see as the specific use of German Idealism
                        for thinking with British Romanticism. My concrete pedagogical example, with
                        which I conclude, comes from my experience teaching Eckart Förster’s <title
                            level="m">The 25 Years of Philosophy: A Systematic Reconstruction
                        </title>(2012)—a chapter a week, alongside the literary texts—in a
                        semester-length graduate course.</p>
                    <p>In the 1793 Immanuel Kant found himself an object of a satire by the polymath
                        Abraham Gotthelf Kästner. Its title was <title level="m">Thoughts on the
                            Inability of Writers to Produce Rebellion</title>, and its basic
                        argument was a common one: theorists such as Kant had uncoupled themselves
                        from the real world. Kant’s response that same year in the <title level="m"
                            >Berlinische Monaatschrift</title>, “On the Common Saying: ‘This May be
                        True in Theory, but it does not Apply in Practice’,” cunningly turned the
                        tables: “It is therefore not the fault of the theory if it is of little
                        practical use.&#160;.&#160;. The fault is that there is <emph>not enough
                        </emph>theory; the person concerned ought to have learnt from experience”
                        (Kant 61). The point is supremely Kantian: so-called natural experience is
                        always already shaped by theoretical frameworks. Practical experience, in
                        order to be practical, must build itself up into general, theoretical
                        principles so that it can be communicated, reflected upon, actualized.</p>
                    <p> Two years later, in 1795, Kant applied a similar bit of logical torque to a
                        neighboring topic. I include the opening paragraph in full, in part because
                        it is so eminently teachable: <quote>THE PERPETUAL PEACE. A Dutch innkeeper
                            once put this satirical inscription on his signboard, along with the
                            picture of a graveyard. We shall not trouble to ask whether it applies
                            to men in general, or particularly to heads of states (who can never
                            have enough of war), or only to the philosophers who blissfully dream of
                            perpetual peace. The author of the present essay does, however, make one
                            reservation in advance. The practical politician tends to look down with
                            great complacency upon the political theorist as a mere academic. The
                            theorist's abstract ideas, the practitioner believes, cannot endanger
                            the state, since the state must be founded upon principles of
                            experience; it thus seems safe to let him fire off his whole broadside,
                            and the worldly wise statesman need not turn a hair. It thus follows
                            that if the practical politician is to be consistent, he must not claim,
                            in the event of a dispute with the theorists, to scent any danger to the
                            state in the opinions which the theorists has randomly uttered in
                            public. By this saving clause, the author of this essay will consider
                            himself expressly safeguarded, in correct and proper style, against all
                            malicious interpretation. (Kant 93). </quote> These are the sorts of
                        moments in Kant that we, as literary critics, like. In the former example,
                        Kant cuts to the heart of what we today would call false consciousness or
                        ideology—a belief that the mind can have direct, unstructured access to the
                        world. In this example from “Perpetual Peace,” Kant uses irony to shield
                        himself from “malicious interpretation.” He finds a blind spot in the
                        practitioner’s perspective, and wagers that if an efficacious critique is
                        possible at all, it might be leveraged from that occluded site. He cheekily
                        labels his essay a “sketch,” an <foreign>Entwurf</foreign>—that is, a
                        design, plan or blueprint, with its obvious mimicking of a document from a
                        practical vocation.</p>
                    <p>Kant’s opening gambit is to take a mismatch between text, image, and site
                        (“THE PERPETUAL PEACE,” the graveyard, and the inn), allegedly commissioned
                        by a non-academic foreigner (the innkeeper), and use it to structure and
                        defend a philosophical “sketch.” As critics we like this because here Kant
                        challenges genres. We have even invented the term “fourth critique” to
                        describe the constellation of political writings Kant wrote in the 1790’s, a
                        series of fragments that simultaneously complete and disrupt the system that
                        conditioned them. One thing that makes these texts often appear more
                        “literary” than even something like the third <title level="m"
                            >Critique</title> is Kant’s finding a rhetorical register that can put
                        his theoretical apparatus to use. In the case of <title level="m">Perpetual
                            Peace</title>, the most immediate application is a self-generated
                        “safeguarding” of Kant’s theses against misuse. In those moments I have a
                        doubled feeling: of the texts being actuated or put in motion, and of their
                        sudden halting. Jean-Luc Nancy has pointed out that, despite his alleged
                        absence of style, few philosophers have found their way into more literary
                        texts than Kant. He then mentions a 1917 letter of Walter Benjamin, who
                        declares that Kant’s linguistic austerity <quote>“represents a
                                <foreign>limes </foreign>of literary prose”.&#160;.&#160;. because
                            he perceives in Kant a yet-unheard-of philosophical stake, still to
                            come, Benjamin wishes to receive his prose—usually judged to be heavy—as
                            if possessing artistic force, that is to say, the force of awakening,
                            indeed of enthusiasm. Moreover, he immediately adds, “If this were not
                            the case, would the <title level="m">Critique of Pure Reason</title>
                            have so shaken Kleist to the deepest parts of his being?” (xxiv).
                        </quote> We seek out these moments. I, for instance, have just cited Nancy,
                        citing Benjamin, citing Kleist’s encounter with Kant. One thing that
                        “theory” can do is bring these kinds of moments, simultaneously fleeting and
                        eternal, into the present via an empirically verifiable lineage of
                        influence. Their problems become our problems; their having been shaken
                        shakes us. Of course, such neatly drawn lines of causation are precisely
                        what theory teaches us to suspect. Yet many, myself included, find ourselves
                        conceiving of these networks of relations “as if possessing artistic force.”
                        I find this “as if” to be a motivating factor in my own work, and also a
                        powerful pedagogical tool: read Kant <emph>as if</emph> it were powerful
                        enough to shake someone’s inner sense; let’s talk <emph>as if </emph>Shelley
                        were writing within a Badiouan framework; think of the German Romantics
                            <emph>as if </emph>they were simply composing an alternative historical
                        response to the French Revolution than the British; draft a sketch of what
                        perpetual peace might look like if the Kantian paradigm were efficacious and
                        true. The point is less about forcing similarities than unearthing
                        differences: between genres, strategies and styles; between historical
                        moments and places; between our first reading of a text and subsequent
                        readings of it. “To think differently than one thinks, and to perceive
                        differently than one sees.” This mantra, which I adopt from Foucault’s
                            <title level="m">The Use of Pleasure</title>, is probably the most
                        concise articulation of how and why I bring theory into the classroom (and
                        my own work) (8); and what North Americans call <emph>theory,</emph> the
                        French often call <emph>thought</emph>.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn13"

                            box that is the debate over the relationship between Romanticism,
                            philosophy and theory, despite my examples of Kant and Badiou. I will
                            merely cite Marc Redfield’s apt genealogy of it: “at the crossroads of
                            philosophy and literature, the early German Romantics not only theorized
                            a fully modern idea of ‘literature’; in doing so they also unleashed, as
                            Hegel suspected, the entrancing and threatening specter of ‘theory’ as
                            the monstrous concatenation of philosophy-as-literature. Inevitably, an
                            ambivalent romance with theory became, at a certain point in its
                            development, part of the drama of ‘Romanticism’ as a field of study in
                            the university. And that in turn has meant that philosophy and
                            Romanticism continue to enjoy and suffer their strange elective
                            affinity” (337).</note></p>
                    <p>Simon Jarvis has discussed verse’s “second repertoire of thinking,” the fact
                        that we can read poetry in at least two incompatible ways at the same
                        time—semantically and formally, with the latter interrupting and interfering
                        with the former (934). I think reading Romantic texts with theory—be it
                        Kant, or Judith Butler, or <title level="m">The Defense of Poetry</title>,
                        or Keats describing the Vale of Soul-Making to his brother and sister—mimics
                        and models this kind of semantic and formal layering. Theory echoes the
                        literary, but out of phase or in a different register—and what is an echo
                        but a vibration, a shaking just at the threshold of perception. I think one
                        thing that theory trains students to do is to become attentive to particular
                        kinds of shifts and frictions among texts. Placing, say, “I Wandered Lonely
                        As a Cloud” alongside Spinoza’s <title level="m">Ethics,</title> is often
                        simply a way of amplifying the tremors already threaded in Wordsworth’s
                        verse. The danger, we are told, is in becoming enamored of “the application
                        of gross and violent stimulants”—the solution is a return to therapeutic
                        hermeneutics, or to the calming materiality of history. But it is unclear
                        what an “untheoretical” return to the text or to history might look like,
                        even in teaching. If nothing else, teaching theory forces us to lay our
                        commitments on the table, and talk about them. So why, for me, this apparent
                        commitment to post-Kantian thought? What’s its use?</p>
                    <p>There is a notion, common enough in Romantic circles, that there has been an
                        unwarranted “Germanification” of British Romanticism, that critics have
                        applied Kantian or idealist paradigms to English Romantic texts that don’t
                        properly conform to or need those paradigms. A running assumption here is
                        that these literary texts have been historically conditioned by the German
                        texts, and so a perfectly reasonable conclusion is that we need to examine
                        those texts that <emph>did </emph>condition that literature. A way of
                        closing the loop is to claim, with a fair deal of support, that the German
                        philosophers and critics were themselves conditioned by English and Scottish
                        texts: Hume, Sterne, Reid, Mandeville, and so forth. But I think that there
                        are two factors in favor of the alleged Germanification, and against a
                        narrower historicist reading. First, that even if particular texts—say,
                        Coleridge’s “Frost at Midnight” or Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey”—weren’t
                            <emph>directly </emph>influenced by German thought, our reception of
                        them, and our very mode of practicing literary criticism at all, is directly
                        influenced by them. Too directly, might proclaim those who have recently had
                        to teach the <title level="m">Biographia </title>or “The Concept of Irony.”
                        But that is another issue—one which, I think, perhaps lies deeper than the
                        first. It is a moral or aesthetic issue, rather than a historical one. </p>
                    <p>Secondly, I find myself, recently, pro-Germanification because I am beginning
                        to see German Romantic paradigms as “possible worlds” versions of British
                        Romantic paradigms. Call it the age’s second repertoire, or one of
                        them—related, but out of phase or in another register. Those models and ways
                        of thinking stretch and test the ones we encounter in the British texts we
                        read, and I think that the novelists, poets and essayists may have
                        approached the matter from a similar perspective. Germany presented them
                        with an alternate history of the present, one confronted with many of the
                        same problems: the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars; a simultaneous
                        fascination and frustration with empiricism; a new understanding of and
                        feeling for history; a burgeoning print market; a taste for irony. So when I
                        say that I am for the moment “pro-Germanification” what I am perhaps really
                        saying is that I am in favor of this sort of stretching and testing of
                        limits. A Hegelian might call this <emph>dialectic</emph>; it strikes me as
                        more like common sense.</p>
                    <p>But how to initiate students—many of whom, understandably, have little
                        experience with philosophy as a discipline—into one of thought’s densest,
                        deepest periods? Last year I chose to spend the first fifteen or twenty
                        minutes of class each week discussing a chapter from Eckart Förster’s <title
                            level="m">The 25 Years of Philosophy </title>(2012). That book explains
                        the thought of Kant, Fichte, Goethe, Jacobi, Schelling and Hegel, and
                        situates it within a concrete historical context. Förster’s account is
                        eminently readable without glossing over the interesting bits. Much of it,
                        in fact, is a new interpretation of those thinkers, particularly its placing
                        Goethe, and scientific inquiry, at the center of crucial debates. It was,
                        for instance, Goethe’s copy of Spinoza on Schelling’s desk when he was
                        developing his <foreign>Identitätphilosophie</foreign>. And Hegel arrived at
                        several breakthroughs while tending Goethe’s botanical garden. I designed
                        the syllabus so that most weeks there has been a medium-strong correlation
                        between the <title level="m">25YP </title>chapters and the literary texts.
                        For example, Förster’s chapter on the resurgence of Spinozism in Germany
                        coincided with our reading of Wordsworth’s allegedly “pantheist” texts, and
                        Levinson’s “Of Being Numerous”; the chapter on Fichte was juxtaposed with
                        Shelley’s <title level="m">Cenci</title>, a tragedy about consuming egos and
                        unchecked, or self-checking, will.</p>
                    <p>Literary texts, like theoretical ones, produce their own checks, their own
                        resistances. But these are not always the most obvious, or even the most
                        pressing, forms of resistance. Theory seems most useful, both in my own thinking and
                        in the classroom, when it creates the right kinds of resistances to texts
                        and ideas I have been taking for granted. </p>
