            <p class="noCount">If a conversation between poetry and philosophy can be said to have inhabited the
               language and literature of Romanticism since its inception—and to have constituted
               the driving force of Romanticism-as-theory, what happens to this conversation when
               it crosses linguistic and cultural borders? What are the limits of the theory internal
               to Romanticism and of the theories that Romanticism generates beyond the confines
               of an increasingly monophone globalism? This paper engages with such questions by
               presenting and reflecting on passages of textual and cultural dissensus—à propos the
               specific difficulty of translating the very signifiers, “sense” and the “senses”—in
               the reading of “Tintern Abbey” in a non-Western context. It suggests that such sites
               of untranslatability may serve precisely as new grounds for restarting Romanticism’s
               theoretical potential in our contemporary global context of connected yet heterogeneous
               cultural traditions.</p>

                  <p>Along with “nature” and “imagination,” “sense” is a keyword in Romantic poetry and
                     poetics that is notoriously slippery and equivocal. William Empson makes it one of
                     his specimen terms of ambiguity in <em>The Structure of Complex Words</em>, writing in the chapter “Sense in <em>The Prelude</em>” that the “apparently flat little word <em>sense</em> . . . comes into practically all the great passages of <em>Tintern Abbey</em> and <em>The Prelude</em> on the mind’s relation to Nature . . .. [W]hether or not Wordsworth is drawing on
                     Hartley or Coleridge, his whole position depends on some rather undeveloped theory
                     about how the mind interprets what it gets from the senses” (289).

                     </div> “Sense,” that apparently flat little word, marks a <span class="foreign">locus classicus</span> where Romantic poetry reflects on its own means and—in however undeveloped a way—gets
                     theoretical.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Slippery enough in English, “sense” gets even slipperier in crossing over to another
                  language, and then back again. I will recount in this essay a surprising and memorable
                  moment in the spring of 2013 when I taught the warhorse text “Tintern Abbey” to a
                  class of undergraduates in Taiwan. Insofar as “sense” in Wordsworth veers towards
                  equivocation rather than stable signification, its use suggests, paradoxically, a
                  crisis of sense in its primary definition in Webster’s as “a meaning conveyed or intended”;
                  it marks, rather, the opening up of a disjunction within sense itself that leads dialectically,
                  through the mind’s ongoing relationship with the senses, to another sense. I would
                  like to designate this equivocation within “sense” itself with the shorthand “dissensus,”
                  for reasons I will elaborate later as I recount how dissensus took place not just
                  in one but two registers in our class on “Tintern Abbey” and reflect on how that event
                  may serve as the occasion, again, for getting theoretical.</p>
               <p>First, some information to set the scene. There were 26 students in the class, all
                  junior or senior concentrators in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature
                  at National Tsing Hua University, a public research university in Taiwan. Nearly all
                  students who take classes in the Department were born and raised in Taiwan, with some
                  from other Sinophone areas (Hong Kong and Macau, a few exchange students from China)
                  and a smattering from other parts of the world, e.g., Southeast Asia and Central America,
                  where Taiwanese government scholarships are available. The students have a high level
                  of proficiency in English, a mandatory subject in the public school system beginning
                  in the fifth grade. As Tsing Hua is one of the most competitive universities, the
                  students typically graduated at the top of their high school classes. Their ability
                  to follow difficult arguments and write well-reasoned prose reflects the benefits
                  of a rigorous math and science high school education (although many of them also spend
                  the first year or two at university recovering from the grueling aspects of that same
                  education). Concentrators in Foreign Languages and Literature at the university are
                  required to learn a second foreign language besides English, but literature courses
                  have been taught for some time almost exclusively with readings in English or English
                  translation, the default and de facto foreign <span class="foreign">lingua franca</span> in Taiwan—and globally. Since arriving at Tsing Hua in 2012, I’ve taught, for instance,
                  Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Charlotte Smith in English and Rousseau, Herder,
                  Goethe, and Hoffmann in English translation. I conduct lectures and discussion in
                  English but, sharing with the students a common language and much of a common culture,
                  I speak Mandarin whenever points seem to call for translation or, on the contrary,
                  seem particularly untranslatable. My students give presentations in English, write
                  their papers in English, and speak English in discussions, but I ask them to participate
                  in Mandarin if particular insights cannot find expression in another tongue.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It’s a challenge teaching Romanticism beyond the Anglophone context. To begin with,
                     the students simply need more time to comprehend the texts by looking up words and
                     figuring out syntax. One assigns less. On another level, while the students are curious
                     about texts of the period and culture in question, they have had less prior contact,
                     through sheer osmosis, with, say, the sublime or prophetic visionariness, given however
                     secular a turn, as elements of a living tradition. The hermeneutic circle that literary
                     reading and interpretation by and large entails intersects with other linguistic-cultural
                     circles here, giving rise to alternate geometries. At the beginning of a semester,
                     students will have heard of and read specific works by individual Romantic-era writers: <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> comes up often, and Rousseau as the author of the <em>Social Contract</em>, a text they know from high school to be fundamental to the history of modern political
                     thought and, hence, a history in which they are implicated. Thanks to <em>Twilight</em> and <em>Harry Potter,</em> they have had previous exposure to the Gothic. On the whole, I have had to provide
                     a lot more information about historical context and cultural background than I have
                     had to in North American classrooms. At the same time, I have needed to be more careful <em>not</em> to provide too much historical narrative—either regarding Romanticism’s position in
                     Western literary, cultural, and intellectual history or the role of the late eighteenth-,
                     early nineteenth-century moment in the West in contemporary social scientific theories
                     of globalization.

                     </div> I have had to modulate my editorial capacity as pedagogue in order to take care that
                     students have enough room to discover the lessons of Romantic poetry and poetics first <em>as</em> lessons in poetry and poetics that may overlap at points with, and remain in other
                     ways alien to, their habitual ways of experiencing language, culture, history, and
                     the world.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In the spring 2013 class, the students came to “Tintern Abbey” after having experienced
                  the “gentle shock of mild surprise” in reading “The Boy of Winander,” reckoned with
                  the narrator’s intrusion in “Simon Lee,” reflected on what it means to “let Nature
                  be your teacher,” and grappled with the definitions of poetry and the poet in “Preface
                  to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>.” For all students, whatever their first language, “Tintern Abbey” is a difficult
                  poem that works on multiple levels. My plan that day was to guide the students through
                  the poem by beginning with the concrete situation of the Wordsworthian speaker, addressing
                  aspects of the poem’s form and structure, engaging with conceptual intricacies in
                  Wordsworth’s reflection on the conditions of his own creativity, and then discussing
                  the implications of his address to Dorothy. We started with the title and the genre
                  of the loco-descriptive poem. Noting how the poem marks Wordsworth’s turn to autobiography,
                  we talked about how the poet uses the particular landscape as a measure to chart and
                  reflect on his own growth. To draw them into the experience of the poem, I asked them
                  to think about whether there was a particular landscape that might serve each of them
                  as an analogous reference point. The class was by now focused, engaged, and poised
                  to follow Wordsworth’s ruminations more closely.</p>
               <p>I asked for a volunteer to read the first stanza aloud. We considered Wordsworth’s
                  use of blank verse to simulate everyday speech, enjambment to create an effect of
                  fluidity, and repetition to accentuate how long the five years felt and to stress
                  the importance of revisitation. And I asked them to pay attention to the transitions
                  in this stanza between what takes place in Wordsworth’s mind to what he perceives
                  by eye and ear—in preparation for the multiple transitions and reflections thereon
                  that would follow in the rest of the poem. If the first stanza offers the description
                  of a landscape phenomenally available in the present to Wordsworth, as it had been,
                  <span class="foreign">mutatis mutandis</span>, five years ago, the second turns to how that landscape was internalized as a “picture
                  of the mind” during the intervening time. This move from contemplation of the external
                  landscape to contemplation of the internal served as the occasion for broaching the
                  subject of how the poem entertains epistemological questions about the relationship
                  between the mind and the senses.</p>
               <p>In asking students how Wordsworth begins in the next stanza to reflect on the function
                  of sense or sensory experience in his own growth as poet, I was puzzled to find at
                  first a semantic confusion of the “sensory” with the “sensational” or “sensationalist.”
                  One student thought that, in reflecting on what he was like “when first/ I came among
                  these hills,” Wordsworth was criticizing an earlier, youthful susceptibility to the
                  kind of sensationalism involved in the “craving for extraordinary incident, which
                  the rapid communication of intelligence hourly gratifies” that we had talked about
                  the previous week in the <em>Preface</em>. According to her view, Wordsworth would then be advocating a turn away from such
                  sensationalism towards a tranquil mood in which one may be equipped to hear the “still,
                  sad music of humanity.” Several other students chimed in to agree with her. While
                  such a reading was valuable and insightful in discerning an opposition between the
                  contemplative individual and an increasingly sensationalist mass culture on a socio-historical
                  dimension, I wanted to make sure they were also able to recognize the epistemological
                  stakes of the poem.</p>
               <p>I started to underline to them Wordsworth’s references to eye and ear and, beyond
                  the bodily eye, to the “eye made quiet by the power/ Of harmony”; and I pointed out
                  the ambiguity of the word “sense” as it recurs in lines 63-4, 96-7, and 109-110 to
                  designate moments in a process of interplay between the mind and the senses. In exploring
                  the relationship between the mind and the senses, Wordsworth, I explained, was participating
                  through poetry in a philosophical conversation that involved, in his contemporary
                  context, empiricist and associationist iterations; he was exploring questions that
                  remain vitally relevant today, e.g., in classes in analytic and Continental philosophy
                  just down the hall. One could see ethical implications in his exploration of these
                  questions in his extension of his claims regarding himself to Dorothy at the end while
                  proposing “Nature” as basis for a <span class="foreign">sensus communis</span>.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>I had the instinct to bring up at this point, for annotative purposes, the etymology
                     of the phrase for the “senses” in Chinese, <span class="foreign">wuguan</span>. Literally, the two characters constituting <span class="foreign">wuguan</span> mean the “five officials” or “five courtiers,” in relation to which <span class="foreign">xin</span>—the word in classical Chinese that denotes “heart” and “mind” as well as “will” or
                     “volition”—is configured as the “sovereign,” <span class="foreign">jun</span>. (In contemporary Chinese, <span class="foreign">xin</span> still has this cluster of connotations, but “mind” can be translated also by words
                     imported since the late nineteenth century from European and English sources designating
                     “cognition” and “consciousness.”) The earliest record of this metaphor, which establishes
                     an analogy between the human body and the body politic, occurs in the Han Dynasty <em>Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine</em>, from the Warring States or early Han periods, from the fifth century BCE to 220
                     CE.

                     </div> The coalescence of the emotional and the cognitive in <span class="foreign">xin</span> stands in contrast to their separation into “mind” (descended from the Greek <span class="foreign">nous</span>) as figure for cognition and “heart” as figure for feelings in European philosophical
                     discourse and reiterated in the very separation of “mind” and “heart” Wordsworth makes
                     in “Tintern Abbey.”</p>
               </div>
               <p>This philological intervention proved illuminating to the students. Eyes lit up. “Aha!”
                  and “that’s so cool!” and “I never knew that!” and other expressions of wonder were
                  heard. We continued talking about the relationship between “mind” and “the senses”
                  in the rest of the poem, as well as their relationship, in turn, to “sensations,”
                  “feelings,” and “affections”—all associated with the “heart.” The discussion went
                  more smoothly for the rest of the class, with greater appreciation of the multiple
                  dimensions of the poem—including the epistemological, the autobiographical, the ethical,
                  and the socio-historical—and how they might relate to each other. We did not return
                  in that class to talking about the moment in which I introduced the comment concerning
                  the configuration of mind/heart and the senses in Chinese language and discourse.
                  Clearly, though, it had the effect of opening up channels of understanding; indeed,
                  it became a reference point for students when they talked about the course later in
                  the semester.</p>
               <p>As their teacher, I offer a few thoughts about the significance of this moment. I
                  myself was surprised to witness their surprise in discovering the metaphor implicit
                  in their casual, everyday use of the term <span class="foreign">wuguan</span> for senses. In studying a literature foreign to them, they had taken their own language
                  for granted. An estrangement from their own language occurred that revealed both the
                  history of particular phrases as well as the historicity and cultural specificity
                  of these phrases. This estrangement occurred in relation to a certain opacity in the
                  Wordsworthian text for them, which was then rendered discussable for them in its historical
                  and cultural specificity. They discovered also at this point the basic analogy between
                  the human body and the body politic that subtends both the Wordsworthian configuration
                  of the mind and the senses, on the one hand, <em>and</em> the traditional Chinese configuration of <span class="foreign">xin</span> or mind/heart as sovereign in relation to the senses, on the other. While discovering
                  this common analogy, they also discovered at the same time two significantly different
                  configurations. In short, they learned a lesson about the historicity of language
                  and the incommensurability of languages and traditions; they learned a lesson about
                  how metaphor structures and, in this case, straddles philosophical, physiological,
                  and socio-political discourses; and they learned that the same metaphor may be troped
                  differently, with profound philosophical and cultural implications.</p>
               <p>“Sense” is the word that tripped them. As Empson notes, Wordsworth uses it most often
                  at the end of a line and frequently “in the form ‘a sense of . . .,’ which the Oxford
                  English Dictionary explains as ‘not by direct perception but more or less vaguely
                  or instinctively’” (289). In “Tintern Abbey,” Wordsworth writes: </p>

               <p> In lines 96-7, he speaks of feeling “a sense sublime/ Of something far more deeply

               <p> “Sense” appears pleasingly each time as an interfusing of what the eye and ear half
                  create and what perceive, a combination of the prior sense and the senses that becomes
                  available to re-cognition. “Sense” plays a mediating function between cognition and
                  perception, coordinating the relationship between the mind and the senses and bringing
                  them into community with one another. The very word “sense” marks, ironically, the
                  instability of this community of the mind and the senses, a community that is predicated
                  on a fundamental dissensus between parts that conjoin and disjoin in a continuous
                  process. Making sense of “sense” in Wordsworth in English involves registering the
                  disjunction or dissensus between mind and the senses that the word marks, a dissensus
                  that activates the process of re-organization. In making sense of “sense” in Wordsworth
                  through the medium of another language, the class had to pause to register yet another
                  dissensus in reckoning with different configurations of mind or <span class="foreign">xin</span>, “mind/heart,” and the senses, with each configuration defining an operative epistemic
                  disposition.</p>
               <p>“Tintern Abbey” is a warhorse text that can be used to demonstrate commonplaces long
                  considered definitive of Romanticism: the turn to nature, the emphasis on subjectivity,
                  the attentiveness to mental processes, the allegorization by poetry of its own conditions
                  of possibility. Since New Historicist readings by Marjorie Levinson and Kenneth Johnston,
                  it has often been resituated in materialist contexts in relation to historical circumstances
                  it may be taken to bracket out. It can be taught alongside “Frost at Midnight” or
                  put into dialogue with “Beachy Head.” No matter what one does with it, the poem’s
                  critical reflection on its own poetics and performance of its own theory make it ever
                  relevant to thinking about the relationship between Romanticism and literary theory.</p>
               <p>The engagement with the poem and its theory of poetic creativity occasioned in my
                  students a critical reflection on their own habitual ways of thinking. What came to
                  my aid in facilitating this encounter was an etymology about a set of terms no less
                  consequential in Chinese as their epistemological counterparts in English. For this
                  etymology, I have Chinese philological scholarship to thank for its source documentation.
                  The annotation I provided showed obviously a point of untranslatability but, beyond
                  that, introduced students to both intra- and cross-cultural depths and dimensions
                  that amplify and render more capacious the experience of reading.</p>
               <p>The relationship between Romanticism and literary theory can be said to begin in the
                  late eighteenth century with texts in philosophical aesthetics or poetics such as
                  the <em>Critique of Judgment</em>, the <em>Letters on Aesthetic Education</em>, the <em>Athenäum</em> fragments, “The Defense of Poetry,” among others, which variously attempt to reflect
                  on, define, and project the conditions of literary and aesthetic experience for a
                  new era. This relationship is intertwined further with the secular, historicizing
                  textual practices ranging from biblical hermeneutics to classical studies to Sanskritology
                  and Sinology that may be described by the umbrella term, “philology.” Philology designates
                  a variety of approaches to texts, ranging from positivist scholarship to secularized
                  messianic reading, with all approaches distinguishing the modernity of their orientation
                  to the premodern or canonical in historicist terms. The Western study of canonical
                  traditions in other parts of the world is complicated further by its dovetailing with
                  heterogeneous traditions of textual commentary.</p>
               <p>Philology would seem to inhabit the very relationship between Romanticism and literary
                  theory. In his 1982 essay “The Return to Philology” Paul de Man even describes the
                  then-recent turn to theory in literary studies that took place through the field of
                  Romanticism as inherently “a return to philology, to an examination of the structure
                  of language prior to the meaning it produces” (24). He defines philology here not
                  as the study of any particular set of texts but in terms of a “mere reading” that,
                  “prior to any theory, would appear deeply subversive to those who think of the teaching
                  of literature as a substitute for the teaching of theology, ethics, psychology, or
                  intellectual history” (24). Such mere or close reading he finds common in critics
                  and theorists as different as Reuben Brower, Foucault, and Derrida. Beyond his contemporaries,
                  De Man refers to a critical tradition that includes, notably, Nietzsche as philologist.
                  What De Man advocates in the title of his essay is not so much a return to the positivist
                  philological scholarship of the nineteenth century that amassed material for the teaching
                  of literature as the teaching of theology, ethics, psychology, or intellectual history
                  but to philology as a practice of attentiveness to language as medium that radically
                  structures and produces meaning. The essay inscribes, furthermore, its own call for
                  a turn or return to philology in a complex genealogy that goes back to the modern
                  definition of aesthetics, since Baumgarten, as a separate branch of Western philosophy
                  in the eighteenth century. De Man aims to recover a fundamental practice underlying
                  the network of cultural-historical narratives bound up with aesthetics since the eighteenth
                  century that traverses Romanticism as field of study.</p>
               <p>In 2004, Edward Said would define philology in deliberate, marked contrast to De Man
                  in an essay he titled likewise, “The Return to Philology.” Stressing the importance
                  of aspects of a textual practice he had criticized vociferously and generally in the
                  form of Near Eastern scholarship in <em>Orientalism</em>, Said advocates a philology that he characterizes as attentive to “conventions, semantic
                  frameworks, and social or even political communities operating as practical constraints”
                  on utterance (69). He cites examples from three philological traditions: the Arabic-Islamic
                  tradition of Koran scholarship, the philological-hermeneutic scholarship of Spitzer
                  and Auerbach, and the American pragmatist approach of Emerson and Richard Poirier.
                  I cannot pursue within the parameters of this essay the rich implications of the differences
                  between De Man and Said’s conceptions of philology and the critical genealogies they
                  respectively adumbrate. Suffice it to say here that Said points in 2004 to a need
                  that persists twelve years later in literary studies to return to philology as part
                  of an acknowledgment of and reckoning with the plurality and heterogeneity of linguistic
                  and textual traditions in the world. The dialogue between De Man and Said is crucial
                  to thinking the contours of such a return. And such a return is crucial to redefining
                  why Romanticism matters in complex and pluralistic terms and ways that give scandal—and
                  pause—to the pace of an Anglophone globalism.</p>
