            <p class="noCount">This <em>Romantic Circles Pedagogies Commons</em> Special Issue includes an editor's introduction by <a class="link_ref" href="#WharramAbout" title="">C.C. Wharram</a>, with essays by <a class="link_ref" href="#Al-ShattiAbout" title="">Aishah Al-Shatti</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="#DeWispelareAbout" title="">Daniel DeWispelare</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="#DowAbout" title="">Gillian Dow</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="#SchollAbout" title="">Lesa Scholl</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="#HenitiukAbout" title="">Valerie Henitiuk</a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="#WharramAbout" title="">C.C.

            <p class="noCount">In recent years, we have witnessed the rapid migration of the field of translation
               studies from occupying its position as “a backwater of the university” in the 1990s—to
               cite Lawrence Venuti’s oft-quoted complaint—to becoming a central object of scholarly
               inquiry in literary and cultural studies and beyond. Even as numerous conferences,
               symposia, and institutes are organized around the topic of translation, course readings
               in English literature have not yet come to reflect the same transformative impulse.
               In diverse ways, the scholars collected in this volume make compelling cases for expanding
               the repertoire of texts worthy of study in English classrooms to include translations,
               addressing texts by a wide range of authors and translators including Lord Byron,
               J.W. von Goethe, S.T. Coleridge, P.C. de Laclos, George Eliot, Sei Shônagon, and Germaine
               de Staël. Edited and introduced by <span style="font-weight:bold">C.C. Wharram</span>, with essays by <span style="font-weight:bold">Aishah Alshatti</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">Daniel DeWispelare</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">Gillian Dow</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">Lesa Scholl</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">Valerie Henitiuk</span>, and <span style="font-weight:bold">C.C.

               <p class="noCount">This issue was designed at the University of Maryland by Michael Quilligan, Site Manager
                  at <em>Romantic Circles</em>. The initial transformation from WORD Doc to TEI P5 was made using the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/#">OxGarage</a> tool, with further TEI markup modifications according to RC house style by Michael
                  Quilligan. TEI renders text archival quality for better preservation and future access.
                  Laura Mandell and Dave Rettenmaier developed the modified versions of the transforms
                  provided by the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</a> that were used to convert the TEI files into HTML. The image associated with this
