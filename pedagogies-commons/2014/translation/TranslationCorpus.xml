<head>About the Design and Markup</head>
<p rend="noCount">This issue was designed at the University of Maryland by Michael Quilligan, Site Manager at <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title>. The initial transformation from WORD Doc to TEI P5 was made using the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/#">OxGarage</ref> tool, with further TEI markup modifications according to RC house style by Michael Quilligan. TEI renders text archival quality for better preservation and future access. Laura Mandell and Dave Rettenmaier developed the modified versions of the transforms provided by the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</ref> that were used to convert the TEI files into HTML. The image associated with this edition includes elements from <ref target="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Goethe_1774.JPG">the title page</ref> of the first edition of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's <title level="m">Die Leiden des jungen Werthers</title> (1774) from the <ref target="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimedia Commons</ref>, where it is shared with a <ref target="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en">Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</ref> license.</p>

<anchor xml:id="Al-ShattiAbstract"/>Aishah Al-Shatti</hi>, <title level="a">Goethe and the 'Werther Sonnets' of Romantic-era Women Writers</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">The design of this module is to introduce a new dimension in the
                  literary history of Romanticism that has long been overlooked in our
                  pedagogical practices, and that is the interconnectedness of British
                  Romanticism with German literature. In a course titled Romantic and Victorian
                  Poetry, I pair Goethe's <title level="m">The Sorrows of Young Werther</title> with the reviews and
                  poetic responses it elicited at the time, especially the “Werther
                  sonnets” written by Charlotte Smith, Anna Seward, and Anne Bannerman. This
                  exercise introduces the students to one of the key texts of European Romantic
                  literature, gives them a sampling of the literature of the German movement of
                  Sturm und Drang, and enables them to see how this translated text fed into
                  the literary output of British Romanticism by inspiring imitations and
                  appropriations in different generic forms. Equally important is that this
                  text in particular marks a turning point in the history of the reception of
                  German literature in England. Goethe's <title level="m">Werther</title> also raises many questions
                  about the creative process of translation as a novella that contains a
                  translation of a forged translation: Werther's translations of selections
                  from Macpherson's <title level="m">Ossian</title>.

<anchor xml:id="DeWispelareAbstract"/>Daniel DeWispelare</hi>, <title level="a">Teaching Romanticism and Translation through British Hebraism</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">This article suggests that the history of Hebrew-to-English translation before and during the Romantic period can be used to introduce students to translation theories and methodologies more generally. The article describes a strategic rather than exhaustive assortment of primary and secondary texts on the nature, status, and translatability of the Biblical Hebrew language for teachers and scholars. The premise is that these combinations will help teachers enable students to learn the topic while also allowing them to see how they might transfer the translation studies insights they gain to other cultural and temporal contexts.</p>

</head>
<p rend="noCount">This paper details the ways in which contemporary translation studies inform
                  graduate-level study of nineteenth-century literature as cultural history. It
                  examines the way ideas of translation, and the powerplay between the original
                  author and the translator, can manifest themselves in other forms of writing, such
                  as editing and reviewing, and also addresses ideas of cultural translation in travel
                  writing and fiction set in the foreign place. Through this course, students
                  are taught to identify cultural hybridity in the narrative, as well as the
                  ways writers contend with alternative ideological structures through the
                  creative process of translation.

</head>
<p rend="noCount">This essay discusses how serial translations and adaptations can be
                  used pedagogically to enhance a student's understanding of the complexities
                  of textual production, re-production and reception. It draws on the author's
                  research in world literature, specifically with regard to pre-modern Japanese
                  texts. The discussion proposes effective ways to challenge our students'
                  understanding of authorship, stimulate classroom discussion, and foreground
                  the centrality of translational concepts to every act of reading literary
                  works, Romantic or otherwise.

<head/>
<p>In an age of intense cross-cultural exchange, cyber communication, and an increased critical interest in the effects of transnationalism and cultural integration, it is not only important but also necessary to expose our students to foreign texts in translation. Such an exercise yields many benefits: a) it allows our students to situate the texts that they read within a broader context that is not delimited by national and linguistic barriers, b) it forces them to think about how texts are transferred across borders through translation, to be received and assimilated in different cultures, c) it causes them to be more aware of the intercultural and transnational exchanges between nations, and finally d) it allows them to think about the factors that are conducive and obstructive with regard to the processes of translation, appropriation, and intertextuality. </p>
<p>This exercise is even more important in our courses on Romanticism, primarily because Romanticism was an international movement at inception. Our students can only grasp the transnational parameters of Romanticism if we allow them to perceive the reception of its texts within a greater European context, thus allowing the intricate web of intercultural connections between European writers to be more visible. Of course, this practice initiates a discussion of the different layers of intertextual exchange and adaptation; as David Higgins has pointedly remarked, the objective of introducing European texts into our Romantic courses is to allow our students to discover "the extent to which European authors and texts of the Romantic period were in dialogue with one another, and the limitations of examining literature solely through the lens of national culture and tradition" (58). The introduction of European texts will also overcome many of the problems caused by subjecting our curricula to Anglocentric practices, such as grossly omitting aspects of Romanticism in the literary histories provided in class and providing our students with a simplified view of Romanticism that does not consider its wide-ranging and transnational spectrum.  </p>
<p>Historicist and feminist reassessments of the Romantic canon have reshaped the manner in which the literature of the Romantic period is read and taught. More works by Romantic-era women writers are being introduced, and we are now more aware of their important contributions to the literary landscape of this era, which cannot be solely represented by the "Big Six." Usually, works by women are read either in isolation from the traditional, biased Romantic canon or within it, but their works are rarely read as part of their European context. There are many good reasons for teaching our students works by women alongside texts by their European contemporaries: such teaching demonstrates that women were major consumers, translators, and critics of foreign literatures, illustrates the manner in which they read and reacted to these texts, clarifies the role that they played in disseminating and assimilating these texts, and, most importantly, introduces a third dimension to the literary history of Romanticism that has long been overlooked in our pedagogical practices, that is, the interconnectedness of British Romanticism and German literature. As Michael Ferber has noted, the "fatherlands of Romanticism were indisputably English and German" (<title level="a">Introduction</title>, <title level="j">European Romantic Poetry</title> xxxvii), with the writers of both nations turning away from the classicism of French models and instead reading translations of each other's national literatures in search of new models. In a module that invites students to read Goethe's <title level="m">The Sorrows of Young Werther</title> alongside sonnets by women writers who were inspired by this book, I aim to expose the students to Romantic-era European texts to demonstrate how women writers were not passive readers of continental texts, but rather, "transcreative" cosmopolitan readers who conversed with and adapted European texts to suit their target readership in their native culture. </p>
<p>German literature occupies a special position in the development of Romanticism in Europe, and any course on Romanticism that does not touch on its influence sidesteps an important chapter in the literary history of this period. It is in the texts of the <foreign>Sturm und Drang</foreign> movement that many of the features that came to be associated with Romanticism are found: rebellion against traditional models, a strong interest in nature and solitude, sensibility, and the incorporation of biographical elements into fictional texts—such ideas, themes, and tropes were assimilated in different manners by European writers throughout the Romantic period. Because of its impact on the European literature of its time, I recommend the inclusion of Goethe's <title level="m">Werther</title> in our curricula: the work functions as a fine introduction to Romanticism because, in terms of chronology and historical importance, it is one of the foundational texts that introduces students to some of the major features of Romanticism and simultaneously illustrates how these features were transferred and assimilated transnationally. </p>
<p>In class, Goethe's <title level="m">Werther</title> can also stimulate discussions on the creative processes of translation and appropriation because it is a novella that contains a translation of a forged translation—Werther's translations of selections from Macpherson's <title level="m">Ossian</title>. Discussion of these imbedded translations allows the instructor to introduce Goethe's contribution to eighteenth-century translation theory: his specification of the three types of translation. In addition, the manner in which the text was appropriated in a different form and register, the sonnet form, allows the instructor to discuss whether the sonnets on Werther can be regarded as early instances of "transcreation," that is, a creative translation that includes elements of its origin and at the same time, introduces to it new elements that allow it to be easily accepted in the receiving culture. </p>
<p>Goethe's <title level="m">Werther</title> is also an interesting example of a text's effect on the reception in another culture of the national literature with which it is associated. Published in 1774, <title level="m">The Sorrows of Young Werther </title>not only made Goethe one of the most celebrated writers in eighteenth-century Europe but also began one of the most heated debates at that time over the impact of a book on the reading public. Instigating the phenomenon of "Werthermania," the book left a deep impression on its readers and moved many to imitate Werther's dress, excessive sentimentality and—as the book's critics claimed—suicide. Anxious responses and debates on its detrimental impact prompted Anna Barbauld, for instance, to single it out, along with Schiller's <title level="m">The Robbers</title>, as a chief text marking a turning point in the reception of German literature in England. Formerly considered an excellent source of models for literary composition, German literature came to be viewed as a source of dangerous texts (Barbauld 28-9). Equally interesting is that these negative responses to the book were echoed in discussions of female education and conflated the reading of it with female indulgence and promiscuity, as Jacqueline Pearson has explained: "Reading <title level="m">Werther</title> was accused of encouraging self-indulgent sexuality and transgression of traditional femininity as well as suicide [. . .]. In fiction, its readers will be self-indulgent, immoral, or at best immature women" (73). </p>
<p>In England, the book inspired a countless number of imitations, appropriations, rewritings, and parodies that crossed generic, geographic, and linguistic barriers. These imitations presented different readings of the book, which were, in turn, subjected to various readings and interpretations. Many of these imitations appeared as poems that attacked the work for its seemingly apologetic stance on suicide and for the unorthodox behavior of its characters. Other appropriations articulated a more sympathetic view of Werther's sufferings and highlighted moral aspects embedded in the book. Women poets in England contributed to this cultural debate by addressing—in sonnet form—some of the issues raised by the admirers and detractors of <title level="m">Werther</title>. As part of the module on Goethe's <title level="m">Werther</title>, I require my students to examine sonnets by women writers who were influenced by the book. Among many things, this examination of the sonnets will illustrate the various appropriations that emerged, women writers' contributions to these appropriations, and how these contributions were shaped by varying factors, such as literary marketing and aesthetic judgment. </p>
<p>Most of the students taking my course on <title level="a">Romantic and Victorian Poetry</title> are in their third or fourth undergraduate year and are native speakers of Arabic who speak English as a second language. By the time they take this course, they have completed courses in comparative literature, world literature, translation studies, and literary British history. Such a background proves highly useful when discussing translation and what it entails as a cultural process. Additionally, as Middle-eastern readers of Western texts, they are also more perceptive of the manner in which readers approach and respond to foreign texts. The course description states that the aim of the class is to deepen students' understanding of British poetry written in the nineteenth century through reading assignments that pair texts by men and women that reflect the themes, issues, and poetic forms that dominated the century. Considering the short timeframe in which this course must be taught—poetry produced in both the Romantic and Victorian periods must be covered within a span of three months—I tend to opt for primary texts that have made an indelible mark on the poetry written during these two periods and secondary texts that can be valuable reference sources for my students throughout the semester. </p>

<head>Day 1</head>
<p>I begin the first class by asking questions about the character of Werther; using the white board, I ask my students to describe him. The usual responses I receive from students are as follows: lonely—obsessed—emotional—suicidal—feminine—neurotic—failed seducer—naïve—self-obsessed—egotistic. Then, I ask my students to examine this list of descriptions and think about how such a character triggered the phenomenon of "Werthermania." What made him such an appealing character to the extent that imitations and adaptations were created? Students respond differently to this question. They point to the reader's readiness to be possessed by a character to the point of imitation, indicating that an individual's psychological predisposition is essential if the book is to have an effect. Others refer to the book's autobiographical content, as Goethe's personal experience may have been shared by some of his contemporaries, which explains the copy-cat suicides that it supposedly encouraged: "it is not because they saw Werther in themselves, but because they saw themselves in Werther," as one of my students expressed it. </p>
<p>I then turn my students' attention to the literary market into which the book was introduced: what makes such a book so marketable/sellable? What makes any book a bestseller? Again, I receive different responses to this question, which address the book's narrative technique, genre, and target readership. Students point to the epistolary form as a possible reason; to use their words, "reading a book in letters is much easier than reading a book divided into chapters" / "the book is an early version of the romantic novels that fill our bookshops today. Though the theme of unrequited love is frequently revisited in world literatures and is almost overdone, there are always readers who are interested in such stories and long for more, which explains why romantic novels are still sellable today; it has a market." </p>
<p>With this thought regarding target readership in their minds, I ask my students to think about gender and the various warnings and criticisms directed at the book: why did critics at the time feel that this book was particularly dangerous for female readers? Here, I turn their attention to contemporary remarks found in the reception history given by Duncan. Duncan points to early critical responses that connected the book to the rise of suicide, and many reviews referred to the interesting case of a Miss Glover who committed suicide in which a copy of the book was found under her pillow (21). Regardless of the veracity of this incident, the connection drawn between Werther's suicide and suicide among women is most telling because these early reviewers viewed women readers as being particularly susceptible to the influence of the characters of the book. </p>
<p>To understand what was classified as a dangerous or safe text for female readers and how foreign texts have influenced such a classification, I ask students to turn to Pearson's section <title level="a">Translations and Reading in Foreign Languages,</title> which discusses how foreign literature was viewed and how their female readers were perceived. Pearson notes that <title level="m">Werther</title> was considered one of the "most dangerous texts in the period's <foreign>index librorum prohibitorum</foreign>" and that this view intensified after the French Revolution, as female characters who read it were depicted as "self-indulgent, immoral, or at best immature women" (73). To give the students an idea of what contemporary British writers and educators thought of foreign texts such as <title level="m">Werther</title>, I ask them to examine the passage on German literature from Hannah More's <title level="m">Strictures on Female Education</title>, which provides insight into how foreign literature was viewed:
         <quote>Among the overflowing number of fictitious writings, not a few are there in the English, and still more and worse in the French and German schools, in which the intrigue between the already married hero and heroine is opened by means so apparently innocent, and conducted so gradually, and with so much plausibility, as, for a time, to escape detection. (117)
         </quote>
               The first translation of <title level="m">Werther</title> into English was created from a French translation, which renders it doubly pernicious in the eyes of conservatives such as Hannah More because it conveys French excesses and German customs. The discussion usually turns to the character of Charlotte and how she was considered a bad role model whom women were to avoid. In Hannah More's words, students perceive the underlying ideological construction of separate gender spheres for men and women. The tragedy in Werther could have been avoided if Werther and Charlotte did not often associate. Students go further, arguing that placing the blame on Charlotte's conduct is symptomatic of the sexual prejudices of the time. At this point, I turn the students' attention to the novel's narrative structure: with the exception of the few comments provided by the editor of Werther's letters, the story is told primarily through the eyes of Werther. How would the narrative be different had the story been told through the eyes of Charlotte? So I end this session by asking my students to think about how women writers responded to the book and what their responses tell us about their reactions as readers and writers. Additionally, I ask them to consider how women writers utilized the book and its reception in their sonnets.</p>
<p>Overall, this first session aims to acquaint the students with the book and its reception in England. Particular attention is given to the depictions of its two main characters, Werther and Charlotte, because of their centrality to the debate regarding the book's perilous impact on its readers. Addressing the popularity of the book also alerts the students to the market craze it generated, which prompted many writers to imitate and/or rewrite the book, as the assigned readings for the following class will illustrate. The secondary readings assigned for this session provide an overview of the book's reception in England and how its impact on female readers was perceived. In reading Hannah More's warning regarding the detrimental impact of German literature on gender relations, students will better understand how reading was considered an important component of women's education and moral judgment and the resulting view that their readings had to be carefully guarded. These secondary readings also provide information about the connections that were made concerning women, their bodies, and their readings and how reading was used in the construction and perpetuation of fixed gender roles and separate gender spheres. Pearson's remarks on how <title level="m">Werther</title>, in particular, was viewed as a dangerous text causes students to realize the extent of the book's infamy, the negative associations it came to carry, and the way it was used to represent women in fiction by indicating the lax morality of the fictional female characters who read it.  </p>

<head>Day 2</head>
<p>I dedicate this session to a close examination of the sonnets on Werther written by women writers, with the purpose of answering the questions with which I ended the previous class. At the beginning of the class, I ask the students whether they find that the assigned readings' treatment of Goethe's book was faithful or liberal. Then, I invite them to identify both obvious and subtle differences between the novel and the sonnets, on the one hand, and between the sonnets themselves, on the other hand. </p>
<p>Students quickly perceive many interesting devices in these appropriations: retelling the story through the eyes of Charlotte, inserting another fictional character in whom Charlotte confides, providing alternative endings to the novel that depict Charlotte visiting Werther's grave or even describe the ghosts of Werther or Charlotte as haunting Werther's grave. Students invariably find this insistence on rewriting the novel intriguing. I respond in turn with the following question: what do these rewritings tell us about the public's reactions to characterization and the book's ending? Students highlight the various views and readings of the book that circulated, which are reflected in these appropriations: some writers found it necessary to deflect what they perceived as the dangerous impact of a highly popular text, whereas others perceived a visible moral dimension that was worth highlighting. Many of these conflicting views revolved around Werther's suicide and the subtext that the novel appears to convey regarding this incident. Many of these appropriations capitalize on the novel's popularity and are attempts to attract its readership.  </p>
<p>At this point, I shift students' attention to the sonnets on Werther by Charlotte Smith and Anna Seward: I ask how these sonnets reflect the manner in which these women writers read the novel and perhaps even ask them to indicate the lines that they believe reveal their reactions as readers. The students find Smith's writings very savvy in the sense that they capitalize on the popularity of the text and, at the same time, avoid its contentious aspects; for instance, she is curiously silent regarding Werther's suicide, and her semi-impersonation of the female character in the sonnet is consistent with the general theme of her <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title>. </p>
<p>When turning to Seward's poems, students find her remarks on Werther fascinating: in one poem, she condemns Smith's appropriation of <title level="m">Werther</title> and, in another, she defends the book. Seward's <title level="a">Advice to Mrs Smith: A Sonnet</title> criticizes Smith for her use of foreign texts in her sonnets: "It ill befits that verse like thine should tell / Of Petrarch's love, or Werther's frantic pain! / Let not or foreign taste or tales enchain." However, in her note to <title level="a">Written in the Blank Page of the Sorrows of Werter</title> Seward compares the book to Shakespeare's <title level="m">Othello</title>, arguing that "neither the play, nor the novel, can justly be taxed with having an immoral tendency." At this point, I attempt to push my students to further examine Seward's reactions: her rejection of the inscription of foreign texts in the works of fellow compatriots and her advice on how these foreign texts are to be read. To Seward, it is not the book's moral message that is disquieting, but rather, how translations of foreign texts are to be read, interpreted, and assimilated in her native literature. Students relate easily to Seward's position, referring to Arabic films, which in imitation of Western films, were purposely expurgated of elements deemed too improper to suit the preferences and traditions of the target audience. The film had to be adapted to an Arab audience, or "Arabized," as one of the students phrased it. Such a discussion provides an opportunity to ask the students to think about translation and how it is an extended process that does not stop in the mind of the translator, but rather, extends to involve the minds of the readers. Readers react and interpret to translations in multifarious and even oppositional ways, with each group of readers invoking a particular aspect of the translation that suits their ideological convictions. Of course, such reading practices convert these translations into subjects of ideological debate, in which thoughts on gender, tradition, and morality are contested, revised, and subverted. These differences increase the students' awareness of how translation "is a channel opened, often without a certain reluctance, through which foreign influences can penetrate the native culture, challenge it, and even contribute to subverting it" (Lefevere 2). If time allows, this revelation is used to instigate a discussion on how translation can be viewed as a creative act, so I end this session by asking my students to think about the thin line that demarcates the processes of "translation" and "transcreation."</p>
<p>The central focus of this session is to expose the students to examples of poems inspired by Goethe's <title level="m">Werther</title>, with the aim of encouraging them to read these appropriations in view of the book's early reception in England, as covered in the previous session. These poems give a general overview of the different ways in which writers addressed the book's controversial content as they rendered it in verse. Through different narratives that supplement the original ending or provide alternative viewpoints of the events, these writers aimed to tame the book and acculturate it to suit the target readership. Thus, the poems used in this session register the various literary appropriations of the book and represent the readings and counter-readings of a foreign text.</p>
<p>The poems by Smith and Seward illustrate how this translated book became a site of readerly intersections; whereas Smith transcribes the translation in sonnet form, Seward rejects it. These poems also present two striking instances of women writers using a problematic foreign text in a savvy way to simultaneously attract its readership and avoid its critics. The two different positions reflected in their appropriations (Smith's silence about the suicide and Seward's concern about foreign influences on national literature) testify to the active involvement of women writers in the debate surrounding the book's relation to gender, women readers, and foreign literature.  </p>
<p>The sonnets based on their readings of <title level="m">Werther</title> demonstrate the creativity with which Smith and Seward used a foreign text to express their thoughts on aesthetic judgment and national literature. Although both employed the sonnet form for appropriating or commenting on the book, each writer conveyed a distinctly different reaction indicative of how she read and interpreted the book. Smith's sonnets reveal her shrewdness in terms of navigating the literary market and utilizing a popular text in her <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title>. Although Seward chastises Smith for basing her sonnets on a foreign text in her own poems, she later argues that the manner of one's reading determines the way in which the book is to be interpreted. </p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<head>Day 3</head>
<p>During the final session of this module, the central focus of the discussion is on these issues: translation, transcreation, and defining European Romanticism. I begin by referring the students to Goethe's interesting description of translation as a marketplace, where all nations present their cultural contributions. To Goethe, the translator is the "mediator in this general spiritual commerce and who has chosen it as his calling to advance the interchange," and any translation "is and remains one of the most important and dignified enterprises in the general commerce of the world" (<title level="a">Writings on Literature</title> 25), despite any deficiencies that it might have. Students cannot help but make connections among Goethe's words, the translations of <title level="m">Ossian</title> in <title level="m">Werther</title>, and the translation of his work in England. It is the existence of a ready market abroad as a conducive factor that allowed for the transmission of these works across borders, as is the case with Macpherson's <title level="m">Ossian</title> and Goethe's <title level="m">Werther</title>. Of course, this transmission can take different forms and is conducted for different purposes. </p>
<p>We then move to Goethe's description of the three stages of translation. During the first stage, the translator "acquaints us with foreign countries on our own terms" (<title level="a">Book of East and West</title> 75), in the second, he aims to "appropriate foreign content and reproduce it in his own sense" and, in the third and most superior, he aims "to make the original identical with the translation, so that one should be valued not instead of the other, but in the other's stead" (76). I ask my students to pinpoint what distinguishes these three stages and, naturally, they tend to focus on the part played by the translator and the extent to which he creatively adapts the book, so I ask them to examine the other side of the equation: the readers receiving the translation. Under the pressure exerted by his publisher and the reading public, a translator would certainly strive to cater to the preferences of the target audience. However, the conditions under which the translator produces a translation are variably different from the conditions under which his translation is eventually read, and Anna Seward's point in that regard is clear: although <title level="m">Werther</title> was perceived as an immoral text, one can argue that it has didactic and moral overtones. </p>
<p>At this point, I turn the students' attention to the textual context in which a translation is presented to the reader by asking them about the translation of <title level="m">Ossian</title> that is contained in <title level="m">Werther</title>. These imbedded translations of <title level="m">Ossian</title> are included not only to reveal or accentuate an additional dimension of Werther's character but perhaps also to fulfill multiple other functions: as a popular text, <title level="m">Ossian</title> already had a readership and a market outside England. These translations also draw attention to the creative reworking of a translation weaved into the narrative structure of a work of fiction. Therefore, this imbedded translation—just like the imitations of Werther that surfaced all over Europe—are instances of strategic marketing that exploit a literary trend to the optimum level. It is necessary to remind the students that <title level="m">Ossian</title> was presented to the reading public as a translation, and this is not the only case in which original writings were presented to the public as translations of foreign texts; Horace Walpole and William Beckford use the same device in <title level="m">The Castle of Otranto</title> and <title level="m">Vathek</title>, respectively. </p>
<p>The discussion of forged translations leads to series of important questions: why claim that a text is a translation when, in fact, it is not? What types of barriers faced by original texts are overcome by translations? What do these forged translations tell us about the status of translations in comparison with native texts? These questions will ultimately touch on the factors and conditions that contribute to the need for a particular translation of a foreign text: demands of the marketplace, exposure to foreign cultures, pedagogical purposes, and so on. However, students must be made aware of the power relations that underlie these factors and shape the conditions surrounding a translation, and it is useful to remind them of their previous readings of prefaces by imitators of <title level="m">Werther</title> that either addressed a patron or appealed to the tastes, preferences, and morality of the reading public to justify these imitations. In other words, those imitators strived to rework <title level="m">Werther</title> within their national culture and not <emph>against</emph> it.  </p>
<p>By starting this session with a discussion of Goethe's theories on translation, especially his idea of translation as an international market of cultural exchange, students are made aware of Goethe's connection to translation studies, both as translator and theorist, from the start. This awareness is important because his views on translation will assist them in understanding how he views his translation of a forged translation, <title level="m">Ossian</title>, within <title level="m">Werther</title> as participation in the world's literary market. To some extent, the demands of this world literary market determine the methods employed by translators to reproduce a text for a target audience. The three stages of producing a translation outlined by Goethe provide insight into some of these methods and the creative dimension they entail. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, Goethe does not prioritize how the reading public will read a given translation. For this reason, it is crucial to alert the students to this particular perspective in the process of translation, as the entire module rests on the different ways in which readers read, interpreted, and appropriated <title level="m">Werther</title> in their writings. The poems covered in the previous session are clear and significant examples of how a translation may be read and subsequently used: a dominant reading that condemns the text and two different readings reflected in the writings of two prominent female poets of the time—Smith's reading eschews the problematic parts of the text highlighted by the dominant reading, and Seward's reading runs counter to the dominant reading of the text. The discussion of using translations of <title level="m">Ossian</title>, <title level="m">Werther</title>, and women's responses to them necessitates a shift in focus to the term "European Romanticism," which has been used as a rubric under which texts written in the Romantic period in Europe are assigned.</p>
<p>The discussion of the translation of <title level="m">Ossian</title> inserted into <title level="m">Werther</title> and forged translations turns to the multiple points of interconnection and exchange between British literature and foreign literatures and how these points of interconnection constitute the foundation of what is critically termed "European Romanticism." Any module that focuses on texts produced by Romantic-era European writers must therefore touch upon this critical category. This consideration provides an opportunity to address briefly the critical discussions of European Romanticism in the assigned readings and examine attempts to tackle the question of whether "European Romanticism" exists as a category. Reading these theoretical discussions also cultivates in our students a critical awareness of the difficulties and challenges arising from attempts to define "European Romanticism" when the texts grouped under its rubric are too diverse and dissonant. Both Bode and Ferber resort to Wittgenstein's notion of "family resemblances" to resolve the problem of a movement such as Romanticism that is characterized by a uniform diversity. Another useful term, "contagion," is used by Schiffman in her discussion of imitations of <title level="m">Werther</title> (209). "Contagion" underscores the course and extent of transmission and can perhaps be extended to refer to the migratory features critics attribute to "European Romanticism." These terms touch upon different levels of intertextual exchange: family resemblances relate to integration and genealogy, whereas contagion relates to transmission and diffusion. However, all of these levels of intertextual exchange were made possible through translation, as students have seen in the primary texts assigned for this module. Therefore, it is impossible to think of European Romanticism without considering the vital role played by translation that rendered it conceivable as a category. To discuss European Romanticism is to discuss the rich and dynamic network of cross-translations and "transcreations" that allowed for the transfer and assimilation of these texts beyond their national borders. Thus, any of the influences produced by "contagion" and affinities explained by "family resemblances" are direct results of the creative process of translation. If the category "European Romanticism" was initially created to explain why texts produced in different cultures at approximately the same time were similar, this module will reveal to the students one of the processes by which these texts became similar.</p>
<p>Because this module traces how a text crossed borders by translation and was subsequently used by female writers from a different culture in a creative manner, it becomes important to initiate a discussion on "European Romanticism" as a category that explains such points of interconnection among European texts in the Romantic era. In addition, the discussion of this term may prove useful if other primary texts resulting from European cultural exchange, such as British works inspired by Stael's <title level="m">Corrine</title> and Goethe's <title level="m">Tasso</title>, are introduced later in the course. </p>
<p>When a critical category such as "European Romanticism" is presented in class, it is critical that students understand its history and read some of the theoretical discussions surrounding it. One can also encourage students to use their experiences as readers of Romantic-era texts from Europe to reflect on these theoretical terms. This is a useful exercise because it teaches students to view their readings of Smith and Seward's sonnets and their understanding of the factors that led to the production of these sonnets (for example, the impact of the market, the reading public, and patronage) within a theoretical perspective that considers the intertextual exchanges between literary works produced by Romantic-era writers in Europe.</p>
<p>Overall, the module calls attention to the three components of the translation process: the text, the translator, and the readers. It also illustrates the role of market demands in the production and creative use of a translation and the attempts made by women writers to appropriate a popular translated text and produce their own transcreations. Finally, the module I propose here is designed in consideration of constraints of time and course scope, but it can be easily reconfigured to suit additional pedagogical demands. My objectives were primarily to eliminate one of the few pedagogical gaps in our surveys of literary history and to reveal to students literary connections that can be easily overlooked. The simultaneous teaching of works by British women writers and foreign writers appears to satisfy these objectives. </p>

<head>Teaching Romanticism and Translation through British Hebraism</head>

<div type="section">
<head/>
<p>This essay presents the history of Hebrew-to-English translation as a platform for teaching Romantic-era translation theories and methodologies more generally.  To this end, the following pages describe a strategic rather than exhaustive assortment of primary and secondary texts on the nature, status, and translatability of the biblical Hebrew language. The premise is that these combinations will enable students to learn the topic while also allowing them to see how they might transfer the translation studies insights they gain to other cultural and temporal contexts.  In both undergraduate and graduate classes on the Long Eighteenth Century or the Romantic period, the contentious history of Hebrew-to-English translation is uniquely suited for linking together and recapitulating topics already intimately familiar to scholars of the period, irrespective of previous experience with British Hebraism.  In fact, debates surrounding Hebrew-to-English translation during this period meaningfully overlap and inform cultural phenomena that Romanticists have long been investigating.  Some of these I will discuss in detail, including (a) the history of marginalized groups in Britain; (b) the political backgrounds of religious dissent; (c) the development of empire and orientalism; and (d) primitivist theories of poetic genius.</p>
<p>As with any topic addressing translation studies, this one presents a challenge to the monolingual limitations of many anglophone students.  However, British Hebraism is actually a flexible and approachable translation studies topic to introduce to students who lack fluency in biblical languages.  The reason for this is that given the impressive number of translations from biblical material done during this period, it is possible (though obviously not ideal) to lead a comparative conversation about various different translations without consulting the original source text.  For example, one can combine translations of specific passages from the King James Version (KJV) alongside various eighteenth-century, nineteenth-century, and contemporary reworkings in order to see how biblical translation theories and methods have changed over time.  This allows students a way into translation studies and will perhaps interest them in mastering the linguistic prerequisites necessary for pursuing the topic in the future.  I will speak in detail about sample texts one can use in class later in this essay, but for now I would like to mention that the Psalms and the Book of Job are particularly useful biblical books for demonstrating larger changes in translation practice over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  Especially with the Psalms, one can juxtapose the KJV translation alongside early-eighteenth-century traditions of hymnody as well as alongside Romantic-era translations, all of which are dramatically and informatively different.</p>

<head>(a) British Hebraism and the History of Marginalized Groups in Britain</head>
<p>The last two decades have seen stunning research on diverse forms of British Hebraism during the eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries.  The best of this research has come out of the field of British Jewish studies, and for this reason, the situation of British Jews can be used to historicize broader discussions about the history and representation of marginalized ethnic, religious, socio-economic and racial groups during the period.  Historian Todd Endelman's <title level="m">The Jews of Georgian England</title> (1999) is a crucial text for anyone pursuing this angle.  Not only does it narrate the growth (and growing pains) of a linguistically, socially, and politically varied British Jewish community, it introduces terminology central to grasping the more focused complexities of Hebrew-to-English translation as it occurred during this period.  For example, Endelman brilliantly discusses anti-Semitism alongside "philo-Semitism," a term he uses to refer to the period's widespread Christian eschatological fascination with the ways Jews were implicated in the unfolding of Christian revelation.  He likewise provides instructive socio-political background on the passage and repeal of the "Jewish Naturalization Act of 1753," to which much British Jewish (and anti-Jewish) political activity in the Romantic period implicitly responds.</p>
<p>David Ruderman's treatment of the same period, <title level="m">Jewish Enlightenment in an English Key</title> (2000), has more to say about translation studies.  Ruderman argues that methodological disagreements about translating the Hebrew Bible into English must be mapped onto contemporaneous political and theological debates between religious communities, including a British Jewish community that became both increasingly anglophone and outspoken throughout the period.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">For population statistics, immigration patterns, and other socio-historical information about the British Jewish community and its links to Europe, see Endelman's <title level="m">The Jews of Georgian England</title>.
               </note> In Ruderman's account, seemingly narrow arguments about translating biblical Hebrew—especially its vowel marking systems—are always also the terrain of an intricate argument-by-proxy over the evolving criteria of political inclusion within a schizophrenic polity that in 1753-4 granted and then immediately rescinded citizenship rights for British Jews, rights that were only fully granted through piecemeal legislation of the mid-to-late-nineteenth century.  I will return to the details of these debates shortly, but for now I would like to dwell on the wider implications of Ruderman's interrogation of cultural politics and otherness.  The political restrictions that defined life for British Jews in the eighteenth-century resonate with the experiences of other actively disenfranchised groups, including Catholics, Quakers, Methodists, and the panoply of colonial subjects, whether in the British Isles or abroad. Endelman and Ruderman's histories of Jewish attempts to navigate language, identity, and assimilationist pressure can be compared with other investigations <foreign>vis-à-vis</foreign> other marginalized populations, like Robert Crawford's <title level="m">Devolving English Literature</title> (1992), for instance, which contains a trenchant analysis of the geographical, educational, and linguistic trajectories by which Scots and other non-English subjects questioned, subverted, and sometimes even reinforced English metropolitan hegemony within the ever diversifying British Empire.</p>
<p>While Endelman and Ruderman's texts are informed by the methods of cultural and political history, Sheila Spector's work on the Jewish community of Romantic-era Britain is more directly related to literary Romanticism.  Spector's monographs foreground the role of Jewish cultural practices in the formation of the poets Blake and Byron.  The contexts she outlines facilitate a host of new ways to read these figures, including Blake's Kabbalistic subtext<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">An interesting new deciphering of Blake's Hebraism is Abraham Samuel Schiff's <title level="a">Blake's Hebrew Calligraphy,</title> in <ref target="http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake/article/viewArticle/shiff462/shiff462html">
<title level="m">Blake</title>
</ref> 46.2 [accessed Nov. 27, 2012]</note> and Byron's Yiddish- and Hebrew-language afterlives.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">See Spector's <title level="m">Glorious Incomprehensible</title> and <title level="m">Byron and the Jews</title>.</note>  Moreover, the best essays in Spector's three edited volumes interrogate Romantic representations of Jews and Jewish culture, thereby shedding refreshing light on familiar texts like Scott's <title level="m">Old Mortality</title> (1816), Edgeworth's <title level="m">Harrington</title> (1817), and Dickens's <title level="m">Oliver Twist</title> (1838).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4">Spector's edited collections include <title level="m">British Romanticism and the Jews: History, Culture, Literature</title>, <title level="m">The Jews and British Romanticism: Politics, Religion, Culture</title>, and <title level="m">Romanticism / Judaica</title>.</note>  In short, Spector and the authors collected in her edited volumes are the central figures for any research into the "interaction" and "blending" that occurred between "British and Jewish cultures" during the Romantic period (Spector, <title level="m">British Romanticism and the Jews</title> 1, 2, 9, et passim). Their purposeful yoking of British Romanticism and British Jews brings to the fore previously overlooked Jewish writers and translators—like David Levi (1742-1801), Isaac D'Israeli (1766-1848), and Hyman Hurwitz (1770-1844)—in the same way recent studies from other fields have recuperated writers previously omitted from discussion.  The argument that Romantic writing's diversity far exceeds the formerly hermetic Romantic canon will be familiar to anyone who has had contact with the valuable archives of women's writing, Scottish writing, Irish writing, counterflows to colonialism, slave narratives, and other work by writers of color, all of which the field owes to research of the past several decades. </p>
<p>Obscure and yet prolific London-born Jewish scholar David Levi, for example, can only be understood as someone who straddled overlapping cultural milieux. He was an accomplished anglophone writer who sparred in journals with Thomas Paine over Paine's excoriations of prophecy, as well as with Joseph Priestley over Priestley's "amicable" invitation for Jews to "study" (and thereby acknowledge) the evidence of Christianity.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5">See Joseph Priestley's <title level="m">Letters to the Jews; Inviting Them to an Amicable Discussion of the Evidences of Christianity</title>, Thomas Paine's <title level="m">The Age of Reason: Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology</title>, and David Levi's <title level="m">Letters to Dr. Priestley in Answer to Those He Addressed to the Jews</title> and <title level="m">Dissertations on the Prophecies of the Old Testament</title>.</note>  As a true multilingual, Levi's commitment to Jewish political rights and religious heritage resulted in a comprehensive intervention into his era's translation practices.  The three successive volumes of <title level="m">Lingua Sacra</title> in 1785, 1789, and 1803 took the form of a comprehensive Hebrew-to-English lexicon and commentary, in which Levi approached biblical Hebrew and the rabbinical tradition as a steward, one whose knowledge of Jewish tradition allowed him to advance British Jewish interests by rectifying biblical mistranslations on which both anti-Semitic and philo-Semitic discourses were based.  <title level="m">Lingua Sacra</title>'s title page displays this will to correct Christian mistakes and typological interpellations: 
                  
                  <quote>[E]nriched with Notes; in which are shewn the Grammatical Errors and Inaccuracies of the most distinguished Grammarians, and other Writers in the Hebrew Language [. . .].  The more difficult Words and Passages in the Sacred Writings will be explained, according to their true Meaning, and the <emph>lively Oracles of GOD</emph> rescued from the Errors of real or disguised Friends, and the Attacks of open and professed Enemies, whether Deists or Atheists.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="6">As Levi wrote, "Consequently, no just, or critical knowledge of the Sacred Writings of the Old Testament, can be obtained through their [Existing English Bibles'] means; and which I opine to be the principal cause of the encrease [sic] of Deism." At this point in time the Jewish anglophone Bible was the Old Testament of the Authorized Version, the selfsame translation Christians used.  Solomon Bennett issued <title level="m">A Specimen of a New Version of the Hebrew Bible</title> in 1836 and he included significant reworkings of a number of the most important passages and books. It was, however, canonically incomplete.  It was not until 1851 in England and 1853 in America did complete, specifically anglophone-Jewish translations of the <title level="m">Tanakh</title> appear. The first two were Abraham Benisch's <title level="m">A Translation of the Old Testament, Published with Hebrew Text</title> (1851) and Isaac Leeser's <title level="m">The Twenty-four books of the Holy Scriptures</title> (1853).

                  "Deists" and "Atheists" get top billing as "Enemies" to the Jews here and throughout the work, but the more profound intervention occurs with regard to "real or disguised Friends," by which Levi means devout Christian Hebraists using Hebrew translation as a way to confirm their own religious sensibilities.  </p>

<div type="section">
<head>(b) British Hebraism and the Politics of Religious Difference</head>
<p>When David Levi was writing in the 1780s and 1790s, he was responding directly to Hebrew translation practices as they had been elaborated over the course of the eighteenth century, during which time all British religious communities contributed to the translation boom surrounding the Authorized Version's English form.  Jonathan Sheehan's <title level="m">Enlightenment Bible</title> (2005) has documented these preoccupations with renovating biblical material, attributing them to a prevailing sense that parts of the Bible suddenly appeared distant, barbaric, and antiquated rather than omnitemporal or universally applicable. Historian Neil Hitchin has analyzed the retranslation frenzy by focusing on attempts to create a governmentally sponsored Bible retranslation committee like the one that had produced the King James Version in 1611.  Though Hitchin omits Jewish voices entirely, he elucidates details of the eighteenth century's (Christian) "cultural politics of religion" (68), which included dissenters seeking a greater stake in national religious life and certain pillars of the Anglican establishment seeking measured changes to official translations that would protect the Church's stability and authority.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="7">A broad and useful account of dissent and Romanticism is Dan White's <title level="m">Early Romanticism and Religious Dissent</title>. </note>  The essential point is that working out these "cultural politics of religion" occasioned a rise in differing methods of reading, translating, and "knowing" the Hebrew language (some far more accurate than others).  It was the most radical Christian ways of "knowing" the language that Levi would ultimately seek to discredit and debunk.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn8" n="8">An equally important angle on this involves aesthetics, and I will discuss it in the fourth section.  For his part, Hitchin summarizes some of aesthetic motivations for his retranslation in the following terms: "Many felt that the old translation [the KJV] left much to be desired from the point of view of English-language usage. Diction and style were much changed in the intervening time" (75). </note>
</p>
<p>Here it is important to note that within British Christian communities Hebrew had traditionally occupied an odd position in the Hebrew-Greek-Latin scriptural triumvirate. Amongst Anglicans, it was less taught and less well known than the others, likely because Greek and Latin both had non-religious histories that were embedded in the educational system's admiration of the classical world. Commentators noticed the pall of low Hebrew literacy amongst the Anglican clergy. The publishing industry responded with a sudden boom in Hebrew pedagogical materials, many of which criticized clergymen for their poor knowledge of Hebrew grammar.  These pedagogical texts promised that enhanced teaching methods would benefit Church leaders while building a pediment on which to erect a national spiritual revival, or as Hitchin has it, "a nationally comprehensive, protestant Church of England" (70). An analogous situation held true in the British Jewish community, as Endelman and Ruderman both point out.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn9" n="9">See note #6.</note>  Jewish leaders wanted to improve Jewish Hebrew literacy in Hebrew, as this would surely help steady the growing community during times of increasing assimilationist pressures and dwindling Hebrew literacy. </p>
<p>One way to trace the entwined political and theological interests that sought updates to anglophone scriptures is through the slew of Hebrew grammars that hit the markets between roughly 1740 and 1830, many of which were designed for novice and autodidact readers.  While Christians produced the majority of them, British Jews also published anglophone grammars.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn10" n="10">These publishing data are drawn from the grammatical sections of Joseph Jacobs and Lucien Wolf's <title level="m">Bibliotheca Anglo-Judaica</title>, as well as Cecil Roth's <title level="m">Magna Bibliotheca Anglo-Judaica</title>.  </note> Put in a way that highlights the cultural specificity of these texts, grammars promising to teach the Hebrew language to Christians and written by Christians circulated alongside grammars written by Jews with the stated aim of teaching the holy language solely to wayward British Jews.  A third and hybrid typology is also visible: anglophone grammars and lexicons like Levi's that promised to reveal the true character of Hebrew to both Jews and misled Christians.  It is important to reiterate that Standard English was the new framing language for these new grammars.  Whereas early-eighteenth-century Hebrew grammars circulated mostly within Anglican universities, Jewish community schools, and dissenting academies, thereby presupposing knowledge of Latin or Rabbinic (Mishnaic) Hebrew, the anglophone materials of the second half of the century facilitated access to a larger readership.  In this way, Hebrew literacy spread to women, dissenters, and figures like Joseph Priestley, a man kept out of a traditional Anglican university by his convictions and the Test Acts.  For their part, British Jews like Levi increasingly chose English over German, Spanish, Portuguese, Rabbinic Hebrew, Yiddish, and other Jewish heritage languages.  Suffice it to say, the accessibility of anglophone-Hebrew learning materials bred new and sometimes schismatic translation theories and practices.  </p>
<p>One of the most influential of these theories involved the wholesale cultural decontextualization of the language and is best broached through the work of theologian John Hutchinson (1674-1737).  Hutchinson's belief in timeless rabbinic deceit drove his attempts to purge Hebrew of its Jewish traces. In one publication, Hutchinson identifies five sorts of treacherous men:
         
               <quote>1. Men who pretend to be directed by the Scriptures, but never learn to read and understand them. 2. Men who allow the Scriptures to be read, and construed, as the apostate Jews have pointed and explained them. 3. Men who pretend the Church of <emph>Rome</emph> has a power to construe and supersede the written Rules in Scripture. 4. Men who pretend to have a supernatural Director within each of them, which they are to follow, without regard to the Scripture. 5. Men who neither regard Scripture, Church, nor, &amp;c. any farther than it serves their turns; but will each form Schemes, and determine everything by his own Reason, and demonstrate from his own <emph>Data</emph>, by Mathematics and Experiments (<title level="m">Covenant</title> 2-3). </quote>
               Referencing theological contempt of Jews, Catholics, Deists, and atheists here, another passage renounces Jewish writing altogether: "We have nothing to do with the Translations or Paraphrases of the Apostate Jews" (<title level="m">Treatise</title> 5), a claim that underlies Hutchinson's severing of biblical Hebrew from the Jewish commentaries, glossaries, and translations on which Christian translators had always relied.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn11" n="11">A 47-person team of Anglican clerics produced the translation that came to be known as the Authorized Version in three centers of translation: Oxford, Cambridge, and Westminister.  One of the stated operational principles of this team was to rely heavily on earlier versions such as the Geneva, Coverdale, Tyndale, and Bishops's Bibles.  All of these and the King James Bible as well required textual and personal consultation with the Jewish Tradition. For approachable introductions to the KJV translation, see Alister McGrath's <title level="m">In the Beginning</title> and David Crystal's <title level="m">Begat: The King James Bible and the English Language</title>. For more scholarly analyses, see in particular the <title level="a">Introduction</title> to the Oxford World Classics edition of the King James Bible (2008) and David Daiches's <title level="m">The King James Version of the English Bible: An Account of the Development and Sources of the English Bible of 1611 with Special Reference to the Hebrew Tradition</title>.
               </note> His protégé Julius Bate regularly borrows such rhetoric, as here: "It is our own fault to let the Jews mislead us; we are forbid in the strongest manner to have any dealings with them" (292).  Contrasting with the goal of partial formal equivalence that had subtended the production of the KJV, Hutchinsonian thinking characterizes the writings of Alexander Catcott, Benjamin Holloway, George Horne, William Jones of Nayland, and later John Parkhurst, all influential writers who contributed to the most polemical and anti-Semitic Hebrew translation practices during the period. </p>
<p>For these Hutchinsonians, the central translation problem involved the nature of the Hebrew writing system, which can be described as an abjad of consonantal characters surrounded by diacritic dots and dashes that mark vowel quality, accentuation, and cantillation. Hebrew vowel markers (<foreign>niqqud</foreign>, pl. <foreign>niqqudot</foreign>) were frequently referred to as "points" during the period, and Hutchinsonians renounced them by calling them Jewish impositions that debased a once divine script.  The claim that "points" occluded true Christian meanings was but one prong of a much larger rejection of all the cultural history contained in the <title level="m">Masorah</title>, or traditional Jewish textual commentary.  Historian David Katz describes the Hutchinsonian method as follows: "Grammar and the history of linguistic development are angrily thrust aside, as Hutchinson and his followers argued that this [the appearance of irregularity], like all features of the Old Testament, had been planned by God himself" (<title level="m">Skeptics</title> 240). Eliminating "points" from the Hebrew writing system produces considerable lexical and interpretive difficulties, especially for beginners.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn12" n="12">See for instance the discussion of רקיע in Katz's <title level="a">Hutchinsonians</title> 240.</note>  Stripping texts of one of their most crucial signification technologies allowed for exceptional and even egregious interpretive license, one of the reasons why unpointed texts received a sympathetic audience in politically charged eighteenth-century religious discussions.  Hitchin writes, "Dissenters often described literal translations as '<emph>slavish</emph> and literal' [. . .].  Liberty and freedom in translation were prized by translators in the republican or neo-Roman tradition" (72).  While Hutchinsonianism was not necessarily dissent, its will to get out from under a perceived Jewish yoke takes on and reflects the rhetoric of emerging ideas about individual sovereignty.   </p>
<p>Hutchinsonian translator and grammarian John Parkhurst saw himself as a defender of the Anglican faith who, like Hutchinson himself, was charged with fighting a holy war via grammar, for while the "superstitions of Popery" threatened one flank, "the wicked reveries of the <emph>enthusiastic</emph>, <emph>self-illuminated Sects</emph>" menaced another.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn13" n="13">John D.

</ref>, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edition, January 2008 [accessed August 8, 2010]</note> The Hutchinsonian sense that Christianity had superseded Judaism to the point of nullifying Jewish techniques for preserving Hebrew literacy colors Parkhurst's <title level="m">An Hebrew and English Lexicon</title>.  First printed in 1762 and subsequently republished in 1778, 1799, 1807, 1811, and 1823, the work rehearses the line that Hebrew was easier to acquire (and distort) "when unembarrassed with Points" (xii).  Here Parkhurst brazenly promises the reader that study of Hebrew "unadulterated with the Rabbinical Points, <emph>in a few months</emph>, [would] enable him to read in the original with ease and delight, most parts of those <emph>Holy Scriptures</emph>, <emph>all of which,</emph> St. Paul assures us, <emph>were given by inspiration of God,</emph> and <emph>are able to make us wise unto salvation, through Faith, which is in Jesus Christ</emph>" (10-1). After this polemic, the text lists and defines Hebrew words according to an exceptionally idiosyncratic understanding of the language. This work perpetuates the Hutchinsonian opinion that Hebrew writing was divine, but its itinerant vowel systems were illegitimate, an assumption that was then transmitted to eager autodidact translators like Elizabeth Smith, a fascinating writer whom I have written about in a different context.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn14" n="14">Daniel DeWispelare, <title level="a">An Amateur's Professional Devotion: Elizabeth Smith's Translation of the Book of Job.</title> In <title level="j">Literature and Theology</title>, Vol. 25, No. 2 (May 2011).</note>
</p>
<p>I have dwelled on the Hutchinsonian lineage of Hebrew-to-English translation because it represents a mode of theological and teleological translation that was eccentric, philosophically bankrupt, and inevitably moribund even upon its first appearance. While it was influential, many dissenters and Anglican theologians reacted against the obvious revisionism inherent in the Hutchinsonian system, a system that unmoored biblical Hebrew from any verifiable historical and cultural contexts.  By contrast, dissenting preacher John Taylor's <title level="m">The Hebrew Concordance</title> (1754-7) included all <foreign>niqqud</foreign> and <foreign>masorah</foreign> and self-consciously based itself on the models of dissenter theologian Joseph Priestley and Unitarian minister Theophilus Lindsey, both of whom argued that historically accurate knowledge of Hebrew justified dissenting religious doctrines.  Priestley, for instance, rooted his interpretations of Hebrew in philological comparisons of related Semitic languages, as he describes in his memoirs of teaching: "I instructed in Hebrew, and by that means made myself a considerable proficient in that language.  At the same time, I learned Chaldee and Syriac, and just began to read Arabic" (<title level="m">Memoirs</title> 9).  Anglican theologian Anselm Bayly's 1773 Hebrew grammar strikes an ecumenical and empirical tone as a foil to the excesses of Hutchinsonian thinking:
                  <quote>Men of letters, with respect to the Hebrew [. . .] are unhappily divided into two parties, the Jews with some Christians for the Points, as absolutely necessary, and some Christians against them; who [. . .] have run to the other extreme by maintaining, that the Points are so far from being of any use at all, that their design was to confound and mislead.</quote>
            Bayly continued by reaching out to British-Jewish scholars and advocating a collaboration that would have been patently offensive to Hutchinson's followers: "to effect a real and lasting union," Bayly writes, "the best method perhaps would be, for some person of candor and moderation, who is conversant in the Rabinical [sic] writings, to lay open the Points, or however the ground of them, faithfully and plainly" (2).  This statement evokes the long tradition of Jewish-Christian lineages of tutoring, teaching, and transmission, and I mention it because it is firmly within this tradition of intellectual and philosophical exchange that we should locate Hyman Hurwitz, one of the most interesting Hebraists the period produced.</p>
<p>To understand the unique challenges and opportunities in Hurwitz's career, a brief note on the history of Jewish Hebrew teachers in Britain is in order.  Though technically expelled from England from the late-thirteenth century until the 1650s, grammatical, religious, and kabbalistic works circulated into Britain from Jewish centers in Iberia, Amsterdam, and Eastern Europe, while a small network of crypto-Jews lived on discreetly in London, Cambridge, Oxford, and other port cities.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn15" n="15">For the historical details see in particular Cecil Roth, <title level="m">A History of the Jews in England</title>.</note>  Christian students were known to hire recently converted or Jewish Hebrew tutors to facilitate their studies.  In <title level="m">Philo-Semitism</title>, David Katz cites biographical sketches of John Immanuel Tremellius, Jacob Wolfgang, and Jacob Barnet to document this very point. After the Jewish resettlement in 1655, eighteenth-century historian D'Blossiers Tovey hearkened back to the eleventh-century reign of William Rufus to explain the role of Jewish tutors in education, a pedagogic necessity that would have been familiar to students at Oxford in his own day: "In one of the parishes [of Oxford] they also had a <emph>School</emph>, or <emph>Synagogue</emph>; wherein certain <emph>Rabbies</emph> instructed, not only their own People, but, several of the Christian Students of the <emph>University</emph>, in the <emph>Hebrew</emph> Learning and Language" (9). Though there had been Hebrew chairs at Oxford and Cambridge since 1540, it is clear that the Christian establishment continually relied upon Jewish scholarly help in translation and exegesis.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn16" n="16">See in particular the <title level="a">Introduction</title> to the Oxford World Classics edition of the King James Bible (2008) and David Daiches's <title level="m">The King James Version of the English Bible: An Account of the Development and Sources of the English Bible of 1611 with Special Reference to the Hebrew Tradition</title>.</note>
</p>
<p>The details of Hurwitz's life are simple but unusual. Immigrating to Britain around 1800, he spent a brief stint as a Hebrew teacher at a Christian school before opening a school for Jewish youth known as Highgate Academy.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn17" n="17">[Anon.], <title level="a">Hurwitz, Hyman (1770–1844)</title>, rev.

<title level="m">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</title>
</ref>, Oxford University Press, 2004 [accessed 10 Dec 2010]</note>  Through mutual acquaintances he became the friend and tutor of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, a relationship I will discuss through reference to a Coleridgian translation in the final section of this paper.  In 1828, Hurwitz's personality, openness, and writings secured him an appointment as the first Jewish professor of Hebrew at University College London, an institution that did not require its professors to conform to the Test Acts.  The <title level="m">Bibliotheca Anglo-Judaica</title> deems the <title level="m">Elements of the Hebrew Language</title> (1828) to be his most important work, noting that it "went through many editions, and was for a long time the standard Hebrew grammar among English Jews" (Jacobs and Wolf 223).  As in Levi, this text attacks those who would dissociate biblical Hebrew from its cultural context, but it does so in a way that still invites novice readers of any faith into the pleasures of the Hebrew language.  This is attributable to Hurwitz's vocation as an educator for all levels and confessions, but it also derives from his uniquely cosmopolitan cast of mind. </p>
<p>Cultural ecumenism can be seen in Hurwitz's <title level="m">Essay on the Uninspired Literature of the Hebrews</title> as well as the playful Rabbinic parables of <title level="m">Hebrew Tales</title> (1826) that the essay introduces.  As a translator and defender of Mishnaic literature, Hurwitz accentuates the antiquity of the Jewish lore while dressing it in an appealing and contemporary anglophone style. Judith Page has written about Hurwitz's engagement with the British literary tradition, and one example of his Mishnaic glosses will serve here to confirm Page's point.  Like many, the section from the <title level="m">Hebrew Tales</title> called <title level="a">Milton's 'Dark from Excess of Light'</title> presupposes the reader's familiarity both with Book Three of <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> and with the Mishnaic book <title level="m">Kodoshim</title>.  With these subtexts, Hurwitz launches into cultural syncretism, describing how Rabbi Joshua asked Emperor Trajan to stare at the sun after Trajan had questioned God's omnipresence. When the sun's brightness blackens Trajan's vision, Rabbi Joshua asks, "Thou art unable to endure the light of one of his creatures and canst thou expect to behold the resplendent glory of the Creator?" (<title level="m">Tales</title> 64). The image of God's "excessive brightness" in Milton's Christian epic is here given a Jewish precursor.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn18" n="18">The relevant lines are:

</note>  Working on the British canon, Hurwitz's translation is almost the inverse of Christian typology as it locates Jewish subtexts for Christian stories.  The goal is to formulate a cultural history in which Jewish thought and philosophy are recognized as constitutive of British identity and not opposed to it. Hurwitz's <title level="a">Essay on Uninspired Literature</title> and the <title level="m">Hebrew Tales</title> have been compared to Wordsworth and Coleridge's preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, but they can also be likened to phenomena like Ossianism, Percy's <title level="m">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</title> (1765), or the diverse texts of overseas orientalism.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn19" n="19">The comparison with Wordsworth can be found in Judith Page's <title level="a">Hyman Hurwitz's <emph>Hebrew Tales</emph> (1826): Redeeming the Talmudic Garden,</title> in <title level="m">British Romanticism and the Jews: History, Culture, Literature</title>, Sheila Spector, ed.

<div type="section">
<head>(c) British Hebraism, Empire, and Orientalism</head>
<p>Thus far, the frameworks within which I have been describing British Hebraism and Hebrew-to-English translation have been too-narrowly restricted.  There are broader contexts within which to understand this movement, and one of these concerns the expanding British empire's production of novel cultural contacts, its exoticizing interest in foreign linguistic traditions, and its diverse new lines of translation.  As scholars have long recognized, empire brought British economic power to bear on cultural exchange, thereby facilitating the importation of new manuscripts, the hiring of native informants, and the rise of a class of professional translators charged with making the East legible to the colonial apparatus. Since biblical Hebrew was by its very ontology simultaneously European and non-European, "occidental" and "oriental"—a language at the center of Christianity and at its edges—studying its relationship to orientalism shows that orientalism borrowed from while also reinforced theories generated first in studies of the Hebrew scriptures. </p>
<p>The geopolitical configurations underwriting new interest in biblical Hebrew translation are perhaps best introduced through the work of another Anglican theologian, Benjamin Kennicott, the leader of a massive biblical collation project.  Brilliantly brought to life in Ruderman's <title level="m">Jewish Enlightenment in an English Key</title>, Kennicott was, like Hutchinson, antagonistic to the Jewish tradition, protesting of the Hebrew Scriptures in 1774, "They have indeed undergone many great and grievous Corruptions, occasioned by the ignorance or negligence of transcribers" (<title level="m">Sacra</title> 3).  Kennicott's sense of scriptural "Corruption" provoked his attempt to execute an end-run around Jewish intermediaries by way of other near Eastern languages like Samaritan and Aramaic.  Having collated and compared roughly seventy extant manuscripts, Kennicott concluded in his first dissertation, <title level="m">The State of the Printed Hebrew Text</title> of 1753, that textual variations among them engendered enough doubt as to require an extensive (Christian) reassessment of the Old Testament canon.  In his second dissertation of 1759, he legitimized the continuation of his project in the following way,
                  <quote>The chief argument, for the <emph>usefulness</emph> of such an undertaking, was founded upon the discovery of many Heb. MSS, which contain'd very material variations; and such, as would render it probable—that mistakes more in number, and more considerable in their nature, would appear to have been made by <emph>the Jews</emph>, in their transcripts of the <emph>old</emph> Testament (notwithstanding their so-much-boasted accuracy) than appear to have been made by <emph>the Christian</emph> transcribers of the <emph>new</emph> Testament. (<title level="m">State</title> 7)</quote>
            Though he pretended to a sort of proto-scientific objectivity, the ideological nature of Kennicott's project was reinforced by the way that his italicized chiasmus forced the reader to digest again the oft-repeated Christian mantra that "<emph>the Jews</emph>" were to "the <emph>old</emph>" as "<emph>the Christian</emph>" was to "the <emph>new</emph>."  Kennicott's goal was to break the perceived transmission monopoly that Jewish sources had over the biblical corpus.  By 1760, he was soliciting financial support toward the goal of purchasing as many biblical manuscripts as possible from across the world; over £12,000, twenty years, and 30 volumes later, his new Bible collation was complete.  The Kennicott Bible was published at Oxford between 1776 and 1780.  It claimed to feature the most accurate possible conflations of 684 manuscripts, and is still regarded as one of the largest and most significant collation projects undertaken in modern biblical history.   </p>
<p>The implications of Kennicott's orientalism for translation studies are critical: like Hutchinsonians, Kennicott annexed to himself the authority to rewrite the scriptures through contrived textual sciences as a way to bypass traditional Jewish learning. Of course, the other interesting aspect of Kennicott's project is the way it configures the Near East as a distinct repository of authentic cultural material upon which a British scholar could bring the money and linguistic skills necessary for gleaning specifically Christian truths. As Hitchin writes, "Improving access to near eastern lands was a boon to translators. Comparing Arabic and Syriac words with ancient Hebrew words was increasingly treated as an indispensable adjunct for biblical philology" (79). In this respect, Edward Said's link between biblical study and orientalism in the sense of the East as a career-making object of study is borne out most obviously.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn20" n="20">See reading of Lowth in Edward Said's <title level="m">Orientalism</title> (17). </note> The East produced by Kennicott's comparative philology is only one such discursive East, another comes through in the simultaneously primitivist and orientalist translation work of Bishop of London Robert Lowth (1710-1787).</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<head>(d) British Hebraism and Primitivist Theories of Poetic Genius</head>
<p>Closely related to the admittedly brief preceding section on British Hebraism and orientalism is the primitivist underpinnings of much Hebrew-English translation during this period.  A teacher interested in this angle should begin, as others have, with the writing and translations of Bishop of London Robert Lowth, for Lowth's notes on method in <title level="m">De Sacra Poesi Hebraeorum Praelectiones Academicae Oxonii Habitae</title> (1753; English Version 1787) and his fulfillment of that method in <title level="m">Isaiah: A New Translation</title> (1778) were vital reference points for a generation of translators and poets irrespective of interest in Hebrew.  M.H. Abrams writes of Lowth's lectures, "Such an elaborate and comprehensive critical examination of the Hebrew Bible, considered as a collection of poetic documents, was bound to have a radical impact on the accepted system of criticism" (76).  The influence of Lowth's lectures on poetic and translation practice was similarly profound.  </p>
<p>In his writings, Lowth's basic assertion is that Hebrew poetry operates according to its own logic, a logic entirely separate from more familiar Greek and Latin poetic conventions: "Whatever it might be that constituted Hebrew verse, it certainly did not consist in rhyme, or similar and correspondent sounds at the ends of verses [. . .] it is manifest that rhymes, or similar endings, are not an essential part of Hebrew verse" (<title level="m">Isaiah</title> viii).  Eschewing Hutchinson's paranoid venom against perfidious Jews, <title level="m">De sacra poesi Hebraeorum</title> claims merely that attenuated lines of transmission brought Hebrew to eighteenth-century England and thus the true nature of Hebrew verse had been obscured: "Not so much as the number of syllables [. . .] could with any certainty be defined [. . .].  He who attempts to restore the true and genuine Hebrew versification, erects an edifice without a foundation" (<title level="m">Lectures</title> 39).  Just like an antiquarian deciphering a runic inscription, Lowth compensates as best he can, for absent any exact system of versification, the poet-translator-theologian must reinvent the English dress that Hebrew will take on. </p>
<p>Lowth is best known for advancing the thesis that three types of thematic parallelism structured biblical poems.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn21" n="21">For a more contemporary reading that preserves some of Lowth's structures, see James Kugel's <title level="m">The Idea of biblical Poetry: Parallelism and Its History</title>.</note>  First was synonymous parallelism, wherein two parts of one verse echoed one another, as in the first line of Psalm 114: "When Israel went out of Egypt, / the house of Jacob from a people of strange language."  The second type of parallelism fuses two antithetical half-verses, as in 1 Samuel 2:4-5: "The bows of the mighty are broken / and they that stumbled are girded with strength."   The third variety of parallelism repeats a grammatical form over multiple verses like in Psalm 19:8-11: "The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul; / The testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the simple; / The percepts of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart; / The commandment of Jehovah is clear, enlightening the eyes."  The unfolding of the four lines is parallel, but also additive; the sum of the four offers more than each line individually.  Lowth's focus on reproducing these biblical Hebrew traits in eighteenth-century English goes so far as to alter—or <emph>augment</emph>—English's capacities.  Lowth makes English speak in Hebrew's forms rather than the other way around.  He uses space, parallelism, and repetition to produce a translation distant from English poetic traditions, especially the traditions of paraphrase and versification associated with Isaac Watts and others.  </p>
<p>Lowth's translation of <title level="m">Isaiah</title> takes this logic into another dimension, criticizing translators for rendering prophetic writings as prose when in fact Lowth saw them as poetry.  His updating of Isaiah 53, one of the most celebrated typological moments in the Bible, exemplifies how translation can pursue Anglican prophecy <emph>through</emph> anglophone Hebrew poetry.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn22" n="22">In the chapter, a servant sings of the suffering to which he has submitted before God. Christians read this chapter as a prefiguration of Christ whereas Jews tended to identify the suffering servant with the nation of Israel. </note> The KJV's Isaiah 53:2 serves up serial prose fragments with incidental rather than intentional parallelism.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn23" n="23">The KJV wording is: "For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness: and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him." </note> By contrast, Lowth fashions a poem with line breaks conforming spatially to Hebrew grammatical units and employing synonymous parallelism: 
                  <quote>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>For he groweth up in their sight like a tender sucker; </l>
<l>And like a root from a thirsty soil: </l>
<l>He hath no form, nor any beauty, that we should regard him; </l>
<l>Nor is his countenance such, that we should desire him (<title level="m">Isaiah</title> 154).</l>
</lg>
</quote>
                  
         A similarly subtle use of spatial arrangement and discursive purgation is visible in 53:7.  Where the KJV reads, "He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumme, so he openeth not his mouth," Lowth reformulates the lines, 
                  <quote>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>It was exacted, and he was made answerable; and he opened not his mouth: </l>
<l>As a lamb that is led to the slaughter, </l>
<l>And as a sheep before her shearers, </l>
<l>Is dumb; so he opened not his mouth (Lowth, <title level="m">Isaiah</title> 155).</l>
</lg>
</quote>
                  
                  Here Lowth locates synonymous parallelism in the second and third lines.  Additionally, because poetry is meant to enhance prophecy, Lowth establishes a link between the passive <foreign>niggas</foreign> ('exacted') and the passive causative <foreign>na'aneh</foreign> ('made answerable').  His changes produce a strange sort of poem on the page, and while still replete with Christological symbolism, it acts on English-language aesthetic traditions in a way that prefigures other intentionally archaized writings of the period, such as Coleridge's <title level="a">Rime of the Ancyent Marinere</title> (1798) or <title level="a">Christabel</title> (1797-1800).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn24" n="24">We can also trace Lowth's influence through biblical translations, a large number of which came out in his wake.  Genesis underwent seven separate complete or partial translations, Exodus was translated thrice, and assorted chapters of Numbers and Deuteronomy were published as well.  Ecclesiastes, that mystical book, was retranslated and published on at least four separate occasions.  In the 90-year period between 1750 and 1840 there appeared fourteen separate Hebrew-to-English translations of Song of Songs.  Perhaps the most difficult and yet most popular of biblical translation projects besides the Psalter, the Book of Job, was translated at least fifteen separate times.</note>
</p>
<p>In fact, this archaizing impulse in Coleridge is one of the ways British Hebraism can supplement our knowledge of the period.  Coleridge obtained Lowth's <title level="m">De Sacra Poesi Hebraeorum</title> from the library in Bristol in 1796 (Halmi 352; Whalley 114-42). When he translated the opening of the "Song of Deborah" (Judges 5:1-10) in December 1799—before he had ever studied with Hurwitz—it is clear that from Lowth he had developed his own conception of how biblical Hebrew material operated (Halmi 352-4). For one, Coleridge quotes Lowth several times in <title level="m">Lectures on Revealed Religion</title> (1795) (McKusick 412). Additionally, he rehearses Lowth's theory of biblical parallelism in an explanatory note: "The Song of Deborah, translated in the * parallelisms of the Original / (* that is, so that each Line or member of a sentence is counter-balanced by the following, either by difference or similitude, or by the repetition of the same thought in different words or with a different Image" (<title level="m">Poems</title> 254). In his deployment of these forms, Coleridge shows that he is interested in <title level="a">The Song of Deborah</title> as a historical relic unique to a specific time and place, but also that he is interested in the passage as a transcendental and even transhistorical overflow of powerful feelings, what James McKusick terms a "crisis of mental activity finding a volcanic outlet in language" (414).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn25" n="25">The title <title level="a">The Song of Deborah</title> is a product of convention.  In Hebrew, however, the first verse does make clear that it is indeed a <foreign>shir</foreign>, or poetic song.</note>  In fact, his understanding of the Hebrew song as local in origin yet universally sublime in expression offers an interesting new origin for Romantic aesthetics as they are typically understood.    </p>
<p> Coleridge judges the <title level="a">Song of Deborah</title> to be "as simple a dithyrambic production as exists in any language" (<title level="m">Shakespearean Criticism</title> 426).  And indeed, <title level="a">The Song of Deborah</title> is widely believed to be one of the oldest, if not the oldest piece of poetry in the Hebrew corpus even though the difficulties in dating it are many (Globe 495; Smith 81).  Coleridge knew about the song's antiquity and in <title level="m">Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit</title> he even adduced it as evidence arguing against the scriptures being dictated by an "infallible Intelligence" (31).  Rather than considering the Bible as "a hollow passage for a voice, a voice that mocks the voices of many men" (32), Coleridge saw the Bible as a composition, animated but not dictated by a holy spirit, 
                  <quote>All the several books bound up together in our precious family Bibles were composed in different and widely distant ages, under the greatest diversity of circumstances, and degrees of light and information, and yet the composers, whether as uttering or as recording what was uttered and what was done, were all actuated by a pure and holy Spirit [. . .] one Spirit, working diversly.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn26" n="26">Coleridge makes a critical distinction between 'diversely' and 'diversly' here.  "The same Spirit may act and impel diversly, but, being a good Spirit, it cannot act diversely" (<title level="m">Confessions</title> 33).</note>
</quote>
To paraphrase, the Bible unfolds in time as a holy spirit activates people from vastly different eras.  </p>
<p>His poem attempts to reconstruct an authentic feeling of that historicity through language and form.  He confesses in his letter, 
            <quote>As long as I have the image of Deborah before my eyes, and while I throw myself back into the age, country, circumstances, of this Hebrew Bonduca in the not yet tamed chaos of the spiritual creation;—as long as I contemplate the impassioned, high-souled heroic woman in all the prominence and individuality of will and character,—I feel as if I were among the first ferments of the great affections—the proplastic waves of the microcosmic chaos, swelling up against—and yet towards—the outspread wings of the Dove that lies brooding on the troubled waters (34-5).</quote>
         Deborah's fervid song celebrates an Israelite victory, and while trying to make her language historically specific, Coleridge writes her genealogy through his own context, firstly through Christian patrimony and secondly through his evocation of "Bonduca" or Boudica, the rebellious Celtic warrior-queen.  He locates and transmits "great affections" across the "proplastic waves of the microcosmic chaos," a strategy he would later use in his other archaizing poetry.  </p>
<p>
<title level="a">The Song of Deborah</title> incorporates praise, prayer, and even curses.  Coleridge's translation appears on the left as juxtaposed to the KJV translation on the right:

            The effect of Coleridge's rendition is immediate.  It strips away traditional verse numberings in favor of formulating nine discrete stanzas.  Within the first three lines of his first stanza, Coleridge launches a formal revision of the song in which he completes in the third line the syntactic palindrome begun by the first ("sang Deborah"; "sang they"), while simultaneously redoubling its semantic content. The intervening line, "And Barak, Abinoams's Son", possesses its own synonymous parallelism in the metonymic apostrophe to Barak's name.  This three-line stanza is all the more striking given that in neither the Hebrew version nor the KJV are these lines are part of the song.  Verse II reiterates and extends this pattern. The first and last lines echo one another, and the lines between them proceed strictly in parallel: two lines narrating God's movements, three beautifully simplistic lines describing the sublime effect of God's presence, and two lines depicting the annihilation of mountains, themselves already a sublime object of contemplation.  The interlocking diction contributes to the image's sublimity: when God moves, everything is destabilized and liquid. In the KJV's "the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water" (Judges 5:4), the image of rain is more emphatic and more restrictive of creative interpretation. Coleridge's version, however, makes rain but one in a number of possible interpretations of the semantic chain "dissolved," "poured," and "melted."  When God marches, dissolution ensues: of the physical world, of spiritual enemies, and of the self.  </p>
<p>As a Hebrew victory-ballad, <title level="a">The Song of Deborah</title> stands out in the Bible as a ritualized performance.  It caps and extends the prose narrative of Judges 4 with a triumphant prayer celebrating the community's fortification.  In Verse III, Coleridge attends to Deborah's role as prophetess and warrior, intervening with a significant shift in verb tense, from the past "arose" to the present "arise" in the translation of <foreign>shakkamti</foreign>. Thematically, this shift stresses the lasting implications of Deborah's bravery for the community. McKusick attributes Coleridge's variation to a discovery of how to express shifting tense that occurs frequently in the Bible, "as Coleridge could have learned from any grammar book" (414). This reading points to the importance of the new Hebrew grammatical tradition.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn27" n="27">It is worth noting that the translation of this verse is actually quite complicated and even controversial.  The 1917 Jewish Publication Society's English language Bible, the standard English-language Jewish Bible opts for an entirely different verb person, "The rulers ceased in Israel, they ceased, until that thou didst arise, Deborah, that thou didst arise a mother in Israel."</note>  For my part, I want to suggest that Coleridge is deliberately invoking an antithetical parallelism between "They ceased, till I arose, Deborah" and "Till that I [Deborah] arise, a mother in Israel."  My reading emphasizes that these two events reference different moments in the historical narrative.  Deborah's song first thinks back to the moment before she went into battle, just after she "arose," and then jumps forward to the moment after the war's victory when she "arise[s], a mother in Israel" or, equivalently, when she arises as the mother of Israel.  Such a reading corresponds to the emphasis on Deborah's motherhood in <title level="m">Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit</title>, at the same time as it equates Deborah-as-mother and Deborah-as-warmonger storming the Caananites' gates (Verse IV, line 2). </p>
<p>More can be said about Coleridge's unpublished translation, and firmer lines can be drawn to his other work, but what I have tried to do here is simply reveal a local example of the effect biblical translation discourses had on literary production.   In fact, throughout the entirety of this essay, I have opted for strategic rather than exhaustive descriptions of how to integrate British Hebraism into courses.  As any reader of this likely feels, there is obviously more work to be done.  Sketching various lines of lineage between British Hebraism and orientalism, for instance, is an ideal topic for an undergraduate research or graduate seminar paper.  Other topics have equal potential, and I hope that what has been only gestural in this paper will be realized in the work of others.    </p>

<p>In <title level="m">The Rise of the Novel</title> (1957), Ian Watt identifies French fiction from <title level="m">La Princesse de Clèves</title> (1678) to <title level="m">Les Liaisons Dangereuses</title> (1782) as a tradition that stands "outside the main tradition of the novel" (30). Lafayette's historical romance of thwarted passion and Laclos's epistolary novel of aristocratic excess are the only two French novels mentioned in Watt's study, still, of course, a reference point for current work on the eighteenth-century novel, despite being published over 50 years ago. Recent work on the rise of the novel—such as Mary Helen McMurran's 2009 <title level="m">The Spread of Novels: Translation and Prose Fiction in the Eighteenth Century</title>—certainly challenges Watt's Anglocentric perspective.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Watt's choice of these two French novels to bookmark the beginning and the end of the "French" eighteenth-century novel is in many ways apt when viewed from a twenty-first-century perspective. <title level="m">La Princesse de Clèves</title> and <title level="m">Les Liaisons Dangereuses</title> are the only novels from this period which can claim a presence in the Anglo-American tradition since the moment of their first publication: both remain in print in English translation, and, as hyper-translated texts, they have long served to represent French fiction of the eighteenth century. One might go so far as to say that <title level="m">Les Liaisons Dangereuses</title> is the "classic" Romantic novel of the 1780s.  Although Frances Burney's <title level="m">Cecilia</title> was published in the same year as <title level="m">Les Liaisons Dangereuses</title> and gets an increasing amount of scholarly attention in the classroom, the French novel is the one that the non-specialist reader is likely to have heard of, albeit not read. Yet wariness of teaching literature in translation, and of a French tradition that is "other", means that—in the UK at any rate—Laclos is rarely taught to monolingual Anglophone students on Romanticism programmes. Given the exponential increase in the Romantic “canon” in the last three decades, which now includes women poets from Charlotte Smith to Felicia Hemans, not to mention novels, and Romantic "themes" such as abolitionism, education, revolution, and terror, one cannot be surprised that French fiction of the period 1780-1830 is neglected. Had we but world enough, and time, teachers of Romanticism may well be able to include such work in translation on their programmes. As it is, there are all too frequently other priorities. </p>
<p>This article will attempt to persuade the scholar of Romanticism that it is worth introducing monolingual students to French fiction in translation by giving an account of my experience of teaching <title level="m">Les Liaisons Dangereuses</title> in English to second-year undergraduate students in English Literature at the University of Southampton.  The University of Southampton is a large, research-led institution on the south coast of England, a member of the Russell Group of British Universities. Our students in the English literature BA programme are—for the most part—high-achieving, hard-working, dedicated and well-read. But, as a survey I conduct at the very beginning of each class demonstrates, the majority of them come to their studies in English literature without any knowledge of the French language at all. They have never read a French novel of any period (even in translation) and they are largely unable to name a single novelist, playwright, philosopher, or poet from across the channel (Rousseau is occasionally mentioned, but not as frequently as Romanticists might hope). There are many reasons for this, of course—the global dominance of English affects language acquisition and multiculturalism in countries other than the UK. One might argue that there is an indifference to the genre of translation with English speakers. Since 2011, I have directed my students towards David Bellos's lively study <title level="m">Is That a Fish in Your Ear: Translation and the Meaning of Everything</title> for a discussion of this very topic. Bellos points out that monolingual English speakers have very little exposure to literature in translation: Anglo-American publishers do not produce anything like the volume of translations published, say, in France; booksellers do not promote translated works, and, as Bellos puts it, although "translations from English are all over the place[,] translations into English are as rare as hen's teeth" (210). The overall feeling seems to be that since "something is lost" in translation, one might as well not exert oneself. But there are some recent cultural specificities too due to the education system in England. </p>
<p>In England, students at state schools have not been obliged to continue learning a modern language after age 14 since 2002: my own generation of state-school educated students were obliged to take at least one language to age 16, and this was invariably French. The change in the national curriculum has had a devastating effect on tertiary-level education in modern languages: very few of my students now read combined honours in English and a foreign language. It also means fewer General Certificates of Secondary Education (GCSEs) in these subjects (the exam taken age 16), and even fewer "A" levels (the exam taken age 18, just before entry to university). There is a steep learning curve for students without this background, and this is something I tackle directly in our 2-hour lecture, and 2-hour seminar discussion on the text, and that I support throughout the course. </p>
<p>
<title level="m">Les Liaisons Dangereuses</title> is one of seven or eight texts taught on a second year undergraduate module at Southampton, entitled "Dangerous Readings," when students have completed a year of higher education, and moved on to selecting options for more in-depth study. It was designed by me (my main interests are in comparative literature in the period 1750-1830), a nineteenth-century specialist colleague Mary Hammond, and a medievalist colleague Marianne O'Doherty. As our specialisms might suggest, it is cross-period, and it was always intended to be flexible in terms of the set texts each year. Our shared interests are historic readers, and the module therefore has a strong focus on reception and reader-response theory throughout. For more information, <ref target="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/humanities/undergraduate/modules/engl2064_dangerous_readings.page#overview">see here</ref>. </p>
<p>I wanted to introduce our students to some canonical French texts in translation, and to encourage them to think about the increasing fear of French fiction between 1750-1830—and for the remainder of the nineteenth century. This was a period in which the French novel was losing its former influence over British fiction. Although French novels were sold in London bookshops, and indeed were rapidly translated from French into English, reviewers often only recommended them with caveats.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">For an examination of Europhobia more generally in the period, see Peter Mortensen's <title level="m">British Romanticism and Continental Influences.</title> For more comments on the fear of French fiction specifically, see my own chapter, "Criss-Crossing the Channel: The French Novel and English Translation 1660-1832," forthcoming, and my online article “Translation, Cross-Channel Exchanges and the Novel in the Long Eighteenth Century” in <title level="j">Literature Compass</title>, forthcoming.
            </note> Sentimental French prose fiction did remain popular in England throughout the period. As Josephine Grieder has explored, from the works of Marie-Jeanne Riccoboni in the 1750s and 1760s to the novels of Sophie Cottin in the 1810s, there was clearly an avid Anglophone readership for this fiction. But French morals, it was felt, corrupted the morals of the implied readers: young women themselves. If a young female character in a work of prose fiction in English—from Lady Augusta in Maria Edgeworth's <title level="a">Mademoiselle de Panache</title> (1801) to Lady Juliana in Susan Ferrier's <title level="m">Marriage</title> (1818)—is reading French fiction, she is clearly no better than she should be. </p>
<p>Our students begin their "Dangerous Readings" module with a week of classes on Charlotte Lennox's <title level="m">The Female Quixote</title> (1752), focusing on Lady Arabella and her reading of French romances ('in very bad translation'). Here, my aim is to encourage them to think about the novel's continental roots: I have yet to encounter a student at Southampton who has read Cervantes, so I give them some passages in a modern translation, and we talk about the popularity of this Spanish work throughout England in the long eighteenth century, looking at passages from Smollett's 1755 translation. I also want my students to consider what might be "dangerous," and what might be liberating, about Arabella's reading, and whether Lennox's novel is truly a rejection of "silly French novels" for the female reader. We then turn to Laclos, and students go on in subsequent weeks to read <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> (1818), and both Flaubert's <title level="m">Madame Bovary</title> (1856) and Zola's <title level="m">L'Assommoir</title> (1877). </p>
<p>Crucial to the learning aims and objectives for the module is to encourage students to question the effect that the act of translation can have on our own (and indeed contemporary) "readings" of a text. But there are certainly challenges to overcome when teaching a novel for which variant modern translations are currently in print with prestigious presses, not to mention the challenge of teaching an epistolary novel more generally. In the remainder of this article, I will share some of the strategies I have found helpful in the lecture theatre and in the classroom. I will not focus on close readings of the text itself (although students can, and do, choose to provide commentaries on individual letters in the novel as part of their assessment for the module), but rather concentrate on three main areas: situating the novel in what Margaret Cohen and Caroline Dever have called the "Literary Channel," selecting a translation for use in the classroom, and promoting the use of both rare books and online resources. </p>

<div type="section">
<head>The Romantic-period Laclos: the Cross-Channel Novel in the 1780s</head>
<p>Some of my students may have seen the film version of Stephen Frears <title level="m">Les Liaisons Dangereuses</title> with Glenn Close and John Malkovich, or indeed Milos Forman's <title level="m">Valmont</title> with Colin Firth and Annette Bening, but since these films date from 1988 and 1989 respectively, they are "classic" cinema for most of my Southampton undergraduates, born post-1990. Even Roger Kumble's rather wonderful 1999 modernization, <title level="m">Cruel Intentions</title>, set in high-school, high-society New York, is not a film they will have grown up with. I point them towards these adaptations much as I relate the oft-repeated anecdote that Marie Antoinette had a copy of the novel in her library (bound without the title or author's name on the cover), and I recommend them not as a substitute for reading the novel, naturally, but rather as evidence of popularity and continued reception. Most of my students respond enthusiastically to the novel itself, once they have got used to the epistolary form. They enjoy it, and they are shocked to be shocked by its themes. Discussions need a tight rein if they are not to descend into character-driven debate about who, between the Vicomte de Valmont and Madame de Merteuil, is the most evil, or whether Cécile de Volanges or Madame de Tourvel is the most "flaky." I find that the emphasis on production, reception, and translation, and on the literary market place when <title level="m">Les Liaisons Dangereuses</title> was first published, helps to focus our attention. </p>
<p>This part of the teaching is largely lecture-led: I need the students to absorb a large amount of material in a short space of time and direct them towards further reading to expand their background knowledge of the period. I start by explaining the importance of the French Enlightenment within eighteenth-century Europe and that French was the educated <foreign>lingua franca</foreign>. I highlight the popularity of French fiction in the long eighteenth century and point to the rapidity of translation as evidence of reception—English translations from the French were often published in the year or so after publication of the original. And I emphasise the close relationship between the fictions of France and England in this period, the familiarity French readers would have had with British fiction and vice versa. There are many recent publications that help me—and my students—situate the Romantic Novel in the context of cross-cultural exchanges in the period. I have already mentioned Cohen and Dever's <title level="m">The Literary Channel</title>. To this can be added the collected essays of <title level="m">Remapping the Rise of the European Novel</title> edited by Jenny Mander, and <title level="m">Cultural Transfers: France and Britain in the Long Eighteenth Century</title> edited by Thomson, Burrows, and Dziembowski, as well as Mary Helen McMurran's monograph <title level="m">The Spread of Novels: Translation and Prose Fiction in the Eighteenth Century</title>. Taken together, these three studies look beyond national boundaries in considering fiction and cultural capital, and this is exactly what I want my students to be able to do by the end of the module. </p>
<p>I find <title level="m">Les Liaisons Dangereuses</title> an extremely helpful text to emphasis the global nature of reading amongst the European elite in the eighteenth century. Valmont and Merteuil themselves are pan-European readers: Merteuil's unveiling of her self-education in letter 81 demonstrates the variety and depth of her reading of philosophy, conduct literature, and indeed novels. The ill-fated Tourvel is said to be reading Richardson's <title level="m">Clarissa</title> at a crucial moment in her own seduction. The reference comes in letter 107, from Valmont's valet Azolan to his master, who clearly doesn't know the novel (in Douglas Parmée's 1995 translation: "I'm spelling it as it was printed, maybe your lordship will know all about it"), although the educated French reader of the late eighteenth century would have recognised the reference immediately. Laclos's own 1784 review of Frances Burney's <title level="m">Cecilia</title>, published, like <title level="m">Les Liaisons Dangereuses,</title> in 1782, is admiring of the British novel more generally. As Antoinette Marie-Sol points out,
         <quote>Laclos does not distinguish between nations in his list of exceptional works. This leads to the third point of the review: Laclos's own preference for the English novel [. . .] only Richardson, Fielding, and Rousseau are listed as the "meilleurs romanciers" (163).</quote>
               Laclos, of course, is not alone in looking across the channel for his fictional models. Stéphanie-Félicité de Genlis's <title level="m">Adèle et Théodore</title>, published in the same year, and translated into English in 1783 is just as admiring of Richardson (Genlis claims he produced the only "moral" works of fiction that could be recommended to young women), and the English author was also admired by Diderot, Rousseau, and Voltaire.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">For a discussion of how Genlis's <title level="m">Adèle et Théodore</title> might be used in the classroom, see Lesley H. Walker, <ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/pedagogies/commons/novel/walker.html">
<title level="a">What Madame de Genlis might teach us today.</title>
</ref>
</note> For the view from the other side of the channel, students can usefully be referred to <title level="a">An Essay on the Origin and Progress of Novel Writing,</title> which appeared as Anna Laetitia Barbauld's introduction to her <title level="m">British Novelists</title> (1810). In this introduction, Barbauld surveys continental fiction, and gives her own version of the key works in French literature, from Fénelon's <title level="m">Télémaque</title> to Genlis's <title level="m">Adèle et Théodore</title>, via Scarron, Lafayette, Lesage, Marmontel, Graffigny, Rousseau, Bernardin de St. Pierre, and Isabelle de Montolieu. Yet Barbauld does not mention Laclos's <title level="m">Les Liaisons Dangereuses</title>, despite the canonical status in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Such evidence helps students to question the Romantic canon more generally, something all our teaching must now consider. </p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<head>Variant Translations; or, What Text is there in this Class?</head>
<p>In a useful essay entitled <title level="a">The Eighteenth-Century Novel and the Core Curriculum: Dangerous Liaisons,</title> Robert J. Frail argues that "Like English translations of other French texts, <title level="m">Les Liaisons dangereuses</title> fares badly" and that it is therefore necessary to select a translation with great care. It is, he feels,
         <quote>essential for an instructor using an English translation to take some time (especially in a core course where many students may be reading their first and last French novel) to discuss flaws in the translation and strengths and nuances in the original that have been lost in translation (36). </quote>
         Whilst I agree that the issue of translation must be tackled head-on, the discussion of the superiority of the original that Frail encourages here is an exercise in the subjective, not to mention the absurd, for the monolingual student. S/he of necessity has to take on trust that the instructor knows better than the translator, which, in addition, means that Romanticists without extremely fluent French would not be up to the task. It may well be this kind of anxiety that discourages Anglophone Romanticists from teaching literature in translation. I suggest another approach, which is making use of variant translations to emphasise the mediating role played by even the most unobtrusive of translators. I am assisted in this by the number of translations in my classroom, invited or not.</p>
<p>Every year, I assign the Oxford World's Classics edition, translated by Douglas Parmée (1995). This is not because I feel this is a superior translation. I am, in fact, rather partial to the tone of P.W.K. Stone's 1961 translation, still in print with Penguin Classics. In any case, I believe that all translations have their flaws and merits. But the World's Classics edition is affordable and accessible, and includes an excellent and comprehensive introduction by David Coward, and useful explanatory notes (although I take a dim view of combining Laclos's original notes with the translator's notes at the end of the edition—seminar discussion with my students always includes some discussion of the paratextual presentation of <title level="m">Les Liaisons Dangereuses</title>, both now, and in the eighteenth century). </p>
<p>Despite my careful selection of this set text, every year I have at least four translations in my classroom. These are: P.W.K. Stone (1961), Douglas Parmée (1995), Helen Constantine's 2007 translation for Penguin Classics, and, increasingly, Ernest Dowson's 1898 translation, which is the copy text for the Barnes and Noble Classics edition, not widely available in the UK, but importantly, the edition now available for download onto Kindle (beware the Kindle, those who want to read modern translations of classic French texts: the link from the Amazon page for Constantine's most recent translation takes one directly to Dowson). One year, I overheard a student say that "it doesn't really matter which one we have, does it. It's not as if it's a different novel." I use the variant translations in the class to stress that it only doesn't matter which translation we have if we believe that language doesn't matter. And I do so by comparing sections from the variant translations directly. </p>
<p>Take, for example, the translation of Laclos's <title level="a">Avertissement de l'Editeur,</title> that sardonic and satirical "warning" to the public that puts the reader on guard from the outset. Stone's <title level="a">Publisher's Note</title> has this line to conclude the first paragraph: "we have in fact, very good reason to believe that it is only a novel." Parmée's <title level="a">Publisher's Foreword</title> is thus: "We even have strong reasons to suspect that this is a work of fiction." In a course that focuses on the dangers of novel-reading, only Stone's translation can be used to back up any point made about contemporary fear of novels specifically, and novel-writers' disparagement of the false "morality" of their critics. Laclos's original, of course, is "<foreign>ce n'est qu'un Roman</foreign>." I point this out in the classroom, but I try, where possible, not to rely on comparisons with the French. </p>
<p>I then introduce another variant translation into the mix: the first English translation <title level="m">Dangerous Connections</title>, published in 1784. We are fortunate, at Southampton, to have access to this via Eighteenth-Century Collections Online (ECCO), but colleagues who do not could conceivably make use of the second edition of 1812, which is available from Google Books, and which includes Abbe Kentzinger's <title level="a">Extract from the correspondence on what concerns the happiness of man and society. [no. III] The Utility of Novels. The Novel of <emph>Dangerous Connections</emph>.</title> We now have a temporal spread of translations in the classroom, which allows us to examine the changes in language from the late eighteenth century to the twenty-first. Students can easily see that the older translations "feel" linguistically older, and they can observe differences in vocabulary. </p>
<p>I use variant translations of letter 48 to encourage them to observe differences in poetic language. This is the central letter by Valmont, demonstrating his callousness and libertinage. Written in bed (on the back of a prostitute, Emilie) to the Presidente de Tourvel, the reader of <title level="m">Les Liaisons Dangereuses</title> sees a copy of the letter that is included in a letter to Merteuil. This is a confusing enough episode, and the slipperiness of the language rewards a comparative approach across translations. There is an excellent close reading of four variant English translations of this letter by Catriona Seth, in French, entitled <title level="a">Traduire le double langage amoureux. Réflexions sur la lettre XLVIII des Liaisons dangereuses</title>. Seth focuses on translations in English published in 1784, 1898, 1924 and 1962, and sees the successful translation of this letter as crucial to the success of an English translation overall. She notes, too, that the "eighteenth-century" style only remains apparent in the 1784 translation, which contains some now-obsolete phrases:
         <quote>
<foreign>les auteurs des différentes versions ultérieures ne font aucun effort pour donner un texte qui <emph>ferait dix-huitième</emph> comme on fabrique encore des meubles de style Louis XVI</foreign> (the authors of the later versions make no effort to provide a text that <emph>will feel like an eighteenth-century text</emph> just as we continue to make furniture in the style of Louis XVI) [my translation] (152). </quote>
                  My own students easily grasp that the older the translation, the more opaque the <foreign>double entendre</foreign> for them: they recognise, that is, why translations—like film adaptations—are frequently remade for new audiences and readers. Most of them also pick up that Douglas Parmée's translation includes a suggestive ellipsis in Letter 48 at the moment Valmont breaks off the correspondence, as he puts it in Letter 47, "to commit an act of gross infidelity": "I must leave you a moment to relieve the frenzy which is overtaking, nay, overpowering me  [. . .]" This slight over translation is one of the many ways students can find in which the translator performs as an editor, clarifying points the original author may have chosen to leave unclear, and using punctuation to do so. </p>
<p>Finally, these students do not have time to engage with lengthy discussions of translation theory, although I give them comprehensive references to follow up. I do, however, wish them all to understand that an "exact translation" may be impossible, that the notion that any linguistic form in language A has in language B an exact equivalent in terms of meaning, possible connotation, polysemic value, usage, phonic effect and so on, is fundamentally flawed. Frequently, of course, an equivalent is needed, hence the reliance on the translator. This translator becomes a mediator, a reader of the text for us. I give them the correct terminology to refer to translations: the source text is translated into the target language by a practitioner who is ideally bilingual, or at the least fluent in both. Of course they also need to know that different historical periods have had different views on the purpose and function of a translation, and that the Romantic period viewed much translation as hack-work. </p>
<p>I therefore introduce them to the notion of the "Domesticating" model or target-oriented translation, which was most popular in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, by quoting Dryden's famous lines from his <title level="m">Dedication of the Aeneis</title> (1697): "I have endeavoured to make Virgil speak such English as he would himself have spoken, if he had been born in England, and in this present age" (Weissbort and Eysteinsson 150) We have a short discussion about whether, for example, they think that French names should be changed to make them more palatable for the Anglophone readers, or whether the "Frenchness" of the characters is essential to the plot (here, those who have seen Sarah Michelle Gellar as a young, American, Kathryn Merteuil have much to say about the value of "translating" across time and across cultures). I give the class an extract from Lawrence Venuti's groundbreaking <title level="m">The Translator's Invisibility: A History of Translation</title> (1995) to introduce the "Foreignizing" model or source-oriented translation that offers an alternative to domesticating models in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. All of this discussion is of necessity truncated, but many students choose to follow up the exploration of translation theory in their essays: I point them towards <title level="m">Translation—Theory and Practice: A Historical Reader</title>, edited by Daniel Weissbort and Astradur Eysteinsson, which is a wonderful resource for students of this level (and indeed for their tutors). To encourage their own research into the contemporary responses to translation, I direct them towards a variety of online resources, which they examine in preparation for our seminar discussions. </p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<head>Locating the Early Reader and Translator: Online Tools and Resources </head>
<p>There were three reviews of the first English translation of <title level="m">Les Liaisons Dangereuses</title>, entitled <title level="m">Dangerous Connections</title>: the <title level="j">Monthly Review</title> 71 (1784), p. 149, the <title level="j">Critical Review</title> 57 (1784), pp. 473-474, and the <title level="j">English Review</title> 3 (1784), p. 381.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">English reviews of <title level="m">Les Liaisons Dangereuses</title>: the <title level="j">Monthly Review</title> 71 (1784), p. 149, the <title level="j">Critical Review</title> 57 (1784), pp. 473-474, and the <title level="j">English Review</title> 3 (1784), p. 381.</note> My students can access these reviews via the online resource <title level="m">British Periodicals</title>, but those who are not fortunate enough to have campus access to this database could produce handouts—the reviews are not lengthy. Reading the reviews before our seminar discussion, I encourage students to think about the horizon of expectations of the late-eighteenth-century English reader, and how that may differ from our own. </p>
<p>I have already told them—and they have read in Cheryl L. Nixon's valuable <title level="m">Novel Definitions: An Anthology of Commentary on the Novel, 1688-1815</title>—that the expectation from Romantic reviewers and critics was largely that a novel should provide moral instruction. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that the reviews of <title level="m">Dangerous Connections</title> were not favourable. The <title level="j">Monthly Review</title> admits that "the story is conducted with great art and address, but it is almost too diabolical to be realised." The reviewer for the <title level="j">Monthly Review</title> is shocked, too, that there is, in the preface, an attempt to suggest that the work may provide instruction, which the reviewer calls "an insult on the understanding of the public, as the work itself is a daring outrage on every law of virtue and decorum." All we learn of the exact plot is when the reviewer says darkly, "it is not enough to say we are disgusted at such complicated crimes; but we are actually chilled with horror." The <title level="j">Critical Review</title> agrees that "the whole is delusive and dangerous in a great degree," claiming that "where one" reader may be "guarded from the villainy, ten will more completely learn the mysteries of seduction." The <title level="j">English Review</title> recognises the danger too, although the reviewer in this case recognises that "in point of stile, conduct and artifice of tale, this novel is superior to all its contemporaries, but whether these qualities are a sufficient compensation for the mischief it may do by fertilising the genius of the seducer and animating his designs, we leave others to determine." The reviewer goes as far as to say that "we have been highly entertained by it," and says, too, that "to those who prize entertainment above instruction, this book will prove a very pleasing addition to their libraries." But the reviewer ultimately fears that it will promote vice in the reader, by portraying vice so seductively. It is this seduction—the fact that the main characters, the Vicomte de Valmont and the Marquise de Merteuil are so diabolical, and yet simultaneously so witty, attractive, and appealing—that has proved controversial for readers from the late eighteenth-century until our own age: students gain an understanding of the impact of the text by reading these selective responses. There are comments on the quality of the translation too—and students are often amused to compare their own responses to the 1784 <title level="m">Dangerous Connections</title> with the responses of these early readers. </p>
<p>There are many online resources that students can use to gauge contemporary responses to translations. Two are openly accessible. <title level="m">British Fiction, 1800–1829: A Database of Production, Circulation &amp; Reception</title> contains full reviews of works published in this period. A keyword search for "translation" brings up many reviews by weary critics, wishing that translators were more accurate, and less prolific. I point my students towards reviews of Germaine de Staël's <title level="m">Delphine</title> (1802) in particular, where the wish that the novel had not been translated at all is vehemently expressed by the <title level="j">Critical</title> reviewer. Students also enjoy browsing <ref target="http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/reading/UK/">the Reading Experience Database (RED)</ref>. Here, a keyword search for translation brings up a wealth of information about British readers responding to translations between 1450 and 1945: the first record is of Jane Austen, dismissing a translation of Genlis's <title level="m">Alphonsine</title> for its "bad translation" and "indelicacies which disgrace a pen hitherto so pure" before turning to Lennox's "Female Quixotte" (115-16). Students enjoy exploring early reader responses in this way, and I find it an invaluable introduction to the research-led study they will go on to in their final year at the University of Southampton. </p>
<p>In the following weeks, our students go on to read <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> (1818)—<emph>the</emph> canonical Romantic English novel about novel reading—far better equipped to understand Catherine Morland's response to Gothic fiction, the novel's rejection of sentimental fiction, and the roots of Austen's realism more generally. By now, they have considered Lennox's Lady Arabella's reading of French romances, and they have read a scandalous French novel in translation (which includes another naïve heroine whose fate is much less happy than Lady Arabella or indeed Catherine Morland's own). Having thought about rising nationalisms and the cross-channel development of fiction in the eighteenth century more generally, Henry Tilney's words have an extra piquancy: 
         <quote>Dear Miss Morland, consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained. What have you been judging from? Remember the country and the age in which we live. Remember that we are English, that we are Christians. Consult your own understanding, your own sense of the probable, your own observation of what is passing around you—Does our education prepare us for such atrocities? Do our laws connive at them? Could they be perpetrated without being known, in a country like this, where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing; where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies, and where roads and newspapers lay every thing open? Dearest Miss Morland, what ideas have you been admitting? (203)</quote>
                  The student of the Romantic-period novel must always be reminded that literature, and particularly the early novel, is not a purely nationalist affair. I have no evidence, alas, that my students go on to read Goethe's <title level="m">Sorrows of Young Werther</title> (1774), Chateaubriand's <title level="m">Atala</title> (1801) or <title level="m">René</title> (1802), or indeed Staël's <title level="m">Corinne</title> (1809) in translation, although I certainly point them towards the importance of these novels in the Britain of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and to Romantic-period thought more generally. If they take nothing else away, they at least recognise the plurality of Romanticisms, that French fiction is well worth reading in translation as long as one is aware of the mediating role of the translator, and that 'dangerous' readings are more or less dangerous according to the period—and the country—in which they are being read. These are no bad lessons to teach. </p>

<p>Central to the effective teaching of literature is ensuring that students are exposed to the variety of interpretations to which a given text may give rise, and to the implications of these different readings, both of which aims can be effectively addressed through the use of translated texts. For the Romantic period in particular, presenting and discussing a range of translator's voices allows for not only the celebration of multiple readings, but also a helpful problematizing of topics such as authorship, the individual, and originality. However, analyzing texts originally written in a wide variety of times and places through the lens of translation can and will stimulate classroom debate relating to how we understand and access the literary more generally. This brief article will discuss the comparative use of serial translations and adaptations, with a view to suggesting pedagogical approaches that should enhance a student's understanding of the complexities of textual production, re-production, and reception. Examples could of course be drawn from any number of world literature texts, but I will here focus on two very different references from my own specialization in Japanese literature.</p>
<p>Because all translations are a product of a particular place and time, of the social location of the individual who produces the translation, any particular reading can eventually come to seem dated in its use of vocabulary or allusions. This is a common spur to retranslation. Further, advances in scholarship may indicate the desirability (indeed, the imperative) of re-visiting a text in order better to reflect its meaning and implications as currently understood. More broadly speaking, however, it is a fact that any time a reader approaches a work of literature it becomes something new. A fresh reading may well uncover previously hidden facets of a work and will often prompt a reconsideration of previous interpretations. This is all the more true, therefore, for the highly privileged engagement between a text and its translators, who are after all readers first and foremost.</p>
<p>There are many ways to incorporate translation in our teaching as a means of illustrating the exciting possibilities of reading. Some of us may already be making use of such books as Hiroaki Sato's <title level="m">One Hundred Frogs</title>, which offers widely varying English renditions of the well-known <foreign>haiku</foreign> by Matsuo Munefusa, better known as Bashô (1644-1694), including by well-known poets  Kenneth Rexroth and Allen Ginsberg. Other books offering a selection of comparative translations include <title level="m">19 Ways of Looking at Wang Wei</title>, in which Eliot Weinberger and Octavio Paz present versions (mostly in English, but also French and Spanish) of a classical four-line verse by the eighth-century Chinese poet. Raymond Queneau's justly celebrated post-WWII <title level="m">Exercises de style</title> contains dozens of imaginative retellings of a single, very simple story involving a man getting on a bus; the original French has been masterfully translated into English by Barbara Wright as <title level="m">Exercises of Style</title> (versions in other languages also exist, notably Umberto Eco's Italian <title level="m">Esercizi di stile</title>). More linguistically advanced students may be inspired by Ulrich Erckenbrecht's <title level="m">Shakespeare Sechsundsechsig: Variationen über ein Sonett</title>, which comprises a vast number of versions in German of Shakespeare's Sonnet 66. (The first, 1996 edition brought together an already astonishing eighty-eight diverse readings of the sonnet; this was expanded five years later to include forty-four additional translations, with another twenty-two provided in the 2004 supplement, for a grand total of 154.) And <title level="m">A travers le Jabberwocky de Lewis Carroll</title>, published in 1997 by Bernard Cerquiglini, contains more than half a dozen French translations of that renowned nonsense poem. A more recent volume is my <title level="m">Worlding Sei Shônagon: The <emph>Pillow Book</emph> in Translation</title>, which explores the translation history of this greatly beloved Japanese classic, originally authored a millennium ago. I have pulled together almost 50 different readings in sixteen languages of the opening passage, which strikingly describes the author's aesthetic response to the four seasons. Each multilingual version also, by necessity, reflects the translator's own idiosyncratic reading based in a given socio-cultural and historical location (they originally appeared from 1875 to the present day), and this book thus serves as a uniquely valuable tool for pedagogical use.</p>
<p>Of course, there is nothing to prevent teachers and, especially, students from crafting their own, equally creative versions, and indeed such a hands-on exercise can be supremely educational. I will later in this article detail various ways to use Sei Shônagon's text in the classroom. However, to take first the Japanese <foreign>haiku</foreign> as an example, it is helpful for students to think about what it means for a new genre to enter the literary system, how it can affect existing aesthetic norms and open up the receiving culture's possibilities of literary expression. Here is the poem by Bashô mentioned above, for example, with an English gloss supplied on the right:
            
         <quote>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>furuike ya |				old-pond <emph>ya</emph>
<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">
               "Ya" is what is known as a <foreign>kireji</foreign>, or "cutting word," a common feature in traditional Japanese poetry. It is discussed further below.
            </note>
</l>
<l>kawazu tobikomu |			frog jump-in</l>
<l>mizu no oto	|			water's sound</l>
</lg>
</quote>
            
            This word-for-word version calls attention to some fundamental differences between English and Japanese. Such common source-language (SL) features as the lack of either definite or indefinite articles or the absence of verbal person markers, not to mention the extreme brevity, run contrary to common target-language (TL) expectations. European literary conventions such as traditional poetic diction are violated by the extremely simple vocabulary and images found in this style of Japanese poetry, which also eschews rhyme and other elements that were long deemed quite indispensable in the West—indeed, the lack of stressed and unstressed syllables in Japanese means that it is virtually impossible to write in meter in that language—in favor of a fixed 5/7/5 syllable count. It should come as no surprise that when these lines were first "discovered" by the West in the mid-nineteenth century,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">Japan followed a self-imposed seclusion policy for over two centuries, broken only in 1853 when the Americans used a demonstration of superior arms to force an opening of trade.</note> it was difficult for them even to be read as poetry—in fact, one well-known critic of the day sniffed that Japanese verses "suggest rather than state a thought or fancy, and often require a world of explanation to be intelligible. They are titles of unwritten poems, rather than themselves poems" (Dickins 309). If we remind students that Bashô's Western contemporaries include Donne and Milton, it becomes clear to them how significantly even contemporaneous literary systems can diverge.</p>
<p>The translator is faced with a choice between reproduction of the native SL form, which might well appear utterly non-aesthetic to the uninitiated, or substitution of a TL form deemed somehow "equivalent."<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">
               This essay does not allow space to fully elucidate equivalence, which constitutes a very thorny concept in current translation theory. For discussions of this term, see, <foreign>inter alia</foreign>, Catford 1965; Nida and Taber 1969 (Nida's distinction between "dynamic" and "formal" equivalence has been very influential in translation theory); Steiner 1975, Bassnett-McGuire 1980, or Hermans 1985.
         </note> As Sato shows, numerous translators have, over the century and a half since Japanese literature has been known to Europeans, attempted to remake these three very foreign lines into the sort of poem that could be readily recognized and enjoyed as such by their Western readerships. Translators act as tour guides to new linguistic and literary territory, and are responsible for mediating the culture of those regions on behalf of their readers. Rather than shocking the reader with incongruous elements, an alternative strategy is to adapt the SL text to fit seamlessly into the TL culture, such as by extending the short Japanese lines just a little and amending them into some semblance of traditional English poetic meter. For instance, Bashô's famous <foreign>haiku</foreign> could be rendered as follows:
            <quote>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>O mossy shaded pond,</l>
<l>Greet now this nimble frog,</l>
<l>Who makes thy surface sing.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4">
               The three Bashô versions provided here are my own translations.
         </note>
</l>
</lg>
</quote>
            
         Another option would be to retain the original's lexical and grammatical simplicity, but introduce end rhyme with a view to marking the lines as verse. For example:
            <quote>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>A frog</l>
<l>in a pond</l>
<l>in a flash...</l>
<l>A frog</l>
<l>in a pond</l>
<l>with a splash!</l>
</lg>
</quote>            
         
         These two "domestications"—as opposed to "foreignizations" (these terms were popularized by translation theorist Lawrence Venuti in <title level="m">The Scandals of Translation</title>)—of the source text could not be more strikingly different. The first constitutes a self-conscious attempt to flesh out the Japanese poem, explaining the understated images by inserting adjectives and connecting phrases, with a view to rendering it more "English." It attempts to give the poem an archaic flavor through the use of old-fashioned vocabulary, with a nod to the fact that the original dates from over 300 years ago. In contrast, the second version strictly retains the simplicity of image via contemporary language. By choosing here to acknowledge the humor present throughout Bashô's oeuvre (bear in mind that his pen-name means literally "banana plant"), however, I end up on some level misrepresenting the contemplative nature of this particular poem. In English, such repetition coupled with the pared-down elements of these lines is more typical of the norms applied to children's literature, and so the poet is inadvertently turned into a sort of Japanese Dr. Seuss. A cautious and ethical translator may be at least momentarily stymied as to how the diametrically opposed poetic conventions of the SL and the TL should be reconciled.</p>
<p>Over time, however, and with enough exposure, <foreign>haiku</foreign> have become "privileged bearers of the aesthetic function" (Mukařovsky 2) in English as well as Japanese. Translation has always served to transform the receiving culture, to break traditional aesthetic molds by introducing new elements. Imagism, for example, was greatly influenced by the Western reception of Japanese <foreign>haiku</foreign>, with Ezra Pound's "In a Station of the Metro" opening up new poetic possibilities for Anglophone poets. In this way, alternative readings that would once have been considered radically avant-garde in terms of both linguistic and artistic conventions are gradually made available. For example, we could today have something along these lines:
            <quote>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>An age-old pond</l>
<l>frog up-down-</l>
<l>into</l>
<l>...ah!</l>
</lg>
</quote>
         Among other things, here I have reproduced the original's snapshot-like image and adapted the all-important syllable breakdown to a more obvious countdown of 4/3/2/1. The <foreign>ya</foreign> of the original, whose function is difficult to define but which can indicate a sort of pause or closure, becomes in this translation an expression of almost word-less satisfaction as the amphibian breaks the water's surface. Considered together, such utterly different renditions of a single <foreign>haiku</foreign> reveal some of the many possible responses to a given literary text and give students the implicit permission to craft their own adaptive interpretations.</p>
<p>Another, much earlier and distinctive work of world literature, also from Japan, that can offer additional layers of complexity and pedagogical possibilities is the prose masterpiece <title level="m">Makura no Sôshi</title> or <title level="m">Pillow Book</title>, originally composed in the late-tenth or early-eleventh century by a woman known today as Sei Shônagon. This sophisticated text (composed at roughly the same period as the Anglo-Saxon classic <title level="m">Beowulf</title>) remains very popular at home and abroad and has been translated countless times into languages ranging from Bulgarian and Catalan, through English, French and German, to Spanish and Turkish. Far from exhausting the wealth of meaning and stylistic nuance to be found in the source text, these versions helpfully suggest the creative inexhaustibility of this or any literary text and the enticing ability of the act of translation to capitalize on such potential. The highly personal nature of its quirky format, striking mix of colloquial and more formal styles, and ever-shifting perspective has led Japanese scholars such as Machiko Midorikawa to argue quite rightly that "an encounter with [this text] forces us to rethink from scratch our understanding of literary form and genre" (Midorikawa 143). Sei Shônagon's overall style will strike many of today's readers as modern, even post-modern—Midorikawa goes so far as to suggest that the <title level="m">Pillow Book</title> should be considered a sort of "Heian-period blog" (158). Whether described as a <foreign>zuihitsu</foreign> (miscellany), <foreign>nikki</foreign> (diary) or some sort of proto-blog, the text is in any case primarily a mixture of three types of passages: approximately 60 diary-like entries, 80 or 90 anecdotes or descriptions of striking scenes, and some 170 lists—of such things as "Insects" and "Wind instruments," or "Splendid things," "Infuriating things," and "Things that make you feel nostalgic."</p>
<p>As a lady-in-waiting serving one of the emperor's two consorts,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5">Serving the other empress at this time was Murasaki Shikibu, author of the great <title level="m">Genji Monogatari</title> (<title level="m">Tale of Genji</title>).
            </note> Sei Shônagon enjoyed a unique vantage point from which to report on life at the medieval court, and to reveal its worldview. A case in point is the opening passage, in which the author lyrically describes what she finds most attractive about each season and which I present in some four dozen different versions. The apparent simplicity of this and the over 300 subsequent passages that follow in Sei Shônagon's original text belies a profound sensitivity to the world, both natural<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="6">The sensitivity to nature that is central to Japanese aesthetics provides a neat complement to similar themes in the Romantic lyrical tradition.
            </note> and social, a vivid attention to detail, and an ability to cut directly to the heart of things. Its great subtlety poses unique problems and demands a range of interpretations and approaches, and a careful exploration of how it has been translated thus undermines any naïve belief in a straightforward transfer of meaning from one language to another, one culture to another. By guiding students through the often convoluted trajectory through which a once wholly foreign literary work becomes domesticated—or resists domestication—we can help them grasp something of the various historical, ideological, or other forces that ineluctably shape our experience of literature.</p>
<p>For example, let us look closely at the very first few words of the <title level="m">Pillow Book</title>, which in the original Japanese are <foreign>haru wa akebono</foreign>. <foreign>Haru</foreign> means "spring" and <foreign>akebono</foreign> means "dawn"; <foreign>wa</foreign> is a grammatical particle that functions to indicate that whatever comes immediately before it is the topic of the phrase. Classical Japanese, even more than the modern language, is often elliptical and this line is no exception—the exact relationship between spring and dawn is left open to our interpretation. For the other three seasons, as well, we read: "summer <foreign>wa</foreign> night [. . .] autumn <foreign>wa</foreign> evening [. . .] winter <foreign>wa</foreign> early morning." Much as readers have unconsciously probably always done silently in their heads, translators tend to supply an explicit verbal complement for these phrases, presumably with the intention of improving comprehension and readability. They have generally felt the need to be more explicit about the relationship between the season and the time of day: in what is likely the best-known English-language version of the <title level="m">Pillow Book</title>, by Ivan Morris, for instance, the three initial words of Classical Japanese morph into "In Spring, it is the dawn that is most beautiful" (qtd. in Henitiuk, <title level="m">Worlding</title> 147). Translators have also rarely resisted the impulse to narrate in the first person, despite the fact that a characteristic feature of Japanese in both its pre-modern and modern forms is the general avoidance of personal pronouns. Accordingly, we also see: "In spring, [. . .] I love to watch the dawn" (Henitiuk, <title level="m">Worlding</title> 61); "What charms me; in spring it is dawn [. . .] " (66); or "In spring I commend the hour before daybreak" (118). Some translators have opted to use square brackets to make clear the fact that they are supplying information that does not explicitly appear in the Japanese, resulting in the unfortunately clumsy: "Through the seasons. [It is interesting to observe] how in spring [. . .]" (76) or "In spring, [it is] the dawn [that I prefer]" (109). Others have taken very different tacks: "In Spring, at dawn [. . .]. How lovely!" (103) and "Spring is best tasted at dawn" (133), for example, or the minimalist (but does this necessarily make it more "accurate"?) "Springtime – sunrise" (182). One modern Japanese version even offers the tongue-in-cheek teenage-speak of "Spring is, like, OMIGOD, dawn!!!" (35).</p>
<p>What we are dealing with here is a piece of women's writing, and the fact that the majority of translators have been men offers a prime opportunity to introduce the important issue of gender into classroom discussion. It is instructive to ask our students what they make of the fact that, for several decades, English readers knew this highly personal text solely through Arthur Waley's voice and then Ivan Morris'. There is nothing inherently wrong with a male translator rendering a woman's text, of course, but given that Waley was in various ways dismissive about the text and its overall literary worth, it should nonetheless give us pause. His 1928 version comprises snippets from the <title level="m">Pillow Book</title> interspersed within his own extensive commentary about its socio-cultural setting. Waley famously comments in his introduction that "[o]missions have been made only where the original was dull, unintelligible, repetitive, or so packed with allusion that it required an impracticable amount of commentary" (qtd. in Henitiuk, <title level="m">Worlding</title> 97), but in fact offers his readers only about one fourth of what Sei Shônagon actually wrote. Morris, for his part, faithfully translates the complete text, complete with extensive footnotes that treat it with the scholarly respect one would expect in a book published by Columbia University Press. Nonetheless, he is elsewhere on record calling another woman-authored Classical Japanese text, which movingly deals with the breakdown of a marriage, "one long wail of jealousy by a woman in whom the emotion has reached hysterical proportions" (Morris, <title level="m">World</title> 255). His introduction to the <title level="m">Pillow Book</title> contains the following reference to the fact that its author on several occasions recounts enthusiastically testing her mettle against others: "Her attitude to men, even to those of a somewhat higher class than hers, was competitive to the point of overt hostility" (xiv). Sei Shônagon's exchanges with colleagues (both male and female, as it happens) are imbued less with "hostility" than an infectious delight in intellectual challenge, and her "competitors" appear to derive almost as much enjoyment from her besting them as she does (see McKinney 66–69). While admittedly our author can be sharp and even caustic at times, it is inaccurate to characterize her as any sort of rabidly anti-male feminist.</p>
<p>The most recent English translation, for the trade publisher Penguin, has been done by Meredith McKinney, whose approach is colored by a very different attitude. Her project implicitly aims to redress what this translator sees as a prior tendency, intentional or otherwise, to misrepresent not only the women's world at the heart of Japan's Heian court but also the lively voice of one who is arguably its single most personable author. Again, a close examination of the introduction, which opens as follows, is revealing in terms of ideology and the impact it may have: 
         <quote>A thousand years ago [. . .] a lady at the imperial court of Japan settled herself in front of a precious bundle of paper and began to write [an] extraordinary work [. . .]. In it she wrote about her world, in a voice so vividly alive that we find ourselves in the presence of a woman we recognize as we would a friend. (ix)</quote>
            While admittedly McKinney's idealistic approach may be charged with being as inaccurate as Morris', it should come as no surprise that an early twenty-first-century woman translator would want to highlight a strong, attractive female presence in world literary history. Looking back through what is now well over a hundred years of Western readings of the <title level="m">Pillow Book</title>, it becomes evident that gender has been a prime focus in virtually all previous versions as well, with translator prefaces and other commentary more often than not revealing various degrees of misogyny, and so some sort of corrective is nonetheless welcome.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="7">For a detailed examination of translator ideology in relation to gender, as it pertains directly to this text, see Henitiuk, <title level="a">Prefacing Gender: Framing Sei Shônagon for a Western Audience, 1875-2006</title> (2011). Although this brief article does not have space to discuss gender and language in any detail, it is certainly worth pointing out to students that whereas Heian Japanese aristocratic men were educated to write in Chinese, their female counterparts wrote exclusively in the vernacular language. In the Romanticism context, this fact may well allow for some interesting discussion related to Wordsworth's privileging of "the very language of men" in the 1802 Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>.
            </note>
</p>
<p>The rare chance to have immediately to hand such a wealth of translations of a single literary text allows us valuable exposure to evolving attitudes as well as shifting fashions in literary reception, and perhaps above all the inherently non-transparent nature of the translation process. These forty-eight Western renditions of Sei Shônagon's <foreign>haru wa akebono</foreign> passage reveal the astounding fertility of a work that continues to attract readers around the globe and to inspire such a flowering of creativity. They should also increase our students' critical awareness of both linguistic and cultural mediation and foster the ability to challenge reading practices that may serve merely to colonize the cultural production of other worlds and traditions. In exploring them in detail, we can help our students become more sensitized to the power relations involved whenever anyone, even with the best of intentions, steps forward to speak for and in the name of the other. The great diversity of interpretations is certain at the very least to debunk naïve assumptions of unproblematic equivalence.</p>
<p>Presenting a single text in such linguistic variety underscores the vital fact that all reading masks the SL text while ostensibly revealing it. And the fact that no autograph manuscript of this text is extant, in other words that the <title level="m">Pillow Book</title> has no ultimate, authoritative source, should destabilize an all-too-common tendency to fetishize the original at the expense of its readings and thus open up interpretive possibilities. Prompted by the brief commentary on translation differences found on the page facing each version in <title level="m">Worlding Sei Shônagon</title>, students can go on to make their own discoveries. To set the stage for or, perhaps more constructively, build upon the in-classroom exercise of writing their own <foreign>zuihitsu</foreign> on Sei Shônagon's model (similarly to the <foreign>haiku</foreign> exercise described above), students may be assigned specific existing interpretations for analysis, comparison, or even (back-)translation. Those with a particular language interest can be encouraged to focus on versions in that language, comparing and contrasting the strategies employed and solutions found. An examination taking the chronology of all of the translations included into account will allow speculation about the rhythm by which a foreign text makes its appearance (or, in cases where there have been more than one translation into a given language, repeated appearances) in different linguistic communities, as well as discussion about the context in which it is received (i.e. how the title, series, or publishing format can and does affect reader response). The sample book covers provided in Appendix II of <title level="m">Worlding Sei Shonagon</title> (Henitiuk 2012) reveal a range of marketing choices, which will prompt discussion about how the packaging of a book can set up very distinct expectations as to its content. And a careful look at adaptations or imitations inspired by any text allows even further exploration of possible readings; in the case of Sei Shônagon's <title level="m">Pillow Book</title>, there is a vast variety of material to choose from, including novels, short stories, poems, films, and music (see Henitiuk, "Easyfree").<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn8" n="8">For more detail, see my article <title level="a">'Easyfree translation?'</title> in <title level="j">Translation Studies</title>.
            </note>
</p>
<p>There are immense gains for students guided with care through a selection of versions of a single work of literature, and faculty seeking innovative and meaningful ways to engage with issues of authenticity, agency, as well as the relation between self and other will do well to use comparative translation in the classroom. An exploration of variant interpretations allows insightful glimpses into the complex nature of any literary text, and helps to ensure that students are able to read critically and productively. It reveals the multiple "afterlives" (Benjamin) that a given work of literature may enjoy in different times and places, and to different readers, and suggests the profound implications this has for reading. Approaching the teaching of translated texts in this way will effectively complicate our students' understanding of authorship, stimulate classroom discussion, and foreground the centrality of translational concepts to every act of reading literary works, Romantic or otherwise.</p>

<epigraph>
<p rend="noCount">Still it seems to me that translation from one language into another [. . .] is like looking at Flemish tapestries on the wrong side; for though the figures are visible, they are full of threads that make them indistinct, and they do not show with the smoothness and brightness of the right side. —Cervantes, <title level="m">Don Quixote</title>, Ch. 62</p>
</epigraph>
<epigraph>
<p rend="noCount">The semantic layers of double-voiced words interweave "living dialogic threads" in the translated text to create an ambience of open-endedness. —Amith and Malshe, “Translation and Bakhtin’s ‘Metalinguistics’” (120)</p>
</epigraph>
<p>The translator’s mediatory interactions with both a source text and the target audience’s expectations bring together cultural, linguistic, and narrative threads to create a dynamic conversation. This “dialogic triangulation” (Amith and Malshe 116) simultaneously acknowledges and challenges cultural exchange, national identity and the social, moral, and ethical complexities of encountering alternative ideologies. Translation takes on a practical as well as ideological role in this sense, and it is particularly relevant to nineteenth-century literature and culture, in a time when the idea of translation itself changed dramatically, and when translation was instrumental in bringing Continental philosophies into the centre of British intellectual constructs.  The act of translation became controversial, as new understandings of how it operated in relation to cultural production focalised the tensions of faithfulness: to original authors and cultures; to the target culture; or to the translator's own agenda, which often existed somewhere between the two. When examining Victorian literature as cultural history, it is crucial to equip students to take into consideration the impact of translation upon what they are reading: what texts have been made accessible to the author through translation, as well as what foreign ideas are being translated by the author through his or her text.</p>
<p>It has been well-established in contemporary translation theory that the act of translation is not derivative, but a legitimate act of creation in its own right, separate from the original text but in response to it. Yet because of the translator's "illusion of transparency" (Venuti, <title level="m">Invisibility</title> 1), the integral role of translation in cultural and cross-cultural production has been understated. Further work needs to be done through literary studies to establish the implications translation has for the transmission of meaning beyond translators working between two national languages. This chapter will provide a theoretical and historical context for the relevance of contemporary translation theory in examining literature of the long nineteenth century, as well as offering practical means for bringing translation theory into the centre of conversation in the graduate Victorian Studies classroom. This move is timely given the impetus toward interdisciplinarity across the academy, as well as the growing acknowledgement of the importance of multilingual and cross-cultural understandings within the global community.</p>
<p>The role of translation in nineteenth-century literature can be examined in three key ways: the significance of literal translations within the British sphere; the practical and ideological opportunities made available to those able to translate, especially female translators; and broader, more metaphorical forms of translation that furthered the production of alternative cultural threads, such as travel writing, editing, and reviewing. In the latter forms, the authors appropriate translational techniques in their writing, such as displacing their accountability for their text onto an assumed original author/thinker. There is a self-conscious appreciation of the plurality of voices that exist within a given text, with the translator carefully selecting and arranging "pre-existing cultural materials [. . .] in order of priority, and rewrit[ing] (or elaborat[ing]) according to specific values" (Venuti, <title level="m">Scandals</title> 43). I have argued elsewhere that this process of manipulating and rewriting pre-existing cultural materials is facilitated as much by so-called original authors as by translators (Scholl, <title level="m">Translation</title> 2), opening up the possibility for fictional literary texts to be read as a form of intersemiotic translation—similar to translating religious ideas into visual art, or translation between genres, such as Blake's politics being translated into poetry. By enabling ideas of translation in this more metaphorical sense, as well as the concept of cultural translation, students are led more readily to identify and tease apart the threads of the different voices in the texts: threads of Continental philosophy; British scientific thought; and the complexities of identity created by external or foreign experiences derived from the colonies, the Americas, and the Orient. The understanding of the Victorian culture of the mind is therefore enriched through examining the ways in which Britain was influenced from without at a time when British imperialism seemed an unpenetrable global force.</p>
<p>Taking a translational approach to literary fiction potentially redefines literary studies, focalising its innate interdisciplinarity and significance as cultural history. Through reading novels alongside philosophical and scientific texts, the dynamic interplay between British and European ideas is revealed in the wake of the unprecedented breakdown of national borders after the Napoleonic Wars that led to a flourish of cultural exchange across national boundaries, challenging previous notions of identity, progress,and civilisation. In <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, when Raymond Williams defended Jane Austen's apparent neglect of major historical events by claiming that there are many streams of history and that she provided that of the landed gentry (166), he played a significant role in bringing about the cultural turn in literary studies and the importance of cultural and historical contexts in analysing texts. The application of translation theory takes this contextualisation further by recognising the polyphony of international cultural voices within the text, beyond the heterogeneity of the target culture. Translation thus plays a crucial role in the development of nineteenth-century intellectual culture as a hybrid, polycultural conversation. </p>

<p>My understanding of translation is heavily influenced by Bakhtinian notions of utterance and dialogism. Like Bakhtin's utterance, I see translation as a response to the original text, in that it "refutes, affirms, supplements, and relies on [earlier utterances/texts], presupposes them to be known, and somehow takes them into account" (91). The "addressivity" of utterance, that is, its "quality of being directed to someone" (95), resonates with translation, and even more pertinently, as Cheyne and Tarulli observe, "Our utterances are thereby inhabited by the voices of others. An utterance, however, not only reaches backwards to preceding utterances in the chain of speech communion, but also speaks to future possible utterances" (12). Cheyne and Tarulli position the utterance in a mediatory role, between past and future, just as the translator is positioned between the source and target texts. The translator enters into a dialogue with the past, answering the original author, but in a way that is consciously speaking to the future: the readers of the translation.</p>
<p>	The addressivity of utterance or translation, and the simultaneous dialogue with past and present, is particularly useful in the context of Victorian intellectualism when the expectations of translation were changing. Previously the emphasis had been on classical languages, such as Greek and Latin, yet with the growing interest in German and French schools of thought, translation became a vehicle for bringing Continental ideas into Britain. While the focus had been on Latin and Greek, languages predominantly contained within educational and religious institutions, the act of translation had been seen as an intellectual practice for the improvement of language skills and a purely receptive act: receiving understanding from the original, for one's own intellectual benefit. With the move toward both acknowledging the original author and the translator's audience, as well as the new focus on translating living languages, the power relations of translation changed. Whereas a scholar translating Tacitus could not literally speak to the Roman scribe, George Eliot translating Strauss's <title level="m">Life of Jesus</title> (1846) could actually correspond with him, and receive his response to her translation. The act became an actual dialogue, "upset[ting] traditional assumptions about the hierarchy between primary and secondary forms of writing, about writing and reading a text, and about the production and reception of literature" (Stark 29). Within the target audience, there was an assumption that many of them would be able to read the original, and that they would be able to access variant translations. The idea of accuracy became more tied to meaning or message than to words, opening up the possibility to see a translation as a form of literary criticism—the translator's interpretation of the original work. This kind of literary criticism takes into account close reading—word choice, metaphors, similar idioms across cultures, and the dynamics of cultural and historical understanding. Students can begin to recognise the connections between literary criticism and translation through this historical perspective of Victorian translational activities.</p>
<p>The derivativity of translation was also being challenged, along with the emphasis on word-for-word translation, which was closely related to biblical translation and the importance of not altering the word of God. Matthew Arnold played a significant role in the repositioning of translation, arguing that "[t]he language of the Bible, then, is literary, not scientific language; language <emph>thrown out</emph> at an object of consciousness not fully grasped, which inspired emotion" (<title level="m">Literature and Dogma</title> 30). Later he would write that it is "the language of poetry and emotion, <emph>approximate</emph> language thrown out, as it were, at certain great objects which the human mind augurs and feels after, and thrown out by men very liable, many of them, to delusion and error" (<title level="m">God and the Bible</title> 6). For Arnold, the Bible is no longer reified as an immoveable, unalterable sacred text, but is opened up to literary criticism as a dynamic work of poetry. This nexus between religion, philosophy, literature, science and translation speaks to the very centre of the cultural crisis of Victorian Britain; yet through ethical trauma and the conversation that took place between different cultural fragments, intellectual progress was made: "It is from differences in understanding that dialogue and thought are productive; moreover, productivity is not necessarily measured by consensus [. . .]. For Bakhtin, self—other differences, rather than impeding communication, motivate and generate dialogue" (Cheyne and Tarulli 14). I contend that this dialogue was made possible in the nineteenth century through translation.</p>
<p>	Translation theory, influenced by Bakhtin's utterance, provides a tangible point of correspondence in criticism. From a student perspective, literary theory can seem inaccessible and even irrelevant to the so-called real world. Bakhtin himself spoke about the abstraction of theory as a deliberate means for theoreticians to remain in safe intellectual spaces, in which they did not have to consider real-world implications: 
            <quote>In practice, [Bakhtin] believed, [theoretisms] usually replace real engagement with the application of a theory [. . .]. For Bakhtin, such an approach betrays cowardice. It reflects a desire to avoid psychological and intellectual risk. It is too painful to rethink one's convictions, and doing so may put one at odds with those with whom one wants to associate. (Morson 351)</quote>
            For the twenty-first-century student, there is an evident dissatisfaction with those very points that Bakhtin termed cowardice. The immediacy of the culture of the age, with technological advancement and global financial crises, leaves students with a hunger to know how an area of study is directly relevant to them. This has been an increasing challenge in the Literary Studies classroom, with literature in many cases being relegated to entertainment, or a luxury intellectual item for those with the financial and time capacity to study an area that does not guarantee direct employment in a specific profession. What <emph>does</emph> attract students to the literary classroom is the ability to gain a sense of their identity within the global context, both geographically and in terms of the history of humanity. Bakhtin's approach to teaching literature and even more so, translation theory create this capacity. Gary Saul Morson takes up the idea of cultural translation in his classroom:
         <quote>First, <emph>translation</emph>: Given the essential moral issues the character faces, what would be the equivalent situation today? One wants to avoid comments like: if only Russia had had more enlightened divorce laws, Anna Karenina's fate would have been different. Given her character and the choices she makes, can we imagine situations today in which those character traits have an important effect, and analogous choices raise important psychological and moral problems? (355)</quote>
        This kind of equivalency may seem to broach too close to a type of word-for-word translation—cultural equivalencies are just as tenuous as linguistic ones. This example is also complicated in that it refers to a text that has been linguistically translated from Russian to English. Yet it is a matter of seeking out similarities and differences across time and culture, seeing possible connections, as well as where the cultures depart from each other. The point of identification comes by reflecting upon both self and other, departing, as the translator does, from both the source culture and the target culture, being alienated from both in order to understand both more objectively. It is in this space of departure that the dialogue between cultures begins: "Only if such works provided something that departs from—or as Bakhtin liked to say, 'exceeds'—already known truths would they be worth the effort" (Morson 352).</p>
<p>The comparative approach to nineteenth-century Russian literature suggested by Morson is necessary in teaching students at the undergraduate level to recognise cultural and historical contexts—to move them away from ideas of time and space transcendence. At the graduate level, however, once the grounding in cultural and historical materiality has been firmly established, the students should be capable of moving toward more complex ideas of cultural malleability: the cultural and historical sureties they have learned need to be broken down, as they explore the various influences on cultural identity at any given time. It would be expected that students entering graduate nineteenth-century literary studies would have a solid general understanding of the connections and deviations between their contemporary society and Victorian England. The application of translation studies will refine both their comprehension of literary criticism and literary influence, as well as their historical grounding in the streams of culture that entered Britain at that time, for example, the connections between political revolutions and the revival of Romanticism and European philosophy. As a further connection, they will be able to identify how those streams have evolved in terms of current international relations, and political and sociocultural relations. These real-life applications allow students to delve more deeply within theoretical structures, but also firmly establish the theory within the pragmatic world around them. To take a translational approach to nineteenth-century culture, students should read translations (in a broad definition), works about translation, and literary fiction in order to examine how the Victorian culture of the mind was being translated and created by the written word. Students should consider the perceived cultural value of translation as an activity, as well as specific key translations that impacted British culture: what texts were translated and why. The translator's agenda is also entered into, and by looking at "original" works of the translators—by which I mean published works not described as translations of other authors—students can begin to see the ways in which the role of translation filters through other literary activities that espouse and respond to translated messages.</p>

<head>Female Translators</head>
<epigraph>
<p rend="noCount">Translation is like a woman. If it is beautiful, it is not faithful. If it is faithful, it is most certainly not beautiful.						—Proverb, qtd. in <title level="m">Plato's Protagoras</title> (113)</p>
</epigraph>
<p>My approach to translation and literary culture has focused primarily on the position of female translators, and the professional and intellectual pathways that translation opened up for them in the nineteenth century. While it is crucial that students are exposed more widely to translation theory than feminist translation studies, the position of women in relation to the translated text is invaluable in terms of understanding the development of theories of translation (including ideas of derivativity), as well as the history of translational activities that had such an integral impact on nineteenth-century Britain. Alongside Lawrence Venuti's seminal texts <title level="m">The Translator's Invisibility</title> (1995) and <title level="m">The Scandals of Translation</title> (1998), Sherry Simon's <title level="m">Gender in Translation</title> (1996) provides a history of the way women have related to translational activities specifically within Judeo-Christian Western culture, positioning it as a key female intellectual activity. This premise is central to my approach to Victorian intellectualism, as in a very real sense women were able to use their skills as translators to move into the professional literary world in a radical way. These professions often moved from translation to editing and reviewing, activities that have strong resonances with the act of translation itself in the way they respond to and shape specific discrete texts.</p>
<p>Simon addresses the way in which the Judeo-Christian tradition links women to the act of translation as both inferior and derivative: "Translators and women have historically been the weaker figures in their respective hierarchies: translators are handmaidens to authors, women inferior to men" (1). This perspective provides a useful starting point for examining the role of the translator. Through then comparing the idea of translation as derivative to the theories of Venuti, as well as Susan Bassnett and André Lefevere, the students can begin to see that the "myth" of translation's subservience "traditionally made room for women writers to take on a role that inadvertently gives them a public voice" (Scholl, <title level="m">Translation</title> 4). Students are led via this comparison to see that "translation is not just linguistic transmission, but an ambiguous, problematic and sometimes acrimonious cultural exchange," in which the original author's voice is heard through the voice of the translator (3). The possibilities for rewriting, and literary and philosophical manipulation of the text are then opened up within the nineteenth-century context. Within the graduate classroom, there would be an assumption that the students are aware of the importance of the Woman Question in the Victorian era in general; the idea of female translators entering into intellectual conversations through translational activities broadens the scope of influence for professional women, but also for translation itself: "That a nineteenth-century woman should enter into such a role seems radical enough; in translating a celebrated male philosopher, for example, she enters into an intimate discourse with him, often challenging and critiquing the ideas presented, so they become nuanced by her translation" (3). This idea of translation as mediated dialogue and an exchange of ideas connects closely with Bakhtinian notions of utterance, and the productivity of different voices speaking to and against each other. The notion of productivity precludes that of derivativity, thus translation is seen as expanding and creating new space, rather than rehashing the old in another tongue.</p>
<p>In order to help students connect ideas of utterance and translation theory beyond the narrow concept of linguistic translation, and apply them to areas such as editing, reviewing, and literary criticism, there are four key pieces by George Eliot: <title level="a">Translations and Translators</title> (<title level="j">Leader</title>, 20 October 1855); <title level="a">The Morality of <emph>Wilhelm Meister</emph>
</title> (<title level="j">Leader</title>, 21 July 1855); <title level="a">German Wit: Heinrich Heine</title> (<title level="j">Westminster Review</title>, January 1856); and her review of Froude's <title level="m">The Nemesis of Faith</title> (<title level="j">Coventry Herald and Observer</title>, 16 March 1849). I have already mentioned Eliot as the translator of Strauss's <title level="m">Life of Jesus</title>, a work that opened up the floodgates for radical European philosophies to enter British culture. Eliot was very aware of the power she wielded as Strauss's translator, and I have discussed elsewhere the dynamic literal correspondence she had with the original author, as well as her response to the critical reception of her work.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">
                     Susanne Stark cites an anonymous source claiming that "Eliot remained faithful to the German original 'word for word, thought for thought, and sentence for sentence'" in translating Strauss (46). However, it is evident through Eliot's correspondence that she was aware of, and even relished, her power to manipulate and rewrite the text. She wrote to Sara Hennell regarding Wicksteed's review of her translation, "Is it not droll that Wicksteed should have chosen one of my interpolations or rather paraphrases to dilate on? The expression "granite," applied to the sayings of Jesus is nowhere used in Strauss, but is an impudent addition of mine to eke out his metaphor." (15 Nov 1846). See Scholl, <title level="m">Translation</title> (59).
            </note> Eliot is a crucial figure for students to examine because she was so critically alert to the connections between translation, editing, the tensions between author and translator, and cultural production. Indeed, a course could feasibly be designed around George Eliot and translation that would speak effectively to the understanding of Victorian intellectual culture. </p>
<p>
<title level="a">Translations and Translators</title> is a useful place to begin examining Eliot in this context, providing a mid-Victorian understanding of the values, workings, and purpose of translation. Susanne Stark suggests Eliot "shied away from grappling with the subject [of translation] in any depth" (47), yet I would argue that even beyond the explicit example of this particular essay, Eliot's preoccupation with translation infuses all her literary activities—from her editing, reviewing, and journalism to her fiction-writing. <title level="a">Translations and Translators</title> reveals her very powerful understanding of the significance of translation, as well as the provocative debates that were taking place around its role in intellectual progress. Eliot begins her essay with allusions to the religious implications of the changing ideas of translation, and goes on to discuss the possibilities and limitations for translation, as well as the skills translators require in order to succeed in their craft. Significantly, Eliot elevates translation and suggests the possibility of the translation exceeding the original, which lends itself to Bakhtin's idea of productivity: 
           <quote>It is true the Germans think a little too highly of their translations, and especially are under the illusion, encouraged by some silly English people, that Shakespeare according to Schlegel is better than Shakespeare himself—not simply better to a German as being easier for him to understand, but absolutely better poetry [. . .].Sometimes the German is as good as the English—the same music played on another but as good instrument. But more frequently the German is a feeble echo, and here and there it breaks down in a supremely fine passage. (341)</quote>
         As a translator herself, Eliot takes this opportunity to critique the quality of Schlegel's work; yet she also addresses the cultural positioning of translation: in England it is seen as a derivative task, possible to anyone who can operate within the foreign language, whereas in Germany it is "more often undertaken by men of genius" (341). Moreover, she shows her consciousness that cultural exchange takes place through translation, although often with flawed understanding. As she elucidates the flaws in Schlegel's translation, she implies that Shakespeare according to Schlegel is a text separate from Shakespeare himself. The idea the Germans get of Shakespeare in their tongue is not the same Shakespeare that the English have. </p>
<p>
<title level="a">The Morality of <emph>Wilhelm Meister</emph>
</title> and <title level="a">German Wit: Heinrich Heine</title> are natural progressions from Eliot's essay on translation. They both address the role of translation in terms of cultural impact, explicitly confronting the widespread British fear of a German cultural and philosophical invasion. They can also be read in conjunction with Eliot's <title level="a">The Natural History of German Life</title> (<title level="j">Westminster Review</title>, July 1856), which goes further, introducing an approach to translation that resonates with what would become known more specifically in the late twentieth century as cultural translation. Through looking at cultural and historical connotations of words, Eliot begins to connect translation to the understanding of other living cultures, instead of a theoretically based intellectual activity such as translating ancient texts written in dead languages. Translation takes on a pragmatic and immediate role in international relations. By introducing students to the cultural theory of Mary Louise Pratt, particularly in regard to travel writing, which I address in the next section, they will be able to connect Eliot's approach more closely to contemporary criticism.</p>
<p>Eliot's review of Froude's <title level="m">The Nemesis of Faith</title> (1849) has a clear translational approach. In order to observe the ways in which Eliot's voice protrudes through, even in the extended quotations she provides from Froude's text, students should read this review alongside Eliot's <title level="a">Evangelical Teaching: Dr. Cumming</title> (<title level="j">Westminster Review</title>, October 1855), which espouses a similar message to that which she attributes to Froude. Discussions around the ways in which Eliot's voice mediates Froude's in the review can be positioned within the discourse of translation: blurring the lines of authorship; rewriting the text for a new audience; and the translator affecting to step back from the translation, hiding behind the veil of the original author. Although she states that she cites extensively from Froude in order to allow her readers "to assess Froude for themselves" (266), like the translator she brushes over the crucial factor that she has carefully selected the specific passages she includes. The passages no longer belong to the context of Froude's work, but the context of Eliot's critique. By understanding how this blurring of voices takes place in this case, students will begin to see the ways in which translators manipulate the contexts and meanings of the original work in their translation.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<head>Cultural Translation: Geographical and Imaginative Travel</head>
<epigraph>
<p rend="noCount">Woe to the makers of literal translations, who by rendering every word weaken the meaning! It is indeed by so doing that we can say the letter kills and the spirit gives life. —Voltaire, qtd. in Mazīd (21)</p>
</epigraph>
<p>Susan Bassnett observes that "the translator [. . .] is also a traveller, someone engaged in a journey from one source to another" (xiii), highlighting the way in which both translators and travellers exist between two cultural contexts. As students engage with the complexities between words and meaning across cultures as well as across national languages, the idea of travel writing being introduced as a form of translation gives a tangible presence to the translator's mediatory role. Where translation gives mediated access to foreign ideologies, travelling and travel writing take this a step further: the power of mediation shifts from the writer to the traveller, although cultural mediation is still a necessary aspect as the traveller needs to struggle between two different contexts. In order to examine this from a Victorian perspective, students should read several accounts of one foreign place from different authors, examining their different translational motivations. For example, Charles Dickens and Harriet Martineau both deal with slavery in America, yet Martineau also slants her "translation" of American culture toward the position of women, whereas Dickens is more interested in criminality. Furthermore, Harriet Martineau's mid-Victorian journalism reveals the ways in which her translational activities and travel influenced her worldview. This aspect is key to the development of nineteenth-century intellectual culture, especially given the influence Martineau held in her sixty-year literary career and her prolific output. I have discussed in detail elsewhere this connection in Martineau's work, exploring the seeming incongruence between her economic imperialism and cultural egalitarianism.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">See <title level="a">Strong-Minded Political Journalism</title> in <title level="m">Translation, Authorship and the Victorian Professional Woman.</title>
</note> Apart from Mary Louise Pratt's work on cultural translation and cultural encounters, key critics whose work enters into this realm of travel and translation include Sara Mills (<title level="m">Discourses of Difference</title>, 1991), James Buzard (<title level="m">The Beaten Track</title>, 1991), Homi Bhaba (<title level="m">The Location of Culture</title>, 1994), and Susan Bassnett and André Lefevere's collection <title level="m">Translation, History and Culture</title> (1990). </p>
<p>	The ideas of translation, rewriting, and double-voiced discourse can also be applied to literary fiction, with emphasis on cross-cultural encounters. For example, students can be introduced to Martineau's translation of Auguste Comte's <title level="m">Positive Philosophy</title> in the literal sense, but then also examine the way novelists translate Comtean Positivism—rewriting, responding to, and colluding with the philosophy—through the literary narrative.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">For more detail, see my article <title level="a">George Eliot, Harriet Martineau and the Popularisation of Comte's <emph>Positive Philosophy</emph>
</title> in <title level="m">Literature Compass</title>.</note> Fictional narratives can be seen as a form of translation, as a way of illustrating principles in "real life" scenarios—Martineau's <title level="m">Illustrations of Political Economy</title> are a case in point, as are the realist novels of the late nineteenth century. In both cases the narrativisation of theory can be seen as a means of popularisation, yet I would argue in this instance that the act of popularisation is actually a form of translation: rewriting the message for a different audience. We also see translation going outside Britain, with, for example, Russian novelists translating and inserting British intellectualism into their works. Dostoevsky's <title level="m">Crime and Punishment</title> (1866), for example, frequently references British works on Political Economy, as well as George Henry Lewes's positivist expositions. Similarly, Charlotte Brontë's Belgian novels include varying degrees of French in the narrative, creating a sense of cultural collision, misunderstanding, and translation within the language of the narrative that reflects the action of the text. Amith and Malshe refer to this kind of allusion and inclusion of foreignness in their reading of Indian fiction from the perspective of cultural and linguistic translation. They argue that "translation results from an interaction between two languages and cultures situated differently in time and space" (115), and explicitly address the inclusion of foreign words:
         <quote>In Rao's novel <title level="m">The Serpent and the Rope</title> (1958), words such as "Karma", "Maya", "Dharma", "Mantra", etc. appear quite frequently to create a Hindu metaphysical ambience. These are not merely borrowed words or loan translations, but deliberate choices made by the author to assert Indian sensibility in English. (119)</quote>
         In the nineteenth-century European context, we see Continental and British philosophy and science speaking to each other, revealing a globalisation taking place, and a growing recognition of a polycultural world, in a time when national identity was a specific point of anxiety. In this sense, students will be able to connect the Victorian Culture of the Mind closely to their own world, in the wake of the breakdown of national borders not just via warfare and military invasion, but through forced and unforced cultural encounter. Within the Masters classroom in Victorian cultural history, it is crucial to include this kind of "speaking back" to Britain as well as the way Britain incorporates foreignness.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4">If instructors choose to focus on the Russian link, perhaps with reference to either the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, the mid-century Crimean Wars, or the distrust of the Russian empire, it would be useful to read Dostoevsky alongside Martineau's <title level="m">The Charmed Sea</title> (1833), her political economy tale set within the context of Russian tyranny, as well as the positivist writings of Lewes.
            </note>
</p>
<p>As my epigraph from Voltaire suggests, the primacy of ideology—of meaning—is problematic in translation. Hans Vermeer argues that the translator does not merely "imitate" the original text in another language, but "convey[s] a message" (29). From Bakhtin's theory of utterance, it becomes clear that this message is double-voiced, influenced by interpretation derived from the translator's cultural heritage. The purpose of introducing translation theory in the literary classroom, or the cultural history classroom, is to highlight the pervasive nature of translation and expose the mediatory (translational) role of the literary author. While students are encouraged from their undergraduate careers to show a healthy distrust of narrative voices and to identify difference voices and motives, translation theory provides tangible positions for the different voices, creating new understandings and ways of looking at the text: "The co-existence of two different cultural voices and the phenomenon of double-voicedness encourage creative translation strategies between cultures" (Amith and Malshe 120). Linguistic and cultural translation were crucial to the development of the Victorian culture of the mind, with unprecedented movement through the globe, physically through travel and imperialism and the breakdown of national borders, and ideologically through the increase of communication and translation of scholarly material. Through the perspective of translation, the globalisation of the Victorian age resonates with the twenty-first-century student, and creates a greater sense of the relevance of understanding Victorian literary culture as foundational to contemporary understandings of globalisation and the polycultural nature of human civilisation.</p>

<emph>Note on the Translation</emph>
</head>
<p>Readers will almost invariably respond to this translation of Germaine de Staël's <title level="a">On the Spirit of Translation(s)</title> by noting just how terrible it is. I am not rehearsing a form of the translator's modesty in stating this claim. “It is, really, quite bad by the standards with which we have come to judge translations: elegance, fluency, readability, and so on. There is, however, a pedagogical reason for the feeling of alienation from Standard English that this particular translation produces. The attempt is to create, in the spirit of Lawrence Venuti and, before him, Friedrich Schleiermacher, a "foreignizing" translation, one that makes the reading process difficult, to the point of it being almost unpleasurably so.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">
                For a more detailed articulation of Venuti's sense of the "foreignizing translation," see the preface to this volume.
               </note> By following certain features of French syntax, by retaining certain French cognates of English that might be better served with alternative English words, and by leaving some terms and phrases un-translated (<foreign>genre</foreign>, <foreign>generalité</foreign>, <foreign>parole</foreign>, <foreign>nationale</foreign>, and <foreign>jouissance</foreign>), I hope that readers will be continually reminded—because of these recurring moments of friction—that the medium of transmission is <emph>translation</emph>, and specifically translation from the <emph>French</emph>. As noted in the <ref target="commons.2014.translation.wharram.html">preface to this volume</ref> (n.26), two very good, very readable versions of <title level="a">
<emph>De l'Esprit des Traductions</emph>
</title> are available: Doris Kadish's in her collection <title level="m">Translating Slavery</title>, and Joseph Luzzi's in the journal <title level="j">Romanic Review</title>. I offer mine in the spirit of comparative translations that other contributors to this volume have advocated, and also for the convenience of online access—in no way as a corrective. </p>
<p>There is a further pedagogical aim in this version of Stael's treatise: to acquaint students with the vagaries of "machine translation."

<title level="j">Biblioteca Italiana</title>
</ref> in 1816. Critics generally consider Staël's treatise to have launched the Italian Romantic Movement—it was "the spark that touched off the romantic controversy in Italy" (Avitabile 13).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">
               Almost every prolegomena to a discussion of the Italian Romantic begins with reference to Staël's article. See Spera (11); Mueller-Vollmer (151); Zamboni (7).
            </note>
<title level="a">On the Spirit of Translation(s)</title> argues that the Italian literary scene found itself in acute need of regeneration through an influx of the foreign. Translation, Staël argued, was the means by which this regeneration should be actualized.</p>
<p>Staël situates Italian literary arts within contemporary European literatures and the history of translation itself in order to provide a structure for Italian artistic revitalization. She draws attention to the untapped resources afforded by the flexibility of Italian for importing linguistic goods. From the outset of the piece, Staël figures translation as a capital investment capable of enriching the nation. Her opening paragraph moves with remarkable velocity from the abstract, ethereal resonances of her title (the "spirit" of translation) and her opening volley ("the transport of the human spirit from one language to another") to the material signs of exchange in its closing sentence: "the circulation of ideas is, of all the genres of commerce, the one from which the advantages are most certain." Spirit rapidly moves into "circulation" as it becomes concretized in a profitable economy.</p>
<p>Staël refuses either to privilege original writing over translation, or to equate them. Instead she identifies translation as essentially different from original writing, making translation a carrier of "unique" forms of expression into the target language. Serving to inoculate the nation against literary stultification, Staël's concept of translation—that it delivers the "more original"—underscores its paradoxical nature: "Translations of foreign poets can, more effectively than any other medium, protect the literature of a [host] country from those banal turns of phrase, which are the surest signs of its decline." Her language here evokes a positive immunology of literature: the national literary body "protects" itself through the introduction of foreign elements, preventing its "decline." The purpose of translating, Staël argues, is neither "to borrow" nor "to imitate." Translation serves "to emancipate oneself from certain conventional forms that maintain themselves in literature like officious phrases in society, and that exile from themselves all natural truth." To refuse to import foreign expressions is to ignore the emancipatory aspect of translation, leading inexorably to Staël's concluding image of Italians enclosed within their own linguistic parameters should they fail to embark on a program of revitalization through translation: "their country will fall into a sort of apathy from which the sun itself will scarcely be able to awaken it."</p>
<p>
<title level="a">On the Spirit of Translation(s)</title> figures translation as a <foreign>genre</foreign>, a term that carries both taxonomic and gender implications. Staël draws attention to the complex way <foreign>genre</foreign> can blur the lines of literary categories. She sees translation as a complex genre, one trumping all others: any genre can, after all, be superceded through its translation into another language. The French word <foreign>genre</foreign> has a malleability that English fails to encompass. <foreign>Genre</foreign> engenders a myriad of English translations: "form," "type," "kind," "mode," "genus," "species" (as in "the human <foreign>genre</foreign>"), and "gender" (as in the grammatical <foreign>genres</foreign> of masculine, feminine, and neutral). <foreign>Genre</foreign> declares a formal boundary, a classification, a taxonomy—a cordoning off of a larger geography into smaller enclosures. The seven instances of <foreign>genre</foreign> in <title level="a">On the Spirit of Translations</title> range across this connotative vista. </p>
<p>By leaving <foreign>genre</foreign> untranslated (while offering in square parentheses a possible English word suitable for the context) in my rendering of the treatise, I wish to stress the significance of <foreign>genre</foreign> in the progress of Staël's argument. As the treatise progresses, Staël gradually blurs the lines of generic demarcation. When readers reach the last iteration of <emph>genre</emph> in the treatise, they will note that the word refers at once to drama and to translation. In discussing the translations of Shakespeare by her long-time companion A.W. Schlegel, Staël notes that these plays have become "altogether <foreign>nationale</foreign> in Germany," and that "English works—almost like inheritances—are played on the German stage." Through the Italian translation of French drama, Staël argues, "it will be possible in Italy to obtain a result of the same <foreign>genre</foreign>." Staël thereby proposes a genetic hybrid for Italy, based on a German model of English translation. Staël's formulation—"a <emph>result</emph> of the same genre"—stresses the <emph>reproductive</emph> capacities of <emph>genre</emph>, the genetics, of such an undertaking. The desire of the translator, so conceived, demands a genetic hybridization towards the improvement of the nation, towards a breaking free from the strict limitations imposed by "conventional forms." The role of the genre of translation on this literary stage is to intercede in the "executive power" of the genre of theatre: translation, as genre, interrupts the genetic homogeneity of Italian theatre by encoding the foreign into the linguistic parameters of Italian speech, <foreign>parole</foreign>.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Staël's linking of translation to generic proliferation also connects translation to concerns specific to the writing of women during the period. As mentioned in the preface to this volume, shifting the focus away from poetry as the privileged genre of Romantic literature prompted an expansion of generic considerations that changed the shape of Romantic studies.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4">
                See Anne Mellor's <title level="m">Romanticism &amp; Gender</title>. For a sustained discussion of the "privileged locus" (1) of genre during the Romantic period, see Rajan and Wright's <title level="a">Introduction</title> to their collection <title level="m">Romanticism, History and the Possibilities of Genre</title>.
         </note> One might say that by shifting the ground of <foreign>genre</foreign> from strict demarcation to reproductive abundance, Staël ironically points to translation as a form of <foreign>anti-genre</foreign>. A translation always produces an excess of genre, since it functions both as a member of the set of translation and a surplus genre. A translation is always an example of the genre of translation itself <emph>and</emph> the genre of a poem, a novel, or a play, and so on. Translation is <emph>genre in excess</emph>, or, in Staël's words, "the <foreign>jouissance</foreign> of the same genre." As a body of literature, translation could be said to create a literary antibody, an immunizing agent introduced into the <foreign>parole</foreign> of the nation. Not simply then a genre, translation is the beyond of genre, genre in its own excess.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5">
                For a more sustained discussion of the ways that Staël challenged the conventional taxonomic impulses of Enlightenment while anticipating Derrida's "principle of contamination" as articulated in <title level="a">The Law of Genre</title> (57), please see my <title level="a">Aeolian Translation: The Aesthetics of Mediation and the Jouissance of Genre</title> (especially 155-9) in <title level="m">Staël's Philosophy of the Passions</title>.

<head>Germaine de Staël, "On the Spirit of Translation(s)" (1816)</head>
<p>There is no greater service to render literature than the transport of the human spirit from one language to another. There are so few first-rate productions, and genius—in whatever <foreign>genre</foreign> [form] it may present itself—is a phenomenon so rare, that each modern nation limiting itself to its own treasures will always be poor. Furthermore, the circulation of ideas is, of all the <foreign>genres</foreign> [forms] of commerce, the one from which advantages are most certain.</p>
<p>The scholars and even the poets decided, at the time of the renaissance in letters, to write all texts in the same language, Latin, so that they had no need to be translated in order to be heard. This could be advantageous to the sciences, when the argument has no need of stylistic charms. But it nevertheless had the result, that several of the riches of Italians, in this <foreign>genre</foreign> [form], were unknown even to themselves, because the <foreign>generalité</foreign> of readers understood nothing but the idiom of the country. It was necessary, moreover, in writing in Latin about the sciences and philosophy, to create words that did not exist for the authors of antiquity. Therefore, the scholars were at the service of a language both dead and factitious; meanwhile, poets bound themselves to purely classical expressions; and Italy, where Latin resounded again on the banks of the <ref target="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tevere">Tiber</ref>, has been master of the writings of <ref target="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girolamo_Fracastoro">Fracastoro</ref>, <ref target="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnolo_Poliziano">Politian</ref>, and <ref target="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacopo_Sannazaro">Sannazaro</ref>, who approximated themselves, they say, to the style of <ref target="http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Vergilius_Maro">Virgil</ref> and <ref target="http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Horatius_Flaccus">Horace</ref>; but, though their reputation endures, their works are no longer read outside of the Scholarly Age; and it is a woeful literary glory, one for which imitation must be the base. These Latin poets of the Middle Ages were translated into Italian in their own homeland, since it is natural to prefer the language that recalls to you the emotions of your own life, which one can (not) but retrace by study! </p>
<p>The better manner, I am convinced, for dispensing with translations, would be to know all the languages in which the works of great poets have been composed: Greek, Latin, Italian, French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, German. But such an endeavor demands much time, much help, and never can one pretend that knowledge so difficult to acquire could ever be universal. But it is toward the universal that one must strive, when one wants to serve mankind. I would say more: even when one understands foreign languages well, one could taste again through a well-done translation in one's own language, a pleasure more familiar and more intimate. These naturalized beauties furnish the national style with new turns of phrase and more original expressions. Translations of foreign poets can, more effectively than any other medium, protect the literature of a country from those banal turns of phrase, which are the surest signs of its decline.</p>
<p>But, in order to derive from this labor a true advantage, it is not necessary, like the French do, to give one's own color to everything one translates. If one is bound to change everything one touches into gold, the result is no less than that one will not be able to nourish oneself. One would find no new sustenance for thought, and one will encounter again and again the same countenance with scarcely different adornment. This reproach, precisely that merited by the French, holds to, in the face of imposed hindrances of all kinds in their language to the art of writing in verse. The rarity of rhyme, the uniformity of verse, and the difficulty of inversions confine the poet within a certain circumscription that necessarily restricts itself to a kind of monotony in poetic language—if not exactly the same thoughts, than at least similar hemistichs—from which fugitive genius, even when it raises itself to a great height, cannot emancipate itself in all the transitions, in the arguments, and finally, in all of that which lays the groundwork for uniting the great [poetic] effects.</p>
<p>One would with great difficulty find, in French literature, a good translation in verse, with the exception of the <ref target="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_G%C3%A9orgiques">
<title level="m">Georgics</title>
</ref> by the <ref target="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Delille">Abbé Delille</ref>.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="6">
                Jacques Delille's popular translations of Virgil's <title level="m">Georgics</title> were first published in 1769, but had gone through numerous editions before 1817.
            </note> There are beautiful imitations, conquests never confused with the national riches. I do not know if one could name a work in verse that in no manner whatsoever portrays its foreign character, and I don't even believe that such an attempt could ever succeed. If the <title level="m">Georgics</title> of Abbé Delille are justly admired, it is because the French language can assimilate itself more easily to the Latin language than any other; it is derived from it, and it retains of it its pomp and majesty; but modern languages have so much diversity that French poesy will never know to yield to them with gracefulness.</p>
<p>	The English, whose language admits inversions and whose versification is subject to rules much less severe than that of the French, have been able to enrich their literature with translations both exact and natural at the same time. Their great authors, however, have as a rule not undertaken this work. <ref target="http://ckb.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A6%DB%95%D9%84%DB%8E%DA%A9%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF%DB%95%D8%B1_%D9%BE%DB%86%D9%BE">Pope</ref>, the sole one who has consecrated himself in this way, produced two beautiful poems of <title level="m">The Iliad</title> and <title level="m">The Odyssey</title>, but there conserved was none of that ancient simplicity that makes us sense the secret of Homer's superiority.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="7">
                Alexander Pope's translations of <title level="m">The Iliad</title> and <title level="m">The Odyssey</title> appeared between 1715 and 1720, and in 1726, respectively.
            </note>
</p>
<p>In effect, it is not plausible that the genius of a singular man not be surpassed in the three thousand years of work of all subsequent poets, yet there was something primitive in the traditions, in the customs, in the opinions, in the air of this epoch, the charm of which is indisputable. And it is in this beginning of the human <foreign>genre</foreign> [species], this youthfulness of the epoch that renews in our age by reading <ref target="http://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%8C%CE%BC%CE%B7%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%82">Homer</ref>, that we experience a sort of equivalent emotion through the remembrance of our own childhood. This emotion confounds itself with its dreams of the Golden Age, and causes us to give to the most ancient of poets preference above all his successors. If you subtract from his compositions the simplicity of those early days of the world, everything unique in it disappears.</p>
<p>In Germany, many scholars have maintained that the works of Homer were not composed by a single man, and that one should consider <title level="m">The Iliad</title>, and even <title level="m">The Odyssey</title>, as a composite of heroic songs to celebrate in Greece the conquest of Troy and the return of the vanquishers. It seems to me that it is easy to combat this opinion and that, above all else, the unity of <title level="m">The Iliad</title> invalidates such a belief. Why would one be held to the recitation of Achilles' wrath? The subsequent events, the capture of Troy concluding them, must have been naturally done apart from the collection of rhapsodies that one supposes belong to diverse authors. The conception of unity of an event, the wrath of Achilles, cannot be but a plan formed by a single man. Without, however, wanting to discuss here a system, for and against which one must be armed with a frightening amount of scholarship, at least we must acknowledge that the principal grandeur of Homer belongs to his century, since it is believed that the poets of that time, or at least a very large number amongst them, had worked on <title level="m">The Iliad</title>. It is more the proof that this poem is the image of a humane society, at such a degree of civilization, and it again bears the stamp more of the epoch than that of a single man.</p>
<p>The Germans have not limited themselves to their research on the existence of Homer; they have attempted to revivify him there, and the translation of <ref target="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_Voss">Voss</ref> is known as the most exact that exists in any language.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn8" n="8">
                Goethe commented in his <title level="a">Notes</title> to the <title level="m">West-Eastern Divan</title> (1819) that he considered the translations of Voss (<title level="m">The Odyssey</title> of 1781, and <title level="m">The Iliad</title> of 1793) to have inaugurated a new epoch in German translation (264).
            </note> It commits itself to the rhythm of the ancients, and one affirms that these German hexameters follow precisely, word for word, the Greek hexameter. Such a translation effectively contributes to a precise knowledge of the <ref target="http://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%84%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE_%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%BA%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%82">Attic</ref> poem. Yet is it certain that the charm, for which neither rules nor studies suffice, is entirely transported into the German language? Syllabic qualities are preserved, but the harmony of sound is not the same. German poesy loses its natural sound in following the Greek footprints step for step, without being able to acquire the beauty of musical language sung to the lyre.</p>
<p>Italian is, of all modern languages, the most ready to provide for us the sensation produced by Homeric Greek. It has not, it is true, the same rhythm as the original; the hexameter can scarcely introduce itself into our modern idiom; the long and short vowels are not enough demarcation so that one might equate Attic poets in this regard. But Italian <foreign>parole</foreign> [speech] has a harmony which can approximate the symmetry of dactyls and spondees, and the grammatical construction of Italian lends itself to a perfect imitation of Greek inversions: the <ref target="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verso_sciolto">
<foreign>versi sciolti</foreign>
</ref>, unconstrained by rhyme, does not constrict thought like prose does, preserving all the grace and measure of the verse.</p>
<p>	The translation of Homer by <ref target="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenzo_Monti">Monti</ref> is surely, of all existent in Europe, that which approaches the same pleasure brought about by the original.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn9" n="9">
                Vicento Monti had only recently, in 1810, published his rendering of <title level="m">The Iliad</title>.
            </note> It has both pomp and simplicity at the same time; the use of that most common in life, the clothing, the banquets are enhanced through the natural dignity of expressions; and the grandest circumstances are brought within our compass through the truth of portraiture and the ease of style. No one, in Italy, will translate <title level="m">The Iliad</title> hereafter. Homer has forever taken the costume of Monti, and it seems to me, even in the other nations of Europe, nothing whatsoever—not even reading Homer in the original—can surpass the idea of pleasure that Homer can excite through the Italian translation. Translating a poet: it is not to take a compass and copy the dimensions of the building. It is to animate with the same breath of life a different instrument. One wants more <ref target="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jouissance">
<foreign>jouissance</foreign>
</ref> of the same <foreign>genre</foreign> [kind] than perfect fidelity.</p>
<p>	It will be strongly desired, it strikes me, that the Italians occupy themselves with diverse attentions to the new poesies of the English and the Germans. They will thus make their compatriots acquainted with a new <foreign>genre</foreign> [form]—compatriots who cling onto, for the most part, derivative images of Antic mythology. They now begin to exhaust themselves, and the paganism of poesy exists almost no more in the rest of Europe. It is of consequence to the progress of thought that <foreign>la bella Italia</foreign> should look often beyond the Alps, not to borrow, but to learn—not to imitate, but to emancipate oneself from certain conventional forms that maintain themselves in literature like officious phrases in society, and that exile from themselves all natural truth.</p>
<p>	If translations of poems enrich the world of letters, dramatic works will be again able to exercise an even greater influence, since the theatre is truly the executive power of literature. <ref target="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Wilhelm_Schlegel">A.W. Schlegel</ref> made a translation of Shakespeare that, succeeding in exactitude and inspiration, is altogether <ref target="http://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/national">
<foreign>nationale</foreign>
</ref> in Germany. English works—almost like inheritances—are played on the German stage, and <ref target="http://ckb.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%88%DB%8C%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%85_%D8%B4%DB%8E%DA%A9%D8%B3%D9%BE%DB%8C%D8%B1">Shakespeare</ref> and <ref target="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Schiller">Schiller</ref> have there become compatriots.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn10" n="10">
                After splitting with his wife Caroline in 1803, August Wilhelm Schlegel became the long-time companion of Staël until her death in 1817. His translations of fourteen of Shakespeare's plays (1797-1814) coincided with the first theatrical productions of Friedrich Schiller's later works <title level="m">Wallenstein</title> (1799, translated into English by S.T. Coleridge in 1800), <title level="m">Mary Stuart</title> (1800), <title level="m">The Maid of Orleans</title> (1803), <title level="m">The Bride of Messina</title> (1801), and <title level="m">William Tell</title> (1804).
            </note> It will be possible in Italy to obtain a result of the same <foreign>genre</foreign> [type]; French dramatic authors so much approximate the taste of Italians, like Shakespeare that of the Germans, that perhaps one will be able to represent <ref target="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athalie_%28Racine%29">
<title level="m">Athalie</title>
</ref> with success on the lovely stage of <ref target="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milano">Milan</ref>, in providing the Chorus the accompaniment of the admirable music of Italy.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn11" n="11">
<title level="m">Athalie</title> was Jean Racine's final tragedy (1691).
            </note> It is certainly true that one does not go to the theatre in Italy to listen, but rather to chat and rendezvous in the loges with intimate society. It is no less certain that listening the whole day—for more or less five hours to that which one deigns to call the <foreign>parole</foreign> [speech] of the most part of Italian opera—is, in the long run, a sure manner of diminishing the intellectual faculties of a nation. When <ref target="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Battista_Casti">Casti</ref> 
            produced comic operas and when 
            <ref target="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Metastasio">Metastasio</ref> wrote such fine musical adaptations full of charm and elevation, there was no lack of amusement, and reason still won out.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn12" n="12">
                Giovanni Battista Casti (d. 1803) wrote primarily comic libretti for the Italian opera during the 1780s and 90s, while Pietro Metastasio (d. 1782) was known as the best writer of libretti for the "serious" and "elevated" style of opera called <foreign>opera seria</foreign> popular during the middle decades of the 1700s.
            </note> In the milieu of the habitual frivolity of today's society, where each looks to rid himself of himself through the help of others, you could form the spirit of something serious that in the end might provide for true merit, if you made certain ideas and certain sentiments arise through pleasure.</p>
<p>Italian literature is now divided between the scholars who sift and resift the ashes of the past, attempting to rediscover there some flakes of gold, and the writers who rely on the harmony of their language for creating accord without ideas, for the juxtaposition of exclamations, declamations, and invocations wherein there is not one word that comes from the heart, nor one that arrives there. Will it then not be possible that an active emulation of those theatrical successes could restore by degrees the originality of spirit and the truth of style, without which there is no literature whatsoever [<foreign>il n'y a point de littérature</foreign>], nor are there any of the qualities that are necessary for having one?</p>
<p>The taste of sentimental drama has taken possession of the Italian scene and in lieu of this piquant gaiety that one saw reign in another time, in lieu of these great names of comedy who are classic throughout all Europe, one sees represented, from these dramas, the most insipid of murders—if one may so express oneself—from which one can only stage a miserable spectacle. Is it not a poor education for a very considerable number of persons, repeatedly subject to such pleasures? The taste of Italians, in the beaux-arts, is both simple and noble, but <foreign>parole</foreign> [speech] is also one of the beaux-arts and it would be necessary to conceive of it as having the same nature [<foreign>caractère</foreign>]; it [<foreign>parole</foreign>] most centrally constitutes humanity, yet we allow ourselves to be satisfied with paintings and monuments, rather than the sentiments to which it should be dedicated.</p>
<p>The Italians are great enthusiasts of their language. Great men have capitalized well on this investment, and the distinctions of spirit have been the sole <foreign>jouissance</foreign>, and often also the only consolations of the Italian nation. In order that each capable man of thinking perceives for himself a motif for his own development, it is necessary that all nations take an active principle of interest: some are military; others are political. The Italians must distinguish themselves by their literature and beaux-arts. If not, their country will fall into a sort of apathy from which the sun itself will scarcely be able to awaken it. </p>

<p rend="noCount">I show that I have understood a writer only when I can act in his spirit, when, without constricting his individuality, I can translate him and change him in diverse ways.						—Novalis (28)</p>
</epigraph>
</div>
<div type="section">
<head/>
<p>	In diverse ways, the scholars collected in this volume make compelling cases for expanding the repertoire of texts worthy of study in English classrooms to include translations. In this preface, I briefly introduce each of these six interventions, while examining how and why translation changes—or might prompt us to change—the way we approach the teaching of texts of British Romanticism in particular, and literature in general, within a planetary context. The scholars collected here reflect this global framework, not simply in that they work and teach in five different countries spanning four continents, but also in that they address <emph>planetary textual objects</emph>, objects that force us to confront the fact that these texts are "built to travel, to meet new interlocutors, and to develop over time."<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">
            The quotation is taken from <title level="a">Teaching and Translation</title> (374) by Chris Higgins and Nicholas Burbules, a cogent meditation on the intimate connection between these two seemingly divergent activities. Higgins and Burbules note the "strong isomorphism" between scenes of pedagogy and acts of translation (378). The productive interplay of moments of "fidelity" and moments of "fresh invention" informs both teaching and translation: "In teaching and translating, we are performing and reforming tradition. We are not reproducing authentic or inauthentic copies but participating in the ongoing development of a line of thought, re-opening a vein of meaning, responding to a call that demands a response" (369, 376). Higgins and co-director Elizabeth Lowe piloted the first summer institute focused on translation to be funded by The National Endowment for the Humanities in July 2013, <title level="a">The Centrality of Translation to the Humanities: New Interdisciplinary Scholarship,</title> at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, in which I was fortunate to take part. I would like to express my gratitude to directors Lowe and Higgins and the twenty-four other participants from across the United States. I completed this project while enmeshed in a community of intellectual creativity, thoughtful observation, and stimulating scholarship.
            </note> Translations, I will argue, call on us to think anew the way we face the planet and its literary history.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<head>What do Translations Want?</head>
<p>To quote Lawrence Venuti, "translation changes everything."<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">
                  Venuti reflects on the implication of the title for his latest collection of essays, <title level="m">Translation Changes Everything</title>, as follows: "translation carries the potential to bring about multiple transformations. Translation changes the form, meaning, and effect of the source text, even when the translator maintains a semantic correspondence that creates a reliable basis for summaries and commentaries. [. . .] [T]o suppress the translator's interpretation, and to neglect the cultural situation to which it responds must ultimately rest, then, on a fear of change" (10).
               </note> But what, exactly, is our object of scrutiny when we pronounce to have chosen <emph>translation</emph> as our unit of analysis? Translation, after all, refers both to an individual instance—a particular translated work—and to a process of coming-into-being, a "form" or "mode" (depending on which English translation of Walter Benjamin one has at hand) of textual production.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">
                  Samuel Weber offers an incisive reading of the shift from "mode" to "form" between Harry Zohn's 1968 translation for Shocken and the 1996 Harvard edition (59-61).
               </note> When examining translation, should we stress the collective, general set of expectations and limitations that govern the ways translations are produced? Such a strategy, informed by the methodologies of the social sciences, would perhaps foreground analysis of the sorts of people who might have translated in a specific social context and the kinds of texts that prompted translation in that context, and might attempt to reconstruct the contexts of the production and reception of these translations. Alternatively, should we highlight the individual approach that a specific translator has taken towards a specific text? This approach would emphasize the translator's agency in performing a particular (and unique) "interpretive act." Venuti has long advocated the latter approach, from his espousal of "foreignizing translations" in <title level="m">The Translator's Invisibility</title> (1995) to his more recent recommendations for the close reading of translation in the classroom. Venuti emphasizes the rhetorical choices a translator makes in actualizing the original's <foreign>Fortleben</foreign> ("afterlife" or "living-on"), to use Walter Benjamin's famous formulation. Although Venuti acknowledges that acts of translation are always performed within systemic and social constraints, he stresses that these boundaries can only be found through analysis of the "interpretive act" of an agent-translator.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4">
                  "The translator's intention [. . .] is always already collective, determined most decisively by linguistic usage, literary canons, translation traditions, and the institution where a translation is produced" (Venuti, <title level="a">Retranslations</title> 28).
               </note>
</p>
<p>The first approach—let's call it the "social science" one—would be less interested in the details and particularities of individual translated texts and would be more likely to subscribe to something akin to Franco Moretti's "distant reading." By examining texts from a distance such that shapes, relations, and structures invisible at close range become perceptible, Moretti suggests that close reading fails compared to the rich theoretical knowledge generated in ambitious projects that synthesize the vast quantum of data made available through distance. He defines this distance "as a specific condition of knowledge."<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5">
                  Moretti first used this formulation in <title level="a">Conjectures</title> (54), returning to it, slightly revised—"distance is however not an obstacle, <emph>but a specific form of knowledge</emph>"—in <title level="m">Graphs, Maps, and Trees</title> (1). 
               </note> While Venuti and David Damrosch, as we shall see, take Moretti to task for his distanced view, we should not discount the method <foreign>tout court</foreign>. After all, a graph of eighteenth-century translations revealing that in the 1790s women began to translate in hitherto unforeseen numbers is not without interest (see Fig. 1). Similarly, a time map denoting the origins of translated texts over the same time period would show that the tiny circle hovering over German-speaking territories suddenly begins to expand its diameter exponentially during that same decade, when English translators gravitated towards German as never before. One might then, at a distance, speculate that this graph and this map—or more correctly, the social and literary phenomena that they represent—produced something of an affinity between women writers and German texts, <emph>whether or not</emph>  individual women translators were personally engaged in this influx of German books.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="6">
                  They were, of course, to which Anne Plumptre's numerous translations of August Wilhelm Kotzebue testifies.
               </note>
            And, furthermore, this affinity may have contributed to a growing sense in aspiring women writers of the nineteenth century that German (the language, the culture, and the literature) offered entry into literary circles otherwise difficult for women to access. One need only recall that two of the century's great writers, Margaret Fuller and George Eliot—as well as such lesser-known figures as Sarah Austin and the Winkworth sisters<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="7">
                  For a discussion of the translation work of Austin (37-41, 47-58) and Catherine and Susanna Winkworth (36-37, 51-54), see Susanne Stark's <title level="m">Behind Inverted Commas</title>.
               </note>—used their facility in the German language to pry open doors to publication in the middle decades of the century.</p>

</figure>
<p>And yet, as Lesa Scholl's contribution to this volume demonstrates, close attention to the details of translated texts offers something valuable and complementary to the abstractions produced by distant readings of these shapes, relations, and structures.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn8" n="8">
                  Damrosch notes in <title level="m">What is World Literature?</title> Moretti's own acknowledgement of the fact that "systemic approaches need to be counterbalanced with close attention to particular languages, specific texts: we need to see both the forest and the trees" (26). Scholl's contribution provides just such a counterweight. I will dwell on Damrosch and Moretti in more detail below (pars. 27 and 31).
               </note> By reading a number of George Eliot's early essays through a Bakhtinian lens of "dialogic triangulation," Scholl shows the immense value of familiarizing students with the work of translators as it developed over the course of the nineteenth century, arguing convincingly that "Eliot's preoccupation with translation infuses all her literary activities—from her editing, reviewing and journalism to her fiction-writing." Primarily engaged with Victorian cultural history and how its "growing recognition of a polycultural world" helped to shape our contemporary understanding of globalization, Scholl's essay also offers a model methodology for pedagogies that address the means by which "Britain incorporate[d] foreignness" during the Romantic period. The "cultural encounter" embedded in translations by Charlotte Smith, Helen Maria Williams and Felicia Hemans, for example, invites classroom discussions on the ways that translators sometimes "blurred the lines of authorship" and sometimes "hid behind the veil of the original author" (and sometimes did both at once) in presaging what would come to be known as "cultural translation."<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn9" n="9">
                  The term "cultural translation" was developed in the final chapter of Homi Bhabha's <title level="m">The Location of Culture</title>. For a brief overview of its precedents in Jakobson and Serres, its various (inter)disciplinary incarnations, and its controversial status within translation studies as a whole, see the final chapter of Anthony Pym's <title level="m">Exploring Translation Theories</title> (143-164).
               </note>
               There seems to be something of a paradox at work in translation that keeps us at a distance, hiding behind a veil, and yet invites us to a closer scrutiny of its blurred lines. The time is now ripe for the question, "What do translations want?"</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<head>Why Not Translation(s)?</head>
<p>As we enter into the new century's teenage years, we have witnessed the field of translation studies migrate from its position as "a backwater of the university"—to cite Lawrence Venuti's oft-quoted complaint of 1998 (<title level="m">Scandals</title> 8)—to becoming a central object of scholarly enquiry in literary and cultural studies and beyond. It has indeed been a heady decade for translation(s). But while numerous conferences, symposia, seminars, and institutes have been and are being organized around the topic, and collected editions address the role of translators in reconfiguring how we negotiate the scrutiny of literary, historical, and cultural texts, course readings in English literature have, generally speaking, not yet come to reflect the same transformative impulse. In preparing this introduction for our volume, I surveyed recent syllabi for courses on British Romanticism available online to see whether or not translations were included in their reading lists. My little surfing expedition demonstrated to me in a quantitative way that translations remain conspicuously neglected in the teaching of not only British Romanticism, but also the British eighteenth-century and Victorian periods. Indeed, I discovered that it was exceedingly difficult to find even one syllabus available online that includes a substantial number of translated texts.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn10" n="10">
                  While it may be possible that academics willing to publicize their syllabi electronically are more likely to ignore translations in their course reading schedules, this explanation appears highly unlikely. My survey looked at only courses explicitly addressing British literature in a specific timeframe (e.g., British Romantic Literature, British Literature of the Long Eighteenth Century), and not thematic courses, such as The Eighteenth-Century Sentimental Novel.
               </note>
</p>
<p>There are, admittedly, compelling reasons for the absence of translated texts—these are, after all, courses in <emph>British</emph> literature. Let us put aside, for the moment, other possible reasons, such as the territorial disputes that might arise from incorporating texts over which other institutional actors may claim ownership. Let us put our faith, for the moment, in the possibility or, one hopes, the inevitability of a bipartisan appreciation for texts in both original and translation, and agree with Catherine Porter's recent call for "interdepartmental collaboration" and "interdepartmental openness": "It should be possible for any literature department—English, modern languages, comparative literature, Romance studies, Asian studies, and so on—to offer any of these courses [on translation], and it should be possible for students majoring in any of these departments to count such courses toward their major" (37). Amen. While Porter's concern centers on courses primarily taught using translations or about translation, we should also consider the role of translation in courses not exclusively on or in translation. What are the unintended ramifications of examining literature in a specific, historic context with no input from translations? Why do we decide in advance that "British" necessarily entails the elimination of all voices not originating in Britain and in English? Why not translation(s)?<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn11" n="11">
                In passing, I would like to point out that Frances Ferguson, in <title level="a">Planetary Literary History: The Place of the Text,</title> articulates precisely why it is that translations have had a hard time piercing the borders we have drawn around "what counts" as our literary objects of scrutiny. When Ferguson writes of "the peculiar nature of literary history as we have known it—literary history, that is, as the testimony from experience" (661), we can begin to recognize why our methodologies have largely excised translation from our literary histories. Translations have been read as precluding direct experience of the textual object that matters: the original. If, as Ferguson claims, "it is certainly a fact about our habitual ways of treating literary objects that we don't take anyone else's word for it when she pronounces a poem 'great' or 'haunting'" (661), then how much more do our "habitual ways of treating literary objects" curtail the experience of reading a translation? How can I confirm that my acquaintance with a translation is offering me anything more than a pale semblance of the "actual" or "direct" experience of reading the original for myself? How can I, or why should I, <emph>trust</emph> the translator?
            </note>
</p>
<p>That is, I want to raise a serious question about the historical accuracy of the picture we present to our students if and when we erase entirely the presence of translations and translators from the literary Great Britain of 1750, 1800, or 1850. And the same point would hold true for <emph>any</emph> literature course that examines <emph>any</emph> historical period in <emph>any</emph> geographical, political, or linguistic space. There is an analogy available to Romanticists that may illuminate the present situation.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn12" n="12">
                  For this parallel I am indebted to Greg Kucich, who pointed out to me that there appeared to be a globalization or internationalization of Romanticism akin to the pattern established by the expansion of the Romantic canon in response to feminist scholarship.
               </note>
            We appear to be experiencing something of a critical lag at work, much as Romanticists witnessed in the late 1990s, when it was still possible to see Romantic literature courses that ignored women's writing in its entirety, despite the recovery work that had already been done by scholars such as Marilyn Butler, Nancy Armstrong, Janet Todd, Anne Mellor, Claudia Johnson, Stuart Curran, Elizabeth Fay, Julie Carlson, Mary Favret, and many others. This recognition, that women writers made crucial contributions to the public sphere of the period, brought with it an expansion of generic considerations in Romantic scholarship. Poetry, the "masculine occupation" of The Big Six, suddenly (or, once again) found itself in the company of plays, novels, essays, and letters.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn13" n="13">
                  The quotation is found in Mellor's <title level="m">Romanticism &amp; Gender</title> (6), during her longer discussion of the ramifications for genre when "we give equal weight to the thought and writing of women of the period" (1).
               </note>
                  All this scholarly work required new pedagogical anthologies, a need met by the aforementioned Mellor (with Richard Matlak), Duncan Wu, Susan Wolfson and Peter Manning, and Jeffrey Cox and Michael Gamer, among others. Today, it is almost unimaginable that a course—<emph>any</emph> course—on British Romanticism could return to an iteration of The Big Six, unless of course those six were altered to include Mary Shelley, Felicia Hemans, and Joanna Baillie.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn14" n="14">
                  Sadly, the unimaginable <emph>exists</emph>, and it does not take long to find syllabi for British Romanticism courses taught today, <emph>in 2013</emph>, restricting themselves to The Big Six, or—in a minor concession to developments in Romantic studies—The Big Six + <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> or The Big Six + an Austen novel. I hear your deep, collective sigh.
               </note>
</p>
<p>The same impulse that led toward recovering the voices and genres of the multitude of women writing during the period might spur present-day Romanticists to incorporate translated texts. In selecting and organizing the works included in <emph>British Literature 1780-1830</emph>, Mellor and Matlak envisioned "a pedagogical representation of this literature as both participating in and constructing the public sphere" (5). They rightly questioned why women writers were maxed out by previous and competing anthologies of the period at ten percent of the total.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn15" n="15">
                  "They all limit the selections of writings by women to less than ten percent of the volume, they devote at least two-thirds of their anthologies to the six canonical poets, and they represent William Wordsworth in large part by his youthful writings" (Mellor and Matlak 2).
               </note>
            The question one might unfairly ask in 2013 of the 1996 versions of Mellor and Matlak is, “Do translators and translations, since they are almost completely absent from their anthology, <emph>not</emph> participate in and construct the public sphere? If we, like Mellor and Matlak, would like to "encourage a pedagogical attempt to understand this literary period as it developed in the public eye" (5), then shouldn't we include translations, texts that constituted a surprisingly large percentage of the publications during the period?<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn16" n="16">
                  For example, during the two decades between 1790 and 1810, a full fifteen percent of new novels published in Great Britain were translations (Raven 58; Garside 41), with translations constituting many of the most popular novels of the period up to 1830, as evidenced by the number of editions published, including novels by Campe, Ducray-Duminil, Goethe, Kotzebue, Marmontel, Raspe, and Saint-Pierre (Raven 40).
               </note>
            Yet Mellor and Matlak did include one translation in their anthology, a selection from Johann Joachim Winckelmann's 1764 <title level="m">The History of Ancient Art</title> (129-30). Taken from the 1880 translation by G. Henry Lodge, the text comes to readers of the anthology from beyond the historical boundaries of 1780 and 1830, from both before (1764) and after (1880). That is, the Winckelmann translation reveals <emph>and</emph> conceals the blind spot inhabited by translation in our present-day conceptions of literary history. In an uncanny way, perhaps, translations withdraw from literary history.</p>
<p>In any case, we hope that the current volume will propel Romantic pedagogies toward the recognition that foreign texts, as mediated by domestic translators, played a significant role in the public sphere of the period. And this hope is far from original. David Simpson has made eloquent and repeated pleas for the role of translation in Romantic studies. Already in 2004 at the NASSR Conference in Boulder, Colorado, Simpson made the case for "an extended model of translation as a core Romantic paradigm" (152), a call repeated in a lecture he gave in December 2009 to celebrate the launch of the <title level="j">Edinburgh Studies in Transatlantic Literatures</title> series.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn17" n="17">
                  I am grateful to Maria Filippakopoulou at the University of Edinburgh for this last reference.
               </note>
            Noting that to read works by Robert Burns and John Clare, originally published with supplemental glossaries, is "to engage in some experience of translation," Simpson argues that we might recognize that "the distinctions of class and region (often working together) can seem almost as hard to negotiate as those coincident with national borders" (146). Simpson explores the possibility of a renewed consideration of the "historical-geographical epic [. . .], a narrative composed in English about remote events whose implication is explained to us not just in the poetic narrative itself but in an often vast array of footnotes" (148). Citing examples from Moore, Southey, Landor, and Hemans, he locates a disjunctive play between "the power of feeling" inscribed in the poetic narrative and a density of "historical information" embedded in supplementary footnotes and appendices. Translation, accordingly, becomes a promising model producing an awareness of the need for "very slow reading" in which "what one feels for and with the characters [in the poetic narrative] is thus located in the thick field of historical and anthropological material about the translatability of feeling itself" (151, 150). Simpson, like the translation theorists we will encounter below, understands acts of translation not as transparent media into other worlds, "not as the fantasy of dialogism but as the impasse of blocked communication." Translation might prove itself central to Romanticism precisely "for the sake of its profitable impossibility and for its capacity to remind us of just that" (151). Jeffrey Robinson, too, has reminded us how pervasive translations were during the period. Offering in <title level="m">The Cambridge Companion to Shelley</title> ("The Translator") a brief survey of "the landscape of Romantic translations in poetry," he touches on the work of Helen Maria Williams, Charlotte Smith, William Wordsworth, Mary Tighe, and Leigh Hunt as a preface to his contribution on the translations of P.B. Shelley. Similarly, contributor Gillian Dow has foregrounded the significance of translation for women writers between 1700 and 1900 in two recent edited collections—<title level="m">Translators, Interpreters, Mediators</title> and <title level="m">Readers, Writers, Salonnières</title>—highlighting the fact that many women writers in Great Britain engaged in translation work: Eliza Haywood, Elizabeth Griffith, Charlotte Lennox, Charlotte Smith, Clara Reeve, Sophia Lee, Helen Maria Williams, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Maria Edgeworth, to name but a few (<title level="m">Translators</title> 11-12). </p>
<p>At this point, I would like to mention two texts that teachers of Romanticism might wish to consider using in their courses. The first, Broadview's edition of <title level="m">The Travels of Mirza Abu Taleb Khan</title>, translated by Charles Stewart (1810) and edited by Daniel O'Quinn (2009), is one of the very few works available in a scholarly edition of a translation outside the major European languages. As O'Quinn notes, "the translation makes an eloquent argument [. . .] regarding the importance of fostering intercultural dialogue," while demonstrating just how difficult it is for both early nineteenth-century and twenty-first-century readers to evaluate its "moments of intercultural sociability" (16-17). O'Quinn's introduction deals directly with the way in which "the history of orientalist scholarship haunts our own practice even at those moments when it is possible to imagine a pre-existing critique of such complexity" (48). The second text, <title level="m">Poems for the Millennium: The University of California Book of Romantic &amp; Postromantic Poetry</title>, edited by Jerome Rothenberg and Jeffrey Robinson, anthologizes a wealth of Romantic poetry (and some prose) in English, French, and German alongside lesser-known poets (certainly within the Anglophone academy) from outside the "major" European languages. The anthology is somewhat experimental and speculative in form. As the editors themselves acknowledge,
         <quote>[W]e have attempted to construct [. . .] an <emph>international</emph> compendium, something rarely tried but greatly needed. Here we imagine the nineteenth century [. . .] as a time of multiple beginnings and our project as a chance to bring together, to juxtapose, poetry from diverse, sometimes conflicting and oppositional romanticisms and postromanticisms [. . .], to defamiliarize, through its contiguities (as well as through our commentaries), the work of many unquestionably familiar poets. (4)</quote>
         By broadening the context within which students read British writings of the Romantic era, the anthology encourages an appreciation that literary developments in Great Britain were both marked by and productive of planetary resonances.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is one area in which the study of British Romanticism finds itself already rich in resources dedicated to the significant role that translators performed in shaping Romantic thought and writing: the relations between Judaica and British literature in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This state of affairs is due almost single-handedly to the tireless work of Sheila Spector. In a series of monographs and collected editions, Spector has offered Romanticists a window onto the integral role that Hebrew translators played in responding to "the dislocation of the old certitudes [in Western thought] and attempt[ing] to derive a new ethos" during the Romantic era (<title level="m">Judaica</title> 1). Beginning with a pair of monographs on William Blake in 2001, Spector showed the depth of Blake's indebtedness to the Kabbalistic tradition and the profuse analogies between Blake's mythopoetics and Jewish mysticism.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn18" n="18">

               </note>
            In a series of three collected editions, <title level="m">British Romanticism and the Jews</title> (2002), <title level="m">The Jews and British Romanticism</title> (2005), and <title level="m">Romanticism/Judaica</title> (2011), Spector established the convergence of Jewish and Romantic thought and writing as central to the period, with the assistance of contributors such as Lloyd Davies, Judith Page, Stuart Peterfreund, Michael Scrivener, Mark Schoenfield, Ester Schor, Frederick Burwick, Diane Long Hoeveler, Jeffrey Robinson, and Karen Weisman, to name only a few. Drawing on this wealth of critical work, Daniel DeWispelare's contribution to this volume, <title level="a">Teaching Romanticism and Translation through British Hebraism,</title> makes a case for addressing in the classroom the contested arena of Hebrew texts in English, centered on the Hebrew Bible. Read within this historical framework, Coleridge's <title level="a">Song of Deborah,</title> DeWispelare argues, is a particularly suitable text for demonstrating why Coleridge made certain strategic choices as a translator of Hebrew and how these choices produced specific literary effects.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn19" n="19">
               DeWispelare's article might usefully be paired with Karen Weisman's exploration of the elegiac form in <title level="a">Mourning, Translation, Pastoral: Hyman Hurwitz and Literary Authority</title> in the <title level="m">Romanticism/Judaica</title> collection (41-58).
               </note>
</p>
<p>Spector's <title level="m">Byron and the Jews</title> (2010) engages with Roman Jakobson's tripartite taxonomy of translation, primarily focusing on <emph>interlingual translations</emph> in the divergent ways that Hebrew and Yiddish translators leveraged Byron's poems as vehicles for fashioning political, social, and cultural ideas about the Jews themselves. She also, however, traces an instance of <emph>intralingual translation</emph> in a sustained discussion of Jewish impact on the "Byronic self." The literary critic Issac D'Israeli provided Byron with the Jewish conception for "genius," which Byron was to "translate" into the alienated driving force behind the Byronic hero.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn20" n="20">
                  "Byron and D'Israeli translated the <foreign>illuy</foreign>, the Jewish concept of genius, from D'Israeli's English to Byron's, and then back again to D'Israeli's, through their indirect correspondence" (Spector, <title level="m">Byron</title> 4; see also 24-35 and 52-53).
               </note>
                  Jakobson's third type finds voice in Byron's collaboration with the Jewish composer Issac Nathan in <title level="m">Hebrew Melodies.</title> This collaboration offers a unique vantage point on the complexities and nuances that translation, writ large, presents to Romantic pedagogies. The collaboration functions as an <emph>intersemiotic translation</emph>, with composer and lyricist engaged in a back-and-forth negotiation between their various media (or "semiotic systems") and the various forms of linguistic representation (the Hebrew Bible, the <title level="m">KJV</title>, and Byron's own renderings) at play.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn21" n="21">
                  For more detailed elucidations on these issues, I refer the reader to Spector's discussion in <title level="m">Byron and the Jews</title> (35-53) and the excellent essay in <title level="m">Romanticism/Judaica</title> by Toby Benis (31-44), which situates <title level="m">Hebrew Melodies</title> within and against paradigms offered by Katie Trumpener and Celeste Langan regarding the emergent genre of the "national air" in the early nineteenth century.

<head>Psalm 137: A Case for Romantic Translation</head>
<p>Byron's lyric <title level="a">We Sate Down and Wept by the Waters of Babel</title> in <title level="m">Hebrew Melodies</title> is a particularly suitable locus for describing the pedagogical opportunities afforded by close attention to translation. Students may already be familiar with the words and sentiments of the lyric telling of the exile of the Jews in Babylon.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn22" n="22">
                  The reggae group The Melodians set Psalm 137 to music in 1970. Boney M's cover of <title level="a">The Rivers of Babylon</title> (1976) is widely known.
               </note>
             Byron's version of Psalm 137 resonates audibly with an English tradition of Biblical translation, most conspicuously in Byron's rendering of the archaic "sate" as the past tense of "sit"—in fact overleaping entirely the King James Version in favor of the "sate" of the 1560 translation of Psalms 137 in the Geneva Bible. Yet, as Toby Benis notes, "Byron's poem assumes a Hebrew perspective, using the first person to identify his speakers as the Jews in Babylon," thus suspending the dispute between Christians and Jews regarding the authority for Biblical translations "by unapologetically blurring distinctions between Christian and Jewish perspectives" (35-36). Beyond these important insights, Byron's rendering of Psalm 137 makes two specific modifications that force translation to the heart of the matter. </p>
<p>Following the strategy that DeWispelare outlines in his contribution on Coleridge's translation of <title level="a">The Song of Deborah,</title> an instructor might present multiple versions of the Biblical text in conjunction with Byron's lyric. Students will recognize first of all that "Babel" replaces the name "Babylon," as it is usually rendered in English translations, a choice that students might attribute to Byron's need for a two-syllable word suitable for the lyric's rhythm, but should eventually lead to a recognition that "Babel" aligns itself with the transliteration of the word used in the Hebrew Bible for Babylon, "Bävel." In an English context, however, "Babel" usually connotes the story of the Tower of Babel, the etiological account of the multiplicity of languages among humans and the subsequent necessity for translation.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn23" n="23">
                  In another lyric of <title level="m">Hebrew Melodies</title>, "Oh! Weep for those that wept by Babel's stream," Byron likewise chooses "Babel" over "Babylon." George Steiner's <title level="m">After Babel</title>, one of the most sustained accounts of the significant history of translation in the twentieth century, details the legacy of this etiology, noting that "no civilization but has its version of Babel, its mythologizing of the primal scattering of languages" (57). Steiner traces a history of mysticism, Kabbalistic prophecy, and gnostic speculation centered on the pre-Babelian primal language, or <foreign>Ur-Sprache</foreign>—in which it was deemed that "words and objects dovetailed perfectly" (58)—showing demonstrable traces of Kabbalistic thought in the work of Walter Benjamin, Franz Kafka, and Luis Borges, as well as in the writings of Ludwig Wittgenstein and Noam Chomsky: see Steiner's chapter <title level="a">Language and Gnosis</title> (49-109). For an excellent discussion of intersections between the story of the Tower of Babel—"the Biblical paradigm of linguistic division that continues to structure contemporary cultural, literary and philosophical discourse on translation" (291)—and instrumental understandings of Global English as they relate to machine translation in the post-World War II era, see Rita Raley's <title level="a">Machine Translation and Global English.</title>
</note>
            The second modification, less readily perceived, appears in the third and concluding stanza. After their Babylonian conquerors "demanded a song" of the defeated Jews, the riverside mourners refuse "to string our high harp for the foe":
<quote>
<lg>
<l>On the willow that harp is suspended,</l>
<l>Oh Salem! its sound should be free;</l>
<l>And the hour when thy glories were ended</l>
<l>But left me that token of thee:</l>
<l>And ne'er shall its soft tones be blended </l>
<l>With the voice of the spoiler by me!</l>
</lg>
</quote>
               Neither the original Hebrew nor its English translations mention sounds emitting from the "suspended" harp of the Jews. They simply hang up their harp (or harps) in an act of defiance. Byron, however, transforms this act into the retroactive invention of a new instrument, its "suspended" state and "soft tones" resonating with the plethora of Aeolian harps in Romantic-era poetry. James Macpherson pulled off a similarly anachronistic act in having a number of his characters hang up their harps to identical Aeolian effect on the pages of the purportedly medieval poet Ossian.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn24" n="24">
                  In <title level="m">Berrathon</title>, for example, Macpherson writes, "My harp hangs on a blasted branch. The sound of its strings is mournful. Does the wind touch thee, O harp, or is it some passing ghost?"
               </note>
</p>
<p>As M.H. Abrams observed in 1957, the Aeolian harp appears as a "persistent analogue" during the Romantic era.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn25" n="25">
                  "The wind-harp has become a persistent Romantic analogue of mind, the figurative mediator between outer motion and inner emotion. It is possible to speculate that, without this plaything of the 18th Century, the Romantic poets would have lacked a conceptual model for the way the mind and imagination responds to the wind, so that some of their most characteristic passages might have been, in a literal sense, inconceivable" (114).
               </note>
            While for Abrams, this "analogue" referred specifically to the "mind"—to a Romantic "imagination" or "sensibility"—we might first consider the primary function of the harp as an object that converts one kind of information (air movement) into another (sound). In rethinking Romanticism with translation as a "core paradigm" as proposed by David Simpson, I suggest that we consider the work of the Aeolian harp as first and foremost that of a <emph>translator</emph>, albeit an "automatic" one, that allows access—or gives voice—to an otherwise inaudible "something" out there ("nature," "spirit," "world"). That is, the Aeolian harp indeed offers an analogy for Romantic conceptions of the mind, in that it privileges <emph>the primacy of translation</emph>. I have included my translation of Germaine de Staël's <title level="a">On the Spirit of Translation(s)</title> as an appendix to this volume, in part because Staël, at a key moment in her treatise, explicitly likens the work of a good translation to the transmissions of an Aeolian harp, a figure Walter Benjamin would revive more than a century later.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn26" n="26">
                  "In [Hölderlin's translations of Sophocles] the harmony of the languages is so profound that sense is touched by language only the way an Aeolian harp is touched by the wind" (Benjamin 81). Staël's treatise is available in two other recent translations: by Doris Kadish in <title level="m">Translating Slavery</title> (1994, reprinted 2009) (170-174) and by Joseph Luzzi in <title level="j">Romanic Review</title> (2006). It should in no way be construed that I offer the appended translation as a corrective to these excellent ones, but rather in the spirit with which contributors of this volume (especially Dow and Henitiuk) recommend the pedagogical advantages of comparing various translations. My translation foregrounds Staël's repetitive use of the word "genre," which I leave untranslated in the text as a reminder of Staël's insistence on the way that translation generates a proliferation of "genre," in much the spirit that Mellor intended in her groundbreaking work to open up the study of writings of the Romantic era to genres closely linked to the writing of women.
               </note>
</p>
<p>In the context of <title level="a">We Sate Down and Wept by the Waters of Babel,</title> Byron makes a case for "free translation" by transforming the Jews' resigned act of hanging up their harps to a resistant strategy of producing Aeolian music: "its sound should be free." Like the long-time exile Staël, the soon-to-be exiled Byron challenges the primacy of "fidelity" in the relationship between translated and original texts, making a case for "free translation" as an act of political resistance by the Jews in exile.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn27" n="27">
               For a longer discussion of the connection between the Aeolian harp and translation (especially of sentiment), see my <title level="a">Aeolian Translation: The Aesthetics of Mediation and the Jouissance of Genre.</title>
</note> We should, with Benis, recognize how much these harp strings resonate with the piano strings that reverberated to "Hebrew music" in drawing rooms all over the island of Great Britain: "The problem, for some Georgians, was how the home piano performance that included <title level="m">Hebrew Melodies</title> [. . .] placed all the amateurs who played and sang them, even if only for the duration of the performance, in the subject position of the ancient Jewish speaker and musicians" (36). We should also recall the conservative and resolutely anti-Jewish critics that frowned on the conjunction of Byron's lyrics and Nathan's melodies: "Jew and Christian could not possibly agree worse" (ctd. in Benis 37). With such historical and social contexts at their disposal, students will begin to sense just how politically subversive a "free translation" might appear.</p>

<head>A Few Words About Translation Studies</head>
<p>	 A primary object of the present volume is to argue that our pedagogies need to play catch-up to recent insights brought to us by the above scholars, as well as others in translation studies. Many of the writers collected here use terms familiar in translation studies, yet potentially opaque to scholars outside the field. Two of these, source language and target language, have become standard, "source language" (SL) referring to the language or dialect in which the original work manifested itself, and "target language" (TL) referring to the discursive regime in which the translator fashions a new version of the original. Gregory Rabassa, the well-known translator of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Julio Cortazar, shunned the term "target language" for good reason, preferring the terms "first" and "second language": "I eschew 'target language' because when I was in the infantry a target was something to shoot at and, ideally, kill, which does, indeed, often happen in the matter of translation" (5). Notwithstanding Rabassa's sensible, if playful rejection of the term "target language" in the late 1980s, we appear stuck with it in 2013.</p>
<p>	One of the largest hurdles that an understanding of and appreciation for translation faced was the prevailing sensibility—let's call it a mental block—that considered translations to be concealing an object, the original, from direct access. The best that a translation could strive for was to be as faithful as possible to the original, but, alas, <foreign>traddutore traditore</foreign>. Any attempt was bound to fail. Or so went the story we all know—one that many translators themselves embraced, and some continue to embrace. Much criticism in the past few decades in translation studies has worked to remove this mental block from mainstream academic thinking. Antoine Berman, Suzanne Jill Levine, Douglas Robinson, and Lawrence Venuti all offered means of rethinking the mental block that had caused translation, translators, and translated texts to be parceled into a category of derivative or secondary literariness. These critics and others began to see the "failure" of translation, its inability to represent the original textual object in anything other than a distorted form, as a point of departure for an entirely new critical enterprise.</p>
<p>	Although rarely considered a translation theorist, the work of the French philosopher Michel Serres in the 1980s and 90s consistently returned to translation. For Serres, translation became the principal means for exploring and discovering new associations and relations between fields of knowledge. Knowledge, as a result, is intimately connected for Serres with the willingness to engage in translation and listen to its "noise." Drawing on the insights of information theory, Serres railed against the common misconception that noise is a useless waste product of any translation, or any instance of communication between two points in a given system. Noise is an absolute necessity for communication to take place, because, by definition, if there were no noise between sender and receiver, they would be absolutely identical. That is, no noise equals no difference between points, equals no communication, equals no translation. Noise is an essential and in fact <emph>productive</emph> agent in the passage between sender and receiver, and, moreover, between discrete scientific and/or social practices. It follows, then, that the potential transformation inherent in these "passages" or "confluences" between heterogeneous discursive fields in fact offers the possibility of creative, inventive, turbulent, and distributive thinking. In the concept of "noise," Serres provided an avenue for articulating the means by which translation offered a passage, however distorted, between linguistic systems—a model that he would later extend to account for the knowledge production and the creative energy unleashed when discursive regimes interact, such as that between scientific discourses and aesthetic forms. </p>
<p>Examining closely these "noisy" distortions—the twisting, turning and deforming process that produces one textual object out of another—might tell us something profound about the way we approach <emph>all</emph> textual objects. Antoine Berman (<title level="m">L'Épreuve de l'étranger</title>, 1984) offered up a return to the seemingly forgotten insights of German Romantics such as Novalis, the Schlegels, Schleiermacher, Goethe, and Hölderlin, who had valorized methods of translating that called attention to the linguistic and cultural differences that inhered in foreign-language texts. These writers saw translation's "experience of the foreign" as a crucial vehicle of <foreign>Bildung</foreign>, a means of vitalizing and "foreignizing" German culture—an insight that could, by extension, be applied to translation work in all cultures. Suzanne Jill Levine (<title level="m">The Subversive Scribe</title>, 1990) suggested that elevating the "subversive" aspects of translation could free the form from its traditional dismissal as a "betrayal." We confront a new object "lying dormant" within the original by recognizing in translation a sub-version, "a 'version beneath,' a potential version that the original imparts through the magical act of translation" (iii). Douglas Robinson (<title level="m">The Translator's Turn</title>, 1991) proposed that it might just be time for "the translator's turn" in his playfully worded advocacy for a turn towards the study of the tropological eccentricities of translation work. Lawrence Venuti, drawing on Berman, espoused a "foreignizing" type of translation that would push the frontiers of the expressible in the target language (TL).</p>
<p>Since Venuti's category of the "foreignizing" translation appears often in the contributions to this volume, it might be worth expanding on his concept briefly. According to Venuti, translators had found themselves in the course of the twentieth century forced to curtail creativity, innovation, and experimentation in the service of standardizing their language to dominant modes of expression in the target language. In Venuti's words, "translators worldwide came to work under a discursive regime that values a narrowly defined fluency secured by relying on the most familiar form of the translating language, usually the current standard dialect" (2). Venuti calls this type of translation <emph>domestication</emph>. "Foreignizing" translations offer an alternative to the linguistic paralysis perpetuated by translators who conform their <foreign>parole</foreign> to the standards of the target <foreign>langue</foreign>. In subsequent work, Venuti has recognized that Schleiermacher and Berman maintained an "instrumental model of translation." That is, despite their advocacy for foreignizing effects, Schleiermacher and Berman pursued a concept of translation that regarded the original as a vessel containing an invariant foreignness, a foreignness embedded in the original's "lexicon and syntax, style and genre, theme and discourse" that the translator was bound to "reproduce or manifest by adhering closely to those textual features" (<title level="m">Everything</title> 3). </p>
<p>What Serres, Berman, Levine, Robinson, and Venuti have in common is that they all begin with and foster the understanding that a translation produces something new, a newly created object. Translators use a variety of tools (intellectual rigor, close reading, interpersonal dialogue, creative expression, somatic response, and so on) in a sustained, interpretive act. In stressing the newness of this object, these critics have pushed the frontiers of the set of cultural and textual objects that count in literary studies. But they also presaged, in an admittedly oblique way, the movement toward "surface reading" that Stephen Best and Sharon Marcus have recently advanced in their co-edited collection of essays in <title level="m">Representations</title>. Best and Marcus differentiate "surface reading" from "symptomatic reading," an engagement with texts that "took meaning to be hidden, repressed, deep, and in need of detection and disclosure by an interpreter" (1). Seeking to find an alternative to the "heroic" type of critical reading embodied by a figure like Frederick Jameson, who explicitly argued that "interpretation should always seek a repressed, mystified, latent meaning behind a manifest one," Best and Marcus advocate "modes of reading that attend to the surface of texts" (1-2), that dwell on the "manifest rather than [the] hidden" (6). In making their case for "what is evident, perceptible, apprehensible in texts," they stake a claim for describing the surface: "what insists on being looked at rather than what we must train ourselves to see through" (9). Such modes—looking <emph>at</emph> rather than <emph>through</emph>—dovetail nicely with trends in contemporary translation studies that argue for the significance of translations in their own right, not as vehicles for hidden originals that lurk somewhere in their textual underbellies, but as objects already <emph>manifest</emph> in their discursive presence. </p>
<p>	And yet, if we recall Levine's valorization of the translator above, we can also perceive something of the heroic discourse that Best and Marcus—along with the sustained readings of Jameson offered by Margaret Cohen and, especially, Mary Crane in their volume of <title level="m">Representations</title>—align with "symptomatic reading." When Levine suggests that the translator produces a "sub-version" of the original, "a potential version that the original imparts through the magical act of translation" (iii), she gestures toward a certain structural potential within the original, a form of "impart-ability" that the translator, retroactively and subversively, brings into the light of day. There can be little doubt as to the Jamesonian—and, further back, Freudian—"symptomatic" resonances of such a conception of translation, steeped in the psychoanalytic terminology of latent or "dormant" content freed up or translated in a new "manifest" (sub)version.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn28" n="28">
            In Freud's <title level="m">The Interpretation of Dreams</title>, "dream-thoughts" inhabit the Unconscious, longing to break through the psyche's language barrier: "We say, then, an unconscious thought strives for <emph>translation</emph> into the preconscious in order to break through into consciousness" (596). The translation, in other words, occurs between latent and manifest dream-content.
            </note> But in the translation itself, this "hidden" content is no longer concealed, since the original now speaks in a language that the original itself didn't know (or didn't know it knew). There is something of a paradox working in translation, since the purportedly "concealed" object, the original, is everywhere and always "evident, perceptible, apprehensible." To read a translated text is to engage, we might say, in symptomatic and surface reading at the same time. </p>

<div type="section">
<head>Translation and <emph>Weltliteratur</emph>
</head>
<p>	Translation scholars have classified the various types of transformation that occur when linguistic material moves from a source language into a target language. We have already, with Spector's help above, broached Jakobson's three-part structure, though it is beyond the scope of this essay to present an overview of the numerous competing typologies in translation studies. I would, however, like to describe one translation taxonomy that originated during the Romantic era: Goethe's tripartite elucidation of translation from the <title level="m">West-East(ern) Divan</title> (1819). Goethe presents the three methods as stepping stones in the intellectual development of culture—or what he calls, "the nation"—with the caveat that each stage is necessary, and all three can exist simultaneously at any given point in history. The first type, best presented as "a plain prose translation," aims at a familiarity with "the foreign country on our own terms": "the plain prose translation surprises us with foreign splendors in the midst of our national domestic sensibility." The object in this type of translation is transparent communication. Poetic and rhetorical elements in the source text become subservient to the goal of comprehensibility: this kind of translation "completely neutralizes the formal characteristics of any sort of poetic art and reduces even the most exuberant waves of poetic enthusiasm to still water." In more contemporary translation theory, such translations resemble Peter Newmark's <emph>communicative translations</emph>, ones in which the "originality of expression [in the SL] is not an important aspect" (Palumbo 167).</p>
<p>	Goethe calls the second type (or stage) "parodistic" translation, in that "the translator endeavors to transport himself into the foreign situation but actually only appropriates the foreign idea and represents it as his own." The impulse, here, is one of domestication, for which Goethe finds tendencies in French Classicism particularly adapted (and adaptive): "In the same way that the French adapt foreign words to their pronunciation, they adapt feeling, thoughts, even objects; for every foreign fruit there must be a substitute grown in their own soil." As opposed to a strategy that attempts to splice a foreign into a native organism with the object of creating a hybrid form capable of thriving in the new environment (that is, the TL), parodistic translators follow their ethnocentric impulses and search solely for a native substitute, to resume Goethe's horticultural analogy.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn29" n="29">
                  Antoine Berman, to whom I shall return below, cites this particular species of ethnocentric translation recognized by Goethe as symptomatic of colonial discourse, in that "the relation to the foreign is one of refusal, or of misunderstanding, or of disfiguring or 'parodistic' annexation (the case of the Romans and of French culture until the nineteenth century)" (64).
               </note> For British Romanticists, incidentally, Goethe offers the example of William Jones' 1790 translation of <title level="m">Sacontalá</title> as emblematic of this type.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn30" n="30">
                  "I then turned it word for word into English, and afterwards, without adding or suppressing any material sentence, disengaged from the stiffness of a foreign idiom, and prepared the faithful translation of the Indian drama, which I now present to the publick as a most pleasing and authentick picture of old Hindû manners, and one of the greatest curiosities that the literature of Asia has yet brought to light" (vi).
               </note>
                  Indeed, his "Preface" to <title level="m">Sacontalá</title> precisely articulates the motives and methods of Western appropriation of an exoticized "East" that Gayatri Spivak has often indicted in her numerous writings on translation. At the conclusion of the preface, for example, Jones assures his readers that a "venerable" acquaintance from the colony could recite "the whole play of Sacontalá by heart; as he proved when I last conversed with him, to my entire conviction" (xi). Spivak, in her own preface to a translation of Mahasweti Devi's <title level="m">Imaginary Maps</title>, rails against just such an "Indian endorsement" that might be desired by her American readership, since it assumes a non-differentiated conception of "one India" (xxvii). Jones' <title level="a">Preface</title>—accessible <ref target="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00litlinks/shakuntala_jones/00_preface.htm">online</ref>—offers students an early example of orientalist scholarship in miniature, revealing in just a few pages many characteristically orientalist approaches: from the perspective on Asian culture as ancient ("old," "venerable") and static ("stiff") while paradoxically exotic and sensual, to the inclusion of "Indian endorsement" for buttressing the credibility of the translated text.”</p>
<p>	Goethe's third type of translation might best be understood as a form of Hegelian <foreign>Aufhebung</foreign> (sublation, or "sublime synthesis"): "the goal of the translation is to achieve perfect identity with the original, so that the one does not exist instead of the other but in the other's place." Although this formulation flies in the face of more recent meditations on the noisiness, and therefore the productive work of the translator, Goethe's typology did place translation into a new arena: a planetary network. Goethe's articulation in the <title level="m">Divan</title> of "a global view of the mutual relations" between SL and TL embedded in translation laid the groundwork for the concept he developed, and the term he coined, in 1827: <foreign>Weltliteratur</foreign>, "world literature." As Antoine Berman has convincingly shown: 
         <quote>Goethe must be credited for having considered the whole of the play of translating and being translated in the space of contemporaneity; for having measured its psychological, literary, national, and cultural manifestations. Now, translation is taken up in the vast cycle of being translated. [. . .] With the arrival of world literature, the relation [to the foreign] becomes proportionally more complex as the different cultures henceforth seek to contemplate themselves in the mirror of others and to look in it for something they cannot perceive for themselves. (64)</quote>
</p>
<p>David Damrosch, too, takes Goethe's coinage of <foreign>Weltliteratur</foreign> (and the "multiple frames" in which it is embedded) as presaging "all the major complexities, tensions, and opportunities that we still encounter today as we try to grasp our rapidly expanding world and its exfoliating literatures" in his introduction to <title level="m">What is World Literature?</title> (2). In attempting to grasp this unwieldy beast, Damrosch suggests defining "world literature" as a subset of "literature": "all literary works that circulate beyond their culture of origin, either in translation or in their original language (Virgil was long read in Latin in Europe)" (4). But mostly—almost exclusively—in translation since at least the eighteenth century, as I'm sure Damrosch would agree. Damrosch escapes the conundrum of how to approach such a vast field as "world literature" by proposing that it is "not an infinite, ungraspable canon of works but rather a mode of circulation and of reading," which accounts for "why this book highlights the issues of circulation and translation" (5-6). In this sense, Damrosch aligns himself <foreign>avant la lettre</foreign> with "surface reading": "To understand the workings of world literature, we need more a phenomenology than an ontology of the work of art: a literary work <emph>manifests</emph> differently abroad than it does at home" (Damrosch's emphasis, 4). </p>
<p>Valerie Henitiuk's essay for this volume, <title level="a">From Pre-Modern Japan to the 21st-Century World: Comparative Translation in the Classroom,</title> lays out a comparative strategy for glimpsing the complexities of just such a "world literature." In juxtaposing a number of English translations of the eleventh-century Japanese writer Sei Shônagon, Henitiuk illustrates the "creative inexhaustibility" of an original text in its multiple translations. By using the template Henitiuk provides for Romantic-era texts, instructors can offer their students a window into the Benjaminian <foreign>Fortleben</foreign> of the work in another time and another place, recognizing that Sei Shônagon can "live on" in subsequent historical contexts, whether in late-nineteenth-century prose, or as a blog, or an instance of texting ("Spring is like OMG dawn!"). Dow, in her contribution, recommends a similar approach in her discussion of multiple translations of <title level="m">Dangerous Connections/Liaisons</title> by comparing the original English translation (now available online) with more recent versions. Translations, as these contributors are keenly aware, have an uncanny sense of history, a sense that at once indexes the past, while enabling the original's <foreign>Fortleben</foreign>.</p>
<p>	But surely we all recognize the massive transformation called for. We need to shift our present-day focus away from our microscopic "nation/period" literature courses towards an expansive field that asks us to consider nothing less than the entire history of writing over the entire planet. Daunting. Just how do we fit in? It could, it seems to me, be hypothesized that, in dispensing with "close reading" as the be-all and end-all of literary investigation, we may clear a space for translations by upgrading literary history through a sociological turn. That is, if we have neglected translation because our acquaintance with the translated text has been unforgivably mediated by the experience of the translator, then the turn away from close reading and toward sociological methodologies might be something that translations and translators can embrace. Yet, in the end, these methodologies would downplay the intimate relations that translators have with their source texts and the "interpretive acts" performed through translations, and as such, would render hollow the vast corpus of work in translation studies that has made loud and repeated pleas that <emph>we should actually read translations</emph>. </p>
<div>
<head>Translation and Planetary Objects</head>
<p>Allow me to reiterate the conundrum: how do we approach the experience of an object as vast as <foreign>Weltliteratur</foreign>, "global literature" or "planetary literary history," or even a subset such as British Romantic literature, terrifyingly augmented by including all those translations—an object that has "grown too large"? This challenge resonates with another problem we are all-too-familiar with: Global Warming, or Planetary Climate Change. That drought just experienced, that unexpected snowstorm that suddenly arose, or that extreme weather event just witnessed, none of these demonstrates an "acquaintance" or "experience" with Global Warming. You just can't "close read" an individual instance of extreme weather, and stake a subsequent claim for the existence of the object known as "Global Warming" because it is, as Timothy Morton has recently pointed out, "massively distributed in time and space" such that "it's only possible for humans to see pieces or aspects of [it] at any one time" (207, 208). Morton has proposed the term "hyperobjects" as a descriptor for these enormous things in which humans find themselves "enmeshed," calling at the same time for "an upgraded theory of the sublime" (208). I would like to draw a speculative parallel between these two hyperobjects, Global Warming and Planetary Literary History: Morton's conception of Global Warming parallels the way Frances Ferguson has recently described Planetary Literary History: "the very perception of planetary literature as a whole that dwarfs individual capacities marks it as sublime" (657). </p>
<p>	In this introduction, we have already witnessed two approaches to the object of "world literature" that attempt to tackle its vast scale. Moretti, in following at least in part the approach of sociologists such as Fernand Braudel, Immanuel Wallerstein, and Pierre Bourdieu, commends a distanced vantage point on literary history that entails the (massive) collection of reports by others.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn31" n="31">
                  There are methodological differences between Moretti and others who use sociological approaches, such as Casanova. As Ferguson notes, Moretti's is "a schema that represents an accumulation of a number of exegetical claims," whereas Casanova is concerned with "the combination of circulation and regularity in the distribution of social capital," in which "exegesis is an afterthought or an incidental matter" (670). That is, they share in the massive collection of statements about literature, but they differ in the kinds of statements that interest them.
               </note>
            Damrosch, for his part, limits his conception of "world literature" by curtailing the "infinite ungraspable canon of works" (which I read as "really, really big" rather than "infinite"), focusing instead on the mode of circulation, translation, and reception within a defined locale during a specific timeframe.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn32" n="32">
                  Damrosch, in criticizing Moretti's distant, almost non-localized vantage point, emphasizes that "even a global perspective remains a perspective <emph>from somewhere</emph>, and global patterns of the circulation of world literature take shape in their local manifestations. With this in mind, in the following chapters I will be concentrating particularly (though not exclusively) on world literature as it has been construed over the past century in [. . .] the United States" (27-8).
               </note>
            In no way do I wish to downplay the validity or efficacy of these methodologies. Certainly, British Romanticists can see the benefits of recognizing how the distribution systems for translation(s) during the period produced effects worthy of observation. Aishah Al-Shatti's contribution to this volume, for instance, provides an exemplary method for demonstrating to students how Goethe's sentimental novel <title level="m">The Sorrows of Young Werther</title> "manifested differently"—to use Damrosch's words—in Great Britain than in Germany, as the characters of <title level="m">Werther</title> discovered new voices in the poetry of Romantic writers such as Charlotte Smith, Anna Seward, and Amelia Pickering.</p>
<p>	And yet, I would like to point out the allure of Benjamin's concept of <emph>translatability</emph> from his famous "Task of the Translator" in this context. Translatability, with its inclusion of the suffix –<emph>ability</emph>, reverberates with other –<emph>ibilities</emph> and –<emph>abilities</emph> that Samuel Weber has recently described as central to Walter Benjamin's "very distinctive way of <emph>conceptualizing</emph>" (7). In <emph>Benjamin's</emph> –<emph>abilities</emph>, Weber documents Benjamin's propensity to gravitate towards quasi-neologisms such as <foreign>Kritizierbarkeit</foreign> "critizability," <foreign>Reproduziertbarkeit</foreign> "reproducibility," and <foreign>Mitteilbarkeit</foreign> "communicability." Weber notes that <foreign>Übersetzbarkeit</foreign> or "translatability," like these other terms, illuminates a "structural possibility" rather than its "actual realization," much the same as Derrida's well-known differentiation between "iterability" and "iteration" in his response to John Searle in <title level="m">Limited Inc</title>: "iterability, <emph>which is not iteration</emph>, can be recognized in a mark that in fact seems to have occurred only once" (Derrida 47; cited in Weber 5-6, 39, 58).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn33" n="33">
                  Searle's critique of Derrida rested on his understanding that, for Derrida, writing, as opposed to speech, necessitated the absence of the receiver: "Written communication can exist in the presence of the receiver, as for example, when I compose a shopping list for myself" (cited in Derrida 47).
               </note>
</p>
<p>
<emph>Translatability</emph> marks just such a "structural possibility," not (necessarily) an actualization. Benjamin was explicit: "Translatability is an essential quality of certain works, which is not to say that it is essential that they be translated; it means rather that a specific significance inherent in the original manifests [expresses] itself in its translatability" (71).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn34" n="34">
                  Derrida, in the course of his delightfully elusive elucidation of "iterability," notes in passing that his (French) writing will not be easy to translate: "The translator has my sympathy, but the difficulty of translation constitutes part of the demonstrandum" (47).
               </note>
            Particular works, then, call out for future translation; therein lies their peculiarity. Weber has described this structural possibility as follows:
         <quote>For if the call for translation is in some sense rooted in the structure of the works themselves, then these can no longer be considered self-sufficient, independent, autonomous, or self-contained. The paradox resides in the fact that the work can only <emph>be itself</emph> insofar as it is <emph>transported elsewhere</emph>, altered, transformed—in short, <emph>translated</emph> (61). </quote>
         Translations themselves, for Benjamin, do not share this potential: in fact, they are determined precisely by their un-translatability, in that they inevitably index their particular historical moment of transformation into another language. A translation, then, will eventually, by (Benjamin's) definition, become obsolete because it is, like a fossil or a photograph, embedded in the social and historical circumstances of its creation: "even the greatest translation is determined [<foreign>bestimmt</foreign>] to die in the growth of its own language, to perish as the language evolves" (73, my alteration). </p>
<p>Inevitably translations themselves will mark their own obsolescence, since they index, as Benjamin noted, in a peculiar sense, their own failure to "live on" in a world of historical transformation, just as a fossil indexes the moment at which the genetic mutation of an organism <emph>appears</emph> to come to a halt at a particular moment in history. And it is in this sense that objects of translation may interest the literary historian. By opting out of the ebb and flow of language growth, in Benjamin's sense, the translation becomes an especially suitable index for a particular moment in history, <emph>precisely because it withdraws from history</emph>. My point here—hastily sketched out, since this introduction has itself "grown too large"—is not to claim that our study of literary history should concern <emph>only</emph> objects of translation, but that <emph>objects of translation</emph> (and <emph>translatability</emph>) offer an uncanny approach to opening up literary history. The translator, in dwelling on the past (since the original always comes from the past), can push at the constraints of habitual linguistic expression in the TL, pointing toward a future (of) language. This <emph>potential</emph> of translation articulates, of course, Venuti's aspirations for the work of "foreignizing translations"—"The foreignizing translator seeks to expand the range of translation practices, [. . .] to create new conditions of readability" (19)—aspirations which, of course, hearken back to Benjamin: "On behalf of his task, the translator breaks through the rotten limits of his own language" (80, my translation). Such a concept of translation is far removed from any methodological approach that imagines itself to be a transparent medium onto or a full accounting of its objects of scrutiny. It's a foundational premise of translation theory: translation, by definition, is a form—perhaps it is better to say "method"—fully cognizant of its own failure. </p>
<p>Translation always transforms. And to return to the beginning: "translation changes everything." In Samuel Weber's words, "Instead of diaphanous transmission and transparency, translation brushes up against a past and in so doing opens itself to the future" (94). We hope, too, that our volume can be of service in brushing up against the literary past and opening our discipline to a future, planetary object of literary history.</p>
