                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">C.C. Wharram’s “Preface” to this special issue argues that translations call on us
                  to rethink the way we face the planet and its literary history. The essay asks a series
                  of questions pertinent to educators regarding the need for and difficulties in incorporating
                  translated texts into courses designed for literature students. Identifying a peculiar
                  “resistance to translation,” Wharram interrogates the historical accuracy of the picture
                  we present to our students when we expunge translators from literary history, and
                  reviews recent scholarship from Romanticists who address the need for translation’s
                  greater visibility. The essay summarizes recent work in translation studies, drawing
                  attention to a burgeoning interest in the productive “failure” of translations to
                  represent original texts in anything other than a distorted form. Wharram goes on
                  to parallel the understanding that a translation creates a wholly new textual object
                  with our contemporary shift in emphasis from the nation to the planet, a shift that
                  manifests a new problem: the vast scale of what Frances Ferguson calls “Planetary
                  Literary History.” Regarding this new history as a “hyperobject” of inquiry, Wharram
                  touches on recent methods for addressing problems of scale, proposing that translations
                  offer us the “structural possibility” for reading them closely and “distantly” at
                  the same time. The essay concludes by suggesting that translated objects facilitate
                  a peculiar, uncanny means of investigating literary history, and like fossils in natural
                  history, have the capacity to withdraw from and index literary history simultaneously.</p>

                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">The design of this module is to introduce a new dimension in the literary history
                  of Romanticism that has long been overlooked in our pedagogical practices, and that
                  is the interconnectedness of British Romanticism with German literature. In a course
                  titled Romantic and Victorian Poetry, I pair Goethe's <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther</em> with the reviews and poetic responses it elicited at the time, especially the “Werther
                  sonnets” written by Charlotte Smith, Anna Seward, and Anne Bannerman. This exercise
                  introduces the students to one of the key texts of European Romantic literature, gives
                  them a sampling of the literature of the German movement of Sturm und Drang, and enables
                  them to see how this translated text fed into the literary output of British Romanticism
                  by inspiring imitations and appropriations in different generic forms. Equally important
                  is that this text in particular marks a turning point in the history of the reception
                  of German literature in England. Goethe's <em>Werther</em> also raises many questions about the creative process of translation as a novella
                  that contains a translation of a forged translation: Werther's translations of selections
                  from Macpherson's <em>Ossian</em>.</p>

               <p class="noCount">This article suggests that the history of Hebrew-to-English translation before and

                  and methodologies more generally. The article describes a strategic rather than exhaustive
                  assortment of primary and secondary texts on the nature, status, and translatability
                  of the Biblical Hebrew language for teachers and scholars. The premise is that these
                  combinations will help teachers enable students to learn the topic while also allowing
                  them to see how they might transfer the translation studies insights they gain to
                  other cultural and temporal contexts.</p>

                  study of nineteenth-century literature as cultural history. It examines the way ideas

                  can manifest themselves in other forms of writing, such as editing and reviewing,
                  and also addresses ideas of cultural translation in travel writing and fiction set
                  in the foreign place. Through this course, students are taught to identify cultural
                  hybridity in the narrative, as well as the ways writers contend with alternative ideological
                  structures through the creative process of translation. </p>

                     “Translation as 'Genre in its own Excess': Germaine de Staël’s 'On the Spirit of Translation(s)'”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Germaine de Staël’s "On the Spirit of Translation(s),” written in 1816 and originally
                  published in Italian translation, allows students to recognize some of the interesting
                  possibilities that translated texts bring to the study of literature, while providing
                  a brief overview of the history of translation in Europe. Staël questions the idea
                  of a “national” literature independent of outside influence. Rather than focusing
                  on what becomes “lost in translation,” Staël highlights many of the advantages to
                  literature and culture that translation offers. Staël’s treatise suggests a variety
                  of ways that Italians might benefit from an infusion of translation using the German
                  importation of English literary works as a model. Wharram’s introductory materials
                  to his translation offer some ideas for educators wishing to address questions of
                  the literary value of translated texts in their classrooms. References to historical
                  events and figures in Staël’s treatise are explained in hyperlinks that lead to webpages
                  in foreign languages. Students can use online software (Google or Bing) to translate
                  these materials, and learn about the pros and cons of Machine Translation. Wharram
                  furthermore identifies how Staël repeatedly uses the French word genre in her treatise
                  in order to highlight the way translation complicates our ideas about generic expectations.
                  Finally, in making a “foreignizing translation” of Staël’s treatise, Wharram offers
                  the possibility of comparing more fluent versions of her text to allow students to
                  observe the kinds of choices translators can make when thinking about how to best
                  accomplish the task of translation.</p>
