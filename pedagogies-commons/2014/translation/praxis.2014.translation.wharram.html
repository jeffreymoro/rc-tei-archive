                  <p>Readers will almost invariably respond to this translation of Germaine de Staël's 
                     “On the Spirit of Translation(s)”
                      by noting just how terrible it is. I am not rehearsing a form of the translator's
                     modesty in stating this claim. “It is, really, quite bad by the standards with which
                     we have come to judge translations: elegance, fluency, readability, and so on. There
                     is, however, a pedagogical reason for the feeling of alienation from Standard English
                     that this particular translation produces. The attempt is to create, in the spirit
                     of Lawrence Venuti and, before him, Friedrich Schleiermacher, a "foreignizing" translation,
                     one that makes the reading process difficult, to the point of it being almost unpleasurably
                     so.

                     of English that might be better served with alternative English words, and by leaving

                     of friction—that the medium of transmission is <em>translation</em>, and specifically translation from the <em>French</em>. As noted in the preface to this volume (n.26), two very good, very readable versions
                     of 
                     “<em>De l'Esprit des Traductions</em>”
                      are available: Doris Kadish's in her collection <em>Translating Slavery</em>, and Joseph Luzzi's in the journal <em>Romanic Review</em>. I offer mine in the spirit of comparative translations that other contributors to
                     this volume have advocated, and also for the convenience of online access—in no way

                     students with the vagaries of "machine translation." The hyperlinks in the text, including
                     this introduction, lead to Wikipedia pages in the languages appropriate to the references
                     (e.g., "Monti" links to the Italian Wikipedia page).

                              should use Wikipedia as a source for research papers, I do note that, as a reference
                              source for consulting factual information, Wikipedia has proven to be as reliable
                              as other, non-electronic sources (see Chesney, 2006). </span></div>

Certain languages,
                     such as French and Italian, enjoy greater success with machine translation than do
                     others, such as German and Latin. Students and their instructors are encouraged to
                     discuss what causes these discrepancies. What makes French and Italian more suitable
                     for machine translation than German and Latin? Furthermore, English references link
                     to Kurdish Wikipedia pages—also for pedagogical purposes, as readers will discover
                     when they attempt to translate Kurdish into English using currently available translation

                     “On the Spirit of Translation(s)”
                      argues that the Italian literary scene found itself in acute need of regeneration
                     through an influx of the foreign. Translation, Staël argued, was the means by which
                     this regeneration should be actualized.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Staël situates Italian literary arts within contemporary European literatures and
                  the history of translation itself in order to provide a structure for Italian artistic
                  revitalization. She draws attention to the untapped resources afforded by the flexibility
                  of Italian for importing linguistic goods. From the outset of the piece, Staël figures
                  translation as a capital investment capable of enriching the nation. Her opening paragraph
                  moves with remarkable velocity from the abstract, ethereal resonances of her title
                  (the "spirit" of translation) and her opening volley ("the transport of the human
                  spirit from one language to another") to the material signs of exchange in its closing
                  sentence: "the circulation of ideas is, of all the genres of commerce, the one from
                  which the advantages are most certain." Spirit rapidly moves into "circulation" as
                  it becomes concretized in a profitable economy.</p>
               <p>Staël refuses either to privilege original writing over translation, or to equate
                  them. Instead she identifies translation as essentially different from original writing,
                  making translation a carrier of "unique" forms of expression into the target language.
                  Serving to inoculate the nation against literary stultification, Staël's concept of
                  translation—that it delivers the "more original"—underscores its paradoxical nature:
                  "Translations of foreign poets can, more effectively than any other medium, protect
                  the literature of a [host] country from those banal turns of phrase, which are the
                  surest signs of its decline." Her language here evokes a positive immunology of literature:
                  the national literary body "protects" itself through the introduction of foreign elements,
                  preventing its "decline." The purpose of translating, Staël argues, is neither "to
                  borrow" nor "to imitate." Translation serves "to emancipate oneself from certain conventional
                  forms that maintain themselves in literature like officious phrases in society, and
                  that exile from themselves all natural truth." To refuse to import foreign expressions
                  is to ignore the emancipatory aspect of translation, leading inexorably to Staël's
                  concluding image of Italians enclosed within their own linguistic parameters should
                  they fail to embark on a program of revitalization through translation: "their country
                  will fall into a sort of apathy from which the sun itself will scarcely be able to
                  awaken it."</p>
               <p>
                  “On the Spirit of Translation(s)”
                  figures translation as a <span class="foreign">genre</span>, a term that carries both taxonomic and gender implications. Staël draws attention
                  to the complex way <span class="foreign">genre</span> can blur the lines of literary categories. She sees translation as a complex genre,
                  one trumping all others: any genre can, after all, be superceded through its translation
                  into another language. The French word <span class="foreign">genre</span> has a malleability that English fails to encompass. <span class="foreign">Genre</span> engenders a myriad of English translations: "form," "type," "kind," "mode," "genus,"
                  "species" (as in "the human <span class="foreign">genre</span>"), and "gender" (as in the grammatical <span class="foreign">genres</span> of masculine, feminine, and neutral). <span class="foreign">Genre</span> declares a formal boundary, a classification, a taxonomy—a cordoning off of a larger
                  geography into smaller enclosures. The seven instances of <span class="foreign">genre</span> in 
                  “On the Spirit of Translations”
                  range across this connotative vista.</p>
               <p>By leaving <span class="foreign">genre</span> untranslated (while offering in square parentheses a possible English word suitable
                  for the context) in my rendering of the treatise, I wish to stress the significance
                  of <span class="foreign">genre</span> in the progress of Staël's argument. As the treatise progresses, Staël gradually
                  blurs the lines of generic demarcation. When readers reach the last iteration of <em>genre</em> in the treatise, they will note that the word refers at once to drama and to translation.
                  In discussing the translations of Shakespeare by her long-time companion A.W. Schlegel,
                  Staël notes that these plays have become "altogether <span class="foreign">nationale</span> in Germany," and that "English works—almost like inheritances—are played on the German
                  stage." Through the Italian translation of French drama, Staël argues, "it will be
                  possible in Italy to obtain a result of the same <span class="foreign">genre</span>." Staël thereby proposes a genetic hybrid for Italy, based on a German model of English
                  translation. Staël's formulation—"a <em>result</em> of the same genre"—stresses the <em>reproductive</em> capacities of <em>genre</em>, the genetics, of such an undertaking. The desire of the translator, so conceived,
                  demands a genetic hybridization towards the improvement of the nation, towards a breaking
                  free from the strict limitations imposed by "conventional forms." The role of the
                  genre of translation on this literary stage is to intercede in the "executive power"
                  of the genre of theatre: translation, as genre, interrupts the genetic homogeneity
                  of Italian theatre by encoding the foreign into the linguistic parameters of Italian
                  speech, <span class="foreign">parole</span>.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It should be noted that Staël's linking of translation to generic proliferation also
                     connects translation to concerns specific to the writing of women during the period.
                     As mentioned in the preface to this volume, shifting the focus away from poetry as
                     the privileged genre of Romantic literature prompted an expansion of generic considerations
                     that changed the shape of Romantic studies.

                     </div> One might say that by shifting the ground of <span class="foreign">genre</span> from strict demarcation to reproductive abundance, Staël ironically points to translation
                     as a form of <span class="foreign">anti-genre</span>. A translation always produces an excess of genre, since it functions both as a member
                     of the set of translation and a surplus genre. A translation is always an example
                     of the genre of translation itself <em>and</em> the genre of a poem, a novel, or a play, and so on. Translation is <em>genre in excess</em>, or, in Staël's words, "the <span class="foreign">jouissance</span> of the same genre." As a body of literature, translation could be said to create a
                     literary antibody, an immunizing agent introduced into the <span class="foreign">parole</span> of the nation. Not simply then a genre, translation is the beyond of genre, genre
                     in its own excess.

               <p>There is no greater service to render literature than the transport of the human spirit
                  from one language to another. There are so few first-rate productions, and genius—in
                  whatever <span class="foreign">genre</span> [form] it may present itself—is a phenomenon so rare, that each modern nation limiting
                  itself to its own treasures will always be poor. Furthermore, the circulation of ideas
                  is, of all the <span class="foreign">genres</span> [forms] of commerce, the one from which advantages are most certain.</p>
               <p>The scholars and even the poets decided, at the time of the renaissance in letters,
                  to write all texts in the same language, Latin, so that they had no need to be translated
                  in order to be heard. This could be advantageous to the sciences, when the argument
                  has no need of stylistic charms. But it nevertheless had the result, that several
                  of the riches of Italians, in this <span class="foreign">genre</span> [form], were unknown even to themselves, because the <span class="foreign">generalité</span> of readers understood nothing but the idiom of the country. It was necessary, moreover,
                  in writing in Latin about the sciences and philosophy, to create words that did not
                  exist for the authors of antiquity. Therefore, the scholars were at the service of
                  a language both dead and factitious; meanwhile, poets bound themselves to purely classical
                  expressions; and Italy, where Latin resounded again on the banks of the <a class="link_ref" href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tevere">Tiber</a>, has been master of the writings of <a class="link_ref" href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girolamo_Fracastoro">Fracastoro</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnolo_Poliziano">Politian</a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacopo_Sannazaro">Sannazaro</a>, who approximated themselves, they say, to the style of <a class="link_ref" href="http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Vergilius_Maro">Virgil</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Horatius_Flaccus">Horace</a>; but, though their reputation endures, their works are no longer read outside of
                  the Scholarly Age; and it is a woeful literary glory, one for which imitation must
                  be the base. These Latin poets of the Middle Ages were translated into Italian in
                  their own homeland, since it is natural to prefer the language that recalls to you
                  the emotions of your own life, which one can (not) but retrace by study!</p>
               <p>The better manner, I am convinced, for dispensing with translations, would be to know
                  all the languages in which the works of great poets have been composed: Greek, Latin,
                  Italian, French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, German. But such an endeavor demands
                  much time, much help, and never can one pretend that knowledge so difficult to acquire
                  could ever be universal. But it is toward the universal that one must strive, when
                  one wants to serve mankind. I would say more: even when one understands foreign languages
                  well, one could taste again through a well-done translation in one's own language,
                  a pleasure more familiar and more intimate. These naturalized beauties furnish the
                  national style with new turns of phrase and more original expressions. Translations
                  of foreign poets can, more effectively than any other medium, protect the literature
                  of a country from those banal turns of phrase, which are the surest signs of its decline.</p>
               <p>But, in order to derive from this labor a true advantage, it is not necessary, like
                  the French do, to give one's own color to everything one translates. If one is bound
                  to change everything one touches into gold, the result is no less than that one will
                  not be able to nourish oneself. One would find no new sustenance for thought, and
                  one will encounter again and again the same countenance with scarcely different adornment.
                  This reproach, precisely that merited by the French, holds to, in the face of imposed
                  hindrances of all kinds in their language to the art of writing in verse. The rarity
                  of rhyme, the uniformity of verse, and the difficulty of inversions confine the poet
                  within a certain circumscription that necessarily restricts itself to a kind of monotony
                  in poetic language—if not exactly the same thoughts, than at least similar hemistichs—from
                  which fugitive genius, even when it raises itself to a great height, cannot emancipate
                  itself in all the transitions, in the arguments, and finally, in all of that which
                  lays the groundwork for uniting the great [poetic] effects.</p>

               <p>In Germany, many scholars have maintained that the works of Homer were not composed
                  by a single man, and that one should consider <em>The Iliad</em>, and even <em>The Odyssey</em>, as a composite of heroic songs to celebrate in Greece the conquest of Troy and the
                  return of the vanquishers. It seems to me that it is easy to combat this opinion and
                  that, above all else, the unity of <em>The Iliad</em> invalidates such a belief. Why would one be held to the recitation of Achilles' wrath?
                  The subsequent events, the capture of Troy concluding them, must have been naturally
                  done apart from the collection of rhapsodies that one supposes belong to diverse authors.
                  The conception of unity of an event, the wrath of Achilles, cannot be but a plan formed
                  by a single man. Without, however, wanting to discuss here a system, for and against
                  which one must be armed with a frightening amount of scholarship, at least we must
                  acknowledge that the principal grandeur of Homer belongs to his century, since it
                  is believed that the poets of that time, or at least a very large number amongst them,
                  had worked on <em>The Iliad</em>. It is more the proof that this poem is the image of a humane society, at such a
                  degree of civilization, and it again bears the stamp more of the epoch than that of
                  a single man.</p>

                  an active emulation of those theatrical successes could restore by degrees the originality
                  of spirit and the truth of style, without which there is no literature whatsoever
                  [<span class="foreign">il n'y a point de littérature</span>], nor are there any of the qualities that are necessary for having one?</p>
               <p>The taste of sentimental drama has taken possession of the Italian scene and in lieu
                  of this piquant gaiety that one saw reign in another time, in lieu of these great
                  names of comedy who are classic throughout all Europe, one sees represented, from
                  these dramas, the most insipid of murders—if one may so express oneself—from which
                  one can only stage a miserable spectacle. Is it not a poor education for a very considerable
                  number of persons, repeatedly subject to such pleasures? The taste of Italians, in
                  the beaux-arts, is both simple and noble, but <span class="foreign">parole</span> [speech] is also one of the beaux-arts and it would be necessary to conceive of it
                  as having the same nature [<span class="foreign">caractère</span>]; it [<span class="foreign">parole</span>] most centrally constitutes humanity, yet we allow ourselves to be satisfied with
                  paintings and monuments, rather than the sentiments to which it should be dedicated.</p>
               <p>The Italians are great enthusiasts of their language. Great men have capitalized well
                  on this investment, and the distinctions of spirit have been the sole <span class="foreign">jouissance</span>, and often also the only consolations of the Italian nation. In order that each capable
                  man of thinking perceives for himself a motif for his own development, it is necessary
                  that all nations take an active principle of interest: some are military; others are
                  political. The Italians must distinguish themselves by their literature and beaux-arts.
                  If not, their country will fall into a sort of apathy from which the sun itself will
                  scarcely be able to awaken it.</p>
