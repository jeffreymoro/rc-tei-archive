                  <p class="noCount">Still it seems to me that translation from one language into another [. . .] is like
                     looking at Flemish tapestries on the wrong side; for though the figures are visible,
                     they are full of threads that make them indistinct, and they do not show with the
                     smoothness and brightness of the right side. —Cervantes, <em>Don Quixote</em>, ch. 62</p>

                     the translated text to create an ambience of open-endedness. —Amith and Malshe, “Translation
                     and Bakhtin’s ‘Metalinguistics’” (120)</p>
               </div>
               <p>The translator’s mediatory interactions with both a source text and the target audience’s
                  expectations bring together cultural, linguistic, and narrative threads to create
                  a dynamic conversation. This “dialogic triangulation” (Amith and Malshe 116) simultaneously
                  acknowledges and challenges cultural exchange, national identity and the social, moral,
                  and ethical complexities of encountering alternative ideologies. Translation takes
                  on a practical as well as ideological role in this sense, and it is particularly relevant
                  to nineteenth-century literature and culture, in a time when the idea of translation
                  itself changed dramatically, and when translation was instrumental in bringing Continental
                  philosophies into the centre of British intellectual constructs. The act of translation
                  became controversial, as new understandings of how it operated in relation to cultural
                  production focalised the tensions of faithfulness: to original authors and cultures;
                  to the target culture; or to the translator's own agenda, which often existed somewhere
                  between the two. When examining Victorian literature as cultural history, it is crucial
                  to equip students to take into consideration the impact of translation upon what they
                  are reading: what texts have been made accessible to the author through translation,
                  as well as what foreign ideas are being translated by the author through his or her
                  text.</p>
               <p>It has been well-established in contemporary translation theory that the act of translation
                  is not derivative, but a legitimate act of creation in its own right, separate from
                  the original text but in response to it. Yet because of the translator's "illusion
                  of transparency" (Venuti, <em>Invisibility</em> 1), the integral role of translation in cultural and cross-cultural production has
                  been understated. Further work needs to be done through literary studies to establish
                  the implications translation has for the transmission of meaning beyond translators
                  working between two national languages. This chapter will provide a theoretical and
                  historical context for the relevance of contemporary translation theory in examining
                  literature of the long nineteenth century, as well as offering practical means for
                  bringing translation theory into the centre of conversation in the graduate Victorian
                  Studies classroom. This move is timely given the impetus toward interdisciplinarity
                  across the academy, as well as the growing acknowledgement of the importance of multilingual
                  and cross-cultural understandings within the global community.</p>
               <p>The role of translation in nineteenth-century literature can be examined in three
                  key ways: the significance of literal translations within the British sphere; the
                  practical and ideological opportunities made available to those able to translate,
                  especially female translators; and broader, more metaphorical forms of translation
                  that furthered the production of alternative cultural threads, such as travel writing,
                  editing, and reviewing. In the latter forms, the authors appropriate translational
                  techniques in their writing, such as displacing their accountability for their text
                  onto an assumed original author/thinker. There is a self-conscious appreciation of
                  the plurality of voices that exist within a given text, with the translator carefully
                  selecting and arranging "pre-existing cultural materials [. . .] in order of priority,
                  and rewrit[ing] (or elaborat[ing]) according to specific values" (Venuti, <em>Scandals</em> 43). I have argued elsewhere that this process of manipulating and rewriting pre-existing
                  cultural materials is facilitated as much by so-called original authors as by translators
                  (Scholl, <em>Translation</em> 2), opening up the possibility for fictional literary texts to be read as a form
                  of intersemiotic translation—similar to translating religious ideas into visual art,
                  or translation between genres, such as Blake's politics being translated into poetry.
                  By enabling ideas of translation in this more metaphorical sense, as well as the concept
                  of cultural translation, students are led more readily to identify and tease apart
                  the threads of the different voices in the texts: threads of Continental philosophy;
                  British scientific thought; and the complexities of identity created by external or
                  foreign experiences derived from the colonies, the Americas, and the Orient. The understanding
                  of the Victorian culture of the mind is therefore enriched through examining the ways
                  in which Britain was influenced from without at a time when British imperialism seemed
                  an unpenetrable global force.</p>
               <p>Taking a translational approach to literary fiction potentially redefines literary
                  studies, focalising its innate interdisciplinarity and significance as cultural history.
                  Through reading novels alongside philosophical and scientific texts, the dynamic interplay
                  between British and European ideas is revealed in the wake of the unprecedented breakdown
                  of national borders after the Napoleonic Wars that led to a flourish of cultural exchange
                  across national boundaries, challenging previous notions of identity, progress,and
                  civilisation. In <em>The Country and the City</em>, when Raymond Williams defended Jane Austen's apparent neglect of major historical
                  events by claiming that there are many streams of history and that she provided that
                  of the landed gentry (166), he played a significant role in bringing about the cultural
                  turn in literary studies and the importance of cultural and historical contexts in
                  analysing texts. The application of translation theory takes this contextualisation
                  further by recognising the polyphony of international cultural voices within the text,
                  beyond the heterogeneity of the target culture. Translation thus plays a crucial role
                  in the development of nineteenth-century intellectual culture as a hybrid, polycultural
                  conversation.</p>

               <div class="epigraph">
                  <p class="noCount">Say what we may of the inadequacy of translation, yet the work is and will always
                     be one of the weightiest undertakings in the general concern of the world. —Goethe,
                     Letter to Carlyle, 20 July 1827</p>
               </div>
               <p>My understanding of translation is heavily influenced by Bakhtinian notions of utterance
                  and dialogism. Like Bakhtin's utterance, I see translation as a response to the original
                  text, in that it "refutes, affirms, supplements, and relies on [earlier utterances/texts],
                  presupposes them to be known, and somehow takes them into account" (91). The "addressivity"
                  of utterance, that is, its "quality of being directed to someone" (95), resonates
                  with translation, and even more pertinently, as Cheyne and Tarulli observe, "Our utterances
                  are thereby inhabited by the voices of others. An utterance, however, not only reaches
                  backwards to preceding utterances in the chain of speech communion, but also speaks
                  to future possible utterances" (12). Cheyne and Tarulli position the utterance in
                  a mediatory role, between past and future, just as the translator is positioned between
                  the source and target texts. The translator enters into a dialogue with the past,
                  answering the original author, but in a way that is consciously speaking to the future:
                  the readers of the translation.</p>
               <p>The addressivity of utterance or translation, and the simultaneous dialogue with past
                  and present, is particularly useful in the context of Victorian intellectualism when
                  the expectations of translation were changing. Previously the emphasis had been on
                  classical languages, such as Greek and Latin, yet with the growing interest in German
                  and French schools of thought, translation became a vehicle for bringing Continental
                  ideas into Britain. While the focus had been on Latin and Greek, languages predominantly
                  contained within educational and religious institutions, the act of translation had
                  been seen as an intellectual practice for the improvement of language skills and a
                  purely receptive act: receiving understanding from the original, for one's own intellectual
                  benefit. With the move toward both acknowledging the original author and the translator's
                  audience, as well as the new focus on translating living languages, the power relations
                  of translation changed. Whereas a scholar translating Tacitus could not literally
                  speak to the Roman scribe, George Eliot translating Strauss's <em>Life of Jesus</em> (1846) could actually correspond with him, and receive his response to her translation.
                  The act became an actual dialogue, "upset[ting] traditional assumptions about the
                  hierarchy between primary and secondary forms of writing, about writing and reading
                  a text, and about the production and reception of literature" (Stark 29). Within the
                  target audience, there was an assumption that many of them would be able to read the
                  original, and that they would be able to access variant translations. The idea of
                  accuracy became more tied to meaning or message than to words, opening up the possibility
                  to see a translation as a form of literary criticism—the translator's interpretation
                  of the original work. This kind of literary criticism takes into account close reading—word
                  choice, metaphors, similar idioms across cultures, and the dynamics of cultural and
                  historical understanding. Students can begin to recognise the connections between
                  literary criticism and translation through this historical perspective of Victorian
                  translational activities.</p>
               <p>The derivativity of translation was also being challenged, along with the emphasis
                  on word-for-word translation, which was closely related to biblical translation and
                  the importance of not altering the word of God. Matthew Arnold played a significant
                  role in the repositioning of translation, arguing that "[t]he language of the Bible,
                  then, is literary, not scientific language; language <em>thrown out</em> at an object of consciousness not fully grasped, which inspired emotion" (<em>Literature and Dogma</em> 30). Later he would write that it is "the language of poetry and emotion, <em>approximate</em> language thrown out, as it were, at certain great objects which the human mind augurs
                  and feels after, and thrown out by men very liable, many of them, to delusion and
                  error" (<em>God and the Bible</em> 6). For Arnold, the Bible is no longer reified as an immoveable, unalterable sacred
                  text, but is opened up to literary criticism as a dynamic work of poetry. This nexus
                  between religion, philosophy, literature, science and translation speaks to the very
                  centre of the cultural crisis of Victorian Britain; yet through ethical trauma and
                  the conversation that took place between different cultural fragments, intellectual
                  progress was made: "It is from differences in understanding that dialogue and thought
                  are productive; moreover, productivity is not necessarily measured by consensus [.
                  . .]. For Bakhtin, self—other differences, rather than impeding communication, motivate
                  and generate dialogue" (Cheyne and Tarulli 14). I contend that this dialogue was made
                  possible in the nineteenth century through translation.</p>
               <p>Translation theory, influenced by Bakhtin's utterance, provides a tangible point of
                  correspondence in criticism. From a student perspective, literary theory can seem
                  inaccessible and even irrelevant to the so-called real world. Bakhtin himself spoke
                  about the abstraction of theory as a deliberate means for theoreticians to remain
                  in safe intellectual spaces, in which they did not have to consider real-world implications:
                  <span class="quote">‘In practice, [Bakhtin] believed, [theoretisms] usually replace real engagement with
                     the application of a theory [. . .]. For Bakhtin, such an approach betrays cowardice.
                     It reflects a desire to avoid psychological and intellectual risk. It is too painful
                     to rethink one's convictions, and doing so may put one at odds with those with whom
                     one wants to associate. (Morson 351)’</span> For the twenty-first-century student, there is an evident dissatisfaction with those
                  very points that Bakhtin termed cowardice. The immediacy of the culture of the age,
                  with technological advancement and global financial crises, leaves students with a
                  hunger to know how an area of study is directly relevant to them. This has been an
                  increasing challenge in the Literary Studies classroom, with literature in many cases
                  being relegated to entertainment, or a luxury intellectual item for those with the
                  financial and time capacity to study an area that does not guarantee direct employment
                  in a specific profession. What <em>does</em> attract students to the literary classroom is the ability to gain a sense of their
                  identity within the global context, both geographically and in terms of the history
                  of humanity. Bakhtin's approach to teaching literature and even more so, translation
                  theory create this capacity. Gary Saul Morson takes up the idea of cultural translation
                  in his classroom: <span class="quote">‘First, <em>translation</em>: Given the essential moral issues the character faces, what would be the equivalent
                     situation today? One wants to avoid comments like: if only Russia had had more enlightened
                     divorce laws, Anna Karenina's fate would have been different. Given her character
                     and the choices she makes, can we imagine situations today in which those character
                     traits have an important effect, and analogous choices raise important psychological
                     and moral problems? (355)’</span> This kind of equivalency may seem to broach too close to a type of word-for-word
                  translation—cultural equivalencies are just as tenuous as linguistic ones. This example
                  is also complicated in that it refers to a text that has been linguistically translated
                  from Russian to English. Yet it is a matter of seeking out similarities and differences
                  across time and culture, seeing possible connections, as well as where the cultures
                  depart from each other. The point of identification comes by reflecting upon both
                  self and other, departing, as the translator does, from both the source culture and
                  the target culture, being alienated from both in order to understand both more objectively.
                  It is in this space of departure that the dialogue between cultures begins: "Only
                  if such works provided something that departs from—or as Bakhtin liked to say, 'exceeds'—already
                  known truths would they be worth the effort" (Morson 352).</p>
               <p>The comparative approach to nineteenth-century Russian literature suggested by Morson
                  is necessary in teaching students at the undergraduate level to recognise cultural
                  and historical contexts—to move them away from ideas of time and space transcendence.
                  At the graduate level, however, once the grounding in cultural and historical materiality
                  has been firmly established, the students should be capable of moving toward more
                  complex ideas of cultural malleability: the cultural and historical sureties they
                  have learned need to be broken down, as they explore the various influences on cultural
                  identity at any given time. It would be expected that students entering graduate nineteenth-century
                  literary studies would have a solid general understanding of the connections and deviations
                  between their contemporary society and Victorian England. The application of translation
                  studies will refine both their comprehension of literary criticism and literary influence,
                  as well as their historical grounding in the streams of culture that entered Britain
                  at that time, for example, the connections between political revolutions and the revival
                  of Romanticism and European philosophy. As a further connection, they will be able
                  to identify how those streams have evolved in terms of current international relations,
                  and political and sociocultural relations. These real-life applications allow students
                  to delve more deeply within theoretical structures, but also firmly establish the
                  theory within the pragmatic world around them. To take a translational approach to
                  nineteenth-century culture, students should read translations (in a broad definition),
                  works about translation, and literary fiction in order to examine how the Victorian
                  culture of the mind was being translated and created by the written word. Students
                  should consider the perceived cultural value of translation as an activity, as well
                  as specific key translations that impacted British culture: what texts were translated
                  and why. The translator's agenda is also entered into, and by looking at "original"
                  works of the translators—by which I mean published works not described as translations
                  of other authors—students can begin to see the ways in which the role of translation
                  filters through other literary activities that espouse and respond to translated messages.</p>

               <p>My approach to translation and literary culture has focused primarily on the position
                  of female translators, and the professional and intellectual pathways that translation
                  opened up for them in the nineteenth century. While it is crucial that students are
                  exposed more widely to translation theory than feminist translation studies, the position
                  of women in relation to the translated text is invaluable in terms of understanding
                  the development of theories of translation (including ideas of derivativity), as well
                  as the history of translational activities that had such an integral impact on nineteenth-century
                  Britain. Alongside Lawrence Venuti's seminal texts <em>The Translator's Invisibility</em> (1995) and <em>The Scandals of Translation</em> (1998), Sherry Simon's <em>Gender in Translation</em> (1996) provides a history of the way women have related to translational activities
                  specifically within Judeo-Christian Western culture, positioning it as a key female
                  intellectual activity. This premise is central to my approach to Victorian intellectualism,
                  as in a very real sense women were able to use their skills as translators to move
                  into the professional literary world in a radical way. These professions often moved
                  from translation to editing and reviewing, activities that have strong resonances
                  with the act of translation itself in the way they respond to and shape specific discrete
                  texts.</p>
               <p>Simon addresses the way in which the Judeo-Christian tradition links women to the
                  act of translation as both inferior and derivative: "Translators and women have historically
                  been the weaker figures in their respective hierarchies: translators are handmaidens
                  to authors, women inferior to men" (1). This perspective provides a useful starting
                  point for examining the role of the translator. Through then comparing the idea of
                  translation as derivative to the theories of Venuti, as well as Susan Bassnett and
                  André Lefevere, the students can begin to see that the "myth" of translation's subservience
                  "traditionally made room for women writers to take on a role that inadvertently gives
                  them a public voice" (Scholl, <em>Translation</em> 4). Students are led via this comparison to see that "translation is not just linguistic
                  transmission, but an ambiguous, problematic and sometimes acrimonious cultural exchange,"
                  in which the original author's voice is heard through the voice of the translator
                  (3). The possibilities for rewriting, and literary and philosophical manipulation
                  of the text are then opened up within the nineteenth-century context. Within the graduate
                  classroom, there would be an assumption that the students are aware of the importance
                  of the Woman Question in the Victorian era in general; the idea of female translators
                  entering into intellectual conversations through translational activities broadens
                  the scope of influence for professional women, but also for translation itself: "That
                  a nineteenth-century woman should enter into such a role seems radical enough; in
                  translating a celebrated male philosopher, for example, she enters into an intimate
                  discourse with him, often challenging and critiquing the ideas presented, so they
                  become nuanced by her translation" (3). This idea of translation as mediated dialogue
                  and an exchange of ideas connects closely with Bakhtinian notions of utterance, and
                  the productivity of different voices speaking to and against each other. The notion
                  of productivity precludes that of derivativity, thus translation is seen as expanding
                  and creating new space, rather than rehashing the old in another tongue.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In order to help students connect ideas of utterance and translation theory beyond
                     the narrow concept of linguistic translation, and apply them to areas such as editing,
                     reviewing, and literary criticism, there are four key pieces by George Eliot: 
                     “Translations and Translators”
                      (<em>Leader</em>, 20 October 1855); 
                     “The Morality of <em>Wilhelm Meister</em>”
                      (<em>Leader</em>, 21 July 1855); 
                     “German Wit: Heinrich Heine”
                      (<em>Westminster Review</em>, January 1856); and her review of Froude's <em>The Nemesis of Faith</em> (<em>Coventry Herald and Observer</em>, 16 March 1849). I have already mentioned Eliot as the translator of Strauss's <em>Life of Jesus</em>, a work that opened up the floodgates for radical European philosophies to enter
                     British culture. Eliot was very aware of the power she wielded as Strauss's translator,
                     and I have discussed elsewhere the dynamic literal correspondence she had with the
                     original author, as well as her response to the critical reception of her work.

                              that she was aware of, and even relished, her power to manipulate and rewrite the
                              text. She wrote to Sara Hennell regarding Wicksteed's review of her translation, "Is

                     </div> Eliot is a crucial figure for students to examine because she was so critically alert
                     to the connections between translation, editing, the tensions between author and translator,
                     and cultural production. Indeed, a course could feasibly be designed around George
                     Eliot and translation that would speak effectively to the understanding of Victorian
                     intellectual culture.</p>

                  “Translations and Translators”
                  is a useful place to begin examining Eliot in this context, providing a mid-Victorian
                  understanding of the values, workings, and purpose of translation. Susanne Stark suggests
                  Eliot "shied away from grappling with the subject [of translation] in any depth" (47),
                  yet I would argue that even beyond the explicit example of this particular essay,
                  Eliot's preoccupation with translation infuses all her literary activities—from her
                  editing, reviewing, and journalism to her fiction-writing. 
                  “Translations and Translators”
                  reveals her very powerful understanding of the significance of translation, as well
                  as the provocative debates that were taking place around its role in intellectual
                  progress. Eliot begins her essay with allusions to the religious implications of the
                  changing ideas of translation, and goes on to discuss the possibilities and limitations
                  for translation, as well as the skills translators require in order to succeed in
                  their craft. Significantly, Eliot elevates translation and suggests the possibility
                  of the translation exceeding the original, which lends itself to Bakhtin's idea of
                  productivity: <span class="quote">‘It is true the Germans think a little too highly of their translations, and especially
                     are under the illusion, encouraged by some silly English people, that Shakespeare
                     according to Schlegel is better than Shakespeare himself—not simply better to a German
                     as being easier for him to understand, but absolutely better poetry [. . .].Sometimes
                     the German is as good as the English—the same music played on another but as good
                     instrument. But more frequently the German is a feeble echo, and here and there it
                     breaks down in a supremely fine passage. (341)’</span> As a translator herself, Eliot takes this opportunity to critique the quality of
                  Schlegel's work; yet she also addresses the cultural positioning of translation: in
                  England it is seen as a derivative task, possible to anyone who can operate within
                  the foreign language, whereas in Germany it is "more often undertaken by men of genius"
                  (341). Moreover, she shows her consciousness that cultural exchange takes place through
                  translation, although often with flawed understanding. As she elucidates the flaws
                  in Schlegel's translation, she implies that Shakespeare according to Schlegel is a
                  text separate from Shakespeare himself. The idea the Germans get of Shakespeare in
                  their tongue is not the same Shakespeare that the English have.</p>
               <p>
                  “The Morality of <em>Wilhelm Meister</em>”
                  and 
                  “German Wit: Heinrich Heine”
                  are natural progressions from Eliot's essay on translation. They both address the
                  role of translation in terms of cultural impact, explicitly confronting the widespread
                  British fear of a German cultural and philosophical invasion. They can also be read
                  in conjunction with Eliot's 
                  “The Natural History of German Life”
                  (<em>Westminster Review</em>, July 1856), which goes further, introducing an approach to translation that resonates
                  with what would become known more specifically in the late twentieth century as cultural
                  translation. Through looking at cultural and historical connotations of words, Eliot
                  begins to connect translation to the understanding of other living cultures, instead
                  of a theoretically based intellectual activity such as translating ancient texts written
                  in dead languages. Translation takes on a pragmatic and immediate role in international
                  relations. By introducing students to the cultural theory of Mary Louise Pratt, particularly
                  in regard to travel writing, which I address in the next section, they will be able
                  to connect Eliot's approach more closely to contemporary criticism.</p>
               <p>Eliot's review of Froude's <em>The Nemesis of Faith</em> (1849) has a clear translational approach. In order to observe the ways in which
                  Eliot's voice protrudes through, even in the extended quotations she provides from
                  Froude's text, students should read this review alongside Eliot's 
                  “Evangelical Teaching: Dr. Cumming”
                  (<em>Westminster Review</em>, October 1855), which espouses a similar message to that which she attributes to
                  Froude. Discussions around the ways in which Eliot's voice mediates Froude's in the
                  review can be positioned within the discourse of translation: blurring the lines of
                  authorship; rewriting the text for a new audience; and the translator affecting to
                  step back from the translation, hiding behind the veil of the original author. Although
                  she states that she cites extensively from Froude in order to allow her readers "to
                  assess Froude for themselves" (266), like the translator she brushes over the crucial
                  factor that she has carefully selected the specific passages she includes. The passages
                  no longer belong to the context of Froude's work, but the context of Eliot's critique.
                  By understanding how this blurring of voices takes place in this case, students will
                  begin to see the ways in which translators manipulate the contexts and meanings of
                  the original work in their translation.</p>

                  <p>Susan Bassnett observes that "the translator [. . .] is also a traveller, someone
                     engaged in a journey from one source to another" (xiii), highlighting the way in which
                     both translators and travellers exist between two cultural contexts. As students engage
                     with the complexities between words and meaning across cultures as well as across
                     national languages, the idea of travel writing being introduced as a form of translation
                     gives a tangible presence to the translator's mediatory role. Where translation gives
                     mediated access to foreign ideologies, travelling and travel writing take this a step
                     further: the power of mediation shifts from the writer to the traveller, although
                     cultural mediation is still a necessary aspect as the traveller needs to struggle
                     between two different contexts. In order to examine this from a Victorian perspective,
                     students should read several accounts of one foreign place from different authors,
                     examining their different translational motivations. For example, Charles Dickens
                     and Harriet Martineau both deal with slavery in America, yet Martineau also slants
                     her "translation" of American culture toward the position of women, whereas Dickens
                     is more interested in criminality. Furthermore, Harriet Martineau's mid-Victorian
                     journalism reveals the ways in which her translational activities and travel influenced
                     her worldview. This aspect is key to the development of nineteenth-century intellectual
                     culture, especially given the influence Martineau held in her sixty-year literary
                     career and her prolific output. I have discussed in detail elsewhere this connection
                     in Martineau's work, exploring the seeming incongruence between her economic imperialism
                     and cultural egalitarianism.

                     can be introduced to Martineau's translation of Auguste Comte's <em>Positive Philosophy</em> in the literal sense, but then also examine the way novelists translate Comtean Positivism—rewriting,
                     responding to, and colluding with the philosophy—through the literary narrative.

                     </div> Fictional narratives can be seen as a form of translation, as a way of illustrating
                     principles in "real life" scenarios—Martineau's <em>Illustrations of Political Economy</em> are a case in point, as are the realist novels of the late nineteenth century. In
                     both cases the narrativisation of theory can be seen as a means of popularisation,
                     yet I would argue in this instance that the act of popularisation is actually a form
                     of translation: rewriting the message for a different audience. We also see translation
                     going outside Britain, with, for example, Russian novelists translating and inserting
                     British intellectualism into their works. Dostoevsky's <em>Crime and Punishment</em> (1866), for example, frequently references British works on Political Economy, as
                     well as George Henry Lewes's positivist expositions. Similarly, Charlotte Brontë's
                     Belgian novels include varying degrees of French in the narrative, creating a sense
                     of cultural collision, misunderstanding, and translation within the language of the
                     narrative that reflects the action of the text. Amith and Malshe refer to this kind
                     of allusion and inclusion of foreignness in their reading of Indian fiction from the
                     perspective of cultural and linguistic translation. They argue that "translation results
                     from an interaction between two languages and cultures situated differently in time
                     and space" (115), and explicitly address the inclusion of foreign words: <span class="quote">‘In Rao's novel <em>The Serpent and the Rope</em> (1958), words such as "Karma", "Maya", "Dharma", "Mantra", etc. appear quite frequently
                        to create a Hindu metaphysical ambience. These are not merely borrowed words or loan
                        translations, but deliberate choices made by the author to assert Indian sensibility
                        in English. (119)’</span> In the nineteenth-century European context, we see Continental and British philosophy
                     and science speaking to each other, revealing a globalisation taking place, and a
                     growing recognition of a polycultural world, in a time when national identity was
                     a specific point of anxiety. In this sense, students will be able to connect the Victorian
                     Culture of the Mind closely to their own world, in the wake of the breakdown of national
                     borders not just via warfare and military invasion, but through forced and unforced
                     cultural encounter. Within the Masters classroom in Victorian cultural history, it
                     is crucial to include this kind of "speaking back" to Britain as well as the way Britain
                     incorporates foreignness.

               <p>As my epigraph from Voltaire suggests, the primacy of ideology—of meaning—is problematic
                  in translation. Hans Vermeer argues that the translator does not merely "imitate"
                  the original text in another language, but "convey[s] a message" (29). From Bakhtin's
                  theory of utterance, it becomes clear that this message is double-voiced, influenced
                  by interpretation derived from the translator's cultural heritage. The purpose of
                  introducing translation theory in the literary classroom, or the cultural history
                  classroom, is to highlight the pervasive nature of translation and expose the mediatory
                  (translational) role of the literary author. While students are encouraged from their
                  undergraduate careers to show a healthy distrust of narrative voices and to identify
                  difference voices and motives, translation theory provides tangible positions for
                  the different voices, creating new understandings and ways of looking at the text:
                  "The co-existence of two different cultural voices and the phenomenon of double-voicedness
                  encourage creative translation strategies between cultures" (Amith and Malshe 120).
                  Linguistic and cultural translation were crucial to the development of the Victorian
                  culture of the mind, with unprecedented movement through the globe, physically through
                  travel and imperialism and the breakdown of national borders, and ideologically through
                  the increase of communication and translation of scholarly material. Through the perspective
                  of translation, the globalisation of the Victorian age resonates with the twenty-first-century
                  student, and creates a greater sense of the relevance of understanding Victorian literary
                  culture as foundational to contemporary understandings of globalisation and the polycultural
                  nature of human civilisation.</p>

               the German original 'word for word, thought for thought, and sentence for sentence'"
               in translating Strauss (46). However, it is evident through Eliot's correspondence
               that she was aware of, and even relished, her power to manipulate and rewrite the
               text. She wrote to Sara Hennell regarding Wicksteed's review of her translation, "Is
               it not droll that Wicksteed should have chosen one of my interpolations or rather
               paraphrases to dilate on? The expression "granite," applied to the sayings of Jesus
               is nowhere used in Strauss, but is an impudent addition of mine to eke out his metaphor."
