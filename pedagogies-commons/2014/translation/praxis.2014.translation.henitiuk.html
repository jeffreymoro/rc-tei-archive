               <h1><span class="head">From Pre-Modern Japan to the Twenty-First Century World: Comparative Translation in
                     the Classroom</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>Central to the effective teaching of literature is ensuring that students are exposed
               to the variety of interpretations to which a given text may give rise, and to the
               implications of these different readings, both of which aims can be effectively addressed
               through the use of translated texts. For the Romantic period in particular, presenting
               and discussing a range of translator's voices allows for not only the celebration
               of multiple readings, but also a helpful problematizing of topics such as authorship,
               the individual, and originality. However, analyzing texts originally written in a
               wide variety of times and places through the lens of translation can and will stimulate
               classroom debate relating to how we understand and access the literary more generally.
               This brief article will discuss the comparative use of serial translations and adaptations,
               with a view to suggesting pedagogical approaches that should enhance a student's understanding
               of the complexities of textual production, re-production, and reception. Examples
               could of course be drawn from any number of world literature texts, but I will here
               focus on two very different references from my own specialization in Japanese literature.</p>
            <p>Because all translations are a product of a particular place and time, of the social
               location of the individual who produces the translation, any particular reading can
               eventually come to seem dated in its use of vocabulary or allusions. This is a common
               spur to retranslation. Further, advances in scholarship may indicate the desirability
               (indeed, the imperative) of re-visiting a text in order better to reflect its meaning
               and implications as currently understood. More broadly speaking, however, it is a
               fact that any time a reader approaches a work of literature it becomes something new.
               A fresh reading may well uncover previously hidden facets of a work and will often
               prompt a reconsideration of previous interpretations. This is all the more true, therefore,
               for the highly privileged engagement between a text and its translators, who are after
               all readers first and foremost.</p>
            <p>There are many ways to incorporate translation in our teaching as a means of illustrating
               the exciting possibilities of reading. Some of us may already be making use of such
               books as Hiroaki Sato's <em>One Hundred Frogs</em>, which offers widely varying English renditions of the well-known <span class="foreign">haiku</span> by Matsuo Munefusa, better known as Bashô (1644-1694), including by well-known poets
               Kenneth Rexroth and Allen Ginsberg. Other books offering a selection of comparative
               translations include <em>19 Ways of Looking at Wang Wei</em>, in which Eliot Weinberger and Octavio Paz present versions (mostly in English, but
               also French and Spanish) of a classical four-line verse by the eighth-century Chinese
               poet. Raymond Queneau's justly celebrated post-WWII <em>Exercises de style</em> contains dozens of imaginative retellings of a single, very simple story involving
               a man getting on a bus; the original French has been masterfully translated into English
               by Barbara Wright as <em>Exercises of Style</em> (versions in other languages also exist, notably Umberto Eco's Italian <em>Esercizi di stile</em>). More linguistically advanced students may be inspired by Ulrich Erckenbrecht's
               <em>Shakespeare Sechsundsechsig: Variationen über ein Sonett</em>, which comprises a vast number of versions in German of Shakespeare's Sonnet 66.
               (The first, 1996 edition brought together an already astonishing eighty-eight diverse
               readings of the sonnet; this was expanded five years later to include forty-four additional
               translations, with another twenty-two provided in the 2004 supplement, for a grand
               total of 154.) And <em>A travers le Jabberwocky de Lewis Carroll</em>, published in 1997 by Bernard Cerquiglini, contains more than half a dozen French
               translations of that renowned nonsense poem. A more recent volume is my <em>Worlding Sei Shônagon: The <em>Pillow Book</em> in Translation</em>, which explores the translation history of this greatly beloved Japanese classic,
               originally authored a millennium ago. I have pulled together almost 50 different readings
               in sixteen languages of the opening passage, which strikingly describes the author's
               aesthetic response to the four seasons. Each multilingual version also, by necessity,
               reflects the translator's own idiosyncratic reading based in a given socio-cultural
               and historical location (they originally appeared from 1875 to the present day), and
               this book thus serves as a uniquely valuable tool for pedagogical use.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Of course, there is nothing to prevent teachers and, especially, students from crafting
                  their own, equally creative versions, and indeed such a hands-on exercise can be supremely
                  educational. I will later in this article detail various ways to use Sei Shônagon's
                  text in the classroom. However, to take first the Japanese <span class="foreign">haiku</span> as an example, it is helpful for students to think about what it means for a new genre
                  to enter the literary system, how it can affect existing aesthetic norms and open
                  up the receiving culture's possibilities of literary expression. Here is the poem
                  by Bashô mentioned above, for example, with an English gloss supplied on the right: 
                  <blockquote class="quote">
                     <div class="stanza">
                        <div class="l">furuike ya | old-pond <em>ya</em><div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                                    (1)
                                    </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>"Ya" is what is known as a kireji, or "cutting word," a common feature in traditional
                                    Japanese poetry. It is discussed further below.</span></div>
                           </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="l">kawazu tobikomu | frog jump-in</div>
                        <div class="l">mizu no oto | water's sound</div>
                     </div>
                  </blockquote> This word-for-word version calls attention to some fundamental differences between
                  English and Japanese. Such common source-language (SL) features as the lack of either
                  definite or indefinite articles or the absence of verbal person markers, not to mention
                  the extreme brevity, run contrary to common target-language (TL) expectations. European
                  literary conventions such as traditional poetic diction are violated by the extremely
                  simple vocabulary and images found in this style of Japanese poetry, which also eschews
                  rhyme and other elements that were long deemed quite indispensable in the West—indeed,
                  the lack of stressed and unstressed syllables in Japanese means that it is virtually
                  impossible to write in meter in that language—in favor of a fixed 5/7/5 syllable count.
                  It should come as no surprise that when these lines were first "discovered" by the
                  West in the mid-nineteenth century,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Japan followed a self-imposed seclusion policy for over two centuries, broken only
                           in 1853 when the Americans used a demonstration of superior arms to force an opening
                           of trade.</span></div>
                  </div> it was difficult for them even to be read as poetry—in fact, one well-known critic
                  of the day sniffed that Japanese verses "suggest rather than state a thought or fancy,
                  and often require a world of explanation to be intelligible. They are titles of unwritten
                  poems, rather than themselves poems" (Dickins 309). If we remind students that Bashô's
                  Western contemporaries include Donne and Milton, it becomes clear to them how significantly
                  even contemporaneous literary systems can diverge.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The translator is faced with a choice between reproduction of the native SL form,
                  which might well appear utterly non-aesthetic to the uninitiated, or substitution
                  of a TL form deemed somehow "equivalent."
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>This essay does not allow space to fully elucidate equivalence, which constitutes
                           a very thorny concept in current translation theory. For discussions of this term,
                           see, inter alia, Catford 1965; Nida and Taber 1969 (Nida's distinction between "dynamic"
                           and "formal" equivalence has been very influential in translation theory); Steiner
                           1975, Bassnett-McGuire 1980, or Hermans 1985.</span></div>
                  </div> As Sato shows, numerous translators have, over the century and a half since Japanese
                  literature has been known to Europeans, attempted to remake these three very foreign
                  lines into the sort of poem that could be readily recognized and enjoyed as such by
                  their Western readerships. Translators act as tour guides to new linguistic and literary
                  territory, and are responsible for mediating the culture of those regions on behalf
                  of their readers. Rather than shocking the reader with incongruous elements, an alternative
                  strategy is to adapt the SL text to fit seamlessly into the TL culture, such as by
                  extending the short Japanese lines just a little and amending them into some semblance
                  of traditional English poetic meter. For instance, Bashô's famous <span class="foreign">haiku</span> could be rendered as follows: 
                  <blockquote class="quote">
                     <div class="stanza">
                        <div class="l">O mossy shaded pond,</div>
                        <div class="l">Greet now this nimble frog,</div>
                        <div class="l">Who makes thy surface sing.
                           <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                                    (4)
                                    </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The three Bashô versions provided here are my own translations. </span></div>
                           </div>
                        </div>
                     </div>
                  </blockquote> Another option would be to retain the original's lexical and grammatical simplicity,
                  but introduce end rhyme with a view to marking the lines as verse. For example: 
                  <blockquote class="quote">
                     <div class="stanza">
                        <div class="l">A frog</div>
                        <div class="l">in a pond</div>
                        <div class="l">in a flash...</div>
                        <div class="l">A frog</div>
                        <div class="l">in a pond<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
                        <div class="l">with a splash!</div>
                     </div>
                  </blockquote> These two "domestications"—as opposed to "foreignizations" (these terms were popularized
                  by translation theorist Lawrence Venuti in <em>The Scandals of Translation</em>)—of the source text could not be more strikingly different. The first constitutes
                  a self-conscious attempt to flesh out the Japanese poem, explaining the understated
                  images by inserting adjectives and connecting phrases, with a view to rendering it
                  more "English." It attempts to give the poem an archaic flavor through the use of
                  old-fashioned vocabulary, with a nod to the fact that the original dates from over
                  300 years ago. In contrast, the second version strictly retains the simplicity of
                  image via contemporary language. By choosing here to acknowledge the humor present
                  throughout Bashô's oeuvre (bear in mind that his pen-name means literally "banana
                  plant"), however, I end up on some level misrepresenting the contemplative nature
                  of this particular poem. In English, such repetition coupled with the pared-down elements
                  of these lines is more typical of the norms applied to children's literature, and
                  so the poet is inadvertently turned into a sort of Japanese Dr. Seuss. A cautious
                  and ethical translator may be at least momentarily stymied as to how the diametrically
                  opposed poetic conventions of the SL and the TL should be reconciled.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Over time, however, and with enough exposure, <span class="foreign">haiku</span> have become "privileged bearers of the aesthetic function" (Mukařovsky 2) in English
               as well as Japanese. Translation has always served to transform the receiving culture,
               to break traditional aesthetic molds by introducing new elements. Imagism, for example,
               was greatly influenced by the Western reception of Japanese <span class="foreign">haiku</span>, with Ezra Pound's "In a Station of the Metro" opening up new poetic possibilities
               for Anglophone poets. In this way, alternative readings that would once have been
               considered radically avant-garde in terms of both linguistic and artistic conventions
               are gradually made available. For example, we could today have something along these
               lines: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">An age-old pond</div>
                  <div class="l">frog up-down-</div>
                  <div class="l">into</div>
                  <div class="l">...ah!</div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Among other things, here I have reproduced the original's snapshot-like image and
               adapted the all-important syllable breakdown to a more obvious countdown of 4/3/2/1.
               The <span class="foreign">ya</span> of the original, whose function is difficult to define but which can indicate a sort
               of pause or closure, becomes in this translation an expression of almost word-less
               satisfaction as the amphibian breaks the water's surface. Considered together, such
               utterly different renditions of a single <span class="foreign">haiku</span> reveal some of the many possible responses to a given literary text and give students
               the implicit permission to craft their own adaptive interpretations.</p>
            <p>Another, much earlier and distinctive work of world literature, also from Japan, that
               can offer additional layers of complexity and pedagogical possibilities is the prose
               masterpiece <em>Makura no Sôshi</em> or <em>Pillow Book</em>, originally composed in the late-tenth or early-eleventh century by a woman known
               today as Sei Shônagon. This sophisticated text (composed at roughly the same period
               as the Anglo-Saxon classic <em>Beowulf</em>) remains very popular at home and abroad and has been translated countless times
               into languages ranging from Bulgarian and Catalan, through English, French and German,
               to Spanish and Turkish. Far from exhausting the wealth of meaning and stylistic nuance
               to be found in the source text, these versions helpfully suggest the creative inexhaustibility
               of this or any literary text and the enticing ability of the act of translation to
               capitalize on such potential. The highly personal nature of its quirky format, striking
               mix of colloquial and more formal styles, and ever-shifting perspective has led Japanese
               scholars such as Machiko Midorikawa to argue quite rightly that "an encounter with
               [this text] forces us to rethink from scratch our understanding of literary form and
               genre" (Midorikawa 143). Sei Shônagon's overall style will strike many of today's
               readers as modern, even post-modern—Midorikawa goes so far as to suggest that the
               <em>Pillow Book</em> should be considered a sort of "Heian-period blog" (158). Whether described as a
               <span class="foreign">zuihitsu</span> (miscellany), <span class="foreign">nikki</span> (diary) or some sort of proto-blog, the text is in any case primarily a mixture of
               three types of passages: approximately 60 diary-like entries, 80 or 90 anecdotes or
               descriptions of striking scenes, and some 170 lists—of such things as "Insects" and
               "Wind instruments," or "Splendid things," "Infuriating things," and "Things that make
               you feel nostalgic."</p>

                  court, and to reveal its worldview. A case in point is the opening passage, in which
                  the author lyrically describes what she finds most attractive about each season and
                  which I present in some four dozen different versions. The apparent simplicity of
                  this and the over 300 subsequent passages that follow in Sei Shônagon's original text
                  belies a profound sensitivity to the world, both natural

                  of things. Its great subtlety poses unique problems and demands a range of interpretations
                  and approaches, and a careful exploration of how it has been translated thus undermines
                  any naïve belief in a straightforward transfer of meaning from one language to another,
                  one culture to another. By guiding students through the often convoluted trajectory
                  through which a once wholly foreign literary work becomes domesticated—or resists
                  domestication—we can help them grasp something of the various historical, ideological,
                  or other forces that ineluctably shape our experience of literature.</p>
            </div>
            <p>For example, let us look closely at the very first few words of the <em>Pillow Book</em>, which in the original Japanese are <span class="foreign">haru wa akebono</span>. <span class="foreign">Haru</span> means "spring" and <span class="foreign">akebono</span> means "dawn"; <span class="foreign">wa</span> is a grammatical particle that functions to indicate that whatever comes immediately
               before it is the topic of the phrase. Classical Japanese, even more than the modern
               language, is often elliptical and this line is no exception—the exact relationship
               between spring and dawn is left open to our interpretation. For the other three seasons,
               as well, we read: "summer <span class="foreign">wa</span> night [. . .] autumn <span class="foreign">wa</span> evening [. . .] winter <span class="foreign">wa</span> early morning." Much as readers have unconsciously probably always done silently
               in their heads, translators tend to supply an explicit verbal complement for these
               phrases, presumably with the intention of improving comprehension and readability.
               They have generally felt the need to be more explicit about the relationship between
               the season and the time of day: in what is likely the best-known English-language
               version of the <em>Pillow Book</em>, by Ivan Morris, for instance, the three initial words of Classical Japanese morph
               into "In Spring, it is the dawn that is most beautiful" (qtd. in Henitiuk, <em>Worlding</em> 147). Translators have also rarely resisted the impulse to narrate in the first person,
               despite the fact that a characteristic feature of Japanese in both its pre-modern
               and modern forms is the general avoidance of personal pronouns. Accordingly, we also
               see: "In spring, [. . .] I love to watch the dawn" (Henitiuk, <em>Worlding</em> 61); "What charms me; in spring it is dawn [. . .] " (66); or "In spring I commend
               the hour before daybreak" (118). Some translators have opted to use square brackets
               to make clear the fact that they are supplying information that does not explicitly
               appear in the Japanese, resulting in the unfortunately clumsy: "Through the seasons.
               [It is interesting to observe] how in spring [. . .]" (76) or "In spring, [it is]
               the dawn [that I prefer]" (109). Others have taken very different tacks: "In Spring,
               at dawn [. . .]. How lovely!" (103) and "Spring is best tasted at dawn" (133), for
               example, or the minimalist (but does this necessarily make it more "accurate"?) "Springtime
               – sunrise" (182). One modern Japanese version even offers the tongue-in-cheek teenage-speak
               of "Spring is, like, OMIGOD, dawn!!!" (35).</p>
            <p>What we are dealing with here is a piece of women's writing, and the fact that the
               majority of translators have been men offers a prime opportunity to introduce the
               important issue of gender into classroom discussion. It is instructive to ask our
               students what they make of the fact that, for several decades, English readers knew
               this highly personal text solely through Arthur Waley's voice and then Ivan Morris'.
               There is nothing inherently wrong with a male translator rendering a woman's text,
               of course, but given that Waley was in various ways dismissive about the text and
               its overall literary worth, it should nonetheless give us pause. His 1928 version
               comprises snippets from the <em>Pillow Book</em> interspersed within his own extensive commentary about its socio-cultural setting.
               Waley famously comments in his introduction that "[o]missions have been made only
               where the original was dull, unintelligible, repetitive, or so packed with allusion
               that it required an impracticable amount of commentary" (qtd. in Henitiuk, <em>Worlding</em> 97), but in fact offers his readers only about one fourth of what Sei Shônagon actually
               wrote. Morris, for his part, faithfully translates the complete text, complete with
               extensive footnotes that treat it with the scholarly respect one would expect in a
               book published by Columbia University Press. Nonetheless, he is elsewhere on record
               calling another woman-authored Classical Japanese text, which movingly deals with
               the breakdown of a marriage, "one long wail of jealousy by a woman in whom the emotion
               has reached hysterical proportions" (Morris, <em>World</em> 255). His introduction to the <em>Pillow Book</em> contains the following reference to the fact that its author on several occasions
               recounts enthusiastically testing her mettle against others: "Her attitude to men,
               even to those of a somewhat higher class than hers, was competitive to the point of
               overt hostility" (xiv). Sei Shônagon's exchanges with colleagues (both male and female,
               as it happens) are imbued less with "hostility" than an infectious delight in intellectual
               challenge, and her "competitors" appear to derive almost as much enjoyment from her
               besting them as she does (see McKinney 66–69). While admittedly our author can be
               sharp and even caustic at times, it is inaccurate to characterize her as any sort
               of rabidly anti-male feminist.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The most recent English translation, for the trade publisher Penguin, has been done
                  by Meredith McKinney, whose approach is colored by a very different attitude. Her
                  project implicitly aims to redress what this translator sees as a prior tendency,
                  intentional or otherwise, to misrepresent not only the women's world at the heart
                  of Japan's Heian court but also the lively voice of one who is arguably its single
                  most personable author. Again, a close examination of the introduction, which opens
                  as follows, is revealing in terms of ideology and the impact it may have: <span class="quote">‘A thousand years ago [. . .] a lady at the imperial court of Japan settled herself
                     in front of a precious bundle of paper and began to write [an] extraordinary work
                     [. . .]. In it she wrote about her world, in a voice so vividly alive that we find
                     ourselves in the presence of a woman we recognize as we would a friend. (ix)’</span> While admittedly McKinney's idealistic approach may be charged with being as inaccurate
                  as Morris', it should come as no surprise that an early twenty-first-century woman
                  translator would want to highlight a strong, attractive female presence in world literary
                  history. Looking back through what is now well over a hundred years of Western readings
                  of the <em>Pillow Book</em>, it becomes evident that gender has been a prime focus in virtually all previous
                  versions as well, with translator prefaces and other commentary more often than not
                  revealing various degrees of misogyny, and so some sort of corrective is nonetheless
                  welcome.

                           (2011). Although this brief article does not have space to discuss gender and language
                           in any detail, it is certainly worth pointing out to students that whereas Heian Japanese
                           aristocratic men were educated to write in Chinese, their female counterparts wrote
                           exclusively in the vernacular language. In the Romanticism context, this fact may

            <p>The rare chance to have immediately to hand such a wealth of translations of a single
               literary text allows us valuable exposure to evolving attitudes as well as shifting
               fashions in literary reception, and perhaps above all the inherently non-transparent
               nature of the translation process. These forty-eight Western renditions of Sei Shônagon's
               <span class="foreign">haru wa akebono</span> passage reveal the astounding fertility of a work that continues to attract readers
               around the globe and to inspire such a flowering of creativity. They should also increase
               our students' critical awareness of both linguistic and cultural mediation and foster
               the ability to challenge reading practices that may serve merely to colonize the cultural
               production of other worlds and traditions. In exploring them in detail, we can help
               our students become more sensitized to the power relations involved whenever anyone,
               even with the best of intentions, steps forward to speak for and in the name of the
               other. The great diversity of interpretations is certain at the very least to debunk
               naïve assumptions of unproblematic equivalence.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Presenting a single text in such linguistic variety underscores the vital fact that
                  all reading masks the SL text while ostensibly revealing it. And the fact that no
                  autograph manuscript of this text is extant, in other words that the <em>Pillow Book</em> has no ultimate, authoritative source, should destabilize an all-too-common tendency
                  to fetishize the original at the expense of its readings and thus open up interpretive
                  possibilities. Prompted by the brief commentary on translation differences found on
                  the page facing each version in <em>Worlding Sei Shônagon</em>, students can go on to make their own discoveries. To set the stage for or, perhaps
                  more constructively, build upon the in-classroom exercise of writing their own <span class="foreign">zuihitsu</span> on Sei Shônagon's model (similarly to the <span class="foreign">haiku</span> exercise described above), students may be assigned specific existing interpretations
                  for analysis, comparison, or even (back-)translation. Those with a particular language
                  interest can be encouraged to focus on versions in that language, comparing and contrasting
                  the strategies employed and solutions found. An examination taking the chronology
                  of all of the translations included into account will allow speculation about the
                  rhythm by which a foreign text makes its appearance (or, in cases where there have
                  been more than one translation into a given language, repeated appearances) in different
                  linguistic communities, as well as discussion about the context in which it is received
                  (i.e. how the title, series, or publishing format can and does affect reader response).
                  The sample book covers provided in Appendix II of <em>Worlding Sei Shonagon</em> (Henitiuk 2012) reveal a range of marketing choices, which will prompt discussion
                  about how the packaging of a book can set up very distinct expectations as to its
                  content. And a careful look at adaptations or imitations inspired by any text allows
                  even further exploration of possible readings; in the case of Sei Shônagon's <em>Pillow Book</em>, there is a vast variety of material to choose from, including novels, short stories,
                  poems, films, and music (see Henitiuk, "Easyfree").

            <p>There are immense gains for students guided with care through a selection of versions
               of a single work of literature, and faculty seeking innovative and meaningful ways
               to engage with issues of authenticity, agency, as well as the relation between self
               and other will do well to use comparative translation in the classroom. An exploration
               of variant interpretations allows insightful glimpses into the complex nature of any
               literary text, and helps to ensure that students are able to read critically and productively.
               It reveals the multiple "afterlives" (Benjamin) that a given work of literature may
               enjoy in different times and places, and to different readers, and suggests the profound
               implications this has for reading. Approaching the teaching of translated texts in
               this way will effectively complicate our students' understanding of authorship, stimulate
               classroom discussion, and foreground the centrality of translational concepts to every
               act of reading literary works, Romantic or otherwise.</p>

               equivalence has been very influential in translation theory); Steiner 1975, Bassnett-McGuire

               directly to this text, see Henitiuk, 
               “Prefacing Gender: Framing Sei Shônagon for a Western Audience, 1875-2006”
               (2011). Although this brief article does not have space to discuss gender and language
               in any detail, it is certainly worth pointing out to students that whereas Heian Japanese
               aristocratic men were educated to write in Chinese, their female counterparts wrote
               exclusively in the vernacular language. In the Romanticism context, this fact may
               well allow for some interesting discussion related to Wordsworth's privileging of
               "the very language of men" in the 1802 Preface to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
