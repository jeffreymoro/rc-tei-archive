               <p>This essay presents the history of Hebrew-to-English translation as a platform for
                  teaching Romantic-era translation theories and methodologies more generally. To this
                  end, the following pages describe a strategic rather than exhaustive assortment of
                  primary and secondary texts on the nature, status, and translatability of the biblical
                  Hebrew language. The premise is that these combinations will enable students to learn
                  the topic while also allowing them to see how they might transfer the translation
                  studies insights they gain to other cultural and temporal contexts. In both undergraduate
                  and graduate classes on the Long Eighteenth Century or the Romantic period, the contentious
                  history of Hebrew-to-English translation is uniquely suited for linking together and
                  recapitulating topics already intimately familiar to scholars of the period, irrespective
                  of previous experience with British Hebraism. In fact, debates surrounding Hebrew-to-English
                  translation during this period meaningfully overlap and inform cultural phenomena
                  that Romanticists have long been investigating. Some of these I will discuss in detail,
                  including (a) the history of marginalized groups in Britain; (b) the political backgrounds
                  of religious dissent; (c) the development of empire and orientalism; and (d) primitivist
                  theories of poetic genius.</p>
               <p>As with any topic addressing translation studies, this one presents a challenge to
                  the monolingual limitations of many anglophone students. However, British Hebraism
                  is actually a flexible and approachable translation studies topic to introduce to
                  students who lack fluency in biblical languages. The reason for this is that given
                  the impressive number of translations from biblical material done during this period,
                  it is possible (though obviously not ideal) to lead a comparative conversation about
                  various different translations without consulting the original source text. For example,
                  one can combine translations of specific passages from the King James Version (KJV)
                  alongside various eighteenth-century, nineteenth-century, and contemporary reworkings
                  in order to see how biblical translation theories and methods have changed over time.
                  This allows students a way into translation studies and will perhaps interest them
                  in mastering the linguistic prerequisites necessary for pursuing the topic in the
                  future. I will speak in detail about sample texts one can use in class later in this
                  essay, but for now I would like to mention that the Psalms and the Book of Job are
                  particularly useful biblical books for demonstrating larger changes in translation
                  practice over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Especially with
                  the Psalms, one can juxtapose the KJV translation alongside early-eighteenth-century
                  traditions of hymnody as well as alongside Romantic-era translations, all of which
                  are dramatically and informatively different.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">(a) British Hebraism and the History of Marginalized Groups in Britain</span></h2>
               <p>The last two decades have seen stunning research on diverse forms of British Hebraism
                  during the eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries. The best of this research has
                  come out of the field of British Jewish studies, and for this reason, the situation
                  of British Jews can be used to historicize broader discussions about the history and
                  representation of marginalized ethnic, religious, socio-economic and racial groups
                  during the period. Historian Todd Endelman's <em>The Jews of Georgian England</em> (1999) is a crucial text for anyone pursuing this angle. Not only does it narrate
                  the growth (and growing pains) of a linguistically, socially, and politically varied
                  British Jewish community, it introduces terminology central to grasping the more focused
                  complexities of Hebrew-to-English translation as it occurred during this period. For
                  example, Endelman brilliantly discusses anti-Semitism alongside "philo-Semitism,"
                  a term he uses to refer to the period's widespread Christian eschatological fascination
                  with the ways Jews were implicated in the unfolding of Christian revelation. He likewise
                  provides instructive socio-political background on the passage and repeal of the "Jewish
                  Naturalization Act of 1753," to which much British Jewish (and anti-Jewish) political
                  activity in the Romantic period implicitly responds.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>David Ruderman's treatment of the same period, <em>Jewish Enlightenment in an English Key</em> (2000), has more to say about translation studies. Ruderman argues that methodological
                     disagreements about translating the Hebrew Bible into English must be mapped onto
                     contemporaneous political and theological debates between religious communities, including
                     a British Jewish community that became both increasingly anglophone and outspoken
                     throughout the period.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For population statistics, immigration patterns, and other socio-historical information
                              about the British Jewish community and its links to Europe, see Endelman's The Jews
                              of Georgian England.</span></div>
                     </div> In Ruderman's account, seemingly narrow arguments about translating biblical Hebrew—especially
                     its vowel marking systems—are always also the terrain of an intricate argument-by-proxy
                     over the evolving criteria of political inclusion within a schizophrenic polity that
                     in 1753-4 granted and then immediately rescinded citizenship rights for British Jews,
                     rights that were only fully granted through piecemeal legislation of the mid-to-late-nineteenth
                     century. I will return to the details of these debates shortly, but for now I would
                     like to dwell on the wider implications of Ruderman's interrogation of cultural politics
                     and otherness. The political restrictions that defined life for British Jews in the
                     eighteenth-century resonate with the experiences of other actively disenfranchised
                     groups, including Catholics, Quakers, Methodists, and the panoply of colonial subjects,
                     whether in the British Isles or abroad. Endelman and Ruderman's histories of Jewish
                     attempts to navigate language, identity, and assimilationist pressure can be compared
                     with other investigations <span class="foreign">vis-à-vis</span> other marginalized populations, like Robert Crawford's <em>Devolving English Literature</em> (1992), for instance, which contains a trenchant analysis of the geographical, educational,
                     and linguistic trajectories by which Scots and other non-English subjects questioned,
                     subverted, and sometimes even reinforced English metropolitan hegemony within the
                     ever diversifying British Empire.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>While Endelman and Ruderman's texts are informed by the methods of cultural and political
                     history, Sheila Spector's work on the Jewish community of Romantic-era Britain is
                     more directly related to literary Romanticism. Spector's monographs foreground the
                     role of Jewish cultural practices in the formation of the poets Blake and Byron. The
                     contexts she outlines facilitate a host of new ways to read these figures, including
                     Blake's Kabbalistic subtext

                     </div> Moreover, the best essays in Spector's three edited volumes interrogate Romantic representations
                     of Jews and Jewish culture, thereby shedding refreshing light on familiar texts like
                     Scott's <em>Old Mortality</em> (1816), Edgeworth's <em>Harrington</em> (1817), and Dickens's <em>Oliver Twist</em> (1838).

                     </div> In short, Spector and the authors collected in her edited volumes are the central
                     figures for any research into the "interaction" and "blending" that occurred between
                     "British and Jewish cultures" during the Romantic period (Spector, <em>British Romanticism and the Jews</em> 1, 2, 9, et passim). Their purposeful yoking of British Romanticism and British Jews
                     brings to the fore previously overlooked Jewish writers and translators—like David
                     Levi (1742-1801), Isaac D'Israeli (1766-1848), and Hyman Hurwitz (1770-1844)—in the
                     same way recent studies from other fields have recuperated writers previously omitted
                     from discussion. The argument that Romantic writing's diversity far exceeds the formerly
                     hermetic Romantic canon will be familiar to anyone who has had contact with the valuable
                     archives of women's writing, Scottish writing, Irish writing, counterflows to colonialism,
                     slave narratives, and other work by writers of color, all of which the field owes
                     to research of the past several decades.</p>

                  <p>Obscure and yet prolific London-born Jewish scholar David Levi, for example, can only
                     be understood as someone who straddled overlapping cultural milieux. He was an accomplished
                     anglophone writer who sparred in journals with Thomas Paine over Paine's excoriations
                     of prophecy, as well as with Joseph Priestley over Priestley's "amicable" invitation

                     </div> As a true multilingual, Levi's commitment to Jewish political rights and religious
                     heritage resulted in a comprehensive intervention into his era's translation practices.
                     The three successive volumes of <em>Lingua Sacra</em> in 1785, 1789, and 1803 took the form of a comprehensive Hebrew-to-English lexicon
                     and commentary, in which Levi approached biblical Hebrew and the rabbinical tradition
                     as a steward, one whose knowledge of Jewish tradition allowed him to advance British
                     Jewish interests by rectifying biblical mistranslations on which both anti-Semitic
                     and philo-Semitic discourses were based. <em>Lingua Sacra</em>'s title page displays this will to correct Christian mistakes and typological interpellations: <span class="quote">‘[E]nriched with Notes; in which are shewn the Grammatical Errors and Inaccuracies
                        of the most distinguished Grammarians, and other Writers in the Hebrew Language [.

                                 Version, the selfsame translation Christians used. Solomon Bennett issued A Specimen
                                 of a New Version of the Hebrew Bible in 1836 and he included significant reworkings
                                 of a number of the most important passages and books. It was, however, canonically

                  <p>When David Levi was writing in the 1780s and 1790s, he was responding directly to
                     Hebrew translation practices as they had been elaborated over the course of the eighteenth
                     century, during which time all British religious communities contributed to the translation
                     boom surrounding the Authorized Version's English form. Jonathan Sheehan's <em>Enlightenment Bible</em> (2005) has documented these preoccupations with renovating biblical material, attributing
                     them to a prevailing sense that parts of the Bible suddenly appeared distant, barbaric,
                     and antiquated rather than omnitemporal or universally applicable. Historian Neil
                     Hitchin has analyzed the retranslation frenzy by focusing on attempts to create a
                     governmentally sponsored Bible retranslation committee like the one that had produced
                     the King James Version in 1611. Though Hitchin omits Jewish voices entirely, he elucidates
                     details of the eighteenth century's (Christian) "cultural politics of religion" (68),
                     which included dissenters seeking a greater stake in national religious life and certain
                     pillars of the Anglican establishment seeking measured changes to official translations
                     that would protect the Church's stability and authority.

                     a rise in differing methods of reading, translating, and "knowing" the Hebrew language
                     (some far more accurate than others). It was the most radical Christian ways of "knowing"
                     the language that Levi would ultimately seek to discredit and debunk.

                  <p>Here it is important to note that within British Christian communities Hebrew had
                     traditionally occupied an odd position in the Hebrew-Greek-Latin scriptural triumvirate.
                     Amongst Anglicans, it was less taught and less well known than the others, likely
                     because Greek and Latin both had non-religious histories that were embedded in the
                     educational system's admiration of the classical world. Commentators noticed the pall
                     of low Hebrew literacy amongst the Anglican clergy. The publishing industry responded
                     with a sudden boom in Hebrew pedagogical materials, many of which criticized clergymen
                     for their poor knowledge of Hebrew grammar. These pedagogical texts promised that
                     enhanced teaching methods would benefit Church leaders while building a pediment on
                     which to erect a national spiritual revival, or as Hitchin has it, "a nationally comprehensive,
                     protestant Church of England" (70). An analogous situation held true in the British
                     Jewish community, as Endelman and Ruderman both point out.

                  <p>One way to trace the entwined political and theological interests that sought updates
                     to anglophone scriptures is through the slew of Hebrew grammars that hit the markets
                     between roughly 1740 and 1830, many of which were designed for novice and autodidact
                     readers. While Christians produced the majority of them, British Jews also published
                     anglophone grammars.

                              Anglo-Judaica.</span></div>
                     </div> Put in a way that highlights the cultural specificity of these texts, grammars promising
                     to teach the Hebrew language to Christians and written by Christians circulated alongside
                     grammars written by Jews with the stated aim of teaching the holy language solely
                     to wayward British Jews. A third and hybrid typology is also visible: anglophone grammars
                     and lexicons like Levi's that promised to reveal the true character of Hebrew to both
                     Jews and misled Christians. It is important to reiterate that Standard English was
                     the new framing language for these new grammars. Whereas early-eighteenth-century
                     Hebrew grammars circulated mostly within Anglican universities, Jewish community schools,
                     and dissenting academies, thereby presupposing knowledge of Latin or Rabbinic (Mishnaic)
                     Hebrew, the anglophone materials of the second half of the century facilitated access
                     to a larger readership. In this way, Hebrew literacy spread to women, dissenters,
                     and figures like Joseph Priestley, a man kept out of a traditional Anglican university
                     by his convictions and the Test Acts. For their part, British Jews like Levi increasingly
                     chose English over German, Spanish, Portuguese, Rabbinic Hebrew, Yiddish, and other
                     Jewish heritage languages. Suffice it to say, the accessibility of anglophone-Hebrew
                     learning materials bred new and sometimes schismatic translation theories and practices.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>One of the most influential of these theories involved the wholesale cultural decontextualization
                     of the language and is best broached through the work of theologian John Hutchinson
                     (1674-1737). Hutchinson's belief in timeless rabbinic deceit drove his attempts to
                     purge Hebrew of its Jewish traces. In one publication, Hutchinson identifies five
                     sorts of treacherous men: <span class="quote">‘1. Men who pretend to be directed by the Scriptures, but never learn to read and understand
                        them. 2. Men who allow the Scriptures to be read, and construed, as the apostate Jews
                        have pointed and explained them. 3. Men who pretend the Church of <em>Rome</em> has a power to construe and supersede the written Rules in Scripture. 4. Men who pretend
                        to have a supernatural Director within each of them, which they are to follow, without
                        regard to the Scripture. 5. Men who neither regard Scripture, Church, nor, &amp;c. any
                        farther than it serves their turns; but will each form Schemes, and determine everything
                        by his own Reason, and demonstrate from his own <em>Data</em>, by Mathematics and Experiments (<em>Covenant</em> 2-3).’</span> Referencing theological contempt of Jews, Catholics, Deists, and atheists here, another
                     passage renounces Jewish writing altogether: "We have nothing to do with the Translations
                     or Paraphrases of the Apostate Jews" (<em>Treatise</em> 5), a claim that underlies Hutchinson's severing of biblical Hebrew from the Jewish
                     commentaries, glossaries, and translations on which Christian translators had always
                     relied.

                              Westminister. One of the stated operational principles of this team was to rely heavily
                              on earlier versions such as the Geneva, Coverdale, Tyndale, and Bishops's Bibles.

                     subtended the production of the KJV, Hutchinsonian thinking characterizes the writings
                     of Alexander Catcott, Benjamin Holloway, George Horne, William Jones of Nayland, and
                     later John Parkhurst, all influential writers who contributed to the most polemical
                     and anti-Semitic Hebrew translation practices during the period.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>For these Hutchinsonians, the central translation problem involved the nature of the
                     Hebrew writing system, which can be described as an abjad of consonantal characters
                     surrounded by diacritic dots and dashes that mark vowel quality, accentuation, and
                     cantillation. Hebrew vowel markers (<span class="foreign">niqqud</span>, pl. <span class="foreign">niqqudot</span>) were frequently referred to as "points" during the period, and Hutchinsonians renounced
                     them by calling them Jewish impositions that debased a once divine script. The claim
                     that "points" occluded true Christian meanings was but one prong of a much larger
                     rejection of all the cultural history contained in the <em>Masorah</em>, or traditional Jewish textual commentary. Historian David Katz describes the Hutchinsonian
                     method as follows: "Grammar and the history of linguistic development are angrily
                     thrust aside, as Hutchinson and his followers argued that this [the appearance of
                     irregularity], like all features of the Old Testament, had been planned by God himself"
                     (<em>Skeptics</em> 240). Eliminating "points" from the Hebrew writing system produces considerable lexical
                     and interpretive difficulties, especially for beginners.

                     discussions. Hitchin writes, "Dissenters often described literal translations as '<em>slavish</em> and literal' [. . .]. Liberty and freedom in translation were prized by translators
                     in the republican or neo-Roman tradition" (72). While Hutchinsonianism was not necessarily
                     dissent, its will to get out from under a perceived Jewish yoke takes on and reflects

                     Jewish techniques for preserving Hebrew literacy colors Parkhurst's <em>An Hebrew and English Lexicon</em>. First printed in 1762 and subsequently republished in 1778, 1799, 1807, 1811, and
                     1823, the work rehearses the line that Hebrew was easier to acquire (and distort)
                     "when unembarrassed with Points" (xii). Here Parkhurst brazenly promises the reader
                     that study of Hebrew "unadulterated with the Rabbinical Points, <em>in a few months</em>, [would] enable him to read in the original with ease and delight, most parts of
                     those <em>Holy Scriptures</em>, <em>all of which,</em> St. Paul assures us, <em>were given by inspiration of God,</em> and <em>are able to make us wise unto salvation, through Faith, which is in Jesus Christ</em>" (10-1). After this polemic, the text lists and defines Hebrew words according to
                     an exceptionally idiosyncratic understanding of the language. This work perpetuates
                     the Hutchinsonian opinion that Hebrew writing was divine, but its itinerant vowel
                     systems were illegitimate, an assumption that was then transmitted to eager autodidact

               <p>I have dwelled on the Hutchinsonian lineage of Hebrew-to-English translation because
                  it represents a mode of theological and teleological translation that was eccentric,
                  philosophically bankrupt, and inevitably moribund even upon its first appearance.
                  While it was influential, many dissenters and Anglican theologians reacted against
                  the obvious revisionism inherent in the Hutchinsonian system, a system that unmoored
                  biblical Hebrew from any verifiable historical and cultural contexts. By contrast,
                  dissenting preacher John Taylor's <em>The Hebrew Concordance</em> (1754-7) included all <span class="foreign">niqqud</span> and <span class="foreign">masorah</span> and self-consciously based itself on the models of dissenter theologian Joseph Priestley
                  and Unitarian minister Theophilus Lindsey, both of whom argued that historically accurate
                  knowledge of Hebrew justified dissenting religious doctrines. Priestley, for instance,
                  rooted his interpretations of Hebrew in philological comparisons of related Semitic
                  languages, as he describes in his memoirs of teaching: "I instructed in Hebrew, and
                  by that means made myself a considerable proficient in that language. At the same
                  time, I learned Chaldee and Syriac, and just began to read Arabic" (<em>Memoirs</em> 9). Anglican theologian Anselm Bayly's 1773 Hebrew grammar strikes an ecumenical
                  and empirical tone as a foil to the excesses of Hutchinsonian thinking: <span class="quote">‘Men of letters, with respect to the Hebrew [. . .] are unhappily divided into two
                     parties, the Jews with some Christians for the Points, as absolutely necessary, and
                     some Christians against them; who [. . .] have run to the other extreme by maintaining,
                     that the Points are so far from being of any use at all, that their design was to
                     confound and mislead.’</span> Bayly continued by reaching out to British-Jewish scholars and advocating a collaboration
                  that would have been patently offensive to Hutchinson's followers: "to effect a real
                  and lasting union," Bayly writes, "the best method perhaps would be, for some person
                  of candor and moderation, who is conversant in the Rabinical [sic] writings, to lay
                  open the Points, or however the ground of them, faithfully and plainly" (2). This
                  statement evokes the long tradition of Jewish-Christian lineages of tutoring, teaching,
                  and transmission, and I mention it because it is firmly within this tradition of intellectual
                  and philosophical exchange that we should locate Hyman Hurwitz, one of the most interesting

                     expelled from England from the late-thirteenth century until the 1650s, grammatical,
                     religious, and kabbalistic works circulated into Britain from Jewish centers in Iberia,
                     Amsterdam, and Eastern Europe, while a small network of crypto-Jews lived on discreetly
                     in London, Cambridge, Oxford, and other port cities.

                     facilitate their studies. In <em>Philo-Semitism</em>, David Katz cites biographical sketches of John Immanuel Tremellius, Jacob Wolfgang,
                     and Jacob Barnet to document this very point. After the Jewish resettlement in 1655,
                     eighteenth-century historian D'Blossiers Tovey hearkened back to the eleventh-century
                     reign of William Rufus to explain the role of Jewish tutors in education, a pedagogic
                     necessity that would have been familiar to students at Oxford in his own day: "In
                     one of the parishes [of Oxford] they also had a <em>School</em>, or <em>Synagogue</em>; wherein certain <em>Rabbies</em> instructed, not only their own People, but, several of the Christian Students of the <em>University</em>, in the <em>Hebrew</em> Learning and Language" (9). Though there had been Hebrew chairs at Oxford and Cambridge
                     since 1540, it is clear that the Christian establishment continually relied upon Jewish
                     scholarly help in translation and exegesis.

                  <p>The details of Hurwitz's life are simple but unusual. Immigrating to Britain around
                     1800, he spent a brief stint as a Hebrew teacher at a Christian school before opening
                     a school for Jewish youth known as Highgate Academy.

                     </div> Through mutual acquaintances he became the friend and tutor of Samuel Taylor Coleridge,
                     a relationship I will discuss through reference to a Coleridgian translation in the
                     final section of this paper. In 1828, Hurwitz's personality, openness, and writings
                     secured him an appointment as the first Jewish professor of Hebrew at University College
                     London, an institution that did not require its professors to conform to the Test
                     Acts. The <em>Bibliotheca Anglo-Judaica</em> deems the <em>Elements of the Hebrew Language</em> (1828) to be his most important work, noting that it "went through many editions,
                     and was for a long time the standard Hebrew grammar among English Jews" (Jacobs and
                     Wolf 223). As in Levi, this text attacks those who would dissociate biblical Hebrew
                     from its cultural context, but it does so in a way that still invites novice readers
                     of any faith into the pleasures of the Hebrew language. This is attributable to Hurwitz's
                     vocation as an educator for all levels and confessions, but it also derives from his
                     uniquely cosmopolitan cast of mind.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Cultural ecumenism can be seen in Hurwitz's <em>Essay on the Uninspired Literature of the Hebrews</em> as well as the playful Rabbinic parables of <em>Hebrew Tales</em> (1826) that the essay introduces. As a translator and defender of Mishnaic literature,
                     Hurwitz accentuates the antiquity of the Jewish lore while dressing it in an appealing
                     and contemporary anglophone style. Judith Page has written about Hurwitz's engagement
                     with the British literary tradition, and one example of his Mishnaic glosses will
                     serve here to confirm Page's point. Like many, the section from the <em>Hebrew Tales</em> called 
                     “Milton's 'Dark from Excess of Light'”
                      presupposes the reader's familiarity both with Book Three of <em>Paradise Lost</em> and with the Mishnaic book <em>Kodoshim</em>. With these subtexts, Hurwitz launches into cultural syncretism, describing how Rabbi
                     Joshua asked Emperor Trajan to stare at the sun after Trajan had questioned God's
                     omnipresence. When the sun's brightness blackens Trajan's vision, Rabbi Joshua asks,
                     "Thou art unable to endure the light of one of his creatures and canst thou expect
                     to behold the resplendent glory of the Creator?" (<em>Tales</em> 64). The image of God's "excessive brightness" in Milton's Christian epic is here
                     given a Jewish precursor.

                     </div> Working on the British canon, Hurwitz's translation is almost the inverse of Christian
                     typology as it locates Jewish subtexts for Christian stories. The goal is to formulate
                     a cultural history in which Jewish thought and philosophy are recognized as constitutive
                     of British identity and not opposed to it. Hurwitz's 
                     “Essay on Uninspired Literature”
                      and the <em>Hebrew Tales</em> have been compared to Wordsworth and Coleridge's preface to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, but they can also be likened to phenomena like Ossianism, Percy's <em>Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</em> (1765), or the diverse texts of overseas orientalism.

               <h2><span class="head">(c) British Hebraism, Empire, and Orientalism</span></h2>
               <p>Thus far, the frameworks within which I have been describing British Hebraism and
                  Hebrew-to-English translation have been too-narrowly restricted. There are broader
                  contexts within which to understand this movement, and one of these concerns the expanding
                  British empire's production of novel cultural contacts, its exoticizing interest in
                  foreign linguistic traditions, and its diverse new lines of translation. As scholars
                  have long recognized, empire brought British economic power to bear on cultural exchange,
                  thereby facilitating the importation of new manuscripts, the hiring of native informants,
                  and the rise of a class of professional translators charged with making the East legible
                  to the colonial apparatus. Since biblical Hebrew was by its very ontology simultaneously
                  European and non-European, "occidental" and "oriental"—a language at the center of
                  Christianity and at its edges—studying its relationship to orientalism shows that
                  orientalism borrowed from while also reinforced theories generated first in studies
                  of the Hebrew scriptures. </p>
               <p>The geopolitical configurations underwriting new interest in biblical Hebrew translation
                  are perhaps best introduced through the work of another Anglican theologian, Benjamin
                  Kennicott, the leader of a massive biblical collation project. Brilliantly brought
                  to life in Ruderman's <em>Jewish Enlightenment in an English Key</em>, Kennicott was, like Hutchinson, antagonistic to the Jewish tradition, protesting
                  of the Hebrew Scriptures in 1774, "They have indeed undergone many great and grievous
                  Corruptions, occasioned by the ignorance or negligence of transcribers" (<em>Sacra</em> 3). Kennicott's sense of scriptural "Corruption" provoked his attempt to execute
                  an end-run around Jewish intermediaries by way of other near Eastern languages like
                  Samaritan and Aramaic. Having collated and compared roughly seventy extant manuscripts,
                  Kennicott concluded in his first dissertation, <em>The State of the Printed Hebrew Text</em> of 1753, that textual variations among them engendered enough doubt as to require
                  an extensive (Christian) reassessment of the Old Testament canon. In his second dissertation
                  of 1759, he legitimized the continuation of his project in the following way, <span class="quote">‘The chief argument, for the <em>usefulness</em> of such an undertaking, was founded upon the discovery of many Heb. MSS, which contain'd
                     very material variations; and such, as would render it probable—that mistakes more
                     in number, and more considerable in their nature, would appear to have been made by
                     <em>the Jews</em>, in their transcripts of the <em>old</em> Testament (notwithstanding their so-much-boasted accuracy) than appear to have been
                     made by <em>the Christian</em> transcribers of the <em>new</em> Testament. (<em>State</em> 7)’</span> Though he pretended to a sort of proto-scientific objectivity, the ideological nature
                  of Kennicott's project was reinforced by the way that his italicized chiasmus forced
                  the reader to digest again the oft-repeated Christian mantra that "<em>the Jews</em>" were to "the <em>old</em>" as "<em>the Christian</em>" was to "the <em>new</em>." Kennicott's goal was to break the perceived transmission monopoly that Jewish sources
                  had over the biblical corpus. By 1760, he was soliciting financial support toward
                  the goal of purchasing as many biblical manuscripts as possible from across the world;
                  over £12,000, twenty years, and 30 volumes later, his new Bible collation was complete.
                  The Kennicott Bible was published at Oxford between 1776 and 1780. It claimed to feature
                  the most accurate possible conflations of 684 manuscripts, and is still regarded as
                  one of the largest and most significant collation projects undertaken in modern biblical
                  history.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The implications of Kennicott's orientalism for translation studies are critical:
                     like Hutchinsonians, Kennicott annexed to himself the authority to rewrite the scriptures
                     through contrived textual sciences as a way to bypass traditional Jewish learning.
                     Of course, the other interesting aspect of Kennicott's project is the way it configures
                     the Near East as a distinct repository of authentic cultural material upon which a
                     British scholar could bring the money and linguistic skills necessary for gleaning
                     specifically Christian truths. As Hitchin writes, "Improving access to near eastern
                     lands was a boon to translators. Comparing Arabic and Syriac words with ancient Hebrew
                     words was increasingly treated as an indispensable adjunct for biblical philology"
                     (79). In this respect, Edward Said's link between biblical study and orientalism in
                     the sense of the East as a career-making object of study is borne out most obviously.

               <h2><span class="head">(d) British Hebraism and Primitivist Theories of Poetic Genius</span></h2>
               <p>Closely related to the admittedly brief preceding section on British Hebraism and
                  orientalism is the primitivist underpinnings of much Hebrew-English translation during
                  this period. A teacher interested in this angle should begin, as others have, with
                  the writing and translations of Bishop of London Robert Lowth, for Lowth's notes on
                  method in <em>De Sacra Poesi Hebraeorum Praelectiones Academicae Oxonii Habitae</em> (1753; English Version 1787) and his fulfillment of that method in <em>Isaiah: A New Translation</em> (1778) were vital reference points for a generation of translators and poets irrespective
                  of interest in Hebrew. M.H. Abrams writes of Lowth's lectures, "Such an elaborate
                  and comprehensive critical examination of the Hebrew Bible, considered as a collection
                  of poetic documents, was bound to have a radical impact on the accepted system of
                  criticism" (76). The influence of Lowth's lectures on poetic and translation practice
                  was similarly profound.</p>
               <p>In his writings, Lowth's basic assertion is that Hebrew poetry operates according
                  to its own logic, a logic entirely separate from more familiar Greek and Latin poetic
                  conventions: "Whatever it might be that constituted Hebrew verse, it certainly did
                  not consist in rhyme, or similar and correspondent sounds at the ends of verses [.
                  . .] it is manifest that rhymes, or similar endings, are not an essential part of
                  Hebrew verse" (<em>Isaiah</em> viii). Eschewing Hutchinson's paranoid venom against perfidious Jews, <em>De sacra poesi Hebraeorum</em> claims merely that attenuated lines of transmission brought Hebrew to eighteenth-century
                  England and thus the true nature of Hebrew verse had been obscured: "Not so much as
                  the number of syllables [. . .] could with any certainty be defined [. . .]. He who
                  attempts to restore the true and genuine Hebrew versification, erects an edifice without
                  a foundation" (<em>Lectures</em> 39). Just like an antiquarian deciphering a runic inscription, Lowth compensates
                  as best he can, for absent any exact system of versification, the poet-translator-theologian
                  must reinvent the English dress that Hebrew will take on.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Lowth is best known for advancing the thesis that three types of thematic parallelism
                     structured biblical poems.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note21" id="Note21_return"><sup class="super">
                              (21)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For a more contemporary reading that preserves some of Lowth's structures, see James
                              Kugel's The Idea of biblical Poetry: Parallelism and Its History.</span></div>
                     </div> First was synonymous parallelism, wherein two parts of one verse echoed one another,
                     as in the first line of Psalm 114: "When Israel went out of Egypt, / the house of
                     Jacob from a people of strange language." The second type of parallelism fuses two
                     antithetical half-verses, as in 1 Samuel 2:4-5: "The bows of the mighty are broken
                     / and they that stumbled are girded with strength." The third variety of parallelism
                     repeats a grammatical form over multiple verses like in Psalm 19:8-11: "The law of
                     Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul; / The testimony of Jehovah is sure, making
                     wise the simple; / The percepts of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart; / The commandment
                     of Jehovah is clear, enlightening the eyes." The unfolding of the four lines is parallel,
                     but also additive; the sum of the four offers more than each line individually. Lowth's
                     focus on reproducing these biblical Hebrew traits in eighteenth-century English goes
                     so far as to alter—or <em>augment</em>—English's capacities. Lowth makes English speak in Hebrew's forms rather than the
                     other way around. He uses space, parallelism, and repetition to produce a translation
                     distant from English poetic traditions, especially the traditions of paraphrase and
                     versification associated with Isaac Watts and others.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Lowth's translation of <em>Isaiah</em> takes this logic into another dimension, criticizing translators for rendering prophetic
                     writings as prose when in fact Lowth saw them as poetry. His updating of Isaiah 53,
                     one of the most celebrated typological moments in the Bible, exemplifies how translation
                     can pursue Anglican prophecy <em>through</em> anglophone Hebrew poetry.

                     in 53:7. Where the KJV reads, "He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened
                     not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her
                     shearers is dumme, so he openeth not his mouth," Lowth reformulates the lines, 
                     <blockquote class="quote">
                        <div class="stanza">
                           <div class="l">It was exacted, and he was made answerable; and he opened not his mouth: </div>
                           <div class="l">As a lamb that is led to the slaughter, </div>
                           <div class="l">And as a sheep before her shearers, </div>
                           <div class="l">Is dumb; so he opened not his mouth (Lowth, <em>Isaiah</em> 155).</div>
                        </div>
                     </blockquote> Here Lowth locates synonymous parallelism in the second and third lines. Additionally,
                     because poetry is meant to enhance prophecy, Lowth establishes a link between the
                     passive <span class="foreign">niggas</span> ('exacted') and the passive causative <span class="foreign">na'aneh</span> ('made answerable'). His changes produce a strange sort of poem on the page, and while
                     still replete with Christological symbolism, it acts on English-language aesthetic
                     traditions in a way that prefigures other intentionally archaized writings of the
                     period, such as Coleridge's 
                     “Rime of the Ancyent Marinere”
                      (1798) or 
                     “Christabel”
                      (1797-1800).

                              on at least four separate occasions. In the 90-year period between 1750 and 1840 there
                              appeared fourteen separate Hebrew-to-English translations of Song of Songs. Perhaps

                  <p>In fact, this archaizing impulse in Coleridge is one of the ways British Hebraism
                     can supplement our knowledge of the period. Coleridge obtained Lowth's <em>De Sacra Poesi Hebraeorum</em> from the library in Bristol in 1796 (Halmi 352; Whalley 114-42). When he translated
                     the opening of the "Song of Deborah" (Judges 5:1-10) in December 1799—before he had
                     ever studied with Hurwitz—it is clear that from Lowth he had developed his own conception
                     of how biblical Hebrew material operated (Halmi 352-4). For one, Coleridge quotes
                     Lowth several times in <em>Lectures on Revealed Religion</em> (1795) (McKusick 412). Additionally, he rehearses Lowth's theory of biblical parallelism
                     in an explanatory note: "The Song of Deborah, translated in the * parallelisms of
                     the Original / (* that is, so that each Line or member of a sentence is counter-balanced
                     by the following, either by difference or similitude, or by the repetition of the
                     same thought in different words or with a different Image" (<em>Poems</em> 254). In his deployment of these forms, Coleridge shows that he is interested in 
                     “The Song of Deborah”
                      as a historical relic unique to a specific time and place, but also that he is interested
                     in the passage as a transcendental and even transhistorical overflow of powerful feelings,
                     what James McKusick terms a "crisis of mental activity finding a volcanic outlet in
                     language" (414).

                  <p>Coleridge judges the

                      to be "as simple a dithyrambic production as exists in any language" (<em>Shakespearean Criticism</em> 426). And indeed, 
                     “The Song of Deborah”
                      is widely believed to be one of the oldest, if not the oldest piece of poetry in the
                     Hebrew corpus even though the difficulties in dating it are many (Globe 495; Smith
                     81). Coleridge knew about the song's antiquity and in <em>Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit</em> he even adduced it as evidence arguing against the scriptures being dictated by an
                     "infallible Intelligence" (31). Rather than considering the Bible as "a hollow passage
                     for a voice, a voice that mocks the voices of many men" (32), Coleridge saw the Bible
                     as a composition, animated but not dictated by a holy spirit, <span class="quote">‘All the several books bound up together in our precious family Bibles were composed
                        in different and widely distant ages, under the greatest diversity of circumstances,
                        and degrees of light and information, and yet the composers, whether as uttering or
                        as recording what was uttered and what was done, were all actuated by a pure and holy
                        Spirit [. . .] one Spirit, working diversly.

               <p>His poem attempts to reconstruct an authentic feeling of that historicity through
                  language and form. He confesses in his letter, <span class="quote">‘As long as I have the image of Deborah before my eyes, and while I throw myself back
                     into the age, country, circumstances, of this Hebrew Bonduca in the not yet tamed
                     chaos of the spiritual creation;—as long as I contemplate the impassioned, high-souled
                     heroic woman in all the prominence and individuality of will and character,—I feel
                     as if I were among the first ferments of the great affections—the proplastic waves
                     of the microcosmic chaos, swelling up against—and yet towards—the outspread wings
                     of the Dove that lies brooding on the troubled waters (34-5).’</span> Deborah's fervid song celebrates an Israelite victory, and while trying to make her
                  language historically specific, Coleridge writes her genealogy through his own context,
                  firstly through Christian patrimony and secondly through his evocation of "Bonduca"
                  or Boudica, the rebellious Celtic warrior-queen. He locates and transmits "great affections"
                  across the "proplastic waves of the microcosmic chaos," a strategy he would later

               <p> The effect of Coleridge's rendition is immediate. It strips away traditional verse
                  numberings in favor of formulating nine discrete stanzas. Within the first three lines
                  of his first stanza, Coleridge launches a formal revision of the song in which he
                  completes in the third line the syntactic palindrome begun by the first ("sang Deborah";
                  "sang they"), while simultaneously redoubling its semantic content. The intervening
                  line, "And Barak, Abinoams's Son", possesses its own synonymous parallelism in the
                  metonymic apostrophe to Barak's name. This three-line stanza is all the more striking
                  given that in neither the Hebrew version nor the KJV are these lines are part of the
                  song. Verse II reiterates and extends this pattern. The first and last lines echo
                  one another, and the lines between them proceed strictly in parallel: two lines narrating
                  God's movements, three beautifully simplistic lines describing the sublime effect
                  of God's presence, and two lines depicting the annihilation of mountains, themselves
                  already a sublime object of contemplation. The interlocking diction contributes to
                  the image's sublimity: when God moves, everything is destabilized and liquid. In the
                  KJV's "the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water" (Judges 5:4), the image
                  of rain is more emphatic and more restrictive of creative interpretation. Coleridge's
                  version, however, makes rain but one in a number of possible interpretations of the
                  semantic chain "dissolved," "poured," and "melted." When God marches, dissolution
                  ensues: of the physical world, of spiritual enemies, and of the self.</p>

                  <p>As a Hebrew victory-ballad, 
                     “The Song of Deborah”
                      stands out in the Bible as a ritualized performance. It caps and extends the prose
                     narrative of Judges 4 with a triumphant prayer celebrating the community's fortification.
                     In Verse III, Coleridge attends to Deborah's role as prophetess and warrior, intervening
                     with a significant shift in verb tense, from the past "arose" to the present "arise"
                     in the translation of <span class="foreign">shakkamti</span>. Thematically, this shift stresses the lasting implications of Deborah's bravery
                     for the community. McKusick attributes Coleridge's variation to a discovery of how
                     to express shifting tense that occurs frequently in the Bible, "as Coleridge could
                     have learned from any grammar book" (414). This reading points to the importance of
                     the new Hebrew grammatical tradition.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note27" id="Note27_return"><sup class="super">
                              (27)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>It is worth noting that the translation of this verse is actually quite complicated
                              and even controversial. The 1917 Jewish Publication Society's English language Bible,
                              the standard English-language Jewish Bible opts for an entirely different verb person,
                              "The rulers ceased in Israel, they ceased, until that thou didst arise, Deborah, that
                              thou didst arise a mother in Israel."</span></div>
                     </div> For my part, I want to suggest that Coleridge is deliberately invoking an antithetical
                     parallelism between "They ceased, till I arose, Deborah" and "Till that I [Deborah]
                     arise, a mother in Israel." My reading emphasizes that these two events reference
                     different moments in the historical narrative. Deborah's song first thinks back to
                     the moment before she went into battle, just after she "arose," and then jumps forward
                     to the moment after the war's victory when she "arise[s], a mother in Israel" or,
                     equivalently, when she arises as the mother of Israel. Such a reading corresponds
                     to the emphasis on Deborah's motherhood in <em>Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit</em>, at the same time as it equates Deborah-as-mother and Deborah-as-warmonger storming
                     the Caananites' gates (Verse IV, line 2).</p>
               </div>
               <p>More can be said about Coleridge's unpublished translation, and firmer lines can be
                  drawn to his other work, but what I have tried to do here is simply reveal a local
                  example of the effect biblical translation discourses had on literary production.
                  In fact, throughout the entirety of this essay, I have opted for strategic rather
                  than exhaustive descriptions of how to integrate British Hebraism into courses. As
                  any reader of this likely feels, there is obviously more work to be done. Sketching
                  various lines of lineage between British Hebraism and orientalism, for instance, is
                  an ideal topic for an undergraduate research or graduate seminar paper. Other topics
                  have equal potential, and I hope that what has been only gestural in this paper will
                  be realized in the work of others. </p>

               and which I opine to be the principal cause of the encrease [sic] of Deism." At this
               point in time the Jewish anglophone Bible was the Old Testament of the Authorized
               Version, the selfsame translation Christians used. Solomon Bennett issued <em>A Specimen of a New Version of the Hebrew Bible</em> in 1836 and he included significant reworkings of a number of the most important
               passages and books. It was, however, canonically incomplete. It was not until 1851
               in England and 1853 in America did complete, specifically anglophone-Jewish translations
               of the <em>Tanakh</em> appear. The first two were Abraham Benisch's <em>A Translation of the Old Testament, Published with Hebrew Text</em> (1851) and Isaac Leeser's <em>The Twenty-four books of the Holy Scriptures</em> (1853).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               fourth section. For his part, Hitchin summarizes some of aesthetic motivations for
               his retranslation in the following terms: "Many felt that the old translation [the
               KJV] left much to be desired from the point of view of English-language usage. Diction
               and style were much changed in the intervening time" (75). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">A 47-person team of Anglican clerics produced the translation that came to be known
               as the Authorized Version in three centers of translation: Oxford, Cambridge, and
               Westminister. One of the stated operational principles of this team was to rely heavily
               on earlier versions such as the Geneva, Coverdale, Tyndale, and Bishops's Bibles.
               All of these and the King James Bible as well required textual and personal consultation
               with the Jewish Tradition. For approachable introductions to the KJV translation,
               see Alister McGrath's <em>In the Beginning</em> and David Crystal's <em>Begat: The King James Bible and the English Language</em>. For more scholarly analyses, see in particular the

               translations, Exodus was translated thrice, and assorted chapters of Numbers and Deuteronomy
               were published as well. Ecclesiastes, that mystical book, was retranslated and published
               on at least four separate occasions. In the 90-year period between 1750 and 1840 there
               appeared fourteen separate Hebrew-to-English translations of Song of Songs. Perhaps
               the most difficult and yet most popular of biblical translation projects besides the

               is a product of convention. In Hebrew, however, the first verse does make clear that

               the standard English-language Jewish Bible opts for an entirely different verb person,
