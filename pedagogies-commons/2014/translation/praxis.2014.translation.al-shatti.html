               <p>In an age of intense cross-cultural exchange, cyber communication, and an increased
                  critical interest in the effects of transnationalism and cultural integration, it
                  is not only important but also necessary to expose our students to foreign texts in
                  translation. Such an exercise yields many benefits: a) it allows our students to situate
                  the texts that they read within a broader context that is not delimited by national
                  and linguistic barriers, b) it forces them to think about how texts are transferred
                  across borders through translation, to be received and assimilated in different cultures,
                  c) it causes them to be more aware of the intercultural and transnational exchanges
                  between nations, and finally d) it allows them to think about the factors that are
                  conducive and obstructive with regard to the processes of translation, appropriation,
                  and intertextuality. </p>
               <p>This exercise is even more important in our courses on Romanticism, primarily because
                  Romanticism was an international movement at inception. Our students can only grasp
                  the transnational parameters of Romanticism if we allow them to perceive the reception
                  of its texts within a greater European context, thus allowing the intricate web of
                  intercultural connections between European writers to be more visible. Of course,
                  this practice initiates a discussion of the different layers of intertextual exchange
                  and adaptation; as David Higgins has pointedly remarked, the objective of introducing
                  European texts into our Romantic courses is to allow our students to discover "the
                  extent to which European authors and texts of the Romantic period were in dialogue
                  with one another, and the limitations of examining literature solely through the lens
                  of national culture and tradition" (58). The introduction of European texts will also
                  overcome many of the problems caused by subjecting our curricula to Anglocentric practices,
                  such as grossly omitting aspects of Romanticism in the literary histories provided
                  in class and providing our students with a simplified view of Romanticism that does
                  not consider its wide-ranging and transnational spectrum. </p>
               <p>Historicist and feminist reassessments of the Romantic canon have reshaped the manner
                  in which the literature of the Romantic period is read and taught. More works by Romantic-era
                  women writers are being introduced, and we are now more aware of their important contributions
                  to the literary landscape of this era, which cannot be solely represented by the "Big
                  Six." Usually, works by women are read either in isolation from the traditional, biased
                  Romantic canon or within it, but their works are rarely read as part of their European
                  context. There are many good reasons for teaching our students works by women alongside
                  texts by their European contemporaries: such teaching demonstrates that women were
                  major consumers, translators, and critics of foreign literatures, illustrates the
                  manner in which they read and reacted to these texts, clarifies the role that they
                  played in disseminating and assimilating these texts, and, most importantly, introduces
                  a third dimension to the literary history of Romanticism that has long been overlooked
                  in our pedagogical practices, that is, the interconnectedness of British Romanticism
                  and German literature. As Michael Ferber has noted, the "fatherlands of Romanticism
                  were indisputably English and German" (
                  “Introduction”
                  , <em>European Romantic Poetry</em> xxxvii), with the writers of both nations turning away from the classicism of French
                  models and instead reading translations of each other's national literatures in search
                  of new models. In a module that invites students to read Goethe's <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther</em> alongside sonnets by women writers who were inspired by this book, I aim to expose
                  the students to Romantic-era European texts to demonstrate how women writers were
                  not passive readers of continental texts, but rather, "transcreative" cosmopolitan
                  readers who conversed with and adapted European texts to suit their target readership
                  in their native culture.</p>
               <p>German literature occupies a special position in the development of Romanticism in
                  Europe, and any course on Romanticism that does not touch on its influence sidesteps
                  an important chapter in the literary history of this period. It is in the texts of
                  the <span class="foreign">Sturm und Drang</span> movement that many of the features that came to be associated with Romanticism are
                  found: rebellion against traditional models, a strong interest in nature and solitude,
                  sensibility, and the incorporation of biographical elements into fictional texts—such
                  ideas, themes, and tropes were assimilated in different manners by European writers
                  throughout the Romantic period. Because of its impact on the European literature of
                  its time, I recommend the inclusion of Goethe's <em>Werther</em> in our curricula: the work functions as a fine introduction to Romanticism because,
                  in terms of chronology and historical importance, it is one of the foundational texts
                  that introduces students to some of the major features of Romanticism and simultaneously
                  illustrates how these features were transferred and assimilated transnationally.</p>
               <p>In class, Goethe's <em>Werther</em> can also stimulate discussions on the creative processes of translation and appropriation
                  because it is a novella that contains a translation of a forged translation—Werther's
                  translations of selections from Macpherson's <em>Ossian</em>. Discussion of these imbedded translations allows the instructor to introduce Goethe's
                  contribution to eighteenth-century translation theory: his specification of the three
                  types of translation. In addition, the manner in which the text was appropriated in
                  a different form and register, the sonnet form, allows the instructor to discuss whether
                  the sonnets on Werther can be regarded as early instances of "transcreation," that
                  is, a creative translation that includes elements of its origin and at the same time,
                  introduces to it new elements that allow it to be easily accepted in the receiving
                  culture.</p>
               <p>Goethe's <em>Werther</em> is also an interesting example of a text's effect on the reception in another culture
                  of the national literature with which it is associated. Published in 1774, <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther </em>not only made Goethe one of the most celebrated writers in eighteenth-century Europe
                  but also began one of the most heated debates at that time over the impact of a book
                  on the reading public. Instigating the phenomenon of "Werthermania," the book left
                  a deep impression on its readers and moved many to imitate Werther's dress, excessive
                  sentimentality and—as the book's critics claimed—suicide. Anxious responses and debates
                  on its detrimental impact prompted Anna Barbauld, for instance, to single it out,
                  along with Schiller's <em>The Robbers</em>, as a chief text marking a turning point in the reception of German literature in
                  England. Formerly considered an excellent source of models for literary composition,
                  German literature came to be viewed as a source of dangerous texts (Barbauld 28-9).
                  Equally interesting is that these negative responses to the book were echoed in discussions
                  of female education and conflated the reading of it with female indulgence and promiscuity,
                  as Jacqueline Pearson has explained: "Reading <em>Werther</em> was accused of encouraging self-indulgent sexuality and transgression of traditional
                  femininity as well as suicide [. . .]. In fiction, its readers will be self-indulgent,
                  immoral, or at best immature women" (73).</p>
               <p>In England, the book inspired a countless number of imitations, appropriations, rewritings,
                  and parodies that crossed generic, geographic, and linguistic barriers. These imitations
                  presented different readings of the book, which were, in turn, subjected to various
                  readings and interpretations. Many of these imitations appeared as poems that attacked
                  the work for its seemingly apologetic stance on suicide and for the unorthodox behavior
                  of its characters. Other appropriations articulated a more sympathetic view of Werther's
                  sufferings and highlighted moral aspects embedded in the book. Women poets in England
                  contributed to this cultural debate by addressing—in sonnet form—some of the issues
                  raised by the admirers and detractors of <em>Werther</em>. As part of the module on Goethe's <em>Werther</em>, I require my students to examine sonnets by women writers who were influenced by
                  the book. Among many things, this examination of the sonnets will illustrate the various
                  appropriations that emerged, women writers' contributions to these appropriations,
                  and how these contributions were shaped by varying factors, such as literary marketing
                  and aesthetic judgment.</p>
               <p>Most of the students taking my course on 
                  “Romantic and Victorian Poetry”
                  are in their third or fourth undergraduate year and are native speakers of Arabic
                  who speak English as a second language. By the time they take this course, they have
                  completed courses in comparative literature, world literature, translation studies,
                  and literary British history. Such a background proves highly useful when discussing
                  translation and what it entails as a cultural process. Additionally, as Middle-eastern
                  readers of Western texts, they are also more perceptive of the manner in which readers
                  approach and respond to foreign texts. The course description states that the aim
                  of the class is to deepen students' understanding of British poetry written in the
                  nineteenth century through reading assignments that pair texts by men and women that
                  reflect the themes, issues, and poetic forms that dominated the century. Considering
                  the short timeframe in which this course must be taught—poetry produced in both the
                  Romantic and Victorian periods must be covered within a span of three months—I tend
                  to opt for primary texts that have made an indelible mark on the poetry written during
                  these two periods and secondary texts that can be valuable reference sources for my
                  students throughout the semester.</p>
               <p>I usually dedicate one week, that is, three one-hour lessons, of the module to <em>Werther</em>. Below is a list of readings assigned for each day.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Day 1</span></h2>
               <p>I begin the first class by asking questions about the character of Werther; using
                  the white board, I ask my students to describe him. The usual responses I receive
                  from students are as follows: lonely—obsessed—emotional—suicidal—feminine—neurotic—failed
                  seducer—naïve—self-obsessed—egotistic. Then, I ask my students to examine this list
                  of descriptions and think about how such a character triggered the phenomenon of "Werthermania."
                  What made him such an appealing character to the extent that imitations and adaptations
                  were created? Students respond differently to this question. They point to the reader's
                  readiness to be possessed by a character to the point of imitation, indicating that
                  an individual's psychological predisposition is essential if the book is to have an
                  effect. Others refer to the book's autobiographical content, as Goethe's personal
                  experience may have been shared by some of his contemporaries, which explains the
                  copy-cat suicides that it supposedly encouraged: "it is not because they saw Werther
                  in themselves, but because they saw themselves in Werther," as one of my students
                  expressed it. </p>
               <p>I then turn my students' attention to the literary market into which the book was
                  introduced: what makes such a book so marketable/sellable? What makes any book a bestseller?
                  Again, I receive different responses to this question, which address the book's narrative
                  technique, genre, and target readership. Students point to the epistolary form as
                  a possible reason; to use their words, "reading a book in letters is much easier than
                  reading a book divided into chapters" / "the book is an early version of the romantic
                  novels that fill our bookshops today. Though the theme of unrequited love is frequently
                  revisited in world literatures and is almost overdone, there are always readers who
                  are interested in such stories and long for more, which explains why romantic novels
                  are still sellable today; it has a market." </p>
               <p>With this thought regarding target readership in their minds, I ask my students to
                  think about gender and the various warnings and criticisms directed at the book: why
                  did critics at the time feel that this book was particularly dangerous for female
                  readers? Here, I turn their attention to contemporary remarks found in the reception
                  history given by Duncan. Duncan points to early critical responses that connected
                  the book to the rise of suicide, and many reviews referred to the interesting case
                  of a Miss Glover who committed suicide in which a copy of the book was found under
                  her pillow (21). Regardless of the veracity of this incident, the connection drawn
                  between Werther's suicide and suicide among women is most telling because these early
                  reviewers viewed women readers as being particularly susceptible to the influence
                  of the characters of the book. </p>
               <p>To understand what was classified as a dangerous or safe text for female readers and
                  how foreign texts have influenced such a classification, I ask students to turn to
                  Pearson's section 
                  “Translations and Reading in Foreign Languages,”
                  which discusses how foreign literature was viewed and how their female readers were
                  perceived. Pearson notes that <em>Werther</em> was considered one of the "most dangerous texts in the period's <span class="foreign">index librorum prohibitorum</span>" and that this view intensified after the French Revolution, as female characters
                  who read it were depicted as "self-indulgent, immoral, or at best immature women"
                  (73). To give the students an idea of what contemporary British writers and educators
                  thought of foreign texts such as <em>Werther</em>, I ask them to examine the passage on German literature from Hannah More's <em>Strictures on Female Education</em>, which provides insight into how foreign literature was viewed: <span class="quote">‘Among the overflowing number of fictitious writings, not a few are there in the English,
                     and still more and worse in the French and German schools, in which the intrigue between
                     the already married hero and heroine is opened by means so apparently innocent, and
                     conducted so gradually, and with so much plausibility, as, for a time, to escape detection.
                     (117) ’</span> The first translation of <em>Werther</em> into English was created from a French translation, which renders it doubly pernicious
                  in the eyes of conservatives such as Hannah More because it conveys French excesses
                  and German customs. The discussion usually turns to the character of Charlotte and
                  how she was considered a bad role model whom women were to avoid. In Hannah More's
                  words, students perceive the underlying ideological construction of separate gender
                  spheres for men and women. The tragedy in Werther could have been avoided if Werther
                  and Charlotte did not often associate. Students go further, arguing that placing the
                  blame on Charlotte's conduct is symptomatic of the sexual prejudices of the time.
                  At this point, I turn the students' attention to the novel's narrative structure:
                  with the exception of the few comments provided by the editor of Werther's letters,
                  the story is told primarily through the eyes of Werther. How would the narrative be
                  different had the story been told through the eyes of Charlotte? So I end this session
                  by asking my students to think about how women writers responded to the book and what
                  their responses tell us about their reactions as readers and writers. Additionally,
                  I ask them to consider how women writers utilized the book and its reception in their
                  sonnets.</p>
               <p>Overall, this first session aims to acquaint the students with the book and its reception
                  in England. Particular attention is given to the depictions of its two main characters,
                  Werther and Charlotte, because of their centrality to the debate regarding the book's
                  perilous impact on its readers. Addressing the popularity of the book also alerts
                  the students to the market craze it generated, which prompted many writers to imitate
                  and/or rewrite the book, as the assigned readings for the following class will illustrate.
                  The secondary readings assigned for this session provide an overview of the book's
                  reception in England and how its impact on female readers was perceived. In reading
                  Hannah More's warning regarding the detrimental impact of German literature on gender
                  relations, students will better understand how reading was considered an important
                  component of women's education and moral judgment and the resulting view that their
                  readings had to be carefully guarded. These secondary readings also provide information
                  about the connections that were made concerning women, their bodies, and their readings
                  and how reading was used in the construction and perpetuation of fixed gender roles
                  and separate gender spheres. Pearson's remarks on how <em>Werther</em>, in particular, was viewed as a dangerous text causes students to realize the extent
                  of the book's infamy, the negative associations it came to carry, and the way it was
                  used to represent women in fiction by indicating the lax morality of the fictional
                  female characters who read it.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Day 2</span></h2>
               <p>I dedicate this session to a close examination of the sonnets on Werther written by
                  women writers, with the purpose of answering the questions with which I ended the
                  previous class. At the beginning of the class, I ask the students whether they find
                  that the assigned readings' treatment of Goethe's book was faithful or liberal. Then,
                  I invite them to identify both obvious and subtle differences between the novel and
                  the sonnets, on the one hand, and between the sonnets themselves, on the other hand.
                  </p>
               <p>Students quickly perceive many interesting devices in these appropriations: retelling
                  the story through the eyes of Charlotte, inserting another fictional character in
                  whom Charlotte confides, providing alternative endings to the novel that depict Charlotte
                  visiting Werther's grave or even describe the ghosts of Werther or Charlotte as haunting
                  Werther's grave. Students invariably find this insistence on rewriting the novel intriguing.
                  I respond in turn with the following question: what do these rewritings tell us about
                  the public's reactions to characterization and the book's ending? Students highlight
                  the various views and readings of the book that circulated, which are reflected in
                  these appropriations: some writers found it necessary to deflect what they perceived
                  as the dangerous impact of a highly popular text, whereas others perceived a visible
                  moral dimension that was worth highlighting. Many of these conflicting views revolved
                  around Werther's suicide and the subtext that the novel appears to convey regarding
                  this incident. Many of these appropriations capitalize on the novel's popularity and
                  are attempts to attract its readership. </p>
               <p>At this point, I shift students' attention to the sonnets on Werther by Charlotte
                  Smith and Anna Seward: I ask how these sonnets reflect the manner in which these women
                  writers read the novel and perhaps even ask them to indicate the lines that they believe
                  reveal their reactions as readers. The students find Smith's writings very savvy in
                  the sense that they capitalize on the popularity of the text and, at the same time,
                  avoid its contentious aspects; for instance, she is curiously silent regarding Werther's
                  suicide, and her semi-impersonation of the female character in the sonnet is consistent
                  with the general theme of her <em>Elegiac Sonnets</em>.</p>
               <p>When turning to Seward's poems, students find her remarks on Werther fascinating:
                  in one poem, she condemns Smith's appropriation of <em>Werther</em> and, in another, she defends the book. Seward's 
                  “Advice to Mrs Smith: A Sonnet”
                  criticizes Smith for her use of foreign texts in her sonnets: "It ill befits that
                  verse like thine should tell / Of Petrarch's love, or Werther's frantic pain! / Let
                  not or foreign taste or tales enchain." However, in her note to 
                  “Written in the Blank Page of the Sorrows of Werter”
                  Seward compares the book to Shakespeare's <em>Othello</em>, arguing that "neither the play, nor the novel, can justly be taxed with having an
                  immoral tendency." At this point, I attempt to push my students to further examine
                  Seward's reactions: her rejection of the inscription of foreign texts in the works
                  of fellow compatriots and her advice on how these foreign texts are to be read. To
                  Seward, it is not the book's moral message that is disquieting, but rather, how translations
                  of foreign texts are to be read, interpreted, and assimilated in her native literature.
                  Students relate easily to Seward's position, referring to Arabic films, which in imitation
                  of Western films, were purposely expurgated of elements deemed too improper to suit
                  the preferences and traditions of the target audience. The film had to be adapted
                  to an Arab audience, or "Arabized," as one of the students phrased it. Such a discussion
                  provides an opportunity to ask the students to think about translation and how it
                  is an extended process that does not stop in the mind of the translator, but rather,
                  extends to involve the minds of the readers. Readers react and interpret to translations
                  in multifarious and even oppositional ways, with each group of readers invoking a
                  particular aspect of the translation that suits their ideological convictions. Of
                  course, such reading practices convert these translations into subjects of ideological
                  debate, in which thoughts on gender, tradition, and morality are contested, revised,
                  and subverted. These differences increase the students' awareness of how translation
                  "is a channel opened, often without a certain reluctance, through which foreign influences
                  can penetrate the native culture, challenge it, and even contribute to subverting
                  it" (Lefevere 2). If time allows, this revelation is used to instigate a discussion
                  on how translation can be viewed as a creative act, so I end this session by asking
                  my students to think about the thin line that demarcates the processes of "translation"
                  and "transcreation."</p>
               <p>The central focus of this session is to expose the students to examples of poems inspired
                  by Goethe's <em>Werther</em>, with the aim of encouraging them to read these appropriations in view of the book's
                  early reception in England, as covered in the previous session. These poems give a
                  general overview of the different ways in which writers addressed the book's controversial
                  content as they rendered it in verse. Through different narratives that supplement
                  the original ending or provide alternative viewpoints of the events, these writers
                  aimed to tame the book and acculturate it to suit the target readership. Thus, the
                  poems used in this session register the various literary appropriations of the book
                  and represent the readings and counter-readings of a foreign text.</p>
               <p>The poems by Smith and Seward illustrate how this translated book became a site of
                  readerly intersections; whereas Smith transcribes the translation in sonnet form,
                  Seward rejects it. These poems also present two striking instances of women writers
                  using a problematic foreign text in a savvy way to simultaneously attract its readership
                  and avoid its critics. The two different positions reflected in their appropriations
                  (Smith's silence about the suicide and Seward's concern about foreign influences on
                  national literature) testify to the active involvement of women writers in the debate
                  surrounding the book's relation to gender, women readers, and foreign literature.
                  </p>
               <p>The sonnets based on their readings of <em>Werther</em> demonstrate the creativity with which Smith and Seward used a foreign text to express
                  their thoughts on aesthetic judgment and national literature. Although both employed
                  the sonnet form for appropriating or commenting on the book, each writer conveyed
                  a distinctly different reaction indicative of how she read and interpreted the book.
                  Smith's sonnets reveal her shrewdness in terms of navigating the literary market and
                  utilizing a popular text in her <em>Elegiac Sonnets</em>. Although Seward chastises Smith for basing her sonnets on a foreign text in her
                  own poems, she later argues that the manner of one's reading determines the way in
                  which the book is to be interpreted.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Day 3</span></h2>
               <p>During the final session of this module, the central focus of the discussion is on
                  these issues: translation, transcreation, and defining European Romanticism. I begin
                  by referring the students to Goethe's interesting description of translation as a
                  marketplace, where all nations present their cultural contributions. To Goethe, the
                  translator is the "mediator in this general spiritual commerce and who has chosen
                  it as his calling to advance the interchange," and any translation "is and remains
                  one of the most important and dignified enterprises in the general commerce of the
                  world" (
                  “Writings on Literature”
                  25), despite any deficiencies that it might have. Students cannot help but make connections
                  among Goethe's words, the translations of <em>Ossian</em> in <em>Werther</em>, and the translation of his work in England. It is the existence of a ready market
                  abroad as a conducive factor that allowed for the transmission of these works across
                  borders, as is the case with Macpherson's <em>Ossian</em> and Goethe's <em>Werther</em>. Of course, this transmission can take different forms and is conducted for different
                  purposes.</p>
               <p>We then move to Goethe's description of the three stages of translation. During the
                  first stage, the translator "acquaints us with foreign countries on our own terms"
                  (
                  “Book of East and West”
                  75), in the second, he aims to "appropriate foreign content and reproduce it in his
                  own sense" and, in the third and most superior, he aims "to make the original identical
                  with the translation, so that one should be valued not instead of the other, but in
                  the other's stead" (76). I ask my students to pinpoint what distinguishes these three
                  stages and, naturally, they tend to focus on the part played by the translator and
                  the extent to which he creatively adapts the book, so I ask them to examine the other
                  side of the equation: the readers receiving the translation. Under the pressure exerted
                  by his publisher and the reading public, a translator would certainly strive to cater
                  to the preferences of the target audience. However, the conditions under which the
                  translator produces a translation are variably different from the conditions under
                  which his translation is eventually read, and Anna Seward's point in that regard is
                  clear: although <em>Werther</em> was perceived as an immoral text, one can argue that it has didactic and moral overtones.</p>
               <p>At this point, I turn the students' attention to the textual context in which a translation
                  is presented to the reader by asking them about the translation of <em>Ossian</em> that is contained in <em>Werther</em>. These imbedded translations of <em>Ossian</em> are included not only to reveal or accentuate an additional dimension of Werther's
                  character but perhaps also to fulfill multiple other functions: as a popular text,
                  <em>Ossian</em> already had a readership and a market outside England. These translations also draw
                  attention to the creative reworking of a translation weaved into the narrative structure
                  of a work of fiction. Therefore, this imbedded translation—just like the imitations
                  of Werther that surfaced all over Europe—are instances of strategic marketing that
                  exploit a literary trend to the optimum level. It is necessary to remind the students
                  that <em>Ossian</em> was presented to the reading public as a translation, and this is not the only case
                  in which original writings were presented to the public as translations of foreign
                  texts; Horace Walpole and William Beckford use the same device in <em>The Castle of Otranto</em> and <em>Vathek</em>, respectively.</p>
               <p>The discussion of forged translations leads to series of important questions: why
                  claim that a text is a translation when, in fact, it is not? What types of barriers
                  faced by original texts are overcome by translations? What do these forged translations
                  tell us about the status of translations in comparison with native texts? These questions
                  will ultimately touch on the factors and conditions that contribute to the need for
                  a particular translation of a foreign text: demands of the marketplace, exposure to
                  foreign cultures, pedagogical purposes, and so on. However, students must be made
                  aware of the power relations that underlie these factors and shape the conditions
                  surrounding a translation, and it is useful to remind them of their previous readings
                  of prefaces by imitators of <em>Werther</em> that either addressed a patron or appealed to the tastes, preferences, and morality
                  of the reading public to justify these imitations. In other words, those imitators
                  strived to rework <em>Werther</em> within their national culture and not <em>against</em> it.</p>
               <p>By starting this session with a discussion of Goethe's theories on translation, especially
                  his idea of translation as an international market of cultural exchange, students
                  are made aware of Goethe's connection to translation studies, both as translator and
                  theorist, from the start. This awareness is important because his views on translation
                  will assist them in understanding how he views his translation of a forged translation,
                  <em>Ossian</em>, within <em>Werther</em> as participation in the world's literary market. To some extent, the demands of this
                  world literary market determine the methods employed by translators to reproduce a
                  text for a target audience. The three stages of producing a translation outlined by
                  Goethe provide insight into some of these methods and the creative dimension they
                  entail.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, Goethe does not prioritize how the reading public will read a given
                  translation. For this reason, it is crucial to alert the students to this particular
                  perspective in the process of translation, as the entire module rests on the different
                  ways in which readers read, interpreted, and appropriated <em>Werther</em> in their writings. The poems covered in the previous session are clear and significant
                  examples of how a translation may be read and subsequently used: a dominant reading
                  that condemns the text and two different readings reflected in the writings of two
                  prominent female poets of the time—Smith's reading eschews the problematic parts of
                  the text highlighted by the dominant reading, and Seward's reading runs counter to
                  the dominant reading of the text. The discussion of using translations of <em>Ossian</em>, <em>Werther</em>, and women's responses to them necessitates a shift in focus to the term "European
                  Romanticism," which has been used as a rubric under which texts written in the Romantic
                  period in Europe are assigned.</p>
               <p>The discussion of the translation of <em>Ossian</em> inserted into <em>Werther</em> and forged translations turns to the multiple points of interconnection and exchange
                  between British literature and foreign literatures and how these points of interconnection
                  constitute the foundation of what is critically termed "European Romanticism." Any
                  module that focuses on texts produced by Romantic-era European writers must therefore
                  touch upon this critical category. This consideration provides an opportunity to address
                  briefly the critical discussions of European Romanticism in the assigned readings
                  and examine attempts to tackle the question of whether "European Romanticism" exists
                  as a category. Reading these theoretical discussions also cultivates in our students
                  a critical awareness of the difficulties and challenges arising from attempts to define
                  "European Romanticism" when the texts grouped under its rubric are too diverse and
                  dissonant. Both Bode and Ferber resort to Wittgenstein's notion of "family resemblances"
                  to resolve the problem of a movement such as Romanticism that is characterized by
                  a uniform diversity. Another useful term, "contagion," is used by Schiffman in her
                  discussion of imitations of <em>Werther</em> (209). "Contagion" underscores the course and extent of transmission and can perhaps
                  be extended to refer to the migratory features critics attribute to "European Romanticism."
                  These terms touch upon different levels of intertextual exchange: family resemblances
                  relate to integration and genealogy, whereas contagion relates to transmission and
                  diffusion. However, all of these levels of intertextual exchange were made possible
                  through translation, as students have seen in the primary texts assigned for this
                  module. Therefore, it is impossible to think of European Romanticism without considering
                  the vital role played by translation that rendered it conceivable as a category. To
                  discuss European Romanticism is to discuss the rich and dynamic network of cross-translations
                  and "transcreations" that allowed for the transfer and assimilation of these texts
                  beyond their national borders. Thus, any of the influences produced by "contagion"
                  and affinities explained by "family resemblances" are direct results of the creative
                  process of translation. If the category "European Romanticism" was initially created
                  to explain why texts produced in different cultures at approximately the same time
                  were similar, this module will reveal to the students one of the processes by which
                  these texts became similar.</p>
               <p>Because this module traces how a text crossed borders by translation and was subsequently
                  used by female writers from a different culture in a creative manner, it becomes important
                  to initiate a discussion on "European Romanticism" as a category that explains such
                  points of interconnection among European texts in the Romantic era. In addition, the
                  discussion of this term may prove useful if other primary texts resulting from European
                  cultural exchange, such as British works inspired by Stael's <em>Corrine</em> and Goethe's <em>Tasso</em>, are introduced later in the course.</p>
               <p>When a critical category such as "European Romanticism" is presented in class, it
                  is critical that students understand its history and read some of the theoretical
                  discussions surrounding it. One can also encourage students to use their experiences
                  as readers of Romantic-era texts from Europe to reflect on these theoretical terms.
                  This is a useful exercise because it teaches students to view their readings of Smith
                  and Seward's sonnets and their understanding of the factors that led to the production
                  of these sonnets (for example, the impact of the market, the reading public, and patronage)
                  within a theoretical perspective that considers the intertextual exchanges between
                  literary works produced by Romantic-era writers in Europe.</p>
               <p>Overall, the module calls attention to the three components of the translation process:
                  the text, the translator, and the readers. It also illustrates the role of market
                  demands in the production and creative use of a translation and the attempts made
                  by women writers to appropriate a popular translated text and produce their own transcreations.
                  Finally, the module I propose here is designed in consideration of constraints of
                  time and course scope, but it can be easily reconfigured to suit additional pedagogical
                  demands. My objectives were primarily to eliminate one of the few pedagogical gaps
                  in our surveys of literary history and to reveal to students literary connections
                  that can be easily overlooked. The simultaneous teaching of works by British women
                  writers and foreign writers appears to satisfy these objectives. </p>
