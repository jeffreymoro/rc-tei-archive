                  <p>In diverse ways, the scholars collected in this volume make compelling cases for expanding
                     the repertoire of texts worthy of study in English classrooms to include translations.
                     In this preface, I briefly introduce each of these six interventions, while examining
                     how and why translation changes—or might prompt us to change—the way we approach the
                     teaching of texts of British Romanticism in particular, and literature in general,
                     within a planetary context. The scholars collected here reflect this global framework,
                     not simply in that they work and teach in five different countries spanning four continents,
                     but also in that they address <em>planetary textual objects</em>, objects that force us to confront the fact that these texts are "built to travel,
                     to meet new interlocutors, and to develop over time."

                              connection between these two seemingly divergent activities. Higgins and Burbules

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>To quote Lawrence Venuti, "translation changes everything."
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Venuti reflects on the implication of the title for his latest collection of essays,
                              Translation Changes Everything, as follows: "translation carries the potential to
                              bring about multiple transformations. Translation changes the form, meaning, and effect
                              of the source text, even when the translator maintains a semantic correspondence that
                              creates a reliable basis for summaries and commentaries. [. . .] [T]o suppress the
                              translator's interpretation, and to neglect the cultural situation to which it responds
                              must ultimately rest, then, on a fear of change" (10).</span></div>
                     </div> But what, exactly, is our object of scrutiny when we pronounce to have chosen <em>translation</em> as our unit of analysis? Translation, after all, refers both to an individual instance—a
                     particular translated work—and to a process of coming-into-being, a "form" or "mode"
                     (depending on which English translation of Walter Benjamin one has at hand) of textual
                     production.

                              Harry Zohn's 1968 translation for Shocken and the 1996 Harvard edition (59-61). </span></div>
                     </div> When examining translation, should we stress the collective, general set of expectations
                     and limitations that govern the ways translations are produced? Such a strategy, informed
                     by the methodologies of the social sciences, would perhaps foreground analysis of
                     the sorts of people who might have translated in a specific social context and the
                     kinds of texts that prompted translation in that context, and might attempt to reconstruct
                     the contexts of the production and reception of these translations. Alternatively,
                     should we highlight the individual approach that a specific translator has taken towards
                     a specific text? This approach would emphasize the translator's agency in performing
                     a particular (and unique) "interpretive act." Venuti has long advocated the latter
                     approach, from his espousal of "foreignizing translations" in <em>The Translator's Invisibility</em> (1995) to his more recent recommendations for the close reading of translation in
                     the classroom. Venuti emphasizes the rhetorical choices a translator makes in actualizing
                     the original's <span class="foreign">Fortleben</span> ("afterlife" or "living-on"), to use Walter Benjamin's famous formulation. Although
                     Venuti acknowledges that acts of translation are always performed within systemic
                     and social constraints, he stresses that these boundaries can only be found through
                     analysis of the "interpretive act" of an agent-translator.

                  <p>The first approach—let's call it the "social science" one—would be less interested
                     in the details and particularities of individual translated texts and would be more
                     likely to subscribe to something akin to Franco Moretti's "distant reading." By examining
                     texts from a distance such that shapes, relations, and structures invisible at close
                     range become perceptible, Moretti suggests that close reading fails compared to the
                     rich theoretical knowledge generated in ambitious projects that synthesize the vast
                     quantum of data made available through distance. He defines this distance "as a specific
                     condition of knowledge."

                              a specific form of knowledge"—in Graphs, Maps, and Trees (1).</span></div>
                     </div> While Venuti and David Damrosch, as we shall see, take Moretti to task for his distanced
                     view, we should not discount the method <span class="foreign">tout court</span>. After all, a graph of eighteenth-century translations revealing that in the 1790s
                     women began to translate in hitherto unforeseen numbers is not without interest (see
                     Fig. 1). Similarly, a time map denoting the origins of translated texts over the same
                     time period would show that the tiny circle hovering over German-speaking territories
                     suddenly begins to expand its diameter exponentially during that same decade, when
                     English translators gravitated towards German as never before. One might then, at
                     a distance, speculate that this graph and this map—or more correctly, the social and
                     literary phenomena that they represent—produced something of an affinity between women
                     writers and German texts, <em>whether or not</em> individual women translators were personally engaged in this influx of German books.

                     </div> By reading a number of George Eliot's early essays through a Bakhtinian lens of "dialogic
                     triangulation," Scholl shows the immense value of familiarizing students with the
                     work of translators as it developed over the course of the nineteenth century, arguing
                     convincingly that "Eliot's preoccupation with translation infuses all her literary
                     activities—from her editing, reviewing and journalism to her fiction-writing." Primarily
                     engaged with Victorian cultural history and how its "growing recognition of a polycultural
                     world" helped to shape our contemporary understanding of globalization, Scholl's essay
                     also offers a model methodology for pedagogies that address the means by which "Britain
                     incorporate[d] foreignness" during the Romantic period. The "cultural encounter" embedded
                     in translations by Charlotte Smith, Helen Maria Williams and Felicia Hemans, for example,
                     invites classroom discussions on the ways that translators sometimes "blurred the
                     lines of authorship" and sometimes "hid behind the veil of the original author" (and
                     sometimes did both at once) in presaging what would come to be known as "cultural
                     translation."

                  <p>In recent years, we have witnessed the rapid migration of the field of translation
                     studies from occupying its position as “a backwater of the university”—to cite Lawrence
                     Venuti's oft-quoted complaint of 1998 (<em>Scandals</em> 8)—to becoming a central object of scholarly inquiry in literary and cultural studies
                     and beyond. It has indeed been a heady decade for translation(s). But while numerous
                     conferences, symposia, seminars, and institutes have been and are being organized
                     around the topic, and collected editions address the role of translators in reconfiguring
                     how we negotiate the scrutiny of literary, historical, and cultural texts, course
                     readings in English literature have, generally speaking, not yet come to reflect the
                     same transformative impulse. In preparing this introduction for our volume, I surveyed
                     recent syllabi for courses on British Romanticism available online to see whether
                     or not translations were included in their reading lists. My little surfing expedition
                     demonstrated to me in a quantitative way that translations remain conspicuously neglected
                     in the teaching of not only British Romanticism, but also the British eighteenth-century
                     and Victorian periods. Indeed, I discovered that it was exceedingly difficult to find
                     even one syllabus available online that includes a substantial number of translated
                     texts.

                     territorial disputes that might arise from incorporating texts over which other institutional
                     actors may claim ownership. Let us put our faith, for the moment, in the possibility
                     or, one hopes, the inevitability of a bipartisan appreciation for texts in both original
                     and translation, and agree with Catherine Porter's recent call for "interdepartmental
                     collaboration" and "interdepartmental openness": "It should be possible for any literature
                     department—English, modern languages, comparative literature, Romance studies, Asian
                     studies, and so on—to offer any of these courses [on translation], and it should be
                     possible for students majoring in any of these departments to count such courses toward
                     their major" (37). Amen. While Porter's concern centers on courses primarily taught
                     using translations or about translation, we should also consider the role of translation
                     in courses not exclusively on or in translation. What are the unintended ramifications
                     of examining literature in a specific, historic context with no input from translations?
                     Why do we decide in advance that "British" necessarily entails the elimination of
                     all voices not originating in Britain and in English? Why not translation(s)?

                     courses that ignored women's writing in its entirety, despite the recovery work that
                     had already been done by scholars such as Marilyn Butler, Nancy Armstrong, Janet Todd,
                     Anne Mellor, Claudia Johnson, Stuart Curran, Elizabeth Fay, Julie Carlson, Mary Favret,
                     and many others. This recognition, that women writers made crucial contributions to
                     the public sphere of the period, brought with it an expansion of generic considerations
                     in Romantic scholarship. Poetry, the "masculine occupation" of The Big Six, suddenly
                     (or, once again) found itself in the company of plays, novels, essays, and letters.

                     why women writers were maxed out by previous and competing anthologies of the period
                     at ten percent of the total.

                     like to "encourage a pedagogical attempt to understand this literary period as it
                     developed in the public eye" (5), then shouldn't we include translations, texts that
                     constituted a surprisingly large percentage of the publications during the period?

                              of new novels published in Great Britain were translations (Raven 58; Garside 41),
                              with translations constituting many of the most popular novels of the period up to
                              1830, as evidenced by the number of editions published, including novels by Campe,
                              Ducray-Duminil, Goethe, Kotzebue, Marmontel, Raspe, and Saint-Pierre (Raven 40). </span></div>
                     </div> Yet Mellor and Matlak did include one translation in their anthology, a selection
                     from Johann Joachim Winckelmann's 1764 <em>The History of Ancient Art</em> (129-30). Taken from the 1880 translation by G. Henry Lodge, the text comes to readers
                     of the anthology from beyond the historical boundaries of 1780 and 1830, from both
                     before (1764) and after (1880). That is, the Winckelmann translation reveals <em>and</em> conceals the blind spot inhabited by translation in our present-day conceptions of
                     literary history. In an uncanny way, perhaps, translations withdraw from literary

                     significant role in the public sphere of the period. And this hope is far from original.
                     David Simpson has made eloquent and repeated pleas for the role of translation in
                     Romantic studies. Already in 2004 at the NASSR Conference in Boulder, Colorado, Simpson
                     made the case for "an extended model of translation as a core Romantic paradigm" (152),
                     a call repeated in a lecture he gave in December 2009 to celebrate the launch of the <em>Edinburgh Studies in Transatlantic Literatures</em> series.

                     </div> Noting that to read works by Robert Burns and John Clare, originally published with
                     supplemental glossaries, is "to engage in some experience of translation," Simpson
                     argues that we might recognize that "the distinctions of class and region (often working
                     together) can seem almost as hard to negotiate as those coincident with national borders"
                     (146). Simpson explores the possibility of a renewed consideration of the "historical-geographical
                     epic [. . .], a narrative composed in English about remote events whose implication
                     is explained to us not just in the poetic narrative itself but in an often vast array
                     of footnotes" (148). Citing examples from Moore, Southey, Landor, and Hemans, he locates
                     a disjunctive play between "the power of feeling" inscribed in the poetic narrative
                     and a density of "historical information" embedded in supplementary footnotes and
                     appendices. Translation, accordingly, becomes a promising model producing an awareness
                     of the need for "very slow reading" in which "what one feels for and with the characters
                     [in the poetic narrative] is thus located in the thick field of historical and anthropological
                     material about the translatability of feeling itself" (151, 150). Simpson, like the
                     translation theorists we will encounter below, understands acts of translation not
                     as transparent media into other worlds, "not as the fantasy of dialogism but as the
                     impasse of blocked communication." Translation might prove itself central to Romanticism
                     precisely "for the sake of its profitable impossibility and for its capacity to remind
                     us of just that" (151). Jeffrey Robinson, too, has reminded us how pervasive translations
                     were during the period. Offering in <em>The Cambridge Companion to Shelley</em> ("The Translator") a brief survey of "the landscape of Romantic translations in poetry,"
                     he touches on the work of Helen Maria Williams, Charlotte Smith, William Wordsworth,
                     Mary Tighe, and Leigh Hunt as a preface to his contribution on the translations of
                     P.B. Shelley. Similarly, contributor Gillian Dow has foregrounded the significance
                     of translation for women writers between 1700 and 1900 in two recent edited collections—<em>Translators, Interpreters, Mediators</em> and <em>Readers, Writers, Salonnières</em>—highlighting the fact that many women writers in Great Britain engaged in translation
                     work: Eliza Haywood, Elizabeth Griffith, Charlotte Lennox, Charlotte Smith, Clara
                     Reeve, Sophia Lee, Helen Maria Williams, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Maria Edgeworth,
                     to name but a few (<em>Translators</em> 11-12).</p>
               </div>
               <p>At this point, I would like to mention two texts that teachers of Romanticism might
                  wish to consider using in their courses. The first, Broadview's edition of <em>The Travels of Mirza Abu Taleb Khan</em>, translated by Charles Stewart (1810) and edited by Daniel O'Quinn (2009), is one
                  of the very few works available in a scholarly edition of a translation outside the
                  major European languages. As O'Quinn notes, "the translation makes an eloquent argument
                  [. . .] regarding the importance of fostering intercultural dialogue," while demonstrating
                  just how difficult it is for both early nineteenth-century and twenty-first-century
                  readers to evaluate its "moments of intercultural sociability" (16-17). O'Quinn's
                  introduction deals directly with the way in which "the history of orientalist scholarship
                  haunts our own practice even at those moments when it is possible to imagine a pre-existing
                  critique of such complexity" (48). The second text, <em>Poems for the Millennium: The University of California Book of Romantic &amp; Postromantic
                     Poetry</em>, edited by Jerome Rothenberg and Jeffrey Robinson, anthologizes a wealth of Romantic
                  poetry (and some prose) in English, French, and German alongside lesser-known poets
                  (certainly within the Anglophone academy) from outside the "major" European languages.
                  The anthology is somewhat experimental and speculative in form. As the editors themselves
                  acknowledge, <span class="quote">‘[W]e have attempted to construct [. . .] an <em>international</em> compendium, something rarely tried but greatly needed. Here we imagine the nineteenth
                     century [. . .] as a time of multiple beginnings and our project as a chance to bring
                     together, to juxtapose, poetry from diverse, sometimes conflicting and oppositional
                     romanticisms and postromanticisms [. . .], to defamiliarize, through its contiguities
                     (as well as through our commentaries), the work of many unquestionably familiar poets.
                     (4)’</span> By broadening the context within which students read British writings of the Romantic
                  era, the anthology encourages an appreciation that literary developments in Great
                  Britain were both marked by and productive of planetary resonances.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Thankfully, there is one area in which the study of British Romanticism finds itself
                     already rich in resources dedicated to the significant role that translators performed
                     in shaping Romantic thought and writing: the relations between Judaica and British
                     literature in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This state of affairs is due
                     almost single-handedly to the tireless work of Sheila Spector. In a series of monographs
                     and collected editions, Spector has offered Romanticists a window onto the integral
                     role that Hebrew translators played in responding to "the dislocation of the old certitudes
                     [in Western thought] and attempt[ing] to derive a new ethos" during the Romantic era
                     (<em>Judaica</em> 1). Beginning with a pair of monographs on William Blake in 2001, Spector showed the
                     depth of Blake's indebtedness to the Kabbalistic tradition and the profuse analogies
                     between Blake's mythopoetics and Jewish mysticism.

                     English, centered on the Hebrew Bible. Read within this historical framework, Coleridge's 
                     “Song of Deborah,”
                      DeWispelare argues, is a particularly suitable text for demonstrating why Coleridge
                     made certain strategic choices as a translator of Hebrew and how these choices produced
                     specific literary effects.

                     focusing on <em>interlingual translations</em> in the divergent ways that Hebrew and Yiddish translators leveraged Byron's poems
                     as vehicles for fashioning political, social, and cultural ideas about the Jews themselves.
                     She also, however, traces an instance of <em>intralingual translation</em> in a sustained discussion of Jewish impact on the "Byronic self." The literary critic
                     Issac D'Israeli provided Byron with the Jewish conception for "genius," which Byron
                     was to "translate" into the alienated driving force behind the Byronic hero.

                     translation, most conspicuously in Byron's rendering of the archaic "sate" as the
                     past tense of "sit"—in fact overleaping entirely the King James Version in favor of
                     the "sate" of the 1560 translation of Psalms 137 in the Geneva Bible. Yet, as Toby
                     Benis notes, "Byron's poem assumes a Hebrew perspective, using the first person to
                     identify his speakers as the Jews in Babylon," thus suspending the dispute between
                     Christians and Jews regarding the authority for Biblical translations "by unapologetically
                     blurring distinctions between Christian and Jewish perspectives" (35-36). Beyond these
                     important insights, Byron's rendering of Psalm 137 makes two specific modifications
                     that force translation to the heart of the matter.</p>

                     name "Babylon," as it is usually rendered in English translations, a choice that students
                     might attribute to Byron's need for a two-syllable word suitable for the lyric's rhythm,
                     but should eventually lead to a recognition that "Babel" aligns itself with the transliteration
                     of the word used in the Hebrew Bible for Babylon, "Bävel." In an English context,
                     however, "Babel" usually connotes the story of the Tower of Babel, the etiological
                     account of the multiplicity of languages among humans and the subsequent necessity
                     for translation.

                     the "suspended" harp of the Jews. They simply hang up their harp (or harps) in an
                     act of defiance. Byron, however, transforms this act into the retroactive invention
                     of a new instrument, its "suspended" state and "soft tones" resonating with the plethora
                     of Aeolian harps in Romantic-era poetry. James Macpherson pulled off a similarly anachronistic
                     act in having a number of his characters hang up their harps to identical Aeolian
                     effect on the pages of the purportedly medieval poet Ossian.

                     "imagination" or "sensibility"—we might first consider the primary function of the
                     harp as an object that converts one kind of information (air movement) into another
                     (sound). In rethinking Romanticism with translation as a "core paradigm" as proposed
                     by David Simpson, I suggest that we consider the work of the Aeolian harp as first
                     and foremost that of a <em>translator</em>, albeit an "automatic" one, that allows access—or gives voice—to an otherwise inaudible
                     "something" out there ("nature," "spirit," "world"). That is, the Aeolian harp indeed
                     offers an analogy for Romantic conceptions of the mind, in that it privileges <em>the primacy of translation</em>. I have included my translation of Germaine de Staël's 
                     “On the Spirit of Translation(s)”
                      as an appendix to this volume, in part because Staël, at a key moment in her treatise,
                     explicitly likens the work of a good translation to the transmissions of an Aeolian
                     harp, a figure Walter Benjamin would revive more than a century later.

               <p>A primary object of the present volume is to argue that our pedagogies need to play
                  catch-up to recent insights brought to us by the above scholars, as well as others
                  in translation studies. Many of the writers collected here use terms familiar in translation
                  studies, yet potentially opaque to scholars outside the field. Two of these, source
                  language and target language, have become standard, "source language" (SL) referring
                  to the language or dialect in which the original work manifested itself, and "target
                  language" (TL) referring to the discursive regime in which the translator fashions
                  a new version of the original. Gregory Rabassa, the well-known translator of Gabriel
                  Garcia Marquez and Julio Cortazar, shunned the term "target language" for good reason,
                  preferring the terms "first" and "second language": "I eschew 'target language' because
                  when I was in the infantry a target was something to shoot at and, ideally, kill,
                  which does, indeed, often happen in the matter of translation" (5). Notwithstanding
                  Rabassa's sensible, if playful rejection of the term "target language" in the late
                  1980s, we appear stuck with it in 2013.</p>
               <p>One of the largest hurdles that an understanding of and appreciation for translation
                  faced was the prevailing sensibility—let's call it a mental block—that considered
                  translations to be concealing an object, the original, from direct access. The best
                  that a translation could strive for was to be as faithful as possible to the original,
                  but, alas, <span class="foreign">traddutore traditore</span>. Any attempt was bound to fail. Or so went the story we all know—one that many translators
                  themselves embraced, and some continue to embrace. Much criticism in the past few
                  decades in translation studies has worked to remove this mental block from mainstream
                  academic thinking. Antoine Berman, Suzanne Jill Levine, Douglas Robinson, and Lawrence
                  Venuti all offered means of rethinking the mental block that had caused translation,
                  translators, and translated texts to be parceled into a category of derivative or
                  secondary literariness. These critics and others began to see the "failure" of translation,
                  its inability to represent the original textual object in anything other than a distorted
                  form, as a point of departure for an entirely new critical enterprise.</p>
               <p>Although rarely considered a translation theorist, the work of the French philosopher
                  Michel Serres in the 1980s and 90s consistently returned to translation. For Serres,
                  translation became the principal means for exploring and discovering new associations
                  and relations between fields of knowledge. Knowledge, as a result, is intimately connected
                  for Serres with the willingness to engage in translation and listen to its "noise."
                  Drawing on the insights of information theory, Serres railed against the common misconception
                  that noise is a useless waste product of any translation, or any instance of communication
                  between two points in a given system. Noise is an absolute necessity for communication
                  to take place, because, by definition, if there were no noise between sender and receiver,
                  they would be absolutely identical. That is, no noise equals no difference between
                  points, equals no communication, equals no translation. Noise is an essential and
                  in fact <em>productive</em> agent in the passage between sender and receiver, and, moreover, between discrete
                  scientific and/or social practices. It follows, then, that the potential transformation
                  inherent in these "passages" or "confluences" between heterogeneous discursive fields
                  in fact offers the possibility of creative, inventive, turbulent, and distributive
                  thinking. In the concept of "noise," Serres provided an avenue for articulating the
                  means by which translation offered a passage, however distorted, between linguistic
                  systems—a model that he would later extend to account for the knowledge production
                  and the creative energy unleashed when discursive regimes interact, such as that between
                  scientific discourses and aesthetic forms.</p>
               <p>Examining closely these "noisy" distortions—the twisting, turning and deforming process
                  that produces one textual object out of another—might tell us something profound about
                  the way we approach <em>all</em> textual objects. Antoine Berman (<em>L'Épreuve de l'étranger</em>, 1984) offered up a return to the seemingly forgotten insights of German Romantics
                  such as Novalis, the Schlegels, Schleiermacher, Goethe, and Hölderlin, who had valorized
                  methods of translating that called attention to the linguistic and cultural differences
                  that inhered in foreign-language texts. These writers saw translation's "experience
                  of the foreign" as a crucial vehicle of <span class="foreign">Bildung</span>, a means of vitalizing and "foreignizing" German culture—an insight that could, by
                  extension, be applied to translation work in all cultures. Suzanne Jill Levine (<em>The Subversive Scribe</em>, 1990) suggested that elevating the "subversive" aspects of translation could free
                  the form from its traditional dismissal as a "betrayal." We confront a new object
                  "lying dormant" within the original by recognizing in translation a sub-version, "a
                  'version beneath,' a potential version that the original imparts through the magical
                  act of translation" (iii). Douglas Robinson (<em>The Translator's Turn</em>, 1991) proposed that it might just be time for "the translator's turn" in his playfully
                  worded advocacy for a turn towards the study of the tropological eccentricities of
                  translation work. Lawrence Venuti, drawing on Berman, espoused a "foreignizing" type
                  of translation that would push the frontiers of the expressible in the target language
                  (TL).</p>
               <p>Since Venuti's category of the "foreignizing" translation appears often in the contributions
                  to this volume, it might be worth expanding on his concept briefly. According to Venuti,
                  translators had found themselves in the course of the twentieth century forced to
                  curtail creativity, innovation, and experimentation in the service of standardizing
                  their language to dominant modes of expression in the target language. In Venuti's
                  words, "translators worldwide came to work under a discursive regime that values a
                  narrowly defined fluency secured by relying on the most familiar form of the translating
                  language, usually the current standard dialect" (2). Venuti calls this type of translation
                  <em>domestication</em>. "Foreignizing" translations offer an alternative to the linguistic paralysis perpetuated
                  by translators who conform their <span class="foreign">parole</span> to the standards of the target <span class="foreign">langue</span>. In subsequent work, Venuti has recognized that Schleiermacher and Berman maintained
                  an "instrumental model of translation." That is, despite their advocacy for foreignizing
                  effects, Schleiermacher and Berman pursued a concept of translation that regarded
                  the original as a vessel containing an invariant foreignness, a foreignness embedded
                  in the original's "lexicon and syntax, style and genre, theme and discourse" that
                  the translator was bound to "reproduce or manifest by adhering closely to those textual
                  features" (<em>Everything</em> 3).</p>
               <p>What Serres, Berman, Levine, Robinson, and Venuti have in common is that they all
                  begin with and foster the understanding that a translation produces something new,
                  a newly created object. Translators use a variety of tools (intellectual rigor, close
                  reading, interpersonal dialogue, creative expression, somatic response, and so on)
                  in a sustained, interpretive act. In stressing the newness of this object, these critics
                  have pushed the frontiers of the set of cultural and textual objects that count in
                  literary studies. But they also presaged, in an admittedly oblique way, the movement
                  toward "surface reading" that Stephen Best and Sharon Marcus have recently advanced
                  in their co-edited collection of essays in <em>Representations</em>. Best and Marcus differentiate "surface reading" from "symptomatic reading," an engagement
                  with texts that "took meaning to be hidden, repressed, deep, and in need of detection
                  and disclosure by an interpreter" (1). Seeking to find an alternative to the "heroic"
                  type of critical reading embodied by a figure like Frederick Jameson, who explicitly
                  argued that "interpretation should always seek a repressed, mystified, latent meaning
                  behind a manifest one," Best and Marcus advocate "modes of reading that attend to
                  the surface of texts" (1-2), that dwell on the "manifest rather than [the] hidden"
                  (6). In making their case for "what is evident, perceptible, apprehensible in texts,"
                  they stake a claim for describing the surface: "what insists on being looked at rather
                  than what we must train ourselves to see through" (9). Such modes—looking <em>at</em> rather than <em>through</em>—dovetail nicely with trends in contemporary translation studies that argue for the
                  significance of translations in their own right, not as vehicles for hidden originals
                  that lurk somewhere in their textual underbellies, but as objects already <em>manifest</em> in their discursive presence.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>And yet, if we recall Levine's valorization of the translator above, we can also perceive
                     something of the heroic discourse that Best and Marcus—along with the sustained readings
                     of Jameson offered by Margaret Cohen and, especially, Mary Crane in their volume of <em>Representations</em>—align with "symptomatic reading." When Levine suggests that the translator produces
                     a "sub-version" of the original, "a potential version that the original imparts through
                     the magical act of translation" (iii), she gestures toward a certain structural potential
                     within the original, a form of "impart-ability" that the translator, retroactively
                     and subversively, brings into the light of day. There can be little doubt as to the
                     Jamesonian—and, further back, Freudian—"symptomatic" resonances of such a conception
                     of translation, steeped in the psychoanalytic terminology of latent or "dormant" content
                     freed up or translated in a new "manifest" (sub)version.

                              longing to break through the psyche's language barrier: "We say, then, an unconscious
                              thought strives for translation into the preconscious in order to break through into
                              consciousness" (596). The translation, in other words, occurs between latent and manifest
                              dream-content.</span></div>
                     </div> But in the translation itself, this "hidden" content is no longer concealed, since
                     the original now speaks in a language that the original itself didn't know (or didn't

                     "concealed" object, the original, is everywhere and always "evident, perceptible,
                     apprehensible." To read a translated text is to engage, we might say, in symptomatic
                     and surface reading at the same time.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Translation and <em>Weltliteratur</em></span></h2>
               <p>Translation scholars have classified the various types of transformation that occur
                  when linguistic material moves from a source language into a target language. We have
                  already, with Spector's help above, broached Jakobson's three-part structure, though
                  it is beyond the scope of this essay to present an overview of the numerous competing
                  typologies in translation studies. I would, however, like to describe one translation
                  taxonomy that originated during the Romantic era: Goethe's tripartite elucidation
                  of translation from the <em>West-East(ern) Divan</em> (1819). Goethe presents the three methods as stepping stones in the intellectual
                  development of culture—or what he calls, "the nation"—with the caveat that each stage
                  is necessary, and all three can exist simultaneously at any given point in history.
                  The first type, best presented as "a plain prose translation," aims at a familiarity
                  with "the foreign country on our own terms": "the plain prose translation surprises
                  us with foreign splendors in the midst of our national domestic sensibility." The
                  object in this type of translation is transparent communication. Poetic and rhetorical
                  elements in the source text become subservient to the goal of comprehensibility: this
                  kind of translation "completely neutralizes the formal characteristics of any sort
                  of poetic art and reduces even the most exuberant waves of poetic enthusiasm to still
                  water." In more contemporary translation theory, such translations resemble Peter
                  Newmark's <em>communicative translations</em>, ones in which the "originality of expression [in the SL] is not an important aspect"
                  (Palumbo 167).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Goethe calls the second type (or stage) "parodistic" translation, in that "the translator
                     endeavors to transport himself into the foreign situation but actually only appropriates
                     the foreign idea and represents it as his own." The impulse, here, is one of domestication,
                     for which Goethe finds tendencies in French Classicism particularly adapted (and adaptive):
                     "In the same way that the French adapt foreign words to their pronunciation, they
                     adapt feeling, thoughts, even objects; for every foreign fruit there must be a substitute
                     grown in their own soil." As opposed to a strategy that attempts to splice a foreign
                     into a native organism with the object of creating a hybrid form capable of thriving
                     in the new environment (that is, the TL), parodistic translators follow their ethnocentric
                     impulses and search solely for a native substitute, to resume Goethe's horticultural
                     analogy.

                              translation recognized by Goethe as symptomatic of colonial discourse, in that "the
                              relation to the foreign is one of refusal, or of misunderstanding, or of disfiguring
                              or 'parodistic' annexation (the case of the Romans and of French culture until the
                              nineteenth century)" (64). </span></div>
                     </div> For British Romanticists, incidentally, Goethe offers the example of William Jones'
                     1790 translation of <em>Sacontalá</em> as emblematic of this type.

                              the faithful translation of the Indian drama, which I now present to the publick as
                              a most pleasing and authentick picture of old Hindû manners, and one of the greatest
                              curiosities that the literature of Asia has yet brought to light" (vi). </span></div>
                     </div> Indeed, his "Preface" to <em>Sacontalá</em> precisely articulates the motives and methods of Western appropriation of an exoticized
                     "East" that Gayatri Spivak has often indicted in her numerous writings on translation.
                     At the conclusion of the preface, for example, Jones assures his readers that a "venerable"
                     acquaintance from the colony could recite "the whole play of Sacontalá by heart; as
                     he proved when I last conversed with him, to my entire conviction" (xi). Spivak, in
                     her own preface to a translation of Mahasweti Devi's <em>Imaginary Maps</em>, rails against just such an "Indian endorsement" that might be desired by her American
                     readership, since it assumes a non-differentiated conception of "one India" (xxvii).
                     Jones' 
                     “Preface”
                     —accessible <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00litlinks/shakuntala_jones/00_preface.htm">online</a>—offers students an early example of orientalist scholarship in miniature, revealing
                     in just a few pages many characteristically orientalist approaches: from the perspective
                     on Asian culture as ancient ("old," "venerable") and static ("stiff") while paradoxically
                     exotic and sensual, to the inclusion of "Indian endorsement" for buttressing the credibility
                     of the translated text.”</p>
               </div>
               <p>Goethe's third type of translation might best be understood as a form of Hegelian
                  <span class="foreign">Aufhebung</span> (sublation, or "sublime synthesis"): "the goal of the translation is to achieve perfect
                  identity with the original, so that the one does not exist instead of the other but
                  in the other's place." Although this formulation flies in the face of more recent
                  meditations on the noisiness, and therefore the productive work of the translator,
                  Goethe's typology did place translation into a new arena: a planetary network. Goethe's
                  articulation in the <em>Divan</em> of "a global view of the mutual relations" between SL and TL embedded in translation
                  laid the groundwork for the concept he developed, and the term he coined, in 1827:
                  <span class="foreign">Weltliteratur</span>, "world literature." As Antoine Berman has convincingly shown: <span class="quote">‘Goethe must be credited for having considered the whole of the play of translating
                     and being translated in the space of contemporaneity; for having measured its psychological,
                     literary, national, and cultural manifestations. Now, translation is taken up in the
                     vast cycle of being translated. [. . .] With the arrival of world literature, the
                     relation [to the foreign] becomes proportionally more complex as the different cultures
                     henceforth seek to contemplate themselves in the mirror of others and to look in it
                     for something they cannot perceive for themselves. (64)’</span></p>
               <p>David Damrosch, too, takes Goethe's coinage of <span class="foreign">Weltliteratur</span> (and the "multiple frames" in which it is embedded) as presaging "all the major complexities,
                  tensions, and opportunities that we still encounter today as we try to grasp our rapidly
                  expanding world and its exfoliating literatures" in his introduction to <em>What is World Literature?</em> (2). In attempting to grasp this unwieldy beast, Damrosch suggests defining "world
                  literature" as a subset of "literature": "all literary works that circulate beyond
                  their culture of origin, either in translation or in their original language (Virgil
                  was long read in Latin in Europe)" (4). But mostly—almost exclusively—in translation
                  since at least the eighteenth century, as I'm sure Damrosch would agree. Damrosch
                  escapes the conundrum of how to approach such a vast field as "world literature" by
                  proposing that it is "not an infinite, ungraspable canon of works but rather a mode
                  of circulation and of reading," which accounts for "why this book highlights the issues
                  of circulation and translation" (5-6). In this sense, Damrosch aligns himself <span class="foreign">avant la lettre</span> with "surface reading": "To understand the workings of world literature, we need
                  more a phenomenology than an ontology of the work of art: a literary work <em>manifests</em> differently abroad than it does at home" (Damrosch's emphasis, 4).</p>
               <p>Valerie Henitiuk's essay for this volume, 
                  “From Pre-Modern Japan to the 21st-Century World: Comparative Translation in the Classroom,”
                  lays out a comparative strategy for glimpsing the complexities of just such a "world
                  literature." In juxtaposing a number of English translations of the eleventh-century
                  Japanese writer Sei Shônagon, Henitiuk illustrates the "creative inexhaustibility"
                  of an original text in its multiple translations. By using the template Henitiuk provides
                  for Romantic-era texts, instructors can offer their students a window into the Benjaminian
                  <span class="foreign">Fortleben</span> of the work in another time and another place, recognizing that Sei Shônagon can
                  "live on" in subsequent historical contexts, whether in late-nineteenth-century prose,
                  or as a blog, or an instance of texting ("Spring is like OMG dawn!"). Dow, in her
                  contribution, recommends a similar approach in her discussion of multiple translations
                  of <em>Dangerous Connections/Liaisons</em> by comparing the original English translation (now available online) with more recent
                  versions. Translations, as these contributors are keenly aware, have an uncanny sense
                  of history, a sense that at once indexes the past, while enabling the original's <span class="foreign">Fortleben</span>.</p>
               <p>But surely we all recognize the massive transformation called for. We need to shift
                  our present-day focus away from our microscopic "nation/period" literature courses
                  towards an expansive field that asks us to consider nothing less than the entire history
                  of writing over the entire planet. Daunting. Just how do we fit in? It could, it seems
                  to me, be hypothesized that, in dispensing with "close reading" as the be-all and
                  end-all of literary investigation, we may clear a space for translations by upgrading
                  literary history through a sociological turn. That is, if we have neglected translation
                  because our acquaintance with the translated text has been unforgivably mediated by
                  the experience of the translator, then the turn away from close reading and toward
                  sociological methodologies might be something that translations and translators can
                  embrace. Yet, in the end, these methodologies would downplay the intimate relations
                  that translators have with their source texts and the "interpretive acts" performed
                  through translations, and as such, would render hollow the vast corpus of work in
                  translation studies that has made loud and repeated pleas that <em>we should actually read translations</em>.</p>

                  <h3><span class="head">Translation and Planetary Objects</span></h3>
                  <p>Allow me to reiterate the conundrum: how do we approach the experience of an object
                     as vast as <span class="foreign">Weltliteratur</span>, "global literature" or "planetary literary history," or even a subset such as British
                     Romantic literature, terrifyingly augmented by including all those translations—an
                     object that has "grown too large"? This challenge resonates with another problem we
                     are all-too-familiar with: Global Warming, or Planetary Climate Change. That drought
                     just experienced, that unexpected snowstorm that suddenly arose, or that extreme weather
                     event just witnessed, none of these demonstrates an "acquaintance" or "experience"
                     with Global Warming. You just can't "close read" an individual instance of extreme
                     weather, and stake a subsequent claim for the existence of the object known as "Global
                     Warming" because it is, as Timothy Morton has recently pointed out, "massively distributed
                     in time and space" such that "it's only possible for humans to see pieces or aspects
                     of [it] at any one time" (207, 208). Morton has proposed the term "hyperobjects" as
                     a descriptor for these enormous things in which humans find themselves "enmeshed,"
                     calling at the same time for "an upgraded theory of the sublime" (208). I would like
                     to draw a speculative parallel between these two hyperobjects, Global Warming and
                     Planetary Literary History: Morton's conception of Global Warming parallels the way
                     Frances Ferguson has recently described Planetary Literary History: "the very perception
                     of planetary literature as a whole that dwarfs individual capacities marks it as sublime"
                     (657).</p>

                     <p>In this introduction, we have already witnessed two approaches to the object of "world
                        literature" that attempt to tackle its vast scale. Moretti, in following at least
                        in part the approach of sociologists such as Fernand Braudel, Immanuel Wallerstein,
                        and Pierre Bourdieu, commends a distanced vantage point on literary history that entails
                        the (massive) collection of reports by others.

                                 approaches, such as Casanova. As Ferguson notes, Moretti's is "a schema that represents
                                 an accumulation of a number of exegetical claims," whereas Casanova is concerned with
                                 "the combination of circulation and regularity in the distribution of social capital,"
                                 in which "exegesis is an afterthought or an incidental matter" (670). That is, they
                                 share in the massive collection of statements about literature, but they differ in
                                 the kinds of statements that interest them. </span></div>
                        </div> Damrosch, for his part, limits his conception of "world literature" by curtailing
                        the "infinite ungraspable canon of works" (which I read as "really, really big" rather
                        than "infinite"), focusing instead on the mode of circulation, translation, and reception
                        within a defined locale during a specific timeframe.

                                 that "even a global perspective remains a perspective from somewhere, and global patterns
                                 of the circulation of world literature take shape in their local manifestations. With
                                 this in mind, in the following chapters I will be concentrating particularly (though
                                 not exclusively) on world literature as it has been construed over the past century
                                 in [. . .] the United States" (27-8).</span></div>
                        </div> In no way do I wish to downplay the validity or efficacy of these methodologies. Certainly,
                        British Romanticists can see the benefits of recognizing how the distribution systems
                        for translation(s) during the period produced effects worthy of observation. Aishah
                        Al-Shatti's contribution to this volume, for instance, provides an exemplary method
                        for demonstrating to students how Goethe's sentimental novel <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther</em> "manifested differently"—to use Damrosch's words—in Great Britain than in Germany,
                        as the characters of <em>Werther</em> discovered new voices in the poetry of Romantic writers such as Charlotte Smith, Anna
                        Seward, and Amelia Pickering.</p>

                     <p>And yet, I would like to point out the allure of Benjamin's concept of <em>translatability</em> from his famous "Task of the Translator" in this context. Translatability, with its
                        inclusion of the suffix –<em>ability</em>, reverberates with other –<em>ibilities</em> and –<em>abilities</em> that Samuel Weber has recently described as central to Walter Benjamin's "very distinctive
                        way of <em>conceptualizing</em>" (7). In <em>Benjamin's</em> –<em>abilities</em>, Weber documents Benjamin's propensity to gravitate towards quasi-neologisms such
                        as <span class="foreign">Kritizierbarkeit</span> "critizability," <span class="foreign">Reproduziertbarkeit</span> "reproducibility," and <span class="foreign">Mitteilbarkeit</span> "communicability." Weber notes that <span class="foreign">Übersetzbarkeit</span> or "translatability," like these other terms, illuminates a "structural possibility"
                        rather than its "actual realization," much the same as Derrida's well-known differentiation
                        between "iterability" and "iteration" in his response to John Searle in <em>Limited Inc</em>: "iterability, <em>which is not iteration</em>, can be recognized in a mark that in fact seems to have occurred only once" (Derrida
                        47; cited in Weber 5-6, 39, 58).

                                 as opposed to speech, necessitated the absence of the receiver: "Written communication
                                 can exist in the presence of the receiver, as for example, when I compose a shopping
                                 list for myself" (cited in Derrida 47). </span></div>

                     <p><em>Translatability</em> marks just such a "structural possibility," not (necessarily) an actualization. Benjamin
                        was explicit: "Translatability is an essential quality of certain works, which is
                        not to say that it is essential that they be translated; it means rather that a specific
                        significance inherent in the original manifests [expresses] itself in its translatability"
                        (71).

                                 in passing that his (French) writing will not be easy to translate: "The translator
                                 has my sympathy, but the difficulty of translation constitutes part of the demonstrandum"
                                 (47). </span></div>
                        </div> Particular works, then, call out for future translation; therein lies their peculiarity.
                        Weber has described this structural possibility as follows: <span class="quote">‘For if the call for translation is in some sense rooted in the structure of the works
                           themselves, then these can no longer be considered self-sufficient, independent, autonomous,
                           or self-contained. The paradox resides in the fact that the work can only <em>be itself</em> insofar as it is <em>transported elsewhere</em>, altered, transformed—in short, <em>translated</em> (61).’</span> Translations themselves, for Benjamin, do not share this potential: in fact, they
                        are determined precisely by their un-translatability, in that they inevitably index
                        their particular historical moment of transformation into another language. A translation,
                        then, will eventually, by (Benjamin's) definition, become obsolete because it is,
                        like a fossil or a photograph, embedded in the social and historical circumstances
                        of its creation: "even the greatest translation is determined [<span class="foreign">bestimmt</span>] to die in the growth of its own language, to perish as the language evolves" (73,
                        my alteration).</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Inevitably translations themselves will mark their own obsolescence, since they index,
                     as Benjamin noted, in a peculiar sense, their own failure to "live on" in a world
                     of historical transformation, just as a fossil indexes the moment at which the genetic
                     mutation of an organism <em>appears</em> to come to a halt at a particular moment in history. And it is in this sense that
                     objects of translation may interest the literary historian. By opting out of the ebb
                     and flow of language growth, in Benjamin's sense, the translation becomes an especially
                     suitable index for a particular moment in history, <em>precisely because it withdraws from history</em>. My point here—hastily sketched out, since this introduction has itself "grown too
                     large"—is not to claim that our study of literary history should concern <em>only</em> objects of translation, but that <em>objects of translation</em> (and <em>translatability</em>) offer an uncanny approach to opening up literary history. The translator, in dwelling
                     on the past (since the original always comes from the past), can push at the constraints
                     of habitual linguistic expression in the TL, pointing toward a future (of) language.
                     This <em>potential</em> of translation articulates, of course, Venuti's aspirations for the work of "foreignizing
                     translations"—"The foreignizing translator seeks to expand the range of translation
                     practices, [. . .] to create new conditions of readability" (19)—aspirations which,
                     of course, hearken back to Benjamin: "On behalf of his task, the translator breaks
                     through the rotten limits of his own language" (80, my translation). Such a concept
                     of translation is far removed from any methodological approach that imagines itself
                     to be a transparent medium onto or a full accounting of its objects of scrutiny. It's
                     a foundational premise of translation theory: translation, by definition, is a form—perhaps
                     it is better to say "method"—fully cognizant of its own failure.</p>
                  <p>Translation always transforms. And to return to the beginning: "translation changes
                     everything." In Samuel Weber's words, "Instead of diaphanous transmission and transparency,
                     translation brushes up against a past and in so doing opens itself to the future"
                     (94). We hope, too, that our volume can be of service in brushing up against the literary
                     past and opening our discipline to a future, planetary object of literary history.</p>

               “Teaching and Translation”
               (374) by Chris Higgins and Nicholas Burbules, a cogent meditation on the intimate
               connection between these two seemingly divergent activities. Higgins and Burbules
               note the "strong isomorphism" between scenes of pedagogy and acts of translation (378).
               The productive interplay of moments of "fidelity" and moments of "fresh invention"
               informs both teaching and translation: "In teaching and translating, we are performing
               and reforming tradition. We are not reproducing authentic or inauthentic copies but
               participating in the ongoing development of a line of thought, re-opening a vein of
               meaning, responding to a call that demands a response" (369, 376). Higgins and co-director
               Elizabeth Lowe piloted the first summer institute focused on translation to be funded
               by The National Endowment for the Humanities in July 2013, 
               “The Centrality of Translation to the Humanities: New Interdisciplinary Scholarship,”
               at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, in which I was fortunate to take
               part. I would like to express my gratitude to directors Lowe and Higgins and the twenty-four
               other participants from across the United States. I completed this project while enmeshed
               in a community of intellectual creativity, thoughtful observation, and stimulating
               scholarship.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               <em>Translation Changes Everything</em>, as follows: "translation carries the potential to bring about multiple transformations.
               Translation changes the form, meaning, and effect of the source text, even when the
               translator maintains a semantic correspondence that creates a reliable basis for summaries
               and commentaries. [. . .] [T]o suppress the translator's interpretation, and to neglect
               the cultural situation to which it responds must ultimately rest, then, on a fear
               of change" (10).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               “Planetary Literary History: The Place of the Text,”
               articulates precisely why it is that translations have had a hard time piercing the
               borders we have drawn around "what counts" as our literary objects of scrutiny. When
               Ferguson writes of "the peculiar nature of literary history as we have known it—literary
               history, that is, as the testimony from experience" (661), we can begin to recognize
               why our methodologies have largely excised translation from our literary histories.
               Translations have been read as precluding direct experience of the textual object
               that matters: the original. If, as Ferguson claims, "it is certainly a fact about
               our habitual ways of treating literary objects that we don't take anyone else's word
               for it when she pronounces a poem 'great' or 'haunting'" (661), then how much more
               do our "habitual ways of treating literary objects" curtail the experience of reading
               a translation? How can I confirm that my acquaintance with a translation is offering
               me anything more than a pale semblance of the "actual" or "direct" experience of reading

               but has its version of Babel, its mythologizing of the primal scattering of languages"
               (57). Steiner traces a history of mysticism, Kabbalistic prophecy, and gnostic speculation
               centered on the pre-Babelian primal language, or <span class="foreign">Ur-Sprache</span>—in which it was deemed that "words and objects dovetailed perfectly" (58)—showing
