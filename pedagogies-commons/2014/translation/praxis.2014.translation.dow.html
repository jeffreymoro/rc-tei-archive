               <p>In <em>The Rise of the Novel</em> (1957), Ian Watt identifies French fiction from <em>La Princesse de Clèves</em> (1678) to <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em> (1782) as a tradition that stands "outside the main tradition of the novel" (30).
                  Lafayette's historical romance of thwarted passion and Laclos's epistolary novel of
                  aristocratic excess are the only two French novels mentioned in Watt's study, still,
                  of course, a reference point for current work on the eighteenth-century novel, despite
                  being published over 50 years ago. Recent work on the rise of the novel—such as Mary
                  Helen McMurran's 2009 <em>The Spread of Novels: Translation and Prose Fiction in the Eighteenth Century</em>—certainly challenges Watt's Anglocentric perspective.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, Watt's choice of these two French novels to bookmark the beginning and
                  the end of the "French" eighteenth-century novel is in many ways apt when viewed from
                  a twenty-first-century perspective. <em>La Princesse de Clèves</em> and <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em> are the only novels from this period which can claim a presence in the Anglo-American
                  tradition since the moment of their first publication: both remain in print in English
                  translation, and, as hyper-translated texts, they have long served to represent French
                  fiction of the eighteenth century. One might go so far as to say that <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em> is the "classic" Romantic novel of the 1780s. Although Frances Burney's <em>Cecilia</em> was published in the same year as <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em> and gets an increasing amount of scholarly attention in the classroom, the French
                  novel is the one that the non-specialist reader is likely to have heard of, albeit
                  not read. Yet wariness of teaching literature in translation, and of a French tradition
                  that is "other", means that—in the UK at any rate—Laclos is rarely taught to monolingual
                  Anglophone students on Romanticism programmes. Given the exponential increase in the
                  Romantic “canon” in the last three decades, which now includes women poets from Charlotte
                  Smith to Felicia Hemans, not to mention novels, and Romantic "themes" such as abolitionism,
                  education, revolution, and terror, one cannot be surprised that French fiction of
                  the period 1780-1830 is neglected. Had we but world enough, and time, teachers of
                  Romanticism may well be able to include such work in translation on their programmes.
                  As it is, there are all too frequently other priorities.</p>
               <p>This article will attempt to persuade the scholar of Romanticism that it is worth
                  introducing monolingual students to French fiction in translation by giving an account
                  of my experience of teaching <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em> in English to second-year undergraduate students in English Literature at the University
                  of Southampton. The University of Southampton is a large, research-led institution
                  on the south coast of England, a member of the Russell Group of British Universities.
                  Our students in the English literature BA programme are—for the most part—high-achieving,
                  hard-working, dedicated and well-read. But, as a survey I conduct at the very beginning
                  of each class demonstrates, the majority of them come to their studies in English
                  literature without any knowledge of the French language at all. They have never read
                  a French novel of any period (even in translation) and they are largely unable to
                  name a single novelist, playwright, philosopher, or poet from across the channel (Rousseau
                  is occasionally mentioned, but not as frequently as Romanticists might hope). There
                  are many reasons for this, of course—the global dominance of English affects language
                  acquisition and multiculturalism in countries other than the UK. One might argue that
                  there is an indifference to the genre of translation with English speakers. Since
                  2011, I have directed my students towards David Bellos's lively study <em>Is That a Fish in Your Ear: Translation and the Meaning of Everything</em> for a discussion of this very topic. Bellos points out that monolingual English speakers
                  have very little exposure to literature in translation: Anglo-American publishers
                  do not produce anything like the volume of translations published, say, in France;
                  booksellers do not promote translated works, and, as Bellos puts it, although "translations
                  from English are all over the place[,] translations into English are as rare as hen's
                  teeth" (210). The overall feeling seems to be that since "something is lost" in translation,
                  one might as well not exert oneself. But there are some recent cultural specificities
                  too due to the education system in England.</p>
               <p>In England, students at state schools have not been obliged to continue learning a
                  modern language after age 14 since 2002: my own generation of state-school educated
                  students were obliged to take at least one language to age 16, and this was invariably
                  French. The change in the national curriculum has had a devastating effect on tertiary-level
                  education in modern languages: very few of my students now read combined honours in
                  English and a foreign language. It also means fewer General Certificates of Secondary
                  Education (GCSEs) in these subjects (the exam taken age 16), and even fewer "A" levels
                  (the exam taken age 18, just before entry to university). There is a steep learning
                  curve for students without this background, and this is something I tackle directly
                  in our 2-hour lecture, and 2-hour seminar discussion on the text, and that I support
                  throughout the course. </p>
               <p><em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em> is one of seven or eight texts taught on a second year undergraduate module at Southampton,
                  entitled "Dangerous Readings," when students have completed a year of higher education,
                  and moved on to selecting options for more in-depth study. It was designed by me (my
                  main interests are in comparative literature in the period 1750-1830), a nineteenth-century
                  specialist colleague Mary Hammond, and a medievalist colleague Marianne O'Doherty.
                  As our specialisms might suggest, it is cross-period, and it was always intended to
                  be flexible in terms of the set texts each year. Our shared interests are historic
                  readers, and the module therefore has a strong focus on reception and reader-response
                  theory throughout. For more information, <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/humanities/undergraduate/modules/engl2064_dangerous_readings.page#overview">see here</a>.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>I wanted to introduce our students to some canonical French texts in translation,
                     and to encourage them to think about the increasing fear of French fiction between
                     1750-1830—and for the remainder of the nineteenth century. This was a period in which
                     the French novel was losing its former influence over British fiction. Although French
                     novels were sold in London bookshops, and indeed were rapidly translated from French
                     into English, reviewers often only recommended them with caveats.

                              fiction specifically, see my own chapter, "Criss-Crossing the Channel: The French

                     </div> Sentimental French prose fiction did remain popular in England throughout the period.
                     As Josephine Grieder has explored, from the works of Marie-Jeanne Riccoboni in the
                     1750s and 1760s to the novels of Sophie Cottin in the 1810s, there was clearly an
                     avid Anglophone readership for this fiction. But French morals, it was felt, corrupted
                     the morals of the implied readers: young women themselves. If a young female character
                     in a work of prose fiction in English—from Lady Augusta in Maria Edgeworth's 
                     “Mademoiselle de Panache”
                      (1801) to Lady Juliana in Susan Ferrier's <em>Marriage</em> (1818)—is reading French fiction, she is clearly no better than she should be.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Our students begin their "Dangerous Readings" module with a week of classes on Charlotte
                  Lennox's <em>The Female Quixote</em> (1752), focusing on Lady Arabella and her reading of French romances ('in very bad
                  translation'). Here, my aim is to encourage them to think about the novel's continental
                  roots: I have yet to encounter a student at Southampton who has read Cervantes, so
                  I give them some passages in a modern translation, and we talk about the popularity
                  of this Spanish work throughout England in the long eighteenth century, looking at
                  passages from Smollett's 1755 translation. I also want my students to consider what
                  might be "dangerous," and what might be liberating, about Arabella's reading, and
                  whether Lennox's novel is truly a rejection of "silly French novels" for the female
                  reader. We then turn to Laclos, and students go on in subsequent weeks to read <em>Northanger Abbey</em> (1818), and both Flaubert's <em>Madame Bovary</em> (1856) and Zola's <em>L'Assommoir</em> (1877).</p>
               <p>Crucial to the learning aims and objectives for the module is to encourage students
                  to question the effect that the act of translation can have on our own (and indeed
                  contemporary) "readings" of a text. But there are certainly challenges to overcome
                  when teaching a novel for which variant modern translations are currently in print
                  with prestigious presses, not to mention the challenge of teaching an epistolary novel
                  more generally. In the remainder of this article, I will share some of the strategies
                  I have found helpful in the lecture theatre and in the classroom. I will not focus
                  on close readings of the text itself (although students can, and do, choose to provide
                  commentaries on individual letters in the novel as part of their assessment for the
                  module), but rather concentrate on three main areas: situating the novel in what Margaret
                  Cohen and Caroline Dever have called the "Literary Channel," selecting a translation
                  for use in the classroom, and promoting the use of both rare books and online resources.

               <h2><span class="head">The Romantic-period Laclos: the Cross-Channel Novel in the 1780s</span></h2>
               <p>Some of my students may have seen the film version of Stephen Frears <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em> with Glenn Close and John Malkovich, or indeed Milos Forman's <em>Valmont</em> with Colin Firth and Annette Bening, but since these films date from 1988 and 1989
                  respectively, they are "classic" cinema for most of my Southampton undergraduates,
                  born post-1990. Even Roger Kumble's rather wonderful 1999 modernization, <em>Cruel Intentions</em>, set in high-school, high-society New York, is not a film they will have grown up
                  with. I point them towards these adaptations much as I relate the oft-repeated anecdote
                  that Marie Antoinette had a copy of the novel in her library (bound without the title
                  or author's name on the cover), and I recommend them not as a substitute for reading
                  the novel, naturally, but rather as evidence of popularity and continued reception.
                  Most of my students respond enthusiastically to the novel itself, once they have got
                  used to the epistolary form. They enjoy it, and they are shocked to be shocked by
                  its themes. Discussions need a tight rein if they are not to descend into character-driven
                  debate about who, between the Vicomte de Valmont and Madame de Merteuil, is the most
                  evil, or whether Cécile de Volanges or Madame de Tourvel is the most "flaky." I find
                  that the emphasis on production, reception, and translation, and on the literary market
                  place when <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em> was first published, helps to focus our attention.</p>
               <p>This part of the teaching is largely lecture-led: I need the students to absorb a
                  large amount of material in a short space of time and direct them towards further
                  reading to expand their background knowledge of the period. I start by explaining
                  the importance of the French Enlightenment within eighteenth-century Europe and that
                  French was the educated <span class="foreign">lingua franca</span>. I highlight the popularity of French fiction in the long eighteenth century and
                  point to the rapidity of translation as evidence of reception—English translations
                  from the French were often published in the year or so after publication of the original.
                  And I emphasise the close relationship between the fictions of France and England
                  in this period, the familiarity French readers would have had with British fiction
                  and vice versa. There are many recent publications that help me—and my students—situate
                  the Romantic Novel in the context of cross-cultural exchanges in the period. I have
                  already mentioned Cohen and Dever's <em>The Literary Channel</em>. To this can be added the collected essays of <em>Remapping the Rise of the European Novel</em> edited by Jenny Mander, and <em>Cultural Transfers: France and Britain in the Long Eighteenth Century</em> edited by Thomson, Burrows, and Dziembowski, as well as Mary Helen McMurran's monograph
                  <em>The Spread of Novels: Translation and Prose Fiction in the Eighteenth Century</em>. Taken together, these three studies look beyond national boundaries in considering
                  fiction and cultural capital, and this is exactly what I want my students to be able
                  to do by the end of the module.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>I find <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em> an extremely helpful text to emphasis the global nature of reading amongst the European
                     elite in the eighteenth century. Valmont and Merteuil themselves are pan-European
                     readers: Merteuil's unveiling of her self-education in letter 81 demonstrates the
                     variety and depth of her reading of philosophy, conduct literature, and indeed novels.
                     The ill-fated Tourvel is said to be reading Richardson's <em>Clarissa</em> at a crucial moment in her own seduction. The reference comes in letter 107, from
                     Valmont's valet Azolan to his master, who clearly doesn't know the novel (in Douglas
                     Parmée's 1995 translation: "I'm spelling it as it was printed, maybe your lordship
                     will know all about it"), although the educated French reader of the late eighteenth
                     century would have recognised the reference immediately. Laclos's own 1784 review
                     of Frances Burney's <em>Cecilia</em>, published, like <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses,</em> in 1782, is admiring of the British novel more generally. As Antoinette Marie-Sol
                     points out, <span class="quote">‘Laclos does not distinguish between nations in his list of exceptional works. This
                        leads to the third point of the review: Laclos's own preference for the English novel
                        [. . .] only Richardson, Fielding, and Rousseau are listed as the "meilleurs romanciers"
                        (163).’</span> Laclos, of course, is not alone in looking across the channel for his fictional models.
                     Stéphanie-Félicité de Genlis's <em>Adèle et Théodore</em>, published in the same year, and translated into English in 1783 is just as admiring
                     of Richardson (Genlis claims he produced the only "moral" works of fiction that could
                     be recommended to young women), and the English author was also admired by Diderot,
                     Rousseau, and Voltaire.

                     own version of the key works in French literature, from Fénelon's <em>Télémaque</em> to Genlis's <em>Adèle et Théodore</em>, via Scarron, Lafayette, Lesage, Marmontel, Graffigny, Rousseau, Bernardin de St.
                     Pierre, and Isabelle de Montolieu. Yet Barbauld does not mention Laclos's <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em>, despite the canonical status in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Such evidence
                     helps students to question the Romantic canon more generally, something all our teaching
                     must now consider.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Variant Translations; or, What Text is there in this Class?</span></h2>
               <p>In a useful essay entitled 
                  “The Eighteenth-Century Novel and the Core Curriculum: Dangerous Liaisons,”
                  Robert J. Frail argues that "Like English translations of other French texts, <em>Les Liaisons dangereuses</em> fares badly" and that it is therefore necessary to select a translation with great
                  care. It is, he feels, <span class="quote">‘essential for an instructor using an English translation to take some time (especially
                     in a core course where many students may be reading their first and last French novel)
                     to discuss flaws in the translation and strengths and nuances in the original that
                     have been lost in translation (36). ’</span> Whilst I agree that the issue of translation must be tackled head-on, the discussion
                  of the superiority of the original that Frail encourages here is an exercise in the
                  subjective, not to mention the absurd, for the monolingual student. S/he of necessity
                  has to take on trust that the instructor knows better than the translator, which,
                  in addition, means that Romanticists without extremely fluent French would not be
                  up to the task. It may well be this kind of anxiety that discourages Anglophone Romanticists
                  from teaching literature in translation. I suggest another approach, which is making
                  use of variant translations to emphasise the mediating role played by even the most
                  unobtrusive of translators. I am assisted in this by the number of translations in
                  my classroom, invited or not.</p>
               <p>Every year, I assign the Oxford World's Classics edition, translated by Douglas Parmée
                  (1995). This is not because I feel this is a superior translation. I am, in fact,
                  rather partial to the tone of P.W.K. Stone's 1961 translation, still in print with
                  Penguin Classics. In any case, I believe that all translations have their flaws and
                  merits. But the World's Classics edition is affordable and accessible, and includes
                  an excellent and comprehensive introduction by David Coward, and useful explanatory
                  notes (although I take a dim view of combining Laclos's original notes with the translator's
                  notes at the end of the edition—seminar discussion with my students always includes
                  some discussion of the paratextual presentation of <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em>, both now, and in the eighteenth century).</p>
               <p>Despite my careful selection of this set text, every year I have at least four translations
                  in my classroom. These are: P.W.K. Stone (1961), Douglas Parmée (1995), Helen Constantine's
                  2007 translation for Penguin Classics, and, increasingly, Ernest Dowson's 1898 translation,
                  which is the copy text for the Barnes and Noble Classics edition, not widely available
                  in the UK, but importantly, the edition now available for download onto Kindle (beware
                  the Kindle, those who want to read modern translations of classic French texts: the
                  link from the Amazon page for Constantine's most recent translation takes one directly
                  to Dowson). One year, I overheard a student say that "it doesn't really matter which
                  one we have, does it. It's not as if it's a different novel." I use the variant translations
                  in the class to stress that it only doesn't matter which translation we have if we
                  believe that language doesn't matter. And I do so by comparing sections from the variant
                  translations directly. </p>
               <p>Take, for example, the translation of Laclos's 
                  “Avertissement de l'Editeur,”
                  that sardonic and satirical "warning" to the public that puts the reader on guard
                  from the outset. Stone's 
                  “Publisher's Note”
                  has this line to conclude the first paragraph: "we have in fact, very good reason
                  to believe that it is only a novel." Parmée's 
                  “Publisher's Foreword”
                  is thus: "We even have strong reasons to suspect that this is a work of fiction."
                  In a course that focuses on the dangers of novel-reading, only Stone's translation
                  can be used to back up any point made about contemporary fear of novels specifically,
                  and novel-writers' disparagement of the false "morality" of their critics. Laclos's
                  original, of course, is "<span class="foreign">ce n'est qu'un Roman</span>." I point this out in the classroom, but I try, where possible, not to rely on comparisons
                  with the French.</p>
               <p>I then introduce another variant translation into the mix: the first English translation
                  <em>Dangerous Connections</em>, published in 1784. We are fortunate, at Southampton, to have access to this via
                  Eighteenth-Century Collections Online (ECCO), but colleagues who do not could conceivably
                  make use of the second edition of 1812, which is available from Google Books, and
                  which includes Abbe Kentzinger's 
                  “Extract from the correspondence on what concerns the happiness of man and society.
                  [no. III] The Utility of Novels. The Novel of <em>Dangerous Connections</em>.”
                  We now have a temporal spread of translations in the classroom, which allows us to
                  examine the changes in language from the late eighteenth century to the twenty-first.
                  Students can easily see that the older translations "feel" linguistically older, and
                  they can observe differences in vocabulary.</p>
               <p>I use variant translations of letter 48 to encourage them to observe differences in
                  poetic language. This is the central letter by Valmont, demonstrating his callousness
                  and libertinage. Written in bed (on the back of a prostitute, Emilie) to the Presidente
                  de Tourvel, the reader of <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em> sees a copy of the letter that is included in a letter to Merteuil. This is a confusing
                  enough episode, and the slipperiness of the language rewards a comparative approach
                  across translations. There is an excellent close reading of four variant English translations
                  of this letter by Catriona Seth, in French, entitled 
                  “Traduire le double langage amoureux. Réflexions sur la lettre XLVIII des Liaisons
                  dangereuses”
                  . Seth focuses on translations in English published in 1784, 1898, 1924 and 1962,
                  and sees the successful translation of this letter as crucial to the success of an
                  English translation overall. She notes, too, that the "eighteenth-century" style only
                  remains apparent in the 1784 translation, which contains some now-obsolete phrases:
                  <span class="quote">‘<span class="foreign">les auteurs des différentes versions ultérieures ne font aucun effort pour donner
                        un texte qui <em>ferait dix-huitième</em> comme on fabrique encore des meubles de style Louis XVI</span> (the authors of the later versions make no effort to provide a text that <em>will feel like an eighteenth-century text</em> just as we continue to make furniture in the style of Louis XVI) [my translation]
                     (152).’</span> My own students easily grasp that the older the translation, the more opaque the
                  <span class="foreign">double entendre</span> for them: they recognise, that is, why translations—like film adaptations—are frequently
                  remade for new audiences and readers. Most of them also pick up that Douglas Parmée's
                  translation includes a suggestive ellipsis in Letter 48 at the moment Valmont breaks
                  off the correspondence, as he puts it in Letter 47, "to commit an act of gross infidelity":
                  "I must leave you a moment to relieve the frenzy which is overtaking, nay, overpowering
                  me [. . .]" This slight over translation is one of the many ways students can find
                  in which the translator performs as an editor, clarifying points the original author
                  may have chosen to leave unclear, and using punctuation to do so.</p>
               <p>Finally, these students do not have time to engage with lengthy discussions of translation
                  theory, although I give them comprehensive references to follow up. I do, however,
                  wish them all to understand that an "exact translation" may be impossible, that the
                  notion that any linguistic form in language A has in language B an exact equivalent
                  in terms of meaning, possible connotation, polysemic value, usage, phonic effect and
                  so on, is fundamentally flawed. Frequently, of course, an equivalent is needed, hence
                  the reliance on the translator. This translator becomes a mediator, a reader of the
                  text for us. I give them the correct terminology to refer to translations: the source
                  text is translated into the target language by a practitioner who is ideally bilingual,
                  or at the least fluent in both. Of course they also need to know that different historical
                  periods have had different views on the purpose and function of a translation, and
                  that the Romantic period viewed much translation as hack-work. </p>
               <p>I therefore introduce them to the notion of the "Domesticating" model or target-oriented
                  translation, which was most popular in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, by
                  quoting Dryden's famous lines from his <em>Dedication of the Aeneis</em> (1697): "I have endeavoured to make Virgil speak such English as he would himself
                  have spoken, if he had been born in England, and in this present age" (Weissbort and
                  Eysteinsson 150) We have a short discussion about whether, for example, they think
                  that French names should be changed to make them more palatable for the Anglophone
                  readers, or whether the "Frenchness" of the characters is essential to the plot (here,
                  those who have seen Sarah Michelle Gellar as a young, American, Kathryn Merteuil have
                  much to say about the value of "translating" across time and across cultures). I give
                  the class an extract from Lawrence Venuti's groundbreaking <em>The Translator's Invisibility: A History of Translation</em> (1995) to introduce the "Foreignizing" model or source-oriented translation that
                  offers an alternative to domesticating models in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.
                  All of this discussion is of necessity truncated, but many students choose to follow
                  up the exploration of translation theory in their essays: I point them towards <em>Translation—Theory and Practice: A Historical Reader</em>, edited by Daniel Weissbort and Astradur Eysteinsson, which is a wonderful resource
                  for students of this level (and indeed for their tutors). To encourage their own research
                  into the contemporary responses to translation, I direct them towards a variety of
                  online resources, which they examine in preparation for our seminar discussions.</p>

                     </div> My students can access these reviews via the online resource <em>British Periodicals</em>, but those who are not fortunate enough to have campus access to this database could
                     produce handouts—the reviews are not lengthy. Reading the reviews before our seminar
                     discussion, I encourage students to think about the horizon of expectations of the
                     late-eighteenth-century English reader, and how that may differ from our own.</p>
               </div>
               <p>I have already told them—and they have read in Cheryl L. Nixon's valuable <em>Novel Definitions: An Anthology of Commentary on the Novel, 1688-1815</em>—that the expectation from Romantic reviewers and critics was largely that a novel
                  should provide moral instruction. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that the reviews
                  of <em>Dangerous Connections</em> were not favourable. The <em>Monthly Review</em> admits that "the story is conducted with great art and address, but it is almost
                  too diabolical to be realised." The reviewer for the <em>Monthly Review</em> is shocked, too, that there is, in the preface, an attempt to suggest that the work
                  may provide instruction, which the reviewer calls "an insult on the understanding
                  of the public, as the work itself is a daring outrage on every law of virtue and decorum."
                  All we learn of the exact plot is when the reviewer says darkly, "it is not enough
                  to say we are disgusted at such complicated crimes; but we are actually chilled with
                  horror." The <em>Critical Review</em> agrees that "the whole is delusive and dangerous in a great degree," claiming that
                  "where one" reader may be "guarded from the villainy, ten will more completely learn
                  the mysteries of seduction." The <em>English Review</em> recognises the danger too, although the reviewer in this case recognises that "in
                  point of stile, conduct and artifice of tale, this novel is superior to all its contemporaries,
                  but whether these qualities are a sufficient compensation for the mischief it may
                  do by fertilising the genius of the seducer and animating his designs, we leave others
                  to determine." The reviewer goes as far as to say that "we have been highly entertained
                  by it," and says, too, that "to those who prize entertainment above instruction, this
                  book will prove a very pleasing addition to their libraries." But the reviewer ultimately
                  fears that it will promote vice in the reader, by portraying vice so seductively.
                  It is this seduction—the fact that the main characters, the Vicomte de Valmont and
                  the Marquise de Merteuil are so diabolical, and yet simultaneously so witty, attractive,
                  and appealing—that has proved controversial for readers from the late eighteenth-century
                  until our own age: students gain an understanding of the impact of the text by reading
                  these selective responses. There are comments on the quality of the translation too—and
                  students are often amused to compare their own responses to the 1784 <em>Dangerous Connections</em> with the responses of these early readers.</p>
               <p>There are many online resources that students can use to gauge contemporary responses
                  to translations. Two are openly accessible. <em>British Fiction, 1800–1829: A Database of Production, Circulation &amp; Reception</em> contains full reviews of works published in this period. A keyword search for "translation"
                  brings up many reviews by weary critics, wishing that translators were more accurate,
                  and less prolific. I point my students towards reviews of Germaine de Staël's <em>Delphine</em> (1802) in particular, where the wish that the novel had not been translated at all
                  is vehemently expressed by the <em>Critical</em> reviewer. Students also enjoy browsing <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/reading/UK/">the Reading Experience Database (RED)</a>. Here, a keyword search for translation brings up a wealth of information about British
                  readers responding to translations between 1450 and 1945: the first record is of Jane
                  Austen, dismissing a translation of Genlis's <em>Alphonsine</em> for its "bad translation" and "indelicacies which disgrace a pen hitherto so pure"
                  before turning to Lennox's "Female Quixotte" (115-16). Students enjoy exploring early
                  reader responses in this way, and I find it an invaluable introduction to the research-led
                  study they will go on to in their final year at the University of Southampton.</p>
               <p>In the following weeks, our students go on to read <em>Northanger Abbey</em> (1818)—<em>the</em> canonical Romantic English novel about novel reading—far better equipped to understand
                  Catherine Morland's response to Gothic fiction, the novel's rejection of sentimental
                  fiction, and the roots of Austen's realism more generally. By now, they have considered
                  Lennox's Lady Arabella's reading of French romances, and they have read a scandalous
                  French novel in translation (which includes another naïve heroine whose fate is much
                  less happy than Lady Arabella or indeed Catherine Morland's own). Having thought about
                  rising nationalisms and the cross-channel development of fiction in the eighteenth
                  century more generally, Henry Tilney's words have an extra piquancy: <span class="quote">‘Dear Miss Morland, consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained.
                     What have you been judging from? Remember the country and the age in which we live.
                     Remember that we are English, that we are Christians. Consult your own understanding,
                     your own sense of the probable, your own observation of what is passing around you—Does
                     our education prepare us for such atrocities? Do our laws connive at them? Could they
                     be perpetrated without being known, in a country like this, where social and literary
                     intercourse is on such a footing; where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood
                     of voluntary spies, and where roads and newspapers lay every thing open? Dearest Miss
                     Morland, what ideas have you been admitting? (203)’</span> The student of the Romantic-period novel must always be reminded that literature,
                  and particularly the early novel, is not a purely nationalist affair. I have no evidence,
                  alas, that my students go on to read Goethe's <em>Sorrows of Young Werther</em> (1774), Chateaubriand's <em>Atala</em> (1801) or <em>René</em> (1802), or indeed Staël's <em>Corinne</em> (1809) in translation, although I certainly point them towards the importance of
                  these novels in the Britain of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries,
                  and to Romantic-period thought more generally. If they take nothing else away, they
                  at least recognise the plurality of Romanticisms, that French fiction is well worth
                  reading in translation as long as one is aware of the mediating role of the translator,
                  and that 'dangerous' readings are more or less dangerous according to the period—and
                  the country—in which they are being read. These are no bad lessons to teach.</p>
