            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">My aim is to consider the ways in which the “black Atlantic” and
                its combined focus on music and literature redefine the field of Romanticism and how
                this redefinition translates into the classroom. One pedagogical approach is to
                examine how Wheatley maps time, space, and memory through meter. Through attention
                Wheatley’s use of syncopation, it’s possible to see how her verse subverts the
                colonialist notion of mapping, accounting for and claiming ownership of internal and
                external space as well as rhythmical spaces of lines of poetry and typography. Her
                versified maps have spaces and places that are unaccounted for, that are merely
                implied and must be imagined, like a pulse that is felt but not heard. Such
                interstitial spaces are represented in her poetry by syncopation’s silences,
                omissions, ambiguities, ironies, reversals, (un)stressed syllables, and the music
                theory surrounding “on beats” and “off beats.” <title level="a">On Imagination</title> and <title level="a">On Being
                Brought from Africa to America</title> metaphorically re-plot the coordinates of her memory
                of the middle passage, as a metrically mapped journey from earth to heaven. Before
                Wordsworth and Coleridge, Wheatley’s autobiographical pentameter testified to the
                spiritually and politically transformative power of the Imag-I-Nation(s), remapping
                national, spiritual, emotional, racial, and spatial coordinates to challenge the
                understanding of the Enlightenment’s legacy in her day as well as the present.</p>

                        highlighted countries. The Black Lives Matter Coalition’s Platform
                        delineates connections between the slave trade and twenty-first century
                        discrimination, and in so doing makes clear to us a reason for the
                        similarity between the two maps: the oppressive legacy of slavery. Black
                        Lives Matter calls on educational institutions to address the
                        institutionalized racism it has identified and demands: <quote> Reparations

                            Colonialism and Slavery (<title level="a">Reparations</title>). </quote>
                        As teachers and scholars of Romanticism, we are in a position to address
                        these suggestions in our classrooms and publications. One important story
                        left largely untold to students of the long eighteenth century and Romantic
                        age is that of Phillis Wheatley and her versified journeys across “the color
                        line.” There is an urgent need to develop teaching techniques to counter the
                        legacies of segregation and erasure. One such approach involves reclaiming
                        the notion of “mapping” from its colonialist and imperialist past, and
                        deploying it as an anti-racist technology that charts the erasures,
                        silences, symbolisms, and double meanings and consciousnesses in a diverse
                        array of texts, from Wheatley’s poems to hashtagged phrases on Twitter. </p>
                    <p>The above hashtags, for instance, are calls for equality reverberating across
                        the world that have resonance beyond the literal. Indeed, the power of the
                        phrases even affects the hashtags themselves, imbuing them with a
                        double-voicedness and making them not just markers to categorize tweets, but
                        also symbols. From this perspective they are tiny graphs or miniature maps.
                        Their longitudinal and latitudinal lines chart the legacy of the slave trade
                        by mapping human rights violations of the past onto those of the present.
                        The off-kilter gridlines of the hashtags symbolize the fact that education’s
                        mapping of history did not involve (the) right angles, but skewed
                        perspectives: “School curriculums often whitewash the history of slavery and
                        the state’s role in oppressing Black people.” As a miniature map, a hashtag
                        has the subversive power to rechart conversations, connecting those tweeting
                        on a topic across the world. Symbolically, the points where the lines of a
                        hashtag meet represent intersections that connect the blank spaces bordered
                        by the lines. Reading against the grain and between the lines of hashtags,
                        song lyrics, and poetry, however, leads to the opposite notion: that it is
                        also the seemingly empty spaces, silences, and omissions that connect the
                        lines. </p>
                    <p>This essay suggests just such “mapping” as an interpretive and pedagogical
                        strategy to address the pressing need to create “Curriculums That Critically
                        Examine the Political, Economic, and Social Impacts of Colonialism and
                        Slavery.” Doing so necessitates charting the places, texts, oral histories,
                        artifacts, and traditions that were left off the map and changing its
                        orientation to expose the lines the colonizers erased, distorted, and/or
                        never delineated. The blank spaces between the hashtags’ lines represent
                        “erasure”: “Stories of African American history are often left untold or are
                        under-told, and many individuals have no understanding of the extraordinary
                        sacrifices that were made and hardships that were overcome” (<title
                            level="a">Reparations</title>). One such under-told narrative is that of
                        Wheatley’s radicalism. Lines have been drawn around the lines she has
                        written that&#8212;like the borders of the Atlantic rim’s still-segregated
                        cities&#8212;do not become abundantly clear to all until viewed on a map. </p>
                    <p>Credo Reference, “an information skills solutions provider that serves
                        educational institutions worldwide,” has created a tool that allows
                        researchers to see ideas pictographically represented. Credo’s “Mind Map”
                        gives its users “a visualization of a topic, including specific people,
                        places, events, and ideas, and helps [them] find related concepts” (<title
                            level="a">Mind Map</title>). The user-friendly platform includes an
                        informational video that explains to researchers just how the “Mind Maps”
                        are drawn up: <quote> It all starts with a search term. You’ll see a map
                            showing relationships between concepts. Concepts appear based on how
                            frequently they occur together in your licensed content from Credo’s
                            database of more than a hundred publishers’ reference works. (<title
                                level="a">Mind Map</title>) </quote> Given the worldwide web that is
                        spun by digital and print literacies and knowledges, it is easy to imagine
                        an exponential number of connections between any two topics; however,
                        juxtaposing the “Mind Maps” of “Romanticism” and “Phillis Wheatley” yields
                        not even a single connection between the two. Segregation&#8212;one of the
                        lasting effects of slavery&#8212;is not limited to the housing of people,
                        but also the living spaces of ideas and (a)venues of thought.

                        Connecting these two seemingly separate fields of study does not
                        involve mapping Wheatley to Romanticism, but the opposite. Simply adding a
                        Wheatley poem to a course on the Romantics is not enough. Wheatley’s work
                        merits a central spot in the syllabus and a concomitant examination of the
                        ways her centrality forces a reconsideration and reconfiguration of the
                        field, remapping its borders and boundaries. See
                        <ref target="/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixd.html">Appendix D</ref> for an example
                        of a syllabus that examines Black Atlantic Romanticisms, connecting early
                        writers of the African Diaspora with canonical Romantics as well as
                        present-day musical artists. </p>

                    <p>Susan Manning’s <title level="m">Fragments of Union</title>, particularly the

                            Stylistics of Consciousness,</title> examines how Scottish authors used
                        punctuation and syntax politically to disrupt the King’s and Queen’s English
                        and colonial authority, dividing and unifying not just sentence structures,
                        but also political ones. Manning’s contextualization and positioning of the
                        Scottish-American rhetoric of the American Revolution helps clarify
                        Wheatley’s subversive relationship to the Enlightenment and Romanticism. It
                        reveals a reading of <ref

                            America</title></ref> that radically departs from previous
                        interpretations and connects Wheatley to Romanticism. It illuminates how her
                        verse subverts the colonialist notion of mapping by accounting for and
                        claiming ownership of internal and external space. Wheatley’s conceptual
                        maps have spaces and places that are merely implied and must be imagined. 
                        Such interstitial spaces are represented in her poetry by silences,
                        syncopations, omissions, ambiguities, ironies, and reversals. Some of the
                        most interesting moments occur when she metaphorically re-plots the
                        coordinates of her memory of the middle passage, as a journey from earth to
                        heaven. In her poetry, Wheatley remaps spiritual, emotional, racial, and
                        spatial coordinates, challenging the understanding of the Enlightenment’s
                        legacy for readers then and now.</p>
                    <p>When teaching <title level="a">On Being Brought from Africa to
                            America</title> I ask the students to meet in groups and request that
                        they scan the poem, paying attention to which words are accentuated by the
                        meter and which are not; note the rhythm of the verse and how it’s affected
                        by punctuation; and interpret the poem word for word, being sure to map how
                        Wheatley represents herself through elisions, silences, double meanings,
                        voicedness, and consciousnesses. The most intriguing technique employed by
                        Wheatley is her mapping metrically through syncopation, which can form the
                        basis of a class-wide analysis of the way she uses iambic pentameter in this
                        poem. In order to implement this classroom activity, students will need
                        chalk (or dry-erase) boards or computers with screens that can be made
                        visible to the whole class via projection. In order to build the ideological
                        foundation, they will also need a basic understanding of iambic pentameter
                        and the notion of syncopation in poetry and music. Once they have a working
                        knowledge of these ideas, it will be possible to see how she not only
                        syncopates poetic beats by using apostrophes to contract words, but also
                        uses this grammatical syncopation to bring about a musical one through her
                        use of iambic pentameter.  In the first line of <title level="a">On Being
                            Brought from Africa to America,</title> for instance, any reference to
                        herself occurs on a weak or unstressed beat.  In order to examine how the
                        poem’s stressed and unstressed beats reveal the radical ideas of the
                        poet/and or speaker, students will also need to be grounded theoretically in
                        W. E. B. Du Bois’s concept of “double consciousness” and Paul Gilroy’s
                        notion of the “Black Atlantic.” If students copy the poem onto a dry-erase
                        board and circle all of the stressed words and/or syllables, it will become
                        apparent at a glance that although “me” occurs on an unstressed beat in the
                        first line of the poem, in subsequent lines Wheatley begins to refer to
                        herself, God, and fellow black people on stressed beats, thereby utilizing
                        syncopation to illuminate metrically and rhythmically the beatitudinal
                        notion that the “weak” shall be strong and the last shall be first. It is
                        important here to point out that in musical syncopation the weak beat
                        becomes the strong one, which is absent. In the essay that follows, I will
                        attempt to reconstruct this classroom activity in a reading of the poem that
                        maps the double-voicedness of each line of the poem, highlighting a more
                        radical interpretation as well as historical context along the way. As a
                        pedagogical and interpretive technique, mapping combines close reading with
                        critical race theory to examine and interpret subversion in texts written by
                        authors who did not have the freedom to be openly radical.</p>
                    <p>A course on Romanticism(s) that begins with Black Atlantic writers and
                        abolitionists as a precursor to the American, French, and Haitian
                        revolutions as well as other revolts against slavery and colonialism
                        provides an important starting point for students’ understanding the modes
                        of revolutionary discourse available to radical writers, like Wheatley.
                        Although Wordsworth and Coleridge are credited with penning autobiographical
                        pentameter that testifies to the spiritually and politically transformative
                        power of the imagination, Wheatley’s poetry makes it abundantly clear that
                        she helped originate a style (that subverted Enlightenment poetry in ways)
                        that the big 6 Romantics have been credited with creating. A useful
                        pedagogical concept for teaching Wheatley and Romanticism(s) is
                        “Imag-I-Nations”: a term that denotes the ways Atlantic thinkers represent
                        themselves and construct identity along (trans)national lines as well as the
                        way the imagination embroiders the representation of self through metaphors
                        that map authors’ and readers’ journeys across nations, realms, and borders
                        (geographic, physical, spiritual, temporal, transcendental, and mental)
                        (Pace 238).</p>
                    <p> What Manning refers to as “The Cartography of Consciousness” (12) becomes
                        the cartographies of double-consciousness (Du Bois 2–3) when applied to
                        Wheatley, whose support for the American Revolution is linked to her own
                        sense of identity in New England and the way the “integrity and structure of
                        selfhood (or its disintegration) mirror those of the nation: both are unions
                        of potentially disjunctive parts. Disintegration of the nation threatens
                        integrity of personal identity” (Manning 12). The double consciousness in
                        Wheatley’s poetry will become evident to students as they draw parallels
                        between America’s struggle for freedom from British rule and her own fight
                        for liberty from slavery. To understand how this poem functions as
                        Wheatley’s declaration of independence, it is necessary to map the poem’s
                        double voicedness in the context of Atlantic revolutionary rhetoric.
                        Wheatley’s <title level="m">Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and
                            Moral</title> (1773) was printed in London three years before America
                        declared independence. The book begins with a <title level="a">Copy of a
                            Letter sent by the Author’s Master to the Publisher,</title> in which
                        John Wheatley notes that “Phillis was brought from <emph>Africa</emph> to
                            <emph>America</emph> in the Year 1761, between Seven and Eight Years of
                        Age.” Phillis echoes this language in the title of <title level="a">On Being
                            Brought from Africa to America.</title> In order to map the double
                        consciousness of the poem and its subversion of her “master’s” narrative,
                        students should look up each of the poem’s nouns and verbs in the <title
                            level="m">Oxford English Dictionary</title>; ask them to search, on the
                        one hand, for definitions that would have proven amenable to pro-slavery
                        readers and, on the other, ones that would have challenged the racist
                        ideologies and rhetoric that undergirded the slave trade. Mapping the
                        double-voicedness of each and every noun and verb gives students the
                        opportunity to see how the title’s seemingly innocuous passive verb phrase
                        becomes subversive when “Being” is read as a noun. Mapping the space between
                        the double meaning of “Being” as a helping verb, and also as representing
                        the idea that slave ships are carrying not only human beings across the
                        Atlantic, but also the philosophical notion of <emph>being</emph> and its
                        concomitant notions of human rights indicates the double consciousness of
                        the author and/or speaker. In the context of the transatlantic discourses of
                        liberty that the Declaration of Independence arises from, Wheatley’s notion
                        of “Being” carries the import of a “living creature, either corporeal or
                        spiritual; <emph>esp.</emph> a human being, a person” (<title level="m"
                            >OED</title>), who thus has inherent rights: “We hold these truths to be
                        self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their
                        Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty
                        and the pursuit of Happiness” (<title level="a">Declaration of
                            Independence</title> 127).</p>
                    <p>As Manning points out, Jefferson’s Declaration is drawing its notion of human
                        rights from Scottish Enlightenment philosophy’s reaction to René Descartes
                        and others. In his language of self-evident truths, Jefferson is also
                        influenced by a philosophical tradition indebted to Descartes’s notion of
                        thought as the foundation of being: “Cogito Ergo Sum”: <quote> What then am
                            I? A thing which thinks. What is a thing which thinks? It is a thing
                            which doubts, understands, conceives, affirms, denies, wills, refuses,
                            which also imagines and feels … For it is so <emph>evident of
                                itself</emph> that it is I who doubts, who understands, and who
                            desires, that there is no reason here to add anything to explain it. And
                            I have certainly the power of imagining likewise; for although it may
                            happen (as I formerly supposed) that none of the things which I imagine
                            are true, nevertheless this power of imagining does not cease to be
                            really in use, and it forms part of my thought. (Descartes 37) </quote>
                        The unwritten motto of Wheatley’s book of poems can be summarized as, “I
                        write therefore I have rights.” Her mastery of language and rhetoric makes
                        her equality self-evident to readers and remaps their thinking causing them
                        to imagine a world and afterlife built on this principle, which is why
                        Jefferson is threatened enough to disparage her in his <title level="m"
                            >Notes on the State of Virginia</title> (1786): <quote> Misery is often
                            the parent of the most affecting touches in poetry.&#8212;Among the
                            blacks is misery enough, God knows, but no poetry. Love is the peculiar
                            oestrum of the poet. Their love is ardent, but it kindles the senses
                            only, not the imagination. Religion indeed has produced a Phyllis
                            Whately [<emph>sic</emph>]; but it could not produce a poet. The
                            compositions published under her name are below the dignity of
                            criticism. (Jefferson 234) </quote> Were he to admit the merit of her
                        poetry, Jefferson would have to concede the equality of African Americans
                        and concomitantly abolish slavery, as his opponent Benjamin Rush is quick to
                        point out (Rush 2n). Descartes and Jefferson hinge their notions of innate
                        and divinely appointed rights, respectively, on the presence of the godlike
                        capacity of imagination. To declare her equality, Wheatley pens a poem
                            <title level="a">On Imagination.</title> In a rhetorical move that
                        anticipates Coleridge’s writing an <title level="a">Ode to Dejection</title>
                        (that declares his lack of ability to write in a beautifully written poem),
                        Wheatley double-voicedly proclaims her lack of imagination in a poem that
                        subtly points readers to its (and her) divine origin. With a radical
                        politics and poetics of liberation theology, she uses her moral compass to
                        set a course (away from the duality that underwrites slavery) towards
                        salvation, and she employs the telescope of verse to “measure the skies, and
                        range the realms above. / There in one view we grasp the mighty whole, / Or
                        with new worlds amaze th’unbounded soul” (<title level="a">On
                            Imagination,</title> ll. 20–22). Rather than bodies arriving in chains
                        to the “new world,” the soul arrives in the “new worlds” of heaven
                        “unbounded,” or free. Instead of endorsing the slave trade and echoing her
                        master’s passive diction about her being brought from Africa to America,
                        Wheatley maps a middle passage between earth and heaven to illustrate a
                        godlike perspective of unity that exposes the artificial binaries intact in
                        the Anglo-American discourse that underwrites the slave trade.</p>
                    <p>A beneficial classroom activity is to compare Wheatley to spoken word or hip
                        hop artists, such as Lauryn Hill or Kendrick Lamar, who directly and
                        forcefully denounce racism, and then to ask students to imagine how the poem
                        would have read if Wheatley were free to speak her mind. Reading the poem
                        alongside her 11 February 1774 letter to the Native American minister Samson
                        Occom and its open condemnation of slavery and oppression draws attention to
                        the radicalism of the missive and function of silence (on this topic) in the
                        poem. In <title level="a">On Being Brought from Africa to America,</title>
                        Wheatley also maps silence and omission: missing from the title, but present
                        in the minds of her readers, is what connects Africa to America: the
                        Atlantic. The presence of the Atlantic is more powerful for its absence, and
                        the poem continues to make use of elision to map interstitial spaces and
                        conceal powerful presences in the first line of the poem: “’Twas mercy
                        brought me from my <emph>Pagan</emph> land.” Just as the passive verb form
                        of the title removes herself and any agency, so too does the opening
                        character of the poem. The apostrophe is turned outward, a closing single
                        quotation mark facing a letter printed in invisible ink. It erases
                        Wheatley’s presence by metonymically standing in for the “I,” which should
                        be the first letter of the poem. The “I” has been removed, displaced.</p>
                    <p>Another way to make this poem more accessible to students is to teach it
                        alongside relevant songs by Bob Marley. For instance, although the following
                        lines from his “Redemption Song” were written more than two centuries later,
                        they explain the metaphorical significance of the missing “I” in Wheatley’s
                        first line: <quote>
                            <lg type="stanza">
                                <l>Old pirates, yes, they rob I;</l>
                                <l>Sold I to the merchant ships,</l>
                                <l>Minutes after they took I</l>
                                <l>From the bottomless pit. (Marley)</l>
                            </lg>
                        </quote> In one possible reading of this double-voiced poem, the passivity
                        of the title and opening character remove “being” and selfhood, as does
                        slavery; however, remapping the negative space, the selves and concomitant
                        rights are powerfully, self-evidently present. Eliding the first letter of
                        the poem is a literal silence in this opening line of iambic pentameter. The
                        unstressed/stressed cadence of the iamb gives the poem a musical pattern. A
                        Black Atlantic analysis of Wheatley’s use of iambic feet and her “sounds of
                        silence” (Simon) stretches back further in space and time than Pope’s, or
                        even Chaucer’s, use of heroic couplets in England. Syncopation, like an
                        iambic foot, depends upon the interplay between stressed and unstressed to
                        create a rhythm. In poetry, syncopation is the “contraction of a word by
                        omission of one or more syllables or letters in the middle” (<title
                            level="m">OED</title>), which is exemplified by the first word in the
                        poem.</p>
                    <p>In music, syncopation is the “action of beginning a note on a normally
                        unaccented part of the bar and sustaining it into the normally accented
                        part, so as to produce the effect of shifting back or anticipating the
                        accent; the shifting of accent so produced” (<title level="m">OED</title>).
                        African syncopation found its way into European music via the Mediterranean,
                        Greece, and Rome, as well as through the Berber tribes in southern Spain and
                        Italy (Strange), before it crossed the Atlantic and fused with
                        already-existing syncopation of Native American tribes and civilizations, as
                        well as English and Irish folk music in the unaccounted for roots and routes
                        of African American spirituals and jazz (Radano). Wheatley musically
                        syncopates poetic syncopation by contracting the word at the beginning
                        rather than the middle. In closing the typographical and sonic space between
                        “It was” and removing the “I” in “’Twas,” Wheatley is subtly remapping her
                        (readers’) journey across space and time and using syncopation as a
                        chronotope. By demonstrating her ability to alter space and time in the
                        world of verse, Wheatley is not only echoing the power of the
                        Judeo-Christian God of slaveholders, but also subtly asserting her own
                        divine origin and destination. She anticipates the Coleridgean primary
                        imagination and the “infinite I am,” implying (Supreme) “Being” in the title
                        as well as the unnamed bestower of the first line’s “mercy.”</p>
                    <p> One pedagogical approach is to break the students into 8 groups, one for
                        each line of the poem. Then, ask each group to map the rhythm of their line
                        by writing it on a dry-erase board with the stressed beats or words in bold,
                        encouraging them to look up each word in the <title level="m">OED</title>
                        and to examine Wheatley’s use of meter, which (parts of) words she chooses
                        to stress or not. Moving line by line through the poem with attentiveness to
                        its shifts in tone from self as passive recipient of action to the
                        imperative tone of the final couplet affords students the opportunity to
                        plot the coordinates of their journey as readers and the poem’s abolitionist
                        self actualization. The poem begins, however, by deemphasizing or concealing
                        the self: <quote>
                            <lg type="line">
                                <l>’Twas <hi rend="bold">mer</hi>cy <hi rend="bold">brought</hi> me
                                        <hi rend="bold">from</hi> my <hi rend="bold"><emph>Pa</emph></hi><hi rend="italic">gan</hi></l>
                                <l><hi rend="bold">land</hi>, (l. 1)</l>
                            </lg>
                        </quote> The words “me” and “my” are carefully placed on unstressed
                        syllables of the iambic feet, and despite the active verb, the self is acted
                        upon, (as in the title), but does not act and is not emphasized. However, if
                        the “I” of the poem’s first word were restored (to read “It was” rather than
                        “’Twas”), the poem would scan differently with “me” and “my” being stressed
                        rather than unstressed. Wheatley uses iamb to declare “I Am.” Also, in the
                        typography of the first edition, the word “land” appears alone, in its own
                        line, and thus metaphorically positioned as the slave ship (which is not
                        mentioned in the narrative poetry) moving between the first and second line
                        of the poem and floating in an Atlantic of blank space (McKenzie).</p>
                    <p>The second line takes a significant, but subtle, step forward in emphasizing
                        the self by accenting the first-person possessive pronoun: <quote>
                            <lg type="line">
                                <l>Taught <hi rend="bold">my</hi> be<hi rend="bold">night</hi>ed <hi
                                        rend="bold">soul</hi> to <hi rend="bold">un</hi>der<hi
                                        rend="bold">stand</hi> (l. 2)</l>
                            </lg>
                        </quote> In accenting the word “my,” the poem functions like syncopation in
                        music, emphasizing that which has been de-emphasized. The first three
                        emphasized syllables taken together (without the unaccented ones in between)
                        read “my night soul.” These words can be thrown into relief by their
                        appearance in bold on the board, and also by leading a class-wide recitation
                        of each line in which the students also clap while articulating the accented
                        syllables. These three little words celebrate both Wheatley’s blackness and
                        fly in the face of the theology of slaveholders, who claimed that black
                        people did not have souls and thus could not be saved. Wesley and Whitefield
                        moved a step beyond this racist theology by preaching to black people, slave
                        and “free” alike; however, their theology still accommodated the existence
                        of slavery. In Wheatley’s theology, she transcends the theology of the
                        preachers of the Great Awakening: she holds that her soul has understanding,
                        anticipating the Coleridgean distinction between reason and
                        understanding.</p>
                    <p>Although in the first couplet, the speaker still does not perform actively as
                        the subject of a verb, her soul is the indirect object of “taught” and the
                        implied subject of the infinitive “to understand.” Also, “soul” moves a
                        small step closer to subject-hood in the third line, for it is (the direct
                        object of) “taught”: <quote>
                            <lg type="line">

                            </lg>
                        </quote> As in the first syllable of the first line, the apostrophe (of
                        “there’s”) removes the “i” in both accented occurrences. Significantly and
                        importantly for the theological implications of typography and scansion in
                        this poem, “God” is accented, indicating a consciousness of the importance
                        of emphasizing divinity and paralleling the divine being with the spiritual
                        being of Wheatley’s soul in the previous line and title. This third line
                        also maps double consciousness: the single consciousness “That there’s a
                        God” is twinned by the awareness “That there’s a <emph>Saviour</emph> too.”
                        The repetition creates parallelism by contrasting the wrathful god of the
                        Torah (seemingly placating readers who held the racist view that dark skin
                        is the “mark of Cain,” but then subtly subverting this view) with the
                        presence of the merciful Jesus of the Christian New Testament, not implying
                        damnation, but rather salvation for black people.</p>
                    <p>In order to map the subversive qualities of the rhythm in the opening three
                        lines, it’s necessary to prepare the class with lectures or student
                        presentations on the presence and history of syncopation in music. In
                        traditional African American and Black Atlantic music from spirituals to
                        jazz to reggae to hip hop, syncopation is subversive: it accentuates the
                        usually unaccented beat, referred to as the “and” of the beat, while the
                        accented “strong” beat is left silent or unaccented. This aspect can be
                        exemplified by dividing the class and leading them in clapping their hands
                        to a 4/4 rhythm with one half clapping on the “on beat” and the other on the
                        “off beat.” There’s also the possibility of analyzing the rhetoric of why we
                        refer to these beats as “on” and “strong” as opposed to “off” and “weak.”
                        Wheatley’s removing herself from the beginning of the poem is symbolic
                        syncopation, a performative poetics and logical reversal, in accord with the
                        Biblical injunction, “So the last shall be first, and the first last”
                        (Matthew 20:16).</p>
                    <p>The connection between syncopated rhythms, the history of slavery, and
                        disenfranchised people is made clear in Bob Marley’s reggae “riddims,” which
                        accentuate the “weak” beat throughout as he renders this musical reversal
                        political by singing, “Now the weak must be strong” (Marley <title level="a"
                            >Them Belly Full…</title>). Playing reggae aloud in the classroom will
                        allow students to hear how the chucking of the guitar and bubbling of the
                        keyboard land on the “weak” beat, which is made strong by these instruments
                        emphasizing it in unison. In classical music, a beat is divided into an
                        accented “downbeat” followed by unaccented “and” of the beat. However, the
                        rhythm of an iamb, exactly like syncopation, reverses this emphasis by
                        beginning with the unstressed syllable, followed by the stressed one. In a
                        more abstract way, a similar reversal occurs over the first half of the
                        poem. Continuing to map the poem’s marked shift in the first four lines from
                        deemphasizing the passive self to emphasizing the active self, the next
                        coordinate is where the “I” is finally accentuated: <quote>
                            <lg type="line">
                                <l>Once <hi rend="bold">I</hi> re<hi rend="bold">demp</hi>tion <hi
                                        rend="bold">nei</hi>ther <hi rend="bold">sough</hi>t nor
                                    <hi rend="bold" xml:space="preserve">knew </hi>(l. 4)</l>
                            </lg>
                        </quote> As in musical syncopation, the poem uses rhythm to make the “weak”
                        “strong” implying a theological reversal of fortunes. Wheatley masks this
                        revolutionary moment syntactically with the “neither/nor” construct; now the
                        action of self is negated, or only implied by what the “I” does not do. In
                        the first line, all references to Wheatley land on unaccented syllables, but
                        in the fourth line “I” lands on an accented syllable. The beat is reversed,
                        so to speak, as is the line from and emphasis from <title level="a">Amazing
                            Grace</title>: “I once was lost.” Thus what was once unstressed becomes
                        stressed; similarly, syncopation accents the previously unaccented part of
                        the beat. This line is rhythmically double voiced: it can scan two ways. It
                        is possible also to scan the “Once” as stressed, creating an accent shift
                        that syncopates the iambic foot by making it trochaic. In-class listening to
                        African American spirituals with attention to the reversals of being damned
                        or saved and the function of water (anticipating or perhaps influencing
                        Coleridge’s <title level="a">Rime of the Ancient Mariner</title>) is an
                        illuminating way out from Wheatley to wider contexts of interplay among
                        rhythms, words, and liberation theology.</p>
                    <p>Two contexts emerge as equally important to understanding the subtle
                        gradations of meaning and concomitant power shifts in the poem: musical
                        syncopation and Atlantic revolutionary rhetoric. The latter is established
                        in Manning’s chapter on <title level="a">Mapping the Language,</title> the
                        perfect reading to assign to the class as a way to bridge the European
                        American and Black Atlantic rhetoricities of revolution. Wheatley’s shift in
                        this poem models, according to Hugh Blair’s 1759 <title level="m">Lectures
                            in Rhetoric and Belles Lettres</title>, the linguistic progression from
                        “primitive” to “civilized” cultures. Manning discusses Blair’s racist
                        understanding of the relationship between civilization and syntax: <quote>
                            Primitive peoples like the American Indians order their sentences
                            according to instinct and imagination, first naming the object of
                            attention, then indicating their desired relationship to it. As
                            civilizations progress, their use of language inverts this order,
                            placing the self at the head, and distancing the thing, the object,
                            further into the syntax of the sentence. This new order ‘may be called
                            the order of the understanding.’ (247) </quote> Manning provides the
                        perspective to see what is at stake for Wheatley in exemplifying this shift
                        to prove her ability with language, as she had to do before the group of
                        Boston rimy-wigged statesmen who interviewed her to certify that she
                        actually wrote the poems. In the first four lines, Wheatley mirrors this
                        progression. Take, for instance, the first line: “’Twas Mercy brought me
                        from my <emph>Pagan</emph> land,” which seemingly names the object of
                        attention “Mercy” and states her relationship to it. However, Wheatley again
                        subverts established revolutionary rhetoric: rather than moving herself
                        further from her object (election) she juxtaposes the two of them, moving as
                        close as possible to salvation: “Once <emph>I redemption</emph>” (4).</p>
                    <p>In 1778, the Anglo-Scot James Beattie articulated just what was at stake for
                        the colonized in adopting the language of the colonizer and indicated that
                        the practice of slavery was supported by Atlantic English; transatlantic
                        rhetoric had glossed over the horrors of slavery, naturalizing it in
                        metaphor: <quote> We are slaves to the language we write, and are
                            continually afraid of committing <emph>gross</emph> blunders. [….] An
                            English author of learning is the master, not the slave, of his
                            language, and wields it gracefully, because he wields it with ease, and
                            with full assurance that he has command of it. (Forbes 17) </quote> In
                        order to overturn the slave trade, Wheatley had to subvert it
                        linguistically, poetically, and theologically. Manning comments on Beattie’s
                        words by noting that “self-consciousness about style had an edge of fear
                        which elided the social and the eschatological. Somewhere within it was a
                        belief that to get it wrong was not simply to risk derision but damnation”
                        (242). The poem accommodates a pro-slavery reading as well as an
                        abolitionist one, ultimately reflecting the readers’ views in their
                        interpretation and perhaps changing readers’ minds with the possibility of
                        the more radical interpretation that extends the principles of the
                        Enlightenment to all. In this way, the poem functions as a map to salvation,
                        potentially charting a course for equality in the reader’s mind. This
                        context maps how Wheatley reversed the roles of the colonizer and colonized
                        in her poem: she wields language so carefully that she becomes the master
                        and her reader in need of emancipation “from mental slavery” (Marley, <title
                            level="a">Redemption Song</title>). Wheatley’s poem, to paraphrase
                        Blake, cleanses the doors of perception, removing the “mind-forg’d manacles”
                        (line 8) so the slavery advocate can become an abolitionist. John Newton
                        leads his readers on a similar journey from passivity to agency in words
                        that are as close to Wheatley’s in meaning as they are in date of
                        composition (1772): <quote>

                        </quote> This hymn, like Wheatley’s poem, maps a route to heaven.</p>
                    <p> Just as the class is able to map the double voicedness of each word’s
                        meanings as well as the metric binary of stressed and unstressed beats, it
                        is also important that the class map the split between the first four lines
                        of the poem and the last. Before arriving at salvation, Wheatley pauses to
                        reflect on earthly limitations. The second half of <title level="a">On Being
                            Brought from Africa to America</title> contains a shift from the past to
                        the present tense. Wheatley’s identity emerges through the use of the word
                        “our.” She identifies herself as black and separates potentially racist
                        readers from her and her people: <quote>
                            <lg>

                            </lg>
                        </quote> The heraldic “sable” linked with “race” is positive, subverting the
                        negative view of those who believe the racist theology of dark skin as the
                        mark of Cain. The “I” disappears again in the sight of the prejudice in the
                        “eye” of the slaveholder, but “sable” shows that beauty is in the “I” of the
                        be(-k)nighted poet and quill holder. In heraldry, “sable” is symbolized as a
                        shield that is half black and half white with black gridlines over the white
                        background, symbolizing being protected by the aegis of blackness. This
                        symbolism creates a counter-reading to the racist theology about dark skin,
                        with a scriptural allusion to the mark of Cain as a sign that its bearer is
                        unable to be killed, a hint at afterlife and reversal of “die” and death.
                        The other half of the shield with the gridlines represents an almost
                        yin-yang deconstruction of the Manichean duality that undergirds slavery,
                        mapping a journey across opposites. Wheatley’s fifth line also reflects the
                        mapping of the journey of slave ships, since “sable” is also defined as “by
                        sea” and “race” as a “journey” (<title level="m">OED</title>).</p>
                    <p> The final couplet contains the most powerful language. The verb tense
                        undergoes a giant shift from passive in the first line to imperative in the
                        penultimate one: <quote>

                            </lg>
                        </quote> Whereas the lines appear as a plea for the possibility of slaves in
                        the afterlife, the fact that “me,” “Christ,” “black,” “join,” and “train”
                        are all accented hints at a reading far more radical in the context of
                        Puritanical Boston than at first appears: Wheatley and her fellow black
                        people occupy the seats among the elect that the Puritans had reserved for
                        themselves, for they are with Christ among those predestined for salvation.
                        The implied subject of the imperative “Remember” is “you,” although her
                        hortatory auditors are “Christians”; thus, Wheatley commands the subjects of
                        her (death) sentence to recall that they (the pro-slavery readers) may also
                        “be refin’d.” The emphasis on “<hi rend="bold">Christ</hi>ianity” puts the
                        “I” (sound) back in the word, mapping the difference between Christ-ians
                        (those who are Christ-like) and <emph>Christians</emph> (those who support
                        slavery). The slaveholders, however, “may [possibly] be refin’d, and join
                        the angelic train” should they follow this poem’s map to salvation
                        correctly.</p>
                    <p>According to the hegemonic reading, the final couplet seems to be using what
                        Manning refers to as hypotaxis, use of syntax to imply a hierarchical
                        relationship, seemingly making the black people subordinate to the elect,
                        independent white people; however, the punctuation also allows for a
                        subversive reading that reveals the opposite: “so the last shall be first,
                        and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen” (Matthew 20:16).
                        This reading goes significantly beyond Whitefield and Wesley to a Greater
                        Awakening of abolitionist theology. A third reading reveals parataxis, the
                        “placing of propositions or clauses one after another, without indicating by
                        connecting words the relation (of coordination or subordination) between
                        them” (<title level="m">OED</title>). Susan Manning notes how parataxis
                        eliminates hierarchy, making the items in the list equal and
                        interchangeable, and in this instance Wheatley maps the spaces between them.
                        This indicates the potential sinfulness and subsequent salvation for all
                        through the process of being “refin’d.” In this reading, the politics of
                        punctuation become crucial; focusing on the commas that separate
                        “Christians, Negros, black as Cain” makes the items listed interchangeable,
                        thus opening up the possibility that it is the slaveholding Christians whose
                        souls are black as Cain” and in need of refinement, and not the opposite as
                        the hegemonic reading would yield. The possibilities the poem’s parataxis
                        opens up require that students examine the ways the poem is freighted with
                        double meanings and double consciousness. Wheatley uses syntax to levy a tax
                        on sin. With one reading it becomes the duty of the reader to critique the
                        customs of society steeped in the Atlantic slave trade and acknowledge that
                        even the souls of slave traders and owners can be saved. Even the other
                        far-less-radical reading posits that black people have souls and may be
                        among the elect, ideas not accepted widely (or even outright denied) among
                        pro-slavery Christians.</p>
                    <p>Scholars, such as Philip Gould, have noted the final couplet’s metaphorical
                        resonance with the refining of cane sugar on plantations (Gould), but have
                        not discussed how the imagery of this process sustains the metaphor, with
                        the cut stalks of cane appearing as bones and referred to with such words as
                        “black, white, and ivory bone char” that are placed in boiling houses
                        through seven smaller and increasingly hotter kettles (baptismal fonts) only
                        to emerge as the stardust of white sugar crystals, or as molasses syrup
                        decolorized through filtration. The molasses and sugar were shipped across
                        the Atlantic and sold in England and other countries with the profit going
                        toward purchasing more slaves. Quaker leader William Fox noted the mock
                        transubstantiation of sugar plantations and the taste for sugar that
                        sustained them, noting that every pound of sugar consumed may be considered
                        as consuming two ounces of human flesh. Wheatley’s final couplet likens the
                        processes by which cane is cut, refined, and transformed into sugar to
                        death, resurrection, and ascension, thereby charting the coordinates of the
                        voyage from earth to heaven, as opposed to the journey from Africa to
                        American slavery. The intimation that the suffering of slaves on plantations
                        is comparable to Christ’s suffering, crucifixion, and death is made clear in
                        the juxtaposition of “Christians, Negros.” Adding “Black as Cain” reverses
                        the idea that enslaved black people have the mark of Cain and, instead,
                        marks them as Abel, murdered by their brothers. This anticipates a similar
                        juxtaposition by Coleridge in the title of his poem
                            <emph>Christ</emph>[-]<emph>abel</emph>.</p>
                    <p>According to the Credo <title level="a">Mind Map,</title> Wheatley’s poetry
                        and Romanticism do not even contain “related concepts.” As a classroom
                        activity, students can work in groups to draw up more inclusive mind maps
                        that link African American literature with British Romanticism, eighteenth-
                        and nineteenth-century American literature, writers of the black Atlantic,
                        and other oral traditions and writings of the Americas, Canada, and the
                        Caribbean. The Credo Mind Maps for Wheatley and Romanticism can be placed
                        side by side, and class-wide brainstorming can chart continua as well as
                        points of contact, contestation, and connection between them. Some of the
                        many connections that <emph>should</emph> be present on the Credo <title
                            level="a">Mind Maps</title> for “Romanticism” and “Phillis Wheatley” are
                        Wheatley’s critiques of Enlightenment ideology, which anticipate
                        Romanticism. Wheatley’s poem is a refinery of its readers’ sensibilities
                        about slavery, each line subtly removing impure connotations surrounding
                        blackness (“Their colour is a diabolic die,” l. 6) and replacing them with
                        regal ones such as those associated with “sable.” Wheatley maps the ways in
                        which, to use Hugh Blair’s terms, “linguistic authority” becomes a
                        substitute for “spiritual authority” (Manning 247). She also purifies the
                        language and spirituality of the emerging Republic in the hope that it will
                        affect the government and vice versa, a sentiment evident in her poem to
                        George Washington and echoed by John Adams in his 1780 letter to the
                        President of Congress: <quote> As eloquence is cultivated with more care in
                            free republics than in other governments, it has been found by constant
                            experience that such republics have produced greater purity,
                            copiousness, and perfection of language. It is not to be disputed that
                            the form of government has an influence upon language, and language in
                            its turn influences not only the form of government, but the temper, the
                            sentiments, and manners of the people. (qtd. in Manning 251). </quote>
                        Memory and imagination are the processes through which Wheatley’s experience
                        is refined into democratic poetry. Her images function as more than words,
                        as reminders to her readers in her spiritual logos-centric poetry that “the
                        Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us” (John 1:14). Her poetry crosses the
                        Atlantic (from publication in London to be sold in America) as a commodity,
                        reversing the route of the slave ships showing the power of the book trade
                        to defeat the slave trade with the voice of a prophet to eliminate the
                        profit of “Being Brought from Africa to America.” In the last two lines of
                        the poem, Wheatley extends Cartesian innatism beyond the self by alluding to
                        her knowledge of her readers’ divinely implanted knowledge, for she bids
                        them “Remember” something they once knew and have apparently forgotten: “in
                        every human breast God has implanted a principle, which we call love of
                        freedom” (Wheatley <title level="a">Letter to Rev. Samson Occom</title>
                        226). Wheatley links the enslaved and the free not with chains, but by using
                        rhetoric and syncopation to map hearts beating as one across oceans of
                        space, time, race, class, and gender. Her poetry calls to mind the advice of
                            <title level="m">Black Panther</title>’s T’Challa, who echoes an ancient
                        African proverb: “In times of trouble, the wise build bridges and the
                        foolish build walls.” </p>
