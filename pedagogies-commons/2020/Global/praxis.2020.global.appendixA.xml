                considering that ignorance, neglect, or contempt for the rights of man are the sole
                causes of public misfortunes and of the corruption of governments, have resolved to
                set forth, in a solemn declaration, the natural, inalienable and sacred rights of
                man, in order that this declaration, constantly present to all members of the social
                body, will ceaselessly remind them of their rights and their duties; so that the
                acts of the legislative and the executive powers, able to be compared at any moment
                with the aim of all political institutions, will be better respected; so that the

            <p rend="noCount">It is true that deference to authority has declined, that its lawlessness is
                unmasked, and, although still armed with power, sneaks no dignity any more; men have
                awoken from their long lethargy and self-deception, and by an impressive majority
                they are demanding the restitution of their inalienable rights. Nor are they merely
                demanding them: on every side they are bestirring themselves to seize by force what
                has, in their opinion, been wrongfully withheld from them. The fabric of the natural
                State is tottering, its rotten foundations are yielding, and there seems to be a 
                <emph>physical</emph> possibility of setting Law upon the throne, of
                honouring Man at last as an end in himself and making true freedom the basis of
                political association. Vain hope! The <emph>moral</emph> possibility is
                wanting, and the favourable moment finds an apathetic generation.</p>

            <p rend="noCount">I am now convinced that the highest act of reason, by encompassing all ideas, is an
                aesthetic act, and that truth and goodness are only siblings in beauty...Until we
                make ideas aesthetic, that is, mythological, they are of no interest to the people,
                and vice versa: until mythology is rational, it will be an embarrassment to
                philosophy. Thus those who are enlightened and those who are not must finally make
                common cause, mythology must become philosophical, to make the people rational, and
                philosophy must become mythological, to make philosophy sensuous. Then eternal unity
                will reign among us. Never again the arrogant glance, never again the blind
                shuddering of the people before its wise men and priests. Only then will equal
                development of all of our powers await us, for the particular person as well as for
                all individuals. Now power will again be suppressed, then general freedom and
                equality will reign among spirits! – A higher spirit, sent from heaven, must found

            <p rend="noCount">The whole objection however of the immorality of poetry rests upon a misconception
                of the manner in which poetry acts to produce the moral improvement of man. Ethical
                science arranges the elements which poetry has created, and propounds schemes and
                proposes examples of civil and domestic life: nor is it for want of admirable
                doctrines that men hate, and despise, and censure, and deceive, and subjugate one
                another. But Poetry acts in another and a diviner manner. It awakens and enlarges
                the mind itself by rendering it the receptacle of a thousand unapprehended
                combinations of thought. Poetry lifts the veil from the hidden beauty of the world,
                and makes familiar objects be as if they were not familiar; it reproduces all that
                it represents, and the impersonations clothed in its Elysian light stand
                thenceforward in the minds of those who have once contemplated them, as memorials of
                that gentle and exalted content which extends itself over all thoughts and actions
                with which it coexists. The great secret of morals is Love; or a going out of our
                own nature, and an identification of ourselves with the beautiful which exists in
                thought, action, or person, not our own.</p>

                form any judgment of a scene, the sublimity of which depended much less on its
                external magnificence than on the effect it produced on the minds of the spectators.
                ‘The people, sure, the people were the sight!’ I may tell you of pavilions, of
                triumphal arches, of altars on which incense was burnt, of two hundred thousand men
                walking in procession; but how am I to give you an adequate idea of the behaviour of
                the spectators? How am I to paint the impetuous feelings of that immense, that
                exulting multitude? Half a million of people assembled at a spectacle, which
                furnished every image that can elevate the mind of man; which connected the
                enthusiasm of moral sentiment with the solemn pomp of religious ceremonies; which
                addressed itself at once to the imagination, the understanding, and the heart!</p>

            <p rend="noCount">The transition from the state of nature to the civil state produces a very
                remarkable change in man, by substituting in his behavior justice for instinct, and
                by imbuing his actions with a moral quality they previously lacked. Only when the
                voice of duty prevails over physical impulse, and law prevails over appetite, does
                man, who until then was preoccupied only with himself, understand that he must act
                according to other principles, and must consult his reason before listening to his
                inclinations. Although, in this state, he gives up many advantages that he derives
                from nature, he acquires equally great ones in return; his faculties are used and
                developed; his ideas are expanded; his feelings are ennobled; his entire soul is
                raised to such a degree that, if the abuses of this new condition did not often
                degrade him below that from which he has emerged, he ought to bless continually the
                wonderful moment that released him from it forever, and transformed him from a
                stupid, limited animal into an intelligent being and a man.</p>

            <p rend="noCount">The dynamic state can only make society possible, by curbing Nature through Nature;
                the ethical State can only make it (morally) necessary, by subjecting the individual
                to the general will; the aesthetic State alone can make it actual, since it carries
                out the will of the whole through the nature of the individual. Though need may
                drive Man into society, and Reason implant social principles in him, Beauty alone
                can confer on him a social character. Taste alone brings harmony into society,
                because it establishes harmony in the individual.</p>

                favourable to accuracy than to sprightliness and sublimity. As the world advances,
                the understanding gains ground upon the imagination; the understanding is more
                exercised; the imagination, less. Fewer objects occur that are new or surprizing.
                Men apply themselves to trace the causes of things; they correct and refine one
                another; they subdue or disguise their passions; they form their exterior manners
                upon one uniform standard of politeness and civility. Human nature is pruned
                according to method and rule. Language advances from sterility to copiousness, and
                at the same time, from fervour and enthusiasm, to correctness and precision. Style
                becomes more chaste; but less animated. The progress of the world in this respect
                resembles the progress of age in man. The powers of imagination are most vigorous
                and predominant in youth; those of the understanding ripen more slowly, and often
                attain not their maturity, till the imagination begins to flag. Hence, poetry, which
                is the child of imagination, is frequently most glowing and animated in the first
                ages of society. As the ideas of our youth are remembered with a peculiar pleasure
                on account of their liveliness and vivacity; so the most ancient poems have often
                proved the greatest fovourites of nations.</p>

            <p rend="noCount">Fingal being talked of, Dr. Johnson, who used to boast that he had, from the first,
                resisted both Ossian and the Giants of Patagonia, averred his positive disbelief of
                its authenticity. Lord Elibank said, ‘I am sure it is not Macpherson’s. Mr. Johnson,
                I keep company a great deal with you; it is known I do. I may borrow from you better
                things than I can say myself, and give them as my own; but if I should, everybody
                will know whose they are.’ The Doctor was not softened by this compliment. He denied
                merit to Fingal, supposing it to be the production of a man who has had the
                advantages that the present age affords, and said, ‘Nothing is more easy than to
                write enough in that style if once you begin.’ One gentleman in company expressing
                his opinion that Fingal was certainly genuine, for that he had heard a great part of
                it repeated in the original, Dr. Johnson indignantly asked him whether he understood
                the original; to which an answer being given in the negative, ‘Why then,’ said Dr.
                Johnson, ‘we see to what this testimony comes: thus it is.’</p>

            <p rend="noCount">The elegiac poet seeks nature, but as an idea and in perfection in which she has
                never existed, even if he mourns her as something having existed and now lost. When
                Ossian tells of the days which are no more, and of the heroes who have disappeared,
                his poetic power has long since transformed those images of recollection into
                ideals, and those heroes into gods. The experience of a particular loss has been
                broadened into the idea of universal evanescence and the bard, affected and pursued
                by the image of omnipresent ruin, elevates himself to the skies to find there, in
                the cycle of the sun, an image of the immutable.</p>

            <p rend="noCount">There are, it seems to me, two entirely distinct literatures, that coming up from
                the South and that coming down from the North, that of which Homer is the main
                source and that of which Ossian is the origin. The English poets, it may be said,
                are noteworthy for their philosophic spirit – it is displayed in all their works –
                whereas Ossian has almost no serious ideas: he narrates a succession of incidents
                and impressions. I answer to this objection that the most common images and ideas in
                Ossian are those that call to mind the brevity of life, respect for the dead and the
                celebration of their memory, and the devotion of those who remain to those who are
                departed. If the poet has not combined with these sentiments any moral maxims or
                philosophical reflections, it is because in that era the human mind was not yet
                capable of the abstraction necessary for the drawing of conclusions. But the shock
                to the imagination caused by the songs of Ossian dispose the mind to the most
                profound meditations.</p>

            <p rend="noCount">None but foreigners are still the dupes of Ossian; all England is convinced 
                that the poems which bear the name of his are the works of Mr. Macpherson himself. I was for
                a long time deceived by this ingenious fraud; an enthusiast in Ossian, like a young
                man, as I was then, I was obliged to pass several years among the literati of London
                before I could be entirely undeceived. But at length, conviction was no longer to be
                resisted, and the palaces of Fingal vanished away from before me like many other of
                my dreams . . .</p>
            <p rend="noCount">To say the truth it seems now wholly incredible how any one ever could have 
                been deceived with respect to the true author of Ossian’s poems. The man of the
                eighteenth century peeps through the thin veil at every moment. I will only instance
                by way of example the apostrophe of the bard to the sun. ‘O sun,’ he says, ‘whence
                comest thou, whither dost thou go, wilt thou not fall one day,’ &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
            <p rend="noCount">Madame de Staël who is so well versed in the history of the human understanding 
                will see that there are here so many complex ideas under moral, physical, and
                metaphysical relations, that they can scarcely without palpable absurdity be
                ascribed to a savage. Besides this, the most abstract ideas on time, on duration,
                and on eternity, occur at almost every page of Ossian. I have lived among the
                savages of America, and I have observed that they often talk of the times that are
                past, but never of those that are to come. Some grains of dust at the bottom of the
                tomb, remain to them as a testimony of life in the vacuum of the past, but what can
                indicate to them existence in the vacuum of the future. This anticipation of the
                future, which is so familiar to us, is nevertheless one of the strongest
                abstractions at which the ideas of mankind have arrived. Happy the savage who does
                not know like us, that grief is followed by grief, and whose soul devoid of
                recollection or of foresight does not concenter in itself, by a sort of painful
                eternity, the past, the present, and the future.</p>
            <p rend="noCount">But what proves incontestably that Mr. Macpherson is the author of Ossian’s 
                poems, is the perfection or the beautiful ideal of morals which reigns in them. This deserves
                to be somewhat dwelt upon. The beautiful ideal is the offspring of society; men
                nearly in a state of nature have no conception of it. They content themselves in
                their songs, with painting exactly what they see; and as they live in the midst of
                deserts, their pictures are always grand and poetical; for this reason no bad taste
                is to be found in their compositions, but then they are and must be, monotonous, and
                the sentiments they express cannot arrive at true heroism. . . .</p>
            <p rend="noCount">I ask now where Ossian could have imbibed those perfect ideas of morals with which he
                adorns his heroes. It was not in his religion, since it is agreed on all hands that
                there is no religion among his savages. Could it be from nature itself? – And how
                should the savage Ossian seated upon a rock in Caledonia, while every thing around
                him was cruel, barbarous, gross and sanguinary, arrive so rapidly at those notions
                of morals which were scarcely understood by Socrates in the most enlightened days of
                Greece? – notions, which the Gospel alone revealed to the world, as the result of
                observations pursued for four thousand years upon the character of man....In fine,
                Mr. Macpherson has been guilty of mistakes in Natural History, which would alone
                suffice to betray the imposture: he has planted oaks where nothing but gorse ever
                grew, and made eagles scream, where nothing was ever heard but the voice of the
                barnacle, or the whistling of the curlew.”</p>
