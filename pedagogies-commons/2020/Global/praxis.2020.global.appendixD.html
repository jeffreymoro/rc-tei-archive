               <h2><span class="head">Description</span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">This course examines imaginative representations of the self in the poems, novels,
                  autobiographies, essays, and sermons of the earliest African American writers, including
                  the works of Phillis Wheatley, Harriet Jacobs, and Frederick Douglass and draws connections
                  with contemporary writers and musicians. “Imag-I-Nations” is a term that denotes the
                  ways writers represent themselves and construct identity along (trans)national lines
                  as well as the way the imagination embroiders the representation of self through metaphors
                  that cut across nations, realms, and borders (both physical and imagined). “Imag-I-Nations”
                  is a nod towards Homi K. Bhabha’s “DissemiNation” and its acknowledgement of Derrida’s
                  book of the same title (sans capital “N”). Paul Gilroy’s notion of an “Ethiopianist
                  Imaginary” is an important way of understanding how black Atlantic writers recreate
                  a home that reifies the black identity that the white supremacist power structures
                  attempt to destroy or define and confine (9). Ultimately, Wheatley maps a heavenly
                  home—a room in the “bright abode / Th’Empyreal palace of the thund’ring God” (<em>On Imagination,</em> lines 3–4),—that exists in her lines of poetry, not wholly unlike Whitman’s casting
                  himself as a house unto himself “a cosmos” or Wordsworth “whose dwelling is in the
                  light of setting suns,” or Dickinson’s dwelling “in possibility— / A fairer house
                  than prose—&gt;” (Poem 466, 1–2). Ultimately, the transnational Imag-I-Nation creates
                  a place that can’t be mapped or owned, an imaginary place.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Gilroy’s <em>Black Atlantic</em> makes an irrefutable case for the centrality of music to understanding the interplay
                  among Atlantic cultures. He demonstrates that African American liberation theology
                  that dates from the time of slavery is a central theme in music of the “black Atlantic.”
                  In the tradition of Wheatley, many black Atlantic artists have created spiritual utopias
                  with words to express their hopes, but these artists have also used syncopated poetry
                  in the form of hip hop lyrics to create dystopias that give vent to the persistence
                  of racism in the wake of colonialism and slavery. Reggae, dancehall, and hip hop artists
                  in the late 20th to early 21st century create an urban identity through the interplay
                  between the representation of self and city. In the lyrics of many artists, ghettos
                  are cast in biblical terms as utopias or dystopias, and the rapper or singer as the
                  old testament prophet warning of the fall of Babylon and/or the voice prophesying
                  Zion/New Jerusalem: as is exemplified by the difference between the dystopic America
                  of Childish Gambino, the New York City of Grandmaster Flash’s 
                  “Message”
                  and Nas’s 
                  “N.Y. State of Mind”
                  compared with beatific Big Apple of Jay Z and Alicia Keys’s 
                  “Empire State of Mind”
                  ; Kendrick Lamar’s Compton; Lauryn Hill’s 
                  “New Jersey”
                  as Zion; and, to cross the Atlantic, Apache Indian’s union of self, Birmingham (UK)
                  and his ancestral home in India in terms of a blessed combination of the four elements
                  as well as Rastafarian and Hindu religions in “Om Numah Shivaya.” One of the many
                  links among these writers is the message that, in the words of Salman Rushdie, “we
                  will not be capable of reclaiming precisely the thing that was lost; that we will,
                  in short, create fictions, not actual cities of villages, but invisible ones, imaginary
                  homelands” (10). According to Credo’s Mind Maps, even these imaginary homelands are
                  segregated by library classification systems of call numbers, and shelf marks as well
                  academic curricula that house these fictional homes in separate dwelling spaces. What
                  are the connections between these forms of separation in the way knowledges and cities
                  are constructed?</p>

               <p class="noCount">Listen to Bob Marley’s <em>Redemption Song</em> and analyze the lyrics. Read the selections, specified below, from Paul Gilroy’s

                  “Redemption Song,”
                  <em>Amistad</em>, and the historical event (on which the film is based), specifically through a response
                  to these three questions: What do ships signify/symbolize in the film <em>Amistad</em> and <em>Redemption Song</em>? How does Gilroy’s writing about “ships” help us understand the song, the film, and
                  historical event? How do Marley’s and Spielberg’s portrayal of ships as well as the
                  event on which the film is based help us understand Gilroy?</p>

                  of space conducive to hierarchy? For a slave, how is a port or a hull a different

                  accessibility of space change during an emergency? How is London different from the
                  Americas, Africa, and the West Indies? Do any laws apply on the waterways? How can
