               <p>This paper describes a course that covers the Romantic period of European and American
                  literature as the moment and site of the modern invention and institution of “culture”—both
                  as an object of study and as a historical and ethical basis for the establishment
                  of self and society. I last taught the course in 2012, and so this paper is something
                  of a retrospective account. I maintain the present tense in my description, however,
                  because this report has inspired me to take up the course again in the near future.
                  It has also alerted me to the need to update its approaches to reflect the fine work
                  in global Romanticism published in the interval and to reconsider how instructional
                  approaches to Romanticism’s “logic of culture” might intersect with accounts of its
                  “global imaginary.” This is a pedagogical report, not a scholarly intervention, and
                  so I will simply acknowledge the compelling recent work of Samuel Baker, Evan Gottlieb,
                  James Mulholland, Juliet Shields, Julie Carr, and Jeffrey Robinson among others whose
                  varied meditations on the interplay between Romantic forms and mobile networks of
                  global trade, communication, and empire must now inform any sustained reading of the
                  authors I cover in this course. It is a confirmation of many of their varied but complementary
                  models of Romanticism that a course focused primarily on the question of culture turns
                  repeatedly in its concerns to the question of the global.</p>
               <p>During a 15-week semester, the students and I read, in English, aesthetic treatises
                  by Blair, Herder, and Schiller, poetry by Macpherson and Byron, and novels by Rousseau,
                  Goethe, Staël, and Cooper. These texts are supplemented by theoretical work on the
                  logic of culture in the modern era and the condition of the modern university. Our
                  primary concerns are to enjoy the rich complexities of these literary projects, to
                  understand their role in establishing culture as a new model of authority and identity,
                  and to perceive the centrality of Romanticism in shaping current cultural paradigms
                  and dilemmas. </p>
               <p>Both the title of my course and our initial historical and theoretical parameters
                  are taken from William Ray’s <em>The Logic of Culture: Authority and Identity in the Modern Age</em>, a rich and suggestive meditation on culture that draws upon the sociological models
                  of Pierre Bourdieu and Jürgen Habermas with nods back to Matthew Arnold, Norbert Elias,
                  F. R. Leavis, and Raymond Williams, and which contains extended engagements with Rousseau,
                  Herder, Kant, and Schiller. Ray’s work is exceptionally productive in the advanced
                  undergraduate classroom not only for his lucid prose and clear explications of social
                  and aesthetic theories, but for the remarkably capacious extent of his argument. In
                  just under 200 pages, Ray offers a) a theoretical model of culture and identity formation
                  in the modern era; b) an intellectual history of European Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment
                  critique; c) a survey of social and literary “institutions” (the museum, the novel)
                  that are both determined by and determinative of cultural logic; and d) a telling
                  and provocative consideration of recent debates over globalization and multiculturalism.
                  Even limiting ourselves to his introduction and first chapter on the roots of cultural
                  logic, paired with Raymond Williams’s treatment of the term <em>culture</em> in <em>Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society</em> and the entry from the OED, we are able to begin interrogating an idea most students
                  simply take for granted.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>I pair these theoretical writings with the opening passages from two primary texts
                     (of sorts) which lay bare the modern ideology of culture, David Finn’s <em>How to Visit a Museum</em> and John Sutherland’s <em>How to Read a Novel: A User’s Guide</em>. Each of these works offer accessible case studies in how regulatory norms are prescribed
                     through idealizations of subjective responses under the aegis of culture. Finn promotes
                     the cultural management of freedom most succinctly in his opening lines by telling
                     his readers that “there is no right or wrong way to visit a museum. The most important
                     rule you should keep in mind as you go through the front door is to follow your own
                     instincts” (10). Sutherland offers an equally normative valorization of acculturated
                     subjectivity through Tolstoy’s depiction of Anna Karenina’s “sublimely languorous”
                     immersion in a Trollope novel on a train from Moscow to St. Petersburg (3). Both Finn
                     and Sutherland insist on the individuality of aesthetic response in contrast to a
                     perceived surfeit of objects and texts in the modern world, constructing aesthetic
                     pleasure as a marker of human intelligence, a badge of honor for the cultured visitor/reader,
                     a skill to be mastered, and a mechanism of social improvement. Through a humorous
                     deconstruction of the rhetoric of these writings, students apprehend how culture and
                     its institutions instantiate a dialectic between autonomy and law, identity and custom,
                     which marks a paradoxical yet productive model of authority in the modern age.

               <p>The class is thus prepared for Schiller’s <em>On the Aesthetic Education of Man</em>, which I suggest might just as well be entitled <em>How to Have an Aesthetic Experience . . . and Why</em>. After the unwitting examples of Finn and Sutherland, students can perceive in Schiller’s
                  more demanding prose how the antinomies of law and nature opened up by the political
                  and philosophical revolutions of the eighteenth century mandated new programs for
                  cultural education. Alongside passages from the <em>Declaration of Independence</em> and the <em>Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen</em> (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.romantic-circles.org/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixA.html">Appendix A</a>), we attend to what Schiller calls “the building up of true political freedom [as]
                  the most perfect of all works of art” (25). By emphasizing the social, political,
                  and hence moral motives for Schiller’s valorization of aesthetic culture, I help students
                  to see his proliferating sequence of dichotomies (sense and form, feeling and reason,
                  savagery and barbarism, etc.) as both epistemological and historical categories leading
                  towards the mediating and transformative experiences of beauty, freedom, and culture.
                  It is the aesthetic state alone for Schiller which “carries out the will of the whole
                  through the nature of the individual,” and thus confers a “social character” upon
                  humanity: “Taste alone brings harmony into society, because it establishes harmony
                  in the individual” (137–38).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>These formulations are echoed by any number of Schiller’s contemporaries, of course,
                     and a glance at brief quotations from Schlegel, Hölderlin, Shelley, and Keats allows
                     students to appreciate Schiller’s letters as articulations of a dominant strain of
                     Romantic thought (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.romantic-circles.org/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixA.html">Appendix A</a>). Helen Maria Williams’s oft reprinted celebration of the Fête de la Fédération from
                     her <em>Letters Written in France</em> makes clear the ideological dimensions of this program: “Half a million of people
                     assembled at a spectacle, which furnished every image that can elevate the mind of
                     man; which connected the enthusiasm of moral sentiment with the solemn pomp of religious
                     ceremonies; which addressed itself at once to the imagination, the understanding,
                     and the heart!” (64–65).

               <p>This project is Kantian to the core, as Schiller freely announces, but he opens his
                  work with an epigraph from Rousseau’s <em>Julie</em> (“<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Si c’est la raison qui fait l’homme, c’est le sentiment qui le conduit</span>” [“if it is reason that makes man, it is sentiment that guides him”]), and it is
                  to that crucial novel of European Romanticism, in the excellent and affordable edition
                  from Dartmouth University Press (translated and edited by Philip Stewart and Jean
                  Vaché) that we next turn. Despite, or perhaps because of the increasingly surreal
                  lunacy of Rousseau’s project, undergraduates thoroughly enjoy this novel’s odd and
                  disorienting conflation of irony and sincerity, while its epistolary form appeals
                  to a generation brought up on texting and instant messaging. Nicholas Paige has outlined
                  an “aesthetics of renunciation” in Rousseau’s novel and its contemporary reception
                  that reveals important affinities between the bifurcated reading experience of the
                  sentimental novel and the modern logic of culture (Paige 131–54), and Ray himself
                  argues that Rousseau seeks to instill in his readers a conscious division of acculturated
                  reflections (<em>Logic of Culture</em> 84–94; <em>Story and History</em> 240–69). I likewise aim to underscore with my students how the novel solicits and
                  regulates naturalized responses under the twin standards of freedom and law.</p>
               <p>Rousseau repeatedly valorizes authentic sentiments, honest communication, and virtuous
                  self-regard, even as he emphasizes the necessity of education and cultivation to join
                  such characteristics to moral duty. In its twin prefaces (which might be entitled
                  <em>How to Read a Novel . . . If You Must</em>) and its bizarre annotations (my favorite being his recommendation of fera, requested
                  by Julie on her deathbed, as “an excellent fish particular to Lake Geneva, found only
                  at certain times” [599]), the novel repudiates the received authority of cultural
                  norms and expresses a conviction in the existence of natural values, even as it suggests
                  that such values are insufficient without moral guidance and are, in any case, no
                  longer available to the readers of this work. Rousseau’s prefatory fantasy of a virtuous
                  farm couple reading his novel after their daily chores is counterbalanced by his satirical
                  aside that it is only in “depraved ages” that people enjoy reading nostalgically about
                  virtue (19).</p>
               <p>As the class encounters the rebellious romance and the methodical submission of Julie
                  and St. Preux, the imaginative origins of Schiller’s aesthetic education become clear.
                  In the movement of the two lovers from passion to duty, we encounter the proliferating
                  dialectics of contingent desire and autonomous law, all mediated by love and portrayed
                  as a poetics of virtue. Neither Julie’s rational submission to faith nor St. Preux’s
                  flirtation with suicidal despair, which follow their failed affair and conclude the
                  first half of the novel, suffice for the building of a moral society. Instead, it
                  is in the utopia of Clarens under Monsieur de Wolmar’s direction, delineated throughout
                  the novel’s second half, in which “innocence and peace” are programmatically produced
                  through “the confidence of beautiful souls” (342, 346). In the domestic economy of
                  Clarens, Wolmar and Julie represent the twin authorities of law and beauty, producing
                  through custom and sentiment a pure morality which “follows and corrects” nature and
                  a pure subordination which becomes the expression of individual will (375). The seduction
                  and the horror of this totalitarian vision are perceptible within a twenty-first-century
                  classroom, and the construction of absolute authority as the union of custom and nature
                  allows students to apprehend both the dream and the nightmare of the Romantic project.
                  </p>
               <p>Understanding Rousseau’s novel as both a representation and an enactment of moral
                  sentiments to provide a new basis of reflexive cultural communion helps students perceive
                  the relation of the novel genre more broadly as an institution of culture, aiding
                  in “the transition from the state of nature to the civil state” theorized by Rousseau
                  in <em>The Social Contract</em> as a substitution of justice for instinct and celebrated by Schiller as “[carrying]
                  out the will of the whole through the nature of the individual” (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.romantic-circles.org/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixA.html">Appendix A</a>). Hence they are well prepared to appreciate the dialogue between ancient poetry
                  and modern taste staged in the pages of Macpherson’s <em>Poems of Ossian</em>. As we read selections from the <em>Fragments of Ancient Poetry</em>, <em>Fingal</em>, and <em>Temora</em>, which Macpherson composed, compiled, and heavily annotated, alongside critical treatises
                  by Blair and Herder, Staël and Chateaubriand, we encounter an archetypal instance
                  of the invention of tradition within explicitly nationalized contexts.</p>
               <p>Published in over 40 discrete English editions from 1760 through 1830, and translated
                  during this same time into French, Dutch, German, Swedish, Finnish, Italian, Russian,
                  Danish, Hungarian, Spanish, Polish, Czech, Latin, and Classical Greek, the <em>Poems of Ossian</em> form arguably the single most influential work of British poetry of the Romantic
                  era (Gaskill). Yet, to my knowledge, these works are rarely taught and occupy only
                  a marginal position, if they are included at all, in the standard anthologies of Romantic
                  verse (Moore). Their reputation as forgeries certainly contribute to this neglect,
                  as does the absence of any affordable edition for use in the classroom. Neither Howard
                  Gaskill’s excellent but prohibitively priced University of Edinburgh edition nor the
                  cheaper but less reliable nineteenth-century reprint from Dover Press provide a complete
                  sense of the dynamic interface between poetry and annotation that Macpherson constructed
                  in the early editions of his works. Some universities and colleges will have these
                  editions in their special collections, and they are also available through ECCO for
                  those with institutional subscriptions. The <em>Ossian Online</em> project at the University of Galway, edited by Rebecca Barr and Justin Tonra, now
                  offers a compelling and open access resource that reproduces the combination of translation,
                  ethnography, and comparative literature at work in the pages of Macpherson’s texts
                  (see <em>Fingal</em> in <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.romantic-circles.org/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixA.html">Appendix A</a>).</p>
               <p>What the students are able to perceive materially in the pages of these editions is
                  the invention of culture as a dialogue between tradition and innovation, heritage
                  and taste. Fiona Stafford argues that “Macpherson’s ‘translations’ involved acts of
                  interpretation not only between Gaelic and English, but also between the oral culture
                  of the depressed rural communities of the Scottish Highlands and the prosperous urban
                  centers of Lowland Scotland, where the printed word was increasingly dominant,” and
                  that therefore we should view his project as neither naïve nor deceptive but as “a
                  sophisticated attempt to mediate between two apparently irreconcilable cultures” (viii).
                  Whether or not they are willing to grant Macpherson this degree of latitude, students
                  are able to witness the efficient transfer of cultural authority from the oral traditions
                  Macpherson evokes to the aesthetic tastes of a modern print culture, which he paradoxically
                  repudiates as degraded from the martial and sentimental purity of the ancient Gaels.
                  The poems themselves thematize this anxiety of cultural transmission throughout, obsessed
                  as they are with proleptic self-eulogy, poetic lament, and a general atmosphere of
                  loss in which the value of any deed is only realized in the affective response of
                  belated reflection. Akin to Julie and St. Preux’s tour to the locations of their former
                  romance, the result is a highly reflexive bardic history which, in concert with the
                  extensive annotations that occupy equal space in Macpherson’s pages, is more about
                  its own reception as aesthetic tableau and archaeological record than about the deeds
                  of its warriors.</p>
               <p>Hugh Blair’s 
                  “Critical Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian,”
                  which was included in all later editions of the work, offers an extended argument
                  for the mutual implication of historical inquiry and aesthetic response as complementary
                  modes of cultural evaluation. Reading his dissertation, the class is able to explore
                  the general contours of conjectural history, the valorization of poetry as moral imagination,
                  and the celebration of the melancholic sublime (Ossian’s “joys of grief”) as superior
                  to the beauties of classical antiquity—arguably the three primary ingredients of Romanticism
                  as a self-conscious literary style. We turn from Blair to selections from Herder,
                  who celebrates Ossian as an authentic voice of oral folk tradition and the vitality
                  of primitive cultures. Mme de Staël comparably valorizes Ossian as the origin of a
                  northern Romanticism in contest with a southern classicism, while François-René de
                  Chateaubriand critiques her convictions by reasserting the necessity of Christianity
                  and advanced society for the cultivation of beautiful morality. Chateaubriand views
                  the sentimental effusions of Ossian’s warriors as evidence of their historical inaccuracy
                  and makes Macpherson’s poetry a locus for his battle with atheistic philosophy and
                  doctrines of perfectibility. Reading through these examples of Ossian’s critical reception
                  enables students to perceive the tension between aestheticism and historicism in Romantic
                  discourse (Leerssen), as well as the political and cultural agendas served by various
                  positions (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.romantic-circles.org/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixA.html">Appendix A</a>).</p>
               <p>Of all the documents of Ossian’s reception, it is Goethe’s <em>Sorrows of Young Werther</em> which had the greatest influence on European letters, and, indeed, helped to promote
                  Macpherson’s work to a wider audience. Goethe’s novella replays both Rousseau’s sentimental
                  education and Macpherson’s cultural archaeology in a tragic mode, presenting a paradigmatic
                  instance of the Romantic turn towards interiority and despondency as a staged response
                  to the tensions of social transformation. Like Rousseau, Goethe presents his fiction
                  as an edited sequence of letters valuable as testimonials of sincerity and objects
                  of sympathy. Werther is, in many ways, another St. Preux, skeptical of cultural mores
                  and seeking beauty as an amelioration to a degenerate society. Such beauty is to be
                  found in the natural world, in literature (especially Klopstock and Ossian), and,
                  of course, in Lotte. The conclusion, in which the melancholic antihero extensively
                  recites the Ossianic “Songs of Selma” to his idealized object of desire, stands as
                  one of the almost literally seminal moments of European Romanticism. As both a last
                  attempt at sexual consummation and a retrospective farewell to his beloved, Werther’s
                  recitation, encompassing a disproportionate <em>one-fifteenth</em> of the entire narrative, deploys the sequential lamentations of Macpherson’s bardic
                  performances towards a sentimental expression of heartsick regret (Lamport).</p>
               <p>Goethe famously disavowed this early melodramatic fantasia as a product of youthful
                  self-indulgence and the morbid temperament of his generation, but the novella itself,
                  along with Goethe’s later reflections, nicely included in the Signet Classics edition
                  (translated by Catherine Hutter), enables the class to perceive the Romantic affinities
                  between melancholic confession and cultural ennui. The significance of the work, Goethe
                  argues, emerges precisely out of the social and historical disparities revealed between
                  the heroic cadences of Ossianic lament and the performatively self-indulgent letters
                  of a lovesick hero: “Defunct heroes and wan maidens hovered around us until, in the
                  end, we really thought we could see the terrible shape of the spirit of Loda. In such
                  an atmosphere, with fancies and studies of this nature, tortured by unsatisfied passion,
                  with no external inspiration to do anything really important, our only prospect to
                  succumb, in the end, to a dreary, uncultured, bourgeois existence—we began to think
                  kindly of departing this life ” (146). Werther’s Ossianic recitation is at once an
                  elegiac identification with a supposedly anterior poetry, itself a performance of
                  elegy as a cultural rite, and an ironic revelation of the gulf separating the ideals
                  informing his love for Lotte and the social realities that prevent its consummation.</p>
               <p>With this range of cultural and psychological maneuvers in mind, we approach two of
                  the most paradigmatic literary works of the Napoleonic era, Mme de Staël’s novel <em>Corinne, or Italy</em> and Lord Byron’s <em>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</em>. Both share multiple generic affinities with Schiller’s aesthetic treatise, Rousseau’s
                  sentimental novel, Macpherson’s bardic ethnography, and Goethe’s melancholic parable,
                  all framed within travel narratives in which the conflicts between duty and sensibility
                  are played out through a topography of historical rupture and cultural alienation.</p>
               <p>The entire plot of <em>Corinne</em> can be read as a prolonged crisis of the absence of paternal authority contemporaneous
                  with the French Revolution, an absence restored through the fraught logic of national
                  culture. Oswald’s early residence in revolutionary France coincides with his father’s
                  demise, a father whom he mourns to the brink of self-destruction, yet who himself
                  was ambivalent about exercising his authority in deference to “the purity of affection,
                  which depends on what is most free and involuntary in our nature” (214). His eventual
                  return to Scotland marks a necessary submission to public and domestic dignity and
                  hence a substitution of paternal authority by national spirit, “the prejudices, if
                  you like, which unite us and our nation” as his father writes from beyond the grave:
                  “we are a group, a community, which is free but indissoluble, and can perish only
                  with the last one of us” (335). Between this liberation in France from the unexercised
                  law of the father and the willful submission in Scotland to national duty, Oswald
                  encounters Corinne and Italy through a cult of genius that is simultaneously a cult
                  of the nation. Corinne distills the best of Italian climate, arts, and history while
                  she surmounts the failings to which those very factors have condemned her people.
                  In gazing upon her, both natives and foreigners perceive an idealized image of poetic
                  self-determination even as they recognize the social and political contingencies that
                  make such self-determination impossible. Corinne is not Italy, as the secret of her
                  birth finally reveals and as the title of the novel, with its impossible imperative
                  to choose between the individual and the nation, makes clear; but she does personify
                  the tension between identity and authority with which Oswald must contend.</p>
               <p>The novel itself involves its readers in an analogous contention between nation and
                  selfhood. Staël’s narrative rhetoric insists upon a normative perspective for the
                  appreciation of landscape, the fine arts, and general scenes of cultural life, suggesting
                  a universal aesthetic position by which culture may be apprehended and critiqued.
                  Whether it is the picturesque beauty of Ancona or the sublime terror of Vesuvius,
                  the sailors in the Adriatic or the citizens of Naples, the ruins of Rome or the buildings
                  and galleries of Bologna, Italian culture is offered as a sequence of visual tableaux
                  not only for the perceptions of the individual characters, whose responses inevitably
                  serve to signify their national dispositions, but for an idealized reader whose sympathetic
                  assent to a cosmopolitan taste is presupposed and thereby reaffirmed. Staël positions
                  the reader as a cultivated and autonomous mind free of the confines of national customs
                  and habits, though she repeatedly insists not only on the necessity of the conclusions
                  they derive but also on the collective understandings and beliefs that shape all individuals,
                  common and refined alike. We are repeatedly lectured on the aesthetic sensibilities
                  of the Italians, the rational predilections of the Scots, and the careless sociability
                  of the French through a narrative logic that explicitly conjoins character to national
                  customs and those customs in turn to climate, religion, politics, and history as well
                  as the individual endeavors of poets and artists—the very characters whose impulses
                  allegedly are being explained.</p>
               <p>Explaining himself to Corinne by the tombs of Rome, Oswald speaks in the first-person
                  plural as an emissary from the North: “We probably want sadness to surround death
                  . . . and even before Christianity enlightened us, our ancient mythology, our Ossian,
                  places only regrets and funeral chants beside the grave” (62–63). Later, as Corinne
                  sings and plays Scottish laments besides George Wallis’s painting from Ossian’s <em>Temora</em> of Connal asleep on his father’s tomb, which she hangs in her private gallery as
                  evidence of her own cultural patrimony, Oswald is overcome and begs her to “follow
                  me to those retreats peopled by my memories” (162). Oswald and Lucille’s daughter
                  Juliet assumes the same pose at the end of the novel, having learned the melody from
                  Corinne at the cost of great suffering. This line of Ossianic references converts
                  the bardic song from an already invented tradition of Scottish nationalism to a symptom
                  of national character, a marker of aesthetic response, and an expression of personal
                  sorrow, and in all cases a signifier of the tension between submission to cultural
                  inheritance and assertion of individual desire.</p>
               <p>By the time we turn to <em>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</em>, students are getting used to the contours of the Romantic wanderer. St. Preux, Werther,
                  Oswald, Harold—all appear variations of a single character. Alienated from the cultural
                  mores of his own society, each takes at least temporary refuge in the road, traveling
                  for distraction while acquiring a storehouse of social tableaux and natural vistas
                  against which to formulate his own moral identity. That such journeys of discovery
                  never fulfill their stated goals of liberation, but instead drive these figures either
                  back to the comforts of duty and obligation or into a spiral of self-destruction,
                  also seems to be a basic premise of the Romantic pilgrimage. Byron’s genius is not
                  to concern himself with conclusions, but to use the template of cultural alienation
                  as the medium for a range of aesthetic and historical reflections which exceed the
                  limits of convention. As he notes, “a fictitious character is introduced for the sake
                  of giving some connexion to the piece” (19), but this ironic device helps reveal Romantic
                  character as primarily a conduit for binding sociological and historical reflection
                  under the sign of culture.</p>
               <p>Reading <em>Childe Harold</em> as a fusion of travelogue and memoir, the class perceives how culture becomes yet
                  again an object of contemplation <em>and</em> a vehicle of self-realization, with aesthetic meditation serving as a mode of political
                  as well as historical commentary. Like Staël, whom he eulogizes in the fourth canto,
                  Byron constructs poetic pilgrimage both as a response to the continental turmoil of
                  the Napoleonic wars and as an alternative cosmopolitanism at once skeptical and sympathetic.
                  Students are generally unfamiliar with the multitude of locations surveyed in Byron’s
                  work, as well as the many political treaties, military battles, and other topical
                  references, and, more than in any of the other works in this course, such references
                  can place a barrier towards appreciation, particularly in the first two cantos. But
                  they also underscore, in the form of Byron’s own copious annotations, how everything
                  from ancient ruins to current events can be united within the imperatives of Romantic
                  culture to replace content with judgment.</p>
               <p>The poem’s later set pieces of natural beauty in the third canto take us once again
                  back to Vevey and Rousseauvian epiphanies, and I match Byron’s evocation of the Alps
                  alongside not only the relevant passages from <em>Julie</em> and the <em>Confessions</em>, noted by Byron himself, but the renderings of the solitary sublime in Werther (“From
                  the forbidding mountain range, across the barren plain untrodden by the foot of man,
                  to the ends of the unknown seas, the spirit of the Eternal Creator can be felt rejoicing
                  over every grain of dust that comprehends Him <em>and lives</em>!” [64]) and Ossian (“When the storms of the mountain come; when the north lifts the
                  waves on high; I sit by the sounding shore, and look on the fatal rock. Often by the
                  setting moon I see the ghosts of my children” [170]). Schiller once again helps us
                  here, specifically his reflection in 
                  “Naïve and Sentimental Poetry”
                  on the experience of loss so constitutive of the modern: “Our feeling for nature is
                  like the sick person’s feeling for health” (195). Yet the fourth canto returns us
                  to the aesthetic ideal in its celebration of “the beings of the mind” (4.5.37) amidst
                  the “marble wilderness” (4.79.710) of Rome. We spend a day looking at the masterpieces
                  of antiquity alongside Byron’s meditations and find ourselves back in the world of
                  David Finn’s <em>How to Visit a Museum</em>, only with a far more eloquent and skeptical guide (Siegel).</p>
               <p>The course could end here, the students having read and considered some of the most
                  popular, influential, and archetypal literary expressions of European Romanticism.
                  But I find it particularly instructive in an American classroom to jump the Atlantic
                  and read James Fenimore Cooper’s first Leatherstocking Tale, <em>The Pioneers</em>, for its rendering of nature and character in perpetual transformation—the cultural
                  ethos of the new American nation. Borrowing thematically and stylistically from Scott,
                  whose novels would work equally well within the paradigms of this course, Cooper presents
                  culture as a state of constant change. Culture marks the transition from wilderness
                  to civilization, from the Native to the European, but also from the colonies to the
                  states, the early settlements to the established cities. As with Staël and Byron,
                  indeed as with Rousseau, Macpherson, and Goethe, Cooper marks his own narrative perspective
                  on events as essential, here severed irretrievably from the America of his youth and
                  a natural world that is itself subject to radical alteration.</p>
               <p>Throughout the novel, we as readers are made aware of our role in judging the various
                  characters and their actions in relation to cultural and historical contingencies.
                  Natty Bumpo and Indian John offer us highly mediated echoes of older ways of life
                  and stand, like Ossianic heroes, as elegiac markers of historical change, figures
                  for stages in a developmental history of the modern nation who must give way to the
                  laws of Judge Temple, even as their rightful claims to the land are repeatedly recognized
                  in the language of the narrative (Hayne). Also akin to Macpherson’s project—and those
                  of Rousseau, Goethe, Staël, and Byron—Cooper’s extensive use of footnotes alerts his
                  readers to their own mediated relationship to a cultural (and, in Cooper’s case, ecological)
                  past, one to which they are indebted for the cultivation of the new world even as
                  their reflective reading experience attests to the necessity of its eradication. Even
                  in the optimistic setting of Cooper’s pioneer town, the culture of modernity assumes
                  a constitutively elegiac mode: “This was the last that they ever saw of the Leather-stocking,”
                  the novel ends, “whose rapid movements preceded the pursuit which Judge Temple both
                  ordered and conducted. He had gone far towards the setting sun,—the foremost in that
                  band of Pioneers, who are opening the way for the march of the nation across the continent”
                  (456). Such a conclusion fulfills the transfer of cultural authority to the modern
                  reader. The Romantic logic of Cooper’s novel—like every one of the works covered in
                  this course—replaces tradition with judgment, offering its readers an aesthetic education
                  by which nature and law are reconciled and sublated in the free play of art. As Byron
                  notes at the conclusion of <em>Childe Harold</em>, “Farewell! with <em>him</em> alone may rest the pain / If such there were—with <em>you</em>, the moral of his strain!” (4.186.1673–74).</p>
               <p>This model of cultural identity informs most facets of our modern society, and while
                  tracing its roots may be enlightening, it is also worth considering its demise under
                  the pressures of globalization. By way of a coda, then, I turn with the students to
                  Bill Readings’s <em>The University in Ruins</em>, a critique of the culture wars in the modern university that extends the narrative
                  of this course through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and suggests our current
                  relation to the breakdown of national culture. Readings begins his history where Ray
                  leaves off, moving from Schiller’s promotion of aesthetic culture through the German
                  Idealists, the celebration of <span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">bildung</span>, and the Anglo-American promotion of the university as the site for the cultivation
                  of the liberal arts within overtly national frameworks. With glances at the writings
                  of Matthew Arnold, Cardinal Newman, F. R. Leavis, and Allan Bloom, the class is able
                  to perceive the resiliency of the models of culture we have been tracing throughout
                  the term. But in equally compelling glances at a variety of statements on culture
                  taken from our university’s promotional literature (and duplicated, no doubt, at any
                  current institution of higher learning), we are able to witness the evacuation of
                  culture as a site of meaning under pressure from the corporate discourse of excellence
                  which Readings so brilliantly critiques. Arguing that the logic of culture is inextricable
                  from the rise and fall of the nation-state and the modern university, Readings helps
                  situate the practice as well as the subject of the class within historical and institutional
                  parameters.</p>
               <p>What are the advantages of this approach to the teaching of Romanticism over some
                  of the more exclusively British models in which many of us have been trained and which
                  this selection of essays aims to widen if not critique? Besides the very real problem
                  of literary provincialism, a problem only partially and imperfectly addressed by the
                  inclusion of French, German, and American works, I would argue that the sampling of
                  Romantic literature I offer my students is more representative of the historical phenomenon
                  itself, emphasizing as it does works whose influence spread throughout Europe and
                  the wider world far more so than the writings of many other poets, essayists, and
                  novelists typically included in anthologies of Romantic literature. From a European
                  perspective, it is Rousseau, Goethe, and Byron who constitute fountainheads of Romantic
                  expression. It is Schiller and Staël who articulate through literary and critical
                  works the profound traumas of the revolution, and it is Ossian who offers a new aesthetic
                  for poets, a tradition of “ethnopoetics” whose relation to the equally vibrant experimental
                  strain of nineteenth-century poetries can be traced wonderfully through the use of
                  Jerome Rothenberg and Jeffrey C. Robinson’s <em>Poems for the Millennium, Volume Three: The University of California Book of Romantic
                     and Postromantic Poetry</em>. Furthermore, by exploring Romanticism as imbricated within a modern logic of culture,
                  students can appreciate it as an influential response to social and intellectual transformations
                  still unfolding in the present day. Hard choices of selection are always necessary.
                  What I have tried to outline in this essay is a combination of texts and approaches
                  that I have found to work well in the advanced undergraduate classroom. They offer
                  students a compelling survey of European Romanticism while offering instructors a
                  provocative challenge to reimagine this exciting moment in literary history.</p>
