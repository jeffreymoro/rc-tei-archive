               “Translating Revolution into Spanish: British Romanticism and the Spanish-Speaking
               World”
               offers ways of teaching British Romanticism through the lens of human rights. The
               proposed course covers the pamphlet wars of the 1790s in Edmund Burke’s <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em>, Thomas Paine’s <em>The Rights of Man</em>, and Mary Wollstonecraft’s <em>Vindications of the Rights of Woman</em>. Students also consider abolitionist literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth
               centuries in <em>The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano</em>, Hannah More’s 
               “Slavery, A Poem,”
               and Leonora Sansay’s <em>Secret History; or, The Horrors of St. Domingo</em>. The goal of this approach is to address the cultural amnesia regarding the history
               of slavery and enslaved peoples, and to broaden students’ understanding of the era’s
               independence movements by introducing historical documents from Latin and South America.</p>

                  <p>One of the most important developments in the study of British literature of the long
                     eighteenth century in the past two decades has been the renewed focus on what Keith
                     Hanley and Greg Kucich call the “global formations” of British literary culture (73).
                     The proliferation of studies in global feminisms, cosmopolitan identities, travel
                     writing, translation, and other transnational encounters has created new critical
                     perspectives for reassessing early-nineteenth-century British literature as explicitly
                     international and global in its concerns rather than isolated and insular.

                              (Fay), romantic-era studies have experienced an explosion of critical work on the
                              global dimensions of romantic literature. For foundational work on British romantic

                     </div> Similarly, in early American studies, the work of Gretchen Murphy, Felipe Fernandez-Armesto,
                     James Dunkerly, and Anna Brickhouse, among others, has been especially crucial to
                     exploring the global dimensions of American literature by resituating its study within
                     a broader Hemispheric and Pan-American perspective.

                     alone can no longer provide the explanatory framework for literary analysis they once
                     did and that new critical paradigms are needed if we are to more adequately investigate
                     what Paul Gilroy calls the “system of cultural exchanges” taking place across the
                     globe during the early nineteenth century (14).</p>

                  <p>Yet despite the new critical imperative to explore global dimensions of romantic literature,
                     the Spanish speaking world remains one of the most understudied cultural geographies
                     of the period.

                              and Figurations of Iberia (2001), Joselyn Almeida’s Reimagining the Transatlantic,

                     opened to us by the study of romantic globalism. But to some degree, we must also
                     be aware of an English disciplinary resistance to all things Spanish and, in Joselyn
                     Almeida’s view, a dangerous assumption underlying recent transatlantic critical practices,
                     namely that the ideas, texts, and political thought circulating within the Atlantic
                     world occur primarily between Britain and the US and are, as a consequence, conducted
                     primarily in English. The consequences of such critical practices—of, among other
                     things, continuing to think of the Americas in terms of North America alone—is that
                     we not only risk marginalizing Spanish speakers as minor spectators on the world stage,
                     but also risk confining transatlantic studies, as Almeida has written, within safe
                     linguistic and disciplinary boundaries that ultimately work to reinscribe the disciplinary
                     structures that transatlantic studies has worked so hard to break through.

               <p>Building on David Simpson’s argument for translation as a critical paradigm within
                  which romantic literature is encountered as an “estranged medium,” this essay answers
                  the call for greater attention to the Hispanic dimensions of transatlantic studies
                  by demonstrating some of the ways in which students can explore the meaning of traditional
                  romantic concepts about the imagination, nature, and the rights of man, among others,
                  from a ‘Spanish’ perspective (141). The objective of such reading practices is to
                  open up the interpretive possibilities for understanding romantic literary texts as
                  not only engaged with but also profoundly shaped by the ideas, cultures, and peoples
                  of Spain and Spanish America. In order to get from here to there, I will briefly sketch
                  in this essay the outlines of a course I teach on transatlantic romanticism that I
                  have designed to introduce the complex issues related to the interconnectedness of
                  Atlantic-rim cultures. Focusing on the ways in which cultures, ideologies, and political
                  identities are reworked and reinscribed by the transatlantic movement of peoples,
                  ideas, and cultural artifacts, the course seeks to expand accepted notions of romanticism
                  (typically understood within exclusively British and US American contexts) to include
                  transoceanic perspectives that rethink romantic literature as a global phenomenon.
                  Given the limited space here, I will only consider the shifting forms and languages
                  of revolution as they make their way from Britain to the Americas via the transatlantic
                  slave trade. In order to bring the analysis into sharper focus, I shift the discussion
                  in the final section of the essay from a consideration of historical to textual translation,
                  presenting my own English translation of a key passage from Simon Bolívar’s 
                  “Carta de Jamaica”
                  as a case study that highlights the limits and possibilities of linguistic interpretation
                  as a pedagogical tool that challenges students to rethink the meaning of revolution
                  within a Spanish American context.</p>
               <p>One of the most important debates for exploring the historical context of romantic-era
                  literature remains the pamphlet wars of the 1790s in which Edmund Burke’s <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em> and Thomas Paine’s <em>The Rights of Man</em> form the twin pillars of revolutionary and counter-revolutionary thought of the period.
                  Students typically have an easier time with Paine initially, readily identifying with
                  the language of reason and natural rights, and often share Paine’s convictions about
                  liberty, equality, and inalienable rights. When properly understood as a response
                  to Burke’s arguments about the role of prejudice and prescription in maintaining order
                  in society, itself a response to Richard Price’s <em>A Discourse on the Love of our Country</em>, students tend to become even more convinced of the validity of Paine’s argument
                  about “the vanity and presumption of governing beyond the grave,” which Paine views
                  as “the most ridiculous and insolent of all tyrannies” (74). Teaching the revolutionary
                  debates thus more often than not involves mounting a vigorous defense of Burke. I
                  usually begin by pointing out that in the U.S., appeals to a constitution written
                  over two hundred years ago precisely define what it means to govern beyond the grave.
                  Students who defend constitutional authority and legal precedence now find it difficult
                  to support Paine’s essentially anarchist argument that “the more perfect civilization
                  is, the less occasion has it for government,” a statement that assumes the perfectibility
                  of man and the power of human reason to bring it about (193). After introducing a
                  more nuanced discussion of political theory and the revolutionary politics of the
                  romantic period, I reintroduce Burke’s and Paine’s arguments with a few select passages
                  that yield new insights into the nature of the debate in a way that allows students
                  to reflect on the Burkean and Paineite influences on their own political perspectives.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Discussion of the contribution of women to the revolutionary debate helps prepare
                     students for thinking about the complex ways in which the “regime of truth,” as Michel
                     Foucault calls it, is challenged and transformed by groups and individuals excluded
                     from the governing discourse (131). Mary Wollstonecraft’s <em>Vindications of the Rights of Woman</em>, for example, makes the obvious point that the rights of man did not necessarily
                     also translate as the rights of woman. In addition to outlining Wollstonecraft’s proto-feminist
                     arguments about egalitarian marriage, rational love, and other issues of gender inequality,
                     I highlight the rhetorical strategies through which she enacts her “imitation of manly
                     virtues” that become in and of themselves a form of political engagement (110).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Regarding the style of Vindication, Wollstonecraft writes, “Animated by this important
                              object, I shall disdain to cull my phrases or polish my style. I aim at being useful,
                              and sincerity will render me unaffected; for wishing rather to persuade by the force
                              of my arguments than dazzle by the elegance of my language, I shall not waste my time
                              in rounding periods, or in fabricating the turgid bombast of artificial feelings”
                              (112).</span></div>
                     </div> For in stripping her prose intentionally of the “soft phrases” and “delicacy of sentiment”
                     central to the rhetorical flourishes of Burke’s political reflections on the revolution,
                     Wollstonecraft creates a metacommentary that exposes the reliance of Burke on what
                     he himself defined as the feminine aesthetic of the beautiful in order to, as Tom
                     Furniss argues, “remount a critique of the <em>ancien régime</em> . . . and turn its aesthetic theory against the politics of <em>Reflections</em>” (Wollstonecraft 111; Furniss 184). When <em>Vindications</em> compares the condition of women to slavery, Wollstonecraft further complicates the
                     Revolution debate by introducing an unwelcome discourse into the discussion of what
                     it means for all men to be equal. Without explicitly invoking the abolitionist movement
                     of which women were key players, Wollstonecraft thus alters the hermeneutic context
                     from which to interpret the principles of the French Revolution, illustrating for
                     students how seemingly straightforward arguments become easily strained when ideas
                     are placed in a context for which they were never intended.</p>

                  <p>Having established the broad parameters of an essentially British perspective on political
                     revolution, our discussion naturally moves on to consider romantic literature and
                     the slave trade, a topic recently illuminated by the work of Deirdre Coleman, Debbie
                     Lee, and Paul Youngquist.

                              (6)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See, for example, Coleman, Lee, and Youngquist and Botkin.</span></div>
                     </div> Before discussing the diverse, overlapping, and sometimes contradictory arguments
                     for and against slavery during the romantic period, I remind students of our shared
                     conviction of the inhumanity of slavery in order to focus our discussion more critically
                     on how literature, as Edward Said writes in <em>Culture and Imperialism</em>, “allowed decent men and women to accept the notion that distant territories and
                     their native peoples should be subjugated” (6). Again encouraging students to look
                     beyond the surface of argumentation, I point out that poems about the slave trade
                     often find themselves troubled by an awareness of the tension between their ideals
                     of universal emancipation and the imperial imperative of the civilizing mission. Of
                     the many abolitionist poems that could be cited, Hannah More’s 
                     “Slavery, A Poem”
                      is one of the best in illustrating the structural entanglements of much abolitionist
                     writing. Though she argues for the dignity of slaves as human beings, More, like many
                     of her contemporaries, cannot escape her racist assumptions or imperialist attitudes.
                     Africans, she argues, “have heads to think, and hearts to feel,” but their souls act
                     with “erring zeal” (More 67; 68). Like the British radicals she curiously invokes
                     at the beginning of the poem, Africans must consequently be contained, their “wild
                     vigour of a savage root” civilized by Christianity (More 74). More difficult for students
                     to discern, however, is More’s anxiety about the implicit critique of empire that
                     unintentionally emerges as a result of her abolitionist arguments. Attempting to clarify
                     her intentions, the poet at one point asks, 
                     <blockquote class="quote">
                        <div class="stanza">
                           <div class="l">Does thirst of empire, does desire of fame,</div>
                           <div class="l">(For these are specious crimes,) our rage inflame?</div>
                           <div class="l">No: sordid lust of gold their [slaves] fate controls,</div>
                           <div class="l">The basest appetite of basest souls. (More 125–28)</div>
                        </div>
                     </blockquote> More’s resistance to the idea that the “thirst for empire” is inherently wrong and
                     her attribution of the evil of slavery instead to “sordid lust” allows her to champion
                     the cause of emancipation without upsetting the logic of empire. The parenthetical
                     aside, however, at once deflecting attention from the poem and yet integral to its
                     meter, delays the formulation of the poem’s central question, creating an uneasy tension
                     between the poet’s nervous interrogation and resolute reply. The emphatic “no,” made
                     more determined by the syntactical deductive colon separating the monosyllabic answer
                     from the more involved explanation that follows, not only abruptly interrupts the
                     iambic pentameter of the poem, but in doing so calls attention unintentionally to
                     the so-called “specious crimes” the poet works very hard to deny. This passage in
                     particular can thus help students explore how language and form can express unspoken
                     anxieties, or, in Fredric Jameson’s terms, reveal the “political unconscious” (9).</p>

               <p>No discussion of the cultural impact of the slave trade on romanticism is complete
                  without a reading of any number of the many slave narratives of the period of which
                  Helen Thomas’s <em>Romanticism and Slave Narratives: Transatlantic Testimonies</em> (2000) provides an excellent selection. I continue, however, to remain partial to
                  <em>The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano</em> because of the way in which it allows students to discuss the complex process of
                  what Homi Bhabha calls the “ambivalence of mimicry” occurring at the intersection
                  of the various discourses brought together in what Angelo Contanzo describes as “a
                  new genre of writing that became known as the slave narrative” (129; 10). From its
                  frontispiece and opening address to the British Parliament to its narrative of spiritual
                  conversion and naval adventure stories, <em>The Interesting Narrative</em> establishes Equiano as a civilized, self-made man whose natural inclinations toward
                  masculine British values grant him the authority to speak on the national stage from
                  which he would normally be excluded. Yet, Equiano’s anecdotal accounts as a free man
                  of his persistent mistreatment at the hands of British slave owners remind readers
                  that he will never be more than “almost an Englishman,” one who is free but not free,
                  “almost the same, <em>but not quite</em>” (Equiano 92; Bhabha 123). For some students, Equiano’s attempt to establish an authentic
                  African voice is compromised by a “stronger desire to resemble” his English masters,
                  resulting in an ambivalence over his own identity that he registers in the title of
                  his narrative (Equiano 93). The question of Equiano’s identity is further complicated
                  by notable passages revealing his participation in the slave trade, his support of
                  the British colonization of Africa, and the still controversial arguments discounting
                  his African birth. In order to generate further discussion, however, I typically introduce
                  a counterargument that suggests that such ambivalence is intentional. By engaging
                  in a form of “self-invention,” as Vincent Carretta describes it, Equiano not only
                  displays what W. E. B. Du Bois calls double consciousness, but also in the process
                  returns the mobility of his identity back within his control, which he formally expresses
                  in the title as a choice he allows readers to make in constructing their own meaning
                  of his narrative in a way that spotlights the artificiality of such constructions
                  (6). <em>Interesting Narrative</em> is, in other words, a perfect example of colonial mimicry, a discursive process that
                  depends on its own indeterminacy to disrupt normalized knowledge, not only for slave
                  owners who rely on racist assumptions about the capacity of Africans for rational
                  thought and moral feelings, but also for abolitionists who continue to deny equal
                  rights for Blacks attempting to assimilate into British society.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Equiano’s text provides an excellent introduction to what Paul Youngquist and Frances
                     Botkin have called “Black Romanticism,” a critical focus in romantic studies that
                     seeks to restore certain geographies, particularly the West Indies, back to the center
                     of literary analysis. Although some students will have encountered Equiano before,
                     such encounters will have rarely led to alternative perspectives for reading romantic
                     literature in which the Maroon War, the Haitian Revolution, and the Independence movements
                     of South America form the natural historical backdrop to a literature just as invested
                     in translation and cross-cultural exchange as it is in national formation. According
                     to Youngquist and Botkin, the problem is a disciplinary one, which they provocatively
                     articulate in no uncertain terms in the opening statement of their introduction to
                     the recent volume of collected essays <em>Circulations: Romanticism and the Black Atlantic</em> (2011): “With notable exceptions, studies in British Romanticism remain pretty white”
                     (1).

                     </div> For Youngquist and Botkin, “the whiteness of Romantic studies is a symptom of amnesia
                     . . . a massive act of forgetting on the part of contemporary scholarship” that has
                     blinded us to “the complex network of exchanges circulating people, ideas, practices,
                     and things throughout the Atlantic” (1; 8). In transatlantic studies more broadly
                     defined, this form of amnesia is especially evident in the general neglect of the
                     intersections of romanticism and the Spanish-speaking world in which the voices of
                     Haiti, Cuba, Venezuela, Mexico, and a whole host of other geographies of the Spanish
                     Atlantic commanded the world stage.</p>

               <p>The students I teach usually become excited by this ‘confession’ of sorts, often citing
                  this fact as the main reason for initially enrolling in the class. When asked to provide
                  a brief account of major events in the South Atlantic in the late eighteenth and early
                  nineteenth centuries, however, some students will remember the Haitian Revolution
                  and fewer still will mention the Latin American Independence movements, let alone
                  provide more than cursory details to these events. Employing visual aids, provocative
                  excerpts, and online resources, I outline the important events of the period from
                  the 1780s Andean rebellion through the Bolívar Wars of the 1820s, introducing students
                  to the fiery brilliance of revolutionaries like Antonio Nariño, Francisco de Miranda,
                  San Martín, and the <span class="foreign" xml:lang="sp" lang="sp">libertador</span> himself, Simon Bolívar. With republics springing up first in Venezuela in 1810, soon
                  followed by Buenos Aires and New Granada, then Chile and finally Mexico, Latin America
                  soon rivaled their North American neighbors in political innovation and radical change.
                  Back in Europe, I explain, Spain was experiencing its own revolution of sorts. With
                  the invasion of Napoleon in 1808, Spain not only found itself locked in a life and
                  death struggle for national independence, but also became deeply engaged in its own
                  political experimentations. The liberal intelligentsia in Spain, self-dubbed <span class="foreign" xml:lang="sp" lang="sp">liberales</span>, fought to secure their national sovereignty against Napoleon, but they also viewed
                  the political crisis as a rare opportunity for political and social reform, an opportunity
                  to completely revamp and modernize the Spanish government, transform its traditional
                  social structure, and draft a constitution along more liberal and revolutionary lines.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As the site of wars and invasions, revolutions and constitutional inventions, the
                     Spanish Atlantic opened up a new space for political and ideological discussion in
                     Britain that touched on key issues of national and imperial concerns. The imperial
                     relationship between Spain and its colonies at a time when both the colonies and metropole
                     were formulating new ideas about individual autonomy, national sovereignty, and civil
                     liberties brought into full view the inescapable conflict between liberal thought
                     and the logic of empire. As an early sympathizer of Latin American independence and
                     now an ally of Spain, Britain found itself caught between its moral obligation to
                     support Latin American claims for freedom against tyranny and oppression, and their
                     political responsibilities to honor their new alliance with Spain. Yet, Britain had
                     ulterior motives at play. Long coveting Latin American markets, Britain understood
                     the implications of Spanish American independence for the expansion of its commercial
                     empire. Thus, placed in a position of savior to Spain and Latin America’s hope for
                     independence, Britain became an increasingly significant and politically charged space
                     of converging and conflicting interests: the place of revolutionary plotting on the
                     one hand—Miranda, Bolívar, and others all developed their revolutionary programs in
                     London—and the source of a growing pro-Spanish sentiment on the other.

               <p>To introduce students to the interconnections between romantic literature and the
                  history of the struggle for Haitian independence, I assign the Broadview edition of
                  Leonora Sansay’s <em>Secret History; or, The Horrors of St. Domingo</em> (1808), a text that interweaves the events of the Haitian Revolution with a romance
                  plot that explores the gender and race implications of interracial love, violence
                  against women, and desire for female community. I require students to read the introduction,
                  which provides an excellent initiation to the history of the Revolution from the 1791
                  slave revolt and the rise of Toussaint Louverture to the establishment of the world’s
                  first black republic in 1804 and the massacre of white French colonists at the hands
                  of Jean-Jacques Dessalines. The introduction also provides a helpful discussion of
                  racial politics in the Americas and their complex relationship to constructions of
                  gender and sex exemplified in the interactions between mixed-race mulatto women, white
                  Creole women born in the Caribbean, and white European women. I think Gretchen Woertendyke
                  is absolutely correct to suggest that “Sansay’s tale joins the domestic terror of
                  Clara’s marriage to St. Louis to the revolutionary horror of Saint-Domingue,” a point
                  I tease out by highlighting the ways in which the text deploys similar strategies
                  of elision to hide both the violence of revolution and the violence against women
                  (256). Attempts at textual erasure are immediate. In the opening letter to the novel,
                  Mary expresses a desire to bury her memories of the Revolution in the past, preferring
                  instead to dwell on the “profound tranquility of the ocean, the uninterrupted view,
                  the beautiful horizon . . . with a new world opening to my view” (61). Mary’s romantic
                  reflections at sea, however, are violently interrupted on landing by the “terrible
                  picture of desolation” that itself “cannot be imagined” (61). Recognizing the tension
                  between the romantic imagination and the reality of revolution helps students organize
                  their reading of the ways in which history consistently interrupts the romance narrative
                  of Sansay’s text in order to, one might argue, dramatize the limits of the imagination
                  and reveal the secret process by which some histories become hidden.</p>
               <p>Despite Mary’s attempt to narrate the reestablishment of polite society in St. Domingue
                  in which new fashions, plays, and, most importantly, balls transform the “heap of
                  ruins” throughout the city into “a fairy palace” of pleasure and love-making, sporadic
                  attacks by marauding former slaves and daily accounts of gratuitous violence on both
                  sides soon convince Mary that “[t]he romantic visions of happiness I once delighted
                  to indulge in, are fading fast away before the exterminating touch of cold reality”
                  (61; 74; 93). The links between revolutionary and sexual politics are tangible in
                  the novel, from Mary’s comparison of the masculinity of slave insurrectionists with
                  the effeminacy of French men to Rochambeau’s literal deployment of the military to
                  secure his sexual conquest of Clara. Yet, Mary’s scattered anecdotes of domestic abuse
                  against her sister Clara, like the episodes of revolutionary violence punctuating
                  the text, convey the “silent horror” experienced by not only Clara, but all women
                  in general, Mary remarking at one point that “Clara is not the first wife that has
                  been locked up at St. Domingo” (103; 87). The parallels between Clara’s confinement
                  and the “brutal subjection” of slaves, who “have at length acquired a knowledge of
                  their own strength,” formally justify Clara’s own revolt not only from the tyranny
                  of her husband, but arguably also from the oppressive moral codes Mary herself invokes
                  to judge her sister’s sudden elopement with Don Alonzo (76; 26). Although students
                  may not always grasp all of the nuances of the complex intersections between race,
                  gender, sexuality, and revolutionary violence in the novel, most will begin to understand
                  how different forms of oppression are often linked in romantic literature, recalling,
                  for instance, Wollstonecraft’s comparison of the institution of marriage to slavery,
                  and how new contexts almost always alter meaning, even of self-evident truths about
                  the inalienable rights of man.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Bolívar, Latin American Independence, and the Case for Translation</span></h2>
               <p>In turning to Bolívar and the Independence movements of South America, I conclude
                  this essay with a case study exploring the pedagogical value of translating texts
                  written in Spanish for students who typically encounter the transatlantic and romantic
                  concepts of revolution exclusively in English. I begin by posing the question David
                  Simpson asks in his evaluation of Romantic cosmopolitanism: “can what is written in
                  one language make sense in another; can what is felt by one person be the same as
                  what is felt by someone from a different place or time?” (146). The question is a
                  helpful one because it not only speaks to the purpose of literary interpretation in
                  general, but also seeks to understand that purpose in terms of important questions
                  about the value of translations in literary analysis. According to C. C. Wharram,
                  “translation changes—or might prompt us to change—the way we approach the teaching
                  of texts of British Romanticism in particular, and literature in general, within a
                  planetary context” (1). Although readings of translations, as Lesa Scholl notes, can
                  help students understand how British romantic literature “incorporates foreignness”
                  into its very structures of meaning, I find myself consistently returning to Simpson’s
                  notion of “translation not as the fantasy of dialogism but as the impasse of blocked
                  communication” (Scholl 17; Simpson 151). The key to the pedagogical strategy I have
                  adopted for this course is finding ways to demonstrate how seemingly straightforward
                  romantic concepts like the imagination, nature, liberty, and the rights of man not
                  only acquire new meanings when interpreted and read from one context to the next,
                  but also how the concepts themselves take shape in response to intentional misreadings,
                  unauthorized interpolations, contextual obfuscation, and other forms of textual distortions.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>One of the most compelling texts to advance the case for romantic translation as a
                     pedagogical strategy is Simon Bolívar’s 
                     “Carta de Jamaica”
                      (1815), a letter written originally in Spanish but immediately translated and published

                     resident Henry Cullen in an effort to solicit British support for independence from
                     Spain, Bolívar’s 
                     “Letter from Jamaica”
                      finds itself at the center of a transatlantic textual network triangulating between
                     Britain, Spain, and Spanish America during the early nineteenth century. Students
                     who read this letter expecting to find a revolutionary document worthy of Bolívar’s
                     reputation as <span xml:lang="sp" lang="sp" class="foreign">El Libertador</span> are surprised by what appears to be clear anti-democratic statements. In addition
                     to supporting the rise of dictatorships throughout South America, Bolívar mounts a
                     powerful argument against the adoption of a “democratic and federalist model” of government
                     based on pragmatic considerations, arguing that “institutions which are wholly representative
                     are not suited to our character, customs, and present knowledge” (23). Although Bolívar
                     cites a number of Enlightenment <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">philosophes</span> throughout his political writings, it was Montesquieu not Rousseau that Bolívar preferred
                     to rewrite when imagining the future of Latin America. Within a colonial context in
                     which the colonized are excluded from “the science of government and administration
                     of the state,” a process Bolívar argues has “left us in a kind of permanent infancy
                     with respect to public affairs,” the right to self-determination, Bolívar argues,
                     trumps the right of individuals to political equality (20; 19).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Burke, I remind students, advances a similar pragmatic argument when he suggests that
                  “all men have equal rights; but not to equal things,” particularly with respect to
                  “the share of power, authority, and . . . the management of the state” (218). Like
                  Bolívar, Burke also endorsed the idea that the form of government of a nation ought
                  to “emanate” from its “national character” (249). Burke, after all, supported the
                  American Revolution, a fact that his opponents interpreted as hypocritical but Burke
                  defended by citing the differences of the American situation. If the share of power,
                  authority, and management of the state is at the crux of the Revolution debate, what
                  are we to make of Bolívar’s wholesale dismissal of such an idea? What are we also
                  to make of Bolívar’s class- and race-based skepticism of the masses, particularly
                  the “African hordes” who “rarely manage to appreciate the wholesome condition of freedom”?
                  (qtd. in Bolívar xl; 27). If time allows for the inclusion of other writings of Bolívar,
                  this line of inquiry can be sharpened by questions concerning Bolívar’s denunciation
                  of the “ideal of tolerance” and “exaggerated notion of the rights of man” in <em>The Cartagena Manifesto</em> (1812), his preference for “correct” elections over “popular elections” in the same
                  document, and his inclusion of provisions for a lifetime presidency in the 1826 Bolivian
                  Constitution (3; 7). A brief survey of the rise of <span class="foreign" xml:lang="sp" lang="sp">caudillos</span>—local strongmen among whom historians include nineteenth-century figures like Juan
                  Manuel de Rosas and Antonio López de Santa Anna, dictators of Argentina and Mexico
                  respectively, and modern dictators like Fidel Castro, Manuel Noriega, and Augusto
                  Pinochet—emphasizes the contemporary relevance of such questions by alerting students
                  to the long history of authoritarian violence in Latin America that renowned historian
                  John Lynch argues “was essentially a product of the wars of independence” (5). Admittedly
                  intended for dramatic effect, one might ask how it is possible to get from life, liberty,
                  and the pursuit of happiness to death squads, dictators, and desaparecidos?</p>

                  <p>Bolívar’s political writings, especially the 
                     “Carta de Jamaica,”
                      can also open up important questions about the nature of translation, not only in
                     the way in which it challenges traditional readings of influence, but also in the
                     way in which it defamiliarizes and estranges concepts we think we know. By explicitly
                     citing the works of Enlightenment thinkers like Abbé Raynal, Baron von Humboldt, and
                     Montesquieu, and translating his letter into English, Bolívar suggests that he and
                     his interlocutor are speaking the same language. Ulterior motives aside, Bolívar understands
                     the importance of translating the Spanish American experience within the perceived
                     parameters of a shared discourse, a strategy of “enforcing meaning” that is noticeably
                     absent in texts like <em>The Angostura Address</em>, despite the fact that it essentially develops the same ideas as his 
                     “Carta de Jamaica”
                      (151). Intertextuality, consequently, is essential to the construction of its meaning,
                     a fact that is problematized by Bolívar’s intentional misreadings of many of the texts
                     he cites in his letter, most notably José María Blanco White’s <em>El Español</em>, which Bolívar refers to as evidence of broad support for the cause of independence
                     in Spanish America. Although he initially defended Latin American autonomy while Spain
                     itself fought for its own independence, Blanco White made it clear that he did not
                     intend for his arguments to be interpreted as support of independence.

                     </div>Reading against Blanco White’s ‘original’ intentions, Bolívar selectively reconstructs
                     a transatlantic discourse in order to fashion a political statement that is familiar
                     in its form but peculiar in its implications.</p>
               </div>
               <p>What would it mean to read Bolívar’s letter in Spanish? Would we find an original
                  text with clarified concepts and meanings or would we find new problems of interpretation
                  as we subject the text to the new distortions of our own translations? Consider, for
                  example, Bolívar’s discussion of the reasons why Spanish Americans are unfit for a
                  federal republic. First in English: <span class="quote">‘Slave states are identified as such by virtue of their constitution or the abuse
                     of it. People are slaves when the government, by its essence or through its vices,
                     tramples and usurps the rights of the citizen or subject. Applying these principles,
                     we will find that America was not only deprived of its freedom but deprived as well
                     of the opportunity to practice its own active tyranny. (19) ’</span> From this translation, it is unclear what precisely Bolívar means by “slave states.”
                  The analogy of citizens as slaves under an oppressive government hardly clarifies
                  the issue. Unlike oppressed subjects, slave states enslave themselves unless Bolívar
                  means for the second statement to elaborate his first, suggesting then that states
                  in which the government tramples on the rights of the people are the slave states
                  alluded to in the previous statement. Even if this latter meaning is granted, it is
                  difficult to see how these “principles” help us to understand the American situation.
                  Depriving one of rights does appear tantamount to depriving one of freedom, but how
                  is that the same as depriving one of the opportunity to practice tyranny? This last
                  question is of course resolved if we agree that Bolívar is suggesting that citizens
                  have the right to govern themselves and by depriving them of rights in general, the
                  slave state deprives them of this right as well. But Bolívar does not believe citizens
                  have the right to govern, a point he repeatedly makes throughout his writing. We still
                  have yet to touch on the bizarre notion of participating in one’s own active tyranny,
                  an idea that returns us to the concept of slave states that enslave themselves, which
                  we were supposed to have already clarified. Add to this the history of Bolívar’s relationship
                  to the recently independent black republic Haiti, where he travelled and received
                  military support on the promise he would incorporate abolition as part of his revolutionary
                  program (hitherto not a part), and Bolívar’s discussion of the slave state becomes
                  even more curious.</p>
               <p>Let us now turn to the passage in Spanish to see if we can sort out some of these
                  issues: <span class="quote">‘Los estados son esclavos por la naturaleza de su constitución o por el abuso de ella;
                     luego, un pueblo es esclavo cuando el gobierno, por su esencia o por sus vicios, holla
                     y usurpa los derechos del ciudadano o subdito. Aplicando estos principios, hallaremos
                     que la América no solamente estaba privada de su libertad, sino también de la tiranía
                     activa y dominante. (
                     “Carta”
                     )’</span> Translating with the intent to clarify the questions I posed, I might rewrite this
                  passage in English in the following way: <span class="quote">‘States are subject to despotic rule when they are formed as subject states or when
                     those in power elsewhere act despotically toward it. Tyrannical governments, however,
                     enslave their own people when they reduce and usurp the power of their citizens or
                     subjects to participate in the administration of the state, regardless of whether
                     these governments were formed to do so or not. Applying the principle of subject states,
                     we can see how America as a state has been deprived of its political autonomy. Applying
                     the principle of enslaving governments, however, we can see how Americans have also
                     been deprived of the possibility of participating in the active and dominant tyrannical
                     rule of the state. ’</span> In this interpretation, I seek to clarify the comparison between states and governments
                  by removing the reference to states as slaves in the first statement, which to me
                  creates confusion with regard to another possible analogy between enslaved states
                  and enslaved people. I then mark a contrast between states as political entities sometimes
                  subject to external rule and the mechanisms of governments concerned with the administration
                  of the state in order to create two principles and two applications: the principle
                  of subject states explaining America’s loss of political autonomy and the principle
                  of tyrannical governments explaining the people’s inability to rule themselves. In
                  some ways, I have ironed out some of the wrinkles of confusion; in other ways, I have
                  created more than I began with and have most certainly contained some of the dynamism
                  of the passage. If we reinsert the analogy between enslaved states and enslaved people,
                  for example, we recover Bolívar’s sublimated and far more disturbingly racist view
                  that although Spanish rule has enslaved America, some Americans, like the constitution
                  of subject states, are naturally formed for slavery. Although we do not have time
                  here to tease out the nuances of Bolívar’s view of race in the Americas, it is enough
                  to point out that the racial diversity of the Americas created great anxiety for Bolívar
                  who even in this letter represents race as a stumbling block to unity in the Americas.</p>
               <p>Similarly, in seeking to normalize the strange reference to the desire of the people
                  to tyrannize themselves, I, like the translator before me, invent a phrase to prevent
                  readers from interpreting this passage as an advocacy for tyranny: in Fornoff’s translation,
                  “opportunity to practice” and in mine, “possibility of participating.” Yet, tyranny
                  is precisely what this passage is advocating. Since Americans have been kept “in a
                  kind of permanent infancy,” they have never learned how to use the mechanisms of power
                  to control entire populations, especially those as vast and diverse as those in the
                  Americas. Although the 
                  “Carta de Jamaica”
                  is at its heart a solicitation for British aid, Bolívar understands its role as a
                  statement of his revolutionary agenda, which for him always involves imagining post-colonial
                  rule. Arguments against representative republics are not simply enlightenment speculations
                  on the best form of government; they are in many ways an anticipation and justification
                  of the authoritarian rule that Bolívar believed must be established while the population
                  is educated and gains experience in managing a state. The letter’s disproportionate
                  attention to the process of decolonization and the post-colonial state makes sense
                  when viewed as an assurance to a potential ally concerned about the implications of
                  an independent America in light of anxieties occasioned by nations like Haiti. Yet,
                  as Bolívar’s letter made clear, revolution must be translated into Spanish. In the
                  sentence immediately following this passage, Bolívar writes, “Me explicaré” [Let me
                  explain what I mean]. Translation may never be able to fulfill such a promise, but
                  as a “core Romantic paradigm,” Wharram might be correct in suggesting that “translation
                  changes everything” (Simpson 152; Wharram 1).</p>

               “British Romanticism: Global Crossings”
               (Fay), romantic-era studies have experienced an explosion of critical work on the
               global dimensions of romantic literature. For foundational work on British romantic
               imperialism, see Makdisi, Fulford and Kitson, and Leask. For work on romantic travel
               writing, global feminisms, and cosmopolitanisms, see Mellor, Simpson, Wohlgemut, and
               Bohls and Duncan. In recent years, investigations into the global contexts of British
               romanticism has moved steadily away from the postcolonial frameworks of earlier studies
               toward a broader understanding of romantic literature’s relationship to the history
               of globalization. As Evan Gottlieb argues, “romantic globalism,” Gottlieb’s term for
               the globalizing tendencies of romantic-era literature, “took shape as an alternative
               to, rather than merely an elaboration or anticipation of, imperialism” (10). For more
               on this particular critical trend, see Annesley, Cooppan, Gupta, and Jay.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               my phrases or polish my style. I aim at being useful, and sincerity will render me
               unaffected; for wishing rather to persuade by the force of my arguments than dazzle
               by the elegance of my language, I shall not waste my time in rounding periods, or
               in fabricating the turgid bombast of artificial feelings” (112).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
