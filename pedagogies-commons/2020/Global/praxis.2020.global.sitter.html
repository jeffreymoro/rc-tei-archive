            <p class="noCount">This article argues that India occupies a central position in Romantic literature,
               and that this centrality requires teachers of this period to engage with India as
               both a site of cultural production and an object of imaginative fascination. It offers
               teachers of Romantic literature a pedagogical framework and three specific case studies
               to illustrate approaches to Romantic India across a range of courses. In the first
               case study, I suggest how a narrowly focused seminar could pair texts produced by
               British and South Asian writers—representatives of the “Anglo-Indian” and “Indo-Anglian”
               discourse communities, respectively—to help students grasp how the writing and experience
               of British and Indian subjects of the early Indian empire was at once intermingled
               and strictly segregated. The second case study considers how a period survey might
               incorporate a brief unit on Romantic India that nonetheless treats India as an integral
               part of the literature of the period. I suggest pairing some of Robert Burns’s short
               lyrics with poems by Henry Derozio, who engages analogous themes of nationalism and
               poetic vision in the Indian context. Reading Burns and Derozio together, I suggest,
               can help students see how literary dialects of English could serve as powerful but
               problematic tools of identity-formation and social mobility in both the colonial and
               domestic contexts. In the final case study, I examine the possibilities of teaching
               a longer work, Sydney Owenson’s <em>The Missionary</em>. I show how Owenson’s novel offers rich opportunities to engage students with key
               elements of Britain’s colonial history in India while simultaneously illustrating
               many of the formal tensions that characterized the novel in this period.</p>

                  <p>India figures in English writing of the Romantic period as both an important literary <em>topos</em> and a geographic and discursive site from which British and Indian writers produced
                     a diverse array of texts. As an imagined space, “India”

                              English speakers in the Romantic era. “India” was a capacious category that included,
                              at one time or another, most or all of the territories now generally identified as
                              “South Asia”: principally the nations of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka;
                              and, to a lesser extent, Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan, and the Maldives.</span></div>
                     </div> brought with it the baggage of centuries of European fascination with the exotic Orient;
                     in this guise, the subcontinent was merely one part of a vast and relatively undifferentiated
                     mass stretching from North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean to the shores of China
                     and Japan. At the same time, however, Britain’s deepening involvement with India in
                     an economic, cultural, and “boots-on-the-ground” capacity helped to specify the subcontinent
                     in the British imagination. Britons both at home and abroad began to write with a
                     newly intimate and empirical (though not necessarily more accurate) knowledge of the
                     people and places of South Asia. And in India itself, the growing influence of the
                     British meant that Indian subjects of the (as yet informal) empire increasingly turned
                     to English as a medium of communication, advocacy, and expression. Indeed, Gauri Viswanathan
                     makes a strong case in <em>Masks of Conquest</em> that the discipline of English itself originated in the schools and colleges administered
                     by the East India Company in the 1820s and 1830s. Thus, if students of Romantic-era
                     Britain are to understand the literature, culture, and politics of the period, they
                     must become to some extent students of the India of that era as well; they will need
                     to grasp at least the outlines of the relationship that would so crucially mold the
                     literatures and histories of both nations—and the development of literature in English
                     around the world—in the centuries to follow.</p>
               </div>
               <p>To that end, this article suggests some general pedagogical principles, as well as
                  a few specific texts and classroom approaches, for the teaching of Romantic India.
                  It does so according to the model advocated by Harish Trivedi, among others, which
                  views colonial discourse as a series of “transactions”: “an interactive, dialogic,
                  two-way process rather than as a simple active-passive one” (Trivedi 1). While Trivedi’s
                  model could lend itself to underemphasizing the inequalities that underlie these literary-cultural
                  transactions, I will argue that this danger is not disabling and that a transactional
                  approach can acknowledge the agency of colonized writers without effacing the context
                  of oppression. The single greatest strength of the transactional approach, however,
                  is that it breaks down the divisions, sometimes tacit, sometimes explicit, that have
                  tended to creep up between British and Indian writing, and also between the canonical
                  “literature” produced in Britain versus the texts of merely “historical” interest
                  produced—by both British and Indian writers—“in the Empire.” By seeing the ways in
                  which writers of different national and imperial identities used literature to respond
                  to the opportunities and anxieties inspired by the colonial encounter, students can
                  gain a much “thicker” sense of the world(s) of the Romantic era.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Because the endpoints of our period are so variable and contentious, Romanticists
                     are well used to both problematizing and defending the notion of literary periodization.
                     In India, “the Romantic period” is an even less coherent entity than in Britain, since
                     the subcontinent, even the limited parts of it under British rule or influence, was
                     subject to very different historical and cultural pressures than operated in Britain
                     itself. To take just two examples: since France’s influence in India had atrophied
                     almost completely in the wake of the British East India Company’s victories during
                     the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763), the impact of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic
                     Wars, so transformative in Britain and continental Europe, was muted on the subcontinent.
                     Similarly, Britain’s ongoing industrialization, with the accompanying movements toward
                     enclosure, urbanization, and labor unrest, was felt very differently in India, though
                     the emerging globalization of the textile industry meant that these material pressures
                     could be magnified or refracted unpredictably as well as attenuated by distance and
                     time.

                     and 1830s do contain events of considerable import to life in British India. The 1780s
                     witnessed both William Jones’s founding of the Asiatick Society, which would produce
                     much of the influential Orientalist scholarship of the next century (including the
                     “Indo-European hypothesis” of a fundamental kinship between the languages of India
                     and Europe), and the sensational impeachment trial of Warren Hastings, then governor-general

                     famously codified in Thomas Babington Macaulay’s 
                     “Minute on Indian Education”
                      of 1835 and implemented through the English Education Act of the same year.

               <p>Because curricular resources at most colleges and universities are too limited to
                  devote an entire course to the topic of Romantic India, I will discuss approaches
                  to teaching a unit on this topic in two different, more broadly focused, types of
                  courses. The first is a survey of Romanticism that emphasizes the global reach of
                  British literary as well as material interests in this period. The second is an upper-level
                  seminar on Indian literature in English, which I have taught under the title 
                  “English in India/India in English.”
                  In this course, the Romantic era is one episode in a longitudinal survey of literary
                  transactions between Britain and South Asia running from the eighteenth century to
                  the present. The remainder of this article is organized around three “case studies,”
                  each presenting a text or pair of texts along with some teaching approaches. One caveat:
                  my own experience with these texts has come in universities in the United States,
                  a country whose own involvement in the complex relationship between Britain and India
                  is, though real, at a considerable remove. Clearly, teaching these texts in other
                  places would raise different issues and questions for instructors; however, inviting
                  students to explore their own geographical and cultural location as they read, as
                  well as those of the producers and consumers of these texts, can be an excellent starting
                  point for discussion and collective interpretation. How, for example, might these
                  texts and events mean differently for readers in Britain, or South Asia, or other
                  former British colonies, than they do for readers in the United States? How did they
                  unite or divide different audiences in their own time?</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>One textual pairing I have used with some success in an upper-level seminar is between
                     Phebe Gibbes’ 1789 novel <em>Hartly House, Calcutta</em> and Dean Mahomet’s 1794 travel narrative <em>The Travels of Dean Mahomet</em> (often cited as the first published text by an Indian author), both of which are available
                     in recent scholarly editions. I chose relatively short excerpts from the two texts
                     near the beginning of my 
                     “English in India/India in English”
                      course to frame two categories important to the history of Indian literature in English:
                     “Anglo-India,” which in the nineteenth century described the transplanted society
                     of Britons in India, and “Indo-Anglia,” a term that has gained traction in recent
                     decades as a way of categorizing writing in English by Indian and diasporic authors.

                              some confusion, nineteenth-century texts are fairly consistent in limiting the use
                              of the term to Britons living abroad in India. The term “Indo-Anglian” was in at least
                              modest circulation as far back as 1883, when a slim collection of specimens of Indian
                              writing in English titled Indo-Anglian Literature was published in Calcutta (Buck).</span></div>
                     </div> Seeing these two discourse communities intersect at or near their points of origin
                     helps students grasp how the writing and experience of British and Indian subjects
                     of the early Indian empire could be at once intermingled and strictly segregated.
                     Sophia Goldborne, the narrator of <em>Hartly House, Calcutta</em>, is the daughter of an East India Company official who travels to Calcutta during
                     the Hastings administration and writes letters recounting her experiences there to
                     a friend back in England. Sophia’s experience of India is squarely one of Anglo-India,
                     contained entirely within the British settlement at Calcutta and involving minimal
                     contact with actual Indians. Nonetheless, even Anglo-India was exotic enough to Britons
                     of the day that Sophia narrates her encounters with the company nabobs in the kind
                     of ethnographic and loco-descriptive detail that characterized eighteenth-century
                     encounters with geographical and cultural “others.” Dean Mahomet, in contrast, was
                     a Bengali Muslim who joined the company’s army in 1769, serving as a soldier and subaltern
                     officer until 1783, when he emigrated to Ireland. The <em>Travels</em>, written and published several years after Mahomet’s arrival in Britain but focusing
                     only on his time in India, is also epistolary in form, addressed to an unnamed British
                     “friend” and offering a mixture of autobiography and ethnography.</p>
               </div>
               <p>My students were quick to see many of the similarities between Gibbes’s and Mahomet’s
                  texts—the epistolary form, for example, with its address to an audience at once immediate
                  and displaced, and the sometimes awkwardly integrated conventions of the travel narrative
                  and amateur ethnography. I found their responses to other aspects of these texts more
                  varied and conflicting. Some were quite conscious, for example, of Mahomet’s somewhat
                  ambivalent occupation of his position as native informant, at once a representative
                  of and alienated from the people he describes. For example, when he offers an “account
                  of the form of marriage among the Mahometans, which is generally solemnized with all
                  the external show of Oriental pageantry,” both the phrase “the Mahometans” and the
                  stereotyped reference to “the external show of Oriental pageantry” suggest an unhesitating
                  identification with the perspective of the colonizer (65). As other students more
                  sympathetic to Mahomet’s divided loyalties pointed out, however, this alienated perspective
                  also has a certain cosmopolitan sophistication, and Mahomet often acts as an advocate,
                  if sometimes a condescending one, for the civilizations and cultures of his native
                  country. While Gibbes attempts a similar cosmopolitanism—such as when her narrator
                  Sophia admonishes her correspondent that “all the prejudices you have so long cherished
                  against [India] must be done away; and for this plain reason, that they are totally
                  groundless”—some students were frustrated by the novel’s stubborn focus on the British
                  settlements and the restriction of Indians’ roles to providing “local color” (3).
                  These frustrations can be pedagogically useful, however; Sophia Goldborne’s limited
                  horizon, for example, suggests the restricted mobility of the few British women in
                  India in the early days of empire as well as the “invisibility” of many Indians in
                  British accounts of this period. Dean Mahomet’s pioneering “Indo-Anglian” narrative,
                  then, might be offered as a corrective to some of the omissions of the “Anglo-Indian”
                  texts of the Romantic era.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Case Study 2: Comparative Romanticisms</span></h2>
               <p>In an introductory course on British Romanticism, it is especially important to build
                  connections between writing from and about India and other topical clusters, so that
                  students see “the India stuff” less as an isolated curiosity than as an integral part
                  of the literature and history of the period. One way to do this is by emphasizing
                  the points of commonality between colonial difference and other kinds of marginalization
                  (e.g., geographical, class, gender, ethnic, linguistic) at work on the home front.
                  Juxtaposing Robert Burns with the Bengali poet and reformer Henry Derozio, for example,
                  can help students see how literary dialects of English could serve as powerful but
                  problematic tools of identity-formation and social mobility in both the colonial and
                  domestic contexts. Burns and Derozio make a fascinating combination because they and
                  their poetry play to different prevailing myths about the figure of the Romantic poet:
                  on the one hand, Burns, celebrated as the poet born, not made, whose untutored genius
                  brought him brief glory before his inevitable decline. On the other, Derozio, who
                  (like Keats) died extremely young; who (like Shelley) flirted with philosophical materialism
                  and even atheism; and who (like Byron) adopted a rakish persona, flouted the social
                  mores of polite society, and was surrounded by rumors of sexual scandal. While we
                  often treat dispelling these “romantic” myths of authorship as a pedagogical duty,
                  students are usually more receptive to a gradual complication of these reductive narratives
                  than to a frontal assault; in the case of an unfamiliar and marginalized figure like
                  Derozio, interesting them in the larger-than-life “character” may be a necessary first
                  step toward engaging them with his writing.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Fortunately, Derozio, who could adopt the orientalist clichés of a Byron or a Moore
                     in a poem like 
                     “Song of the Hindustanee Minstrel”
                      (“There’s many a valued pearl / In richest Oman’s sea; / But none, my fair Cashmerian
                     girl! / O! none can rival thee [lines 5–8]), also produced poetry whose relation to
                     both “East” and “West” is more complex, such as the sonnet 
                     “The Harp of India”

                     up on: in addition to the Aeolian harp figure in line 4, the “ruined monument on desert
                     plain” either alludes to or indirectly evokes 
                     “Ozymandias,”
                      raising the question of where Derozio might locate himself in that rumination on empire’s
                     transience. Is the speaker here aligned with Shelley’s traveller, or with the “Oriental”
                     civilizations whose ruins he contemplates? Students might also be curious about the
                     poem’s formal oddness: the repeated rhyme in lines 4 and 5 subverts the quatrain pattern
                     that underlies most English sonnets; its rhetorical turn comes at the precise middle,
                     between lines 7 and 8, avoiding the sonnet’s characteristic asymmetry; and the closing
                     couplet’s return to the “-ain” ending of lines 2, 4, 5, and 7 gives the poem’s aural
                     texture an unfamiliar thickness. Students could be asked to find evidence to support
                     or refute the proposition that these deviations are signs of resistance to British
                     cultural authority—or, alternatively, of an incomplete assimilation of the sonnet’s
                     conventions.</p>

                  <p>Although 
                     “The Harp of India”
                      is often described as a patriotic protest against British rule, the ambiguity of its
                     imagery, together with its adoption of European conventions (including, obviously,
                     the medium of English), raises interpretive questions that can be neatly coupled with
                     an examination of the poem’s form. Is Britain’s intervention presented as the cause
                     of India’s long silence—or is it the clarion that will awaken her from slumber? Does
                     the poem’s use of a canon of nationalist imagery borrowed directly from European sources
                     undermine or enhance its nationalism? Conversely, do the echoes of the tradition of
                     resistance from Britain’s Celtic fringe that Katie Trumpener has labeled “bardic”
                     nationalism align India with other peoples subjected to British colonialism? Pairing 
                     “The Harp of India”
                      with one or more of Burns’s nationalist songs, such as 
                     “Caledonia”
                      or 
                     “Such a Parcel of Rogues in a Nation,”
                      offers students a way to compare the participation of these two very different poets
                     in a literary tradition that both lauded and marginalized their efforts. The martial
                     and strikingly defiant tone of a poem like 
                     “Caledonia,”
                      which personifies Scotland as a warrior goddess whose ferocity has taught “The Anglian
                     lion, the terror of France” “to fear in his own native wood” (lines 29, 32) stands
                     in marked contrast to the mournful ambivalence of Derozio’s poem. Similarly, the conditional
                     mood of Derozio’s closing pledge—“<em>if</em> thy notes divine / May be by mortal wakened once again, / Harp of my country, let
                     me strike the strain!”—differs starkly from the supreme confidence of Burns’s assertion
                     that “brave Caledonia immortal must be” (line 43). Do these differences reflect a
                     divergence in personal aesthetics or the differing conditions of the poets’ two subject
                     nations? Would an Indian poem as defiant as Burns’s have found an audience—or even
                     a publisher? Reading Derozio alongside Burns would allow students to explore and interrogate
                     parallels between the Indian and the Scottish poets from multiple perspectives: poetic
                     and political, textual and contextual.

               <h2><span class="head">Case Study 3: Teaching a Longer Work</span></h2>
               <p>Finally, I want to discuss some of the opportunities presented by teaching a longer
                  text—in this case, Sydney Owenson’s 1811 novel <em>The Missionary: An Indian Tale</em>, now available in a fine critical edition from Broadview Press. While I have not
                  had a chance to teach Owenson’s novel myself, I would like to present a case for the
                  potential benefits of assigning it, most likely in an upper-level undergraduate or
                  graduate course. Of course, a novel, even a relatively short one like <em>The Missionary</em>, consumes a substantial chunk of course time; it is a significant advantage, then,
                  to choose a text that can be brought into dialogue with more than one set of thematic
                  and contextual concerns. Owenson’s novel meets this requirement nicely by mapping
                  the colonial encounter in India onto both national (Irish) and gendered struggles
                  for self-determination; in addition, it offers an opportunity to expose students to
                  the Romantic novel beyond <em>Frankenstein</em> and Jane Austen. As an Irishwoman, Owenson was a subject of British rule in ways
                  that both mirrored and sharply differed from the experience of colonized Indians,
                  and <em>The Missionary</em> is a fascinating instance of the displacement of one set of imperial anxieties onto
                  another. The novel is set in the 1630s, when Portugal was both a colonial power in
                  India and a subject nation, under Spanish domination since 1580—a position with obvious
                  parallels to Ireland’s in the early nineteenth century. <em>The Missionary</em> details the relationship between a Portuguese missionary, Hilarion, and a Brahmin
                  priestess, Luxima, who is the object of his efforts—initially toward conversion, but
                  soon toward romantic union in defiance of both his priestly vows and the caste prejudices
                  of Hindu India. Their relationship bears considerable national-allegorical freight,
                  and Owenson follows a popular tendency (to which her 1806 novel <em>The Wild Irish Girl</em> had already contributed) to figure the conquering nation as male and the conquered
                  as female. Still, however idealized and sacrificial she may seem at times, Luxima
                  is a character of considerable agency and interest, whose resistance to colonial domination
                  and the “priestcraft” of both Catholic and Hindu establishments clearly resonated
                  with certain segments of the Romantic reading public: as Michael Franklin notes, Percy
                  Shelley “recommend[ed] Owenson’s novel to friends with a proselytizing zeal” (167).</p>
               <p><em>The Missionary</em> is also an excellent text for teaching the ways in which literature both is and isn’t
                  about its ostensible subject. While Irish and protofeminist politics are central to
                  the novel, and while British imperialism is displaced onto Portugal and Spain, <em>The Missionary</em> remains firmly entrenched in the religious, ideological, and pragmatic concerns of
                  early nineteenth-century imperial Britain. As Julia Wright’s excellent introduction
                  to the Broadview edition points out, missionary activity in India was a particularly
                  hot topic in the years between the Vellore Mutiny of 1806 (which many blamed on overzealous
                  proselytizing) and the renewal of the East India Company’s charter in 1813 (Owenson
                  40). Like many texts in this period, then, <em>The Missionary</em> was both a work of fiction and an implicit argument about the course of empire in
                  India. Its use of India—particularly of the “India” that Orientalist scholarship had
                  recently made available to Britons—is at once aesthetic and ideological. In a class
                  focused on India, a useful comparison point might be Robert Southey’s <em>The Curse of Kehama</em> (1810), which argues implicitly (as Southey did explicitly in his periodical writing)
                  for the necessity of British evangelism among the Hindus, whose faith he described
                  as “of all false religions [. . .] the most monstrous in its fables, and the most
                  fatal in its effects” (3). A juxtaposition between two such closely contemporary yet
                  starkly contrasting texts can offer students a portal into the complex intertwining
                  of aesthetics and ideology, representation and power, that characterized the literary
                  transactions between Britain and its Indian “possessions.”</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">For the purposes of this article, I will use “India” to reflect common usage among
               English speakers in the Romantic era. “India” was a capacious category that included,
               at one time or another, most or all of the territories now generally identified as
               “South Asia”: principally the nations of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka;
               and, to a lesser extent, Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan, and the Maldives.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">See Siraj Ahmed’s excellent <em>The Stillbirth of Capital: Enlightenment Writing and Colonial India</em> for a detailed account of how the entanglement of British and Indian economies in
               the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was reflected in the period’s literature.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody"><em>Asiatick Researches</em>, which began publication in 1788, was the organ of the Asiatick Society and contains
               most of Jones’s scholarly treatises, along with articles by other important orientalist
               scholars, such as H. T. Colebrooke and Horace Hayman Wilson. Facsimiles of most of
               the issues of <em>Asiatick Researches</em> are available through open-access resources like Google Books and the Internet Archive.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Extracts from these speeches would make a suggestive intertext to read alongside Burke’s
               more frequently taught texts on the sublime and the French Revolution. Sara Suleri’s
               chapters on Burke in <em>The Rhetoric of English India</em> remain the definitive readings of the connections between Burke’s aesthetic theory
               and his anti-Hastings rhetoric.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Viswanathan offers an excellent summary of the Orientalist/Anglicist debate in chapter

         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">“Anglo-Indian” has also been used, particularly since the early twentieth century,
               to describe people of mixed British and Indian ancestry. Although this might cause
               some confusion, nineteenth-century texts are fairly consistent in limiting the use
               of the term to Britons living abroad in India. The term “Indo-Anglian” was in at least
               modest circulation as far back as 1883, when a slim collection of specimens of Indian
               writing in English titled <em>Indo-Anglian Literature</em> was published in Calcutta (Buck).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Derozio’s poetry is difficult to find in print, though Mary Ellis Gibson’s <em>Anglophone Poetry in Colonial India, 1780–1913: A Critical Anthology</em>, has made strides toward rectifying that situation. Fortunately, a number of his
               poems can be found online. Both 
               “Song of the Hindustanee Minstrel”
               and 
               “The Harp of India”
               are available at Representative Poetry Online (
               “Derozio”
               ).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">Chapter 1 of Manu Samriti Chander’s recent <em>Brown Romantics: Poetry and Nationalism in the Global Nineteenth Century</em> offers a deft and thoughtful reading of Derozio’s often subversive deployment of
               English poetic conventions to “Indocentric” ends.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
