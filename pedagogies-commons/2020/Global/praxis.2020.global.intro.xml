            <head>Introduction: Teaching Romanticism in a Global Age</head>
            <p>What does it mean to teach Romanticism in a global age? In the eighteenth century,
                global signified “having a spherical form”; the association of global with “relating
                to, or involving the whole world” arose in the mid-nineteenth century (“Global”).
                The term global, however, is not synonymous with <emph>globalization</emph>, as 
                Felicity Nussbaum notes in the introduction to her
                edited collection, <title level="m">The Global Eighteenth Century</title> (2003; 4).
                In the twenty-first century, the term globalization refers to the patterns and
                processes by which technology allows people across the world to rapidly communicate
                and trade goods and ideas, and <emph>global</emph> has come to signify the
                interconnectedness of peoples and the world they share. The essays collected here
                suggest that teaching Romanticism in a global age invites flexibility and
                imagination in the modalities instructors employ and in the texts that they select
                to make a curriculum. Collectively, the essays in this volume define global
                Romanticism as an intersection of world literatures; they present varied approaches
                to teaching Anglophone Romanticism in ways that acknowledge ties to other cultures,
                languages, and literatures through individual assignments, units, and syllabi.</p>
            <p>This introductory chapter surveys the debate over the shifting meanings of the term
                global in the last two decades among literary scholars and pedagogues in order to
                frame global Romanticism as a concept and field. The term global seems to imply an
                international angle; while the essays here address global themes, issues, and texts,
                they are focused on British and American literature and literature in translation.
                The pervasiveness of English has come to represent its status as a global language
                and its effect on other languages.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Minae 
                    Mizumura’s book, <title level="m">The Fall of Language in the Age of 
                        English</title> (2015).</note>
                Critics from outside the English-speaking world cite the dominance of the English
                language and Anglo-American culture as party to the spread of <emph>globalization</emph>, 
                a word that seems to imply Anglo-centrism. In a 1999
                lecture for UNESCO, <title level="a">Globalisation, Peace, and Cosmopolitanism,</title> 
                Jacques Derrida distinguishes between the French term <foreign xml:lang="fr">mondialisation</foreign> 
                and the similar English and German terms globalization and <foreign xml:lang="de">
                    Globalisierung</foreign>. Whereas mondialisation, for Derrida, denotes the process
                of the world in formation, the finality and ostensible universality of the English term 
                globalization disguises the power imbalances of the “<emph>homo-hegemonizations</emph>” 
                enacted by “the Anglo-American hegemony” and its concomitant governmental and 
                nongovernmental institutions (373).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For an
                    exegesis of Derrida’s lecture, see V. Li, <title level="a">Elliptical Interruptions: Or,
                            Why Derrida Prefers <foreign xml:lang="fr">Mondialisation</foreign> to
                            Globalization</title> (2007). See also Jean-Luc Nancy’s book
                    <title level="m">The Creation of the World or Globalization</title> (2007);
                            its translator, Francois Raffoul, substitutes “world-forming” for the
                            term <foreign xml:lang="fr">mondialisation</foreign> (44).</note></p>
            <p>Evidence supports Derrida’s argument that Anglo-American language and culture do in
                fact dominate the discourses of globalism and globalization. In <title level="m">
                    English as a Global Language</title> (1997/2003), David Crystal notes that English
                has replaced French “as the chief foreign language in schools in Algeria (a former
                French colony)” (5). More recently, Rwanda changed the language of its education
                system from French to English in order to better access the global economy,
                according to officials (McGreal). The majority of scholarly debates about
                globalization appear to take place in English as well. In the 
                essay <title level="a">A Bibliometric Research Analysis of 20 Years of Globalization 
                    Research: 1990–2009,</title> Xinjian Liu and
                his collaborators examine the search term “globali*” across multiple databases and
                libraries and find that nearly 93% of the journal articles are written in English
                (Liu et al. 197), many of them in the mid-1990s, during the rise of the internet,
                the practice of outsourcing, and the expansion of the European Union (Liu et al.
                198). These findings are perhaps not surprising given that the authors limit their
                search to the term “globali,” which would pick up the Spanish 
                word, <foreign xml:lang="es">globalización</foreign>, but neither 
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">mondialisation</foreign> nor the term in many other languages. 
                The same study found that “the volume of books on globalization peaked around 2002 and 
                declined afterwards” (Liu et al. 198). While many of these publications belong to the social
                sciences, in the field of literary studies, a similar pattern appears. Many scholars
                published special volumes on literature and globalization around the turn of the
                    millennium.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Many literary genres illustrate 
                        “evidence of cultural migrations,” as Giles Gunn remarks in his introductory essay 
                        to a special issue of <title level="j">PMLA</title> on <title level="a">Globalizing
                            Literary Studies</title> in 2001 (17). That same year, the
                            <title level="j">South Atlantic Quarterly</title> published
                            a special issue on the same theme. The guest editors note that literary
                            scholars are uniquely situated to comment on the “numerous discourses or
                            ‘fictions’ of globalization” (O’Brien and Szeman 604). Around this time,
                            in 2005, Suzanne Berger offered a Political Science course at MIT on
                            Globalization that is now available online via

                The essays in this volume offer practical applications of projects such as these for
                the teaching of Romantic-era texts.</p>
            <p>Scholarly reflection on globalization in the mid-aughts took the form, in the study
                of Romanticism, of work on cosmopolitanism. While most of the examples of
                “cosmopolitan” cited in the <title level="m">OED</title> stem from the 1840s or
                afterwards, the word reflects growing identification with the culture of the
                metropolis, or as Jon Klancher puts it, “London as Cosmopolis” (65). Romantic
                Cosmopolitanism was the theme of the 2004 annual meeting of the North American
                Society for the Study of Romanticism (NASSR). That conference took place the year
                after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, and David Simpson prefaced his talk with the remark
                that “in 2003 precisely 18 students graduated from US universities with advanced
                degrees in Arabic (apparently up from 6 in 2002)” (142). Published in a special
                volume in <title level="j">The European Romantic Review</title> in 2005, the essay
                version of this talk, <title level="a">The Limits of Cosmopolitanism and the Case for 
                    Translation,</title> poses two important questions about translation and “human feeling”:
            <quote>The question for both is the same: can what is written in one language make sense in
                another; can what is felt by one person be the same as what is felt by someone from
                a different place or time? For poetry, which was and is often the site where feeling
                is held to matter most, where we might expect to recognize that “we have all of us
                one human heart,” each question is a version of the other (Simpson 146).</quote>
               The suggestion here, that poetry—the work of translation, and understanding others’
                feelings require the subject to bridge the gap between self and other—is helpful for
                understanding a pedagogy that aims to teach global awareness. The essays in this
                volume attest beautifully to the idea that teaching literature helps to cultivate
                awareness of others, or empathy.</p>
            <p>Empathy plays a key role in Martha Nussbaum’s argument about what it means to learn,
                teach, and work in a global age. In her book <title level="m">Not for Profit: Why
                    Democracy Needs the Humanities</title> (2016), Nussbaum refers several times to
                what she calls “world citizenship” (89) and at other times “global citizens” (94);
                these are students who are prepared to address issues that humans face across
                national lines, including but not limited to “global warming; decent trade
                regulations; the protection of the environment and animal species; the future of
                nuclear energy and the dangers of nuclear weapons; the movement of labor and the
                establishment of decent labor standards; the protection of children from
                trafficking, sexual abuse, and forced labor” (80). Nussbaum advocates an
                interdisciplinary curriculum that combines the study of the arts and humanities
                “alongside the study of religion and of philosophical theories of justice” (94).
                This course of study aims to cultivate what Nussbaum calls “students’ ‘inner eyes’”
                in order to instill the ability to connect and communicate across barriers that
                traditionally divide humans from each other and the issues that they want to solve
                (Nussbaum 108). While Nussbaum, like Simpson, specifically mentions poetry as a tool
                for teaching empathy, as the essays in this volume illustrate, even nonpoetic texts
                from the Romantic era appear well suited for curricula with these learning goals, in
                part because writers from the period raise issues about social justice.</p>
            <p>The Romantic period also plays an important role in the larger historical process of
                globalization. According to Roland Robertson, the Romantic era occurs during the
                second of five such phases. Robertson names this “The Incipient Phase,” and
                describes it as:
            <quote>Lasting—mainly in Europe—from the mid-eighteenth century until the 1870s. Sharp shift
                towards the idea of the homogeneous, unitary state; crystallization of conceptions
                of formalized international relations, of standardized citizenly individuals and a
                more concrete conception of humankind. Sharp increases in legal conventions and
                agencies concerned with international and transnational regulation and

               As the essays in this volume highlight, global Romanticism at once participates in
                this trend and critiques it. For example, although scholars tend to cite the
                idealized world view of Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) as part of the trend
                toward nationalism that Robertson describes,<note place="foot" resp="editors">Richard

                    particularly in France—that humans are diverse the rational and irrational aspects 
                    of the human personality being unified in a harmonious whole” (263).</note> his

                attempt to synthesize a global ethos for Romanticism.</p>
            <p>Romanticists have long understood that making sense of trends is as important for our
                own era as it is for scholars of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In the
                lead-up to the 2003 war in Iraq, for example, writers debated the ideological legacy
                of Romanticism in regards to globalization and imperialism. Consider George P.
                Fletcher’s book, <title level="m">Romantics at War: Glory and Guilt in the Age of
                    Terrorism</title> (2002). Fletcher takes as his premise the idea that Romantic
                notions of “authenticity” pervade international law and complicate the arbitration
                of extranational crimes such as terrorism (140). Critics have pointed out that
                Fletcher uses a reductive definition of Romanticism (based largely on Isaiah Berlin)
                and that he fails to acknowledge that many eras besides the eighteenth and
                nineteenth centuries teach “in one form or another that the individual’s good is
                intelligible only against the backdrop of the collective good” (Berkowitz 32). In a
                more nuanced vein, Gayatri Spivak’s <title level="m">An Aesthetic Education in the
                    Era of Globalization</title> (2012) asserts Romanticism’s “ability to imagine the
                other side as another human being, rather than simply an enemy to be psyched out,
                which is [the period’s] . . . greatest gift” (Spivak 483). Like Simpson and
                Nussbaum, Spivak emphasizes the power of Romantic literature to evoke empathy in
                readers.</p>
            <p>In the years since the official end of the war in Iraq, scholarship on Romanticism
                and the global has largely explored the scientific, economic implications of
                international trade, travel, and communications. Evan Gottlieb’s book, 
                <title level="m">Romantic Globalism: British Literature and Modern World Order,
                    1750–1830</title> (2014), makes a strong case for British writers’ awareness of
                “the global processes and dynamics that were increasingly reshaping their lives,
                their nation, and the world” (2). His coedited collection, <title level="m">Global
                    Romanticism: Origins, Orientations, and Engagements, 1760–1820</title> (2015),
                demonstrates even more diverse views on the subject, with essays on the early
                networks of empire and communication. Gottlieb’s focus on what he terms 
                <emph>globalism</emph> offers a model for future scholarship that seeks to
                integrate the texts and contexts of Romanticism into discussions of globalization in
                a way that acknowledges the need to explore and entertain different angles of such a
                broad and diverse subject. </p>
            <p>The essays in this volume provide concrete methods of putting recent scholarship on
                Romanticism and the global into action in the classroom. The opening essay by Eric
                Gidal, <title level="a">Teaching Global Romanticisms: Romanticism and the Logic 
                    of Culture,</title> illustrates the ways in which assigning texts with 
                international impact on the movement of Romanticism across Britain and Europe can 
                cultivate a deeper understanding of Romantic writers’ influence on modern culture. Gidal 
                employs William Ray’s model for studying culture in his book <title level="m">The Logic of
                    Culture: Authority and Identity in the Modern Age</title> (2001) in order to
                present a theoretical model, historical background, and institutional framework for
                analyzing the tensions between individual aesthetic experiences and the pressures of
                national traditions. The course that Gidal describes, <title level="a">Literature 
                and Culture of the Romantic Period: The Logic of Culture,</title> incorporates British, 
                French, and German texts. Selections include but are not limited to fictional texts 
                such as Rousseau’s <title level="m">Julie, or the New Heloise </title>(<title level="m">
                    <foreign xml:lang="fr">Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse</foreign></title>, 1761), 
                Staël’s <title level="m">Corinne, or Italy</title> (<title level="m"><foreign xml:lang="fr">
                    Corinne, ou L'Italie</foreign></title>, 1807), and Goethe’s 
                <title level="m">Sorrows of Young Werther</title> (<title level="m"><foreign xml:lang="de">Die 
                    Leiden des jungen Werthers</foreign></title>, 1774); short nonfiction texts such 
                as <title level="m">The Declaration of Independence</title> (1776) and <title level="m">The 
                    Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen</title> (1789); extracts from 
                Schiller’s <title level="m">On the Aesthetic Education of Man</title> 
                (<title level="m"><foreign xml:lang="de">Über die ästhetische
                    Erziehung des Menschen</foreign></title>, 1795), Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence of
                        Poetry</title> (1821), and Williams’s <title level="m">Letters Written in
                            France</title> (1790); and poems: <title level="m">Ode on a Grecian Urn</title>
                (1819/20), <title level="m">Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</title> (1812–18), and 
                <title level="m">The Poems of Ossian</title> (1765). The
                course carefully considers Ossian’s critical reception, thus enabling “students to
                perceive the tension between aestheticism and historicism in Romantic discourse, as
                well as the political and cultural agendas served by various positions.” Gidal
                emphasizes student-centered learning throughout his essay in a fashion that
                underscores the potential for this material to help students see, witness, perceive,
                and explore what the author calls the logic of culture.</p>
            <p>Like the chapter that precedes it, my essay, <title level="a">European Romanticism 
                and <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>: A Comparative Literature Course for 
                English Majors,</title> reaches beyond the Anglophone canon. The purpose of this 
                exploration, however, is to deepen students’ appreciation for a single canonical 
                British text, Mary Shelley’s novel <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> (1818), by 
                reading the global texts that influenced it. <title level="a">European Romanticism</title> 
                discusses the pedagogical purpose behind the course, designed for English majors, many of 
                whom plan to teach in a U.S. classroom someday. The course begins with the French 
                Revolution in order to orient students to one of the key historical benchmarks of the Romantic 
                timeline. However, some of the reading, notably Rousseau’s 
                <title level="m">Confessions</title> (the 1782 text that Shelley
                read), predates the French Revolution, in order to better understand the function of
                sensibility and parenting in <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. Moreover, the
                first unit covers German and French Romantic poetry, some of which was inspired by
                British and German Romanticism, and thus postdates 1830. The course includes at
                least one of the texts that the creature in <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>
                finds in the forest, <title level="m">The Sufferings of Young Werther</title> (the
                modern translation of <title level="m"><foreign xml:lang="de">Die Leiden des jungen 
                    Werthers</foreign></title> that comes closer to the original German than 
                <title level="m">The Sorrows of Young Werther</title>). Along with French and German 
                poetry, this novel lays the foundation for students to learn the concept of Romantic irony, 
                which John Fetzer describes as a “bifocal or double vision” (21). Engaging with Romantic 
                irony helps students to better appreciate the ambivalence and contradiction of the second unit,
                    <title level="a">Frankenstein and his Doppelgänger</title>, in which students read
                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, E. T. A. Hoffmann’s <title level="m">The
                    Sandman</title> (<title level="m"><foreign xml:lang="de">Der Sandmann</foreign></title>, 
                1817), and a play about another ambitious scientist:
                Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s Heinrich Faust, the main protagonist in <title level="m">Faust</title> 
                (1808/1832). This ambitious curriculum frames Romanticism as an international endeavor 
                with interlocking themes and shared issues, such as human rights.</p>
            <p>Yet to what extent can the literature of Romanticism become global in scope and
                chronology, and still remain a coherent field of study? <title level="a">Taking a Step, Learning
                    from Below, and Imagining Plantetarity in Romanticism: On <title level="m">Poems
                    for the Millennium Volume 3</title></title> by Marques Redd poses this intriguing
                question, and provides answers by reflecting on a teaching experiment that creates
                “a truly global Romanticism course” by surveying poems originally written in
                Bengali, Chinese, Danish, English, Farsi, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian,
                Italian, Japanese, Polish, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. The essay provides a
                refreshingly candid account of Redd’s experiences teaching a reading-intensive
                course titled <title level="a">Introduction to Global Romanticisms.</title> The 
                wide-ranging anthology of poetry edited by Jerome Rothenberg and Jeffrey C. Robinson 
                in 2009, the third volume of <title level="m">Poems for the Millennium</title>, serves 
                as the basis for this exploration of what a course about Romantic literature can entail. 
                Rothenberg and Robinson organize their volume into three parts: traditional Romanticism, what 
                the editors call post-Romantic poetry, and the modern era. Some readers find this
                approach provocative; in his review of the book, Donald Mackenzie labels it
                “anthology-as-manifesto” (107). According to <title level="a">Taking a Step,</title> the editors 
                make a case for viewing Romanticism as “an artistic movement that leads directly to the
                work of Ezra Pound.” Yet Redd also looks critically at the anthology, applying some
                of Harold Bloom’s criteria for what makes canonical literature great to the
                selection of course readings. This narrative offers readers ways to think about how
                to turn teaching challenges into opportunities for learning.</p>
            <p>The last three essays in this volume share an interest in questions of empathy,
                communication, and cultural history in Western and non-Western contexts. 
                <title level="a">Teaching Romantic India</title> by Zak Sitter offers another discussion that 
                shows the pedagogical value of foregrounding global exchanges in the classroom. Sitter presents 
                two approaches to incorporating literature pertaining to India in the Romantic period:
                as a unit in a Romantic-era survey of British literature and its global influence,
                and as an advanced seminar on Anglophone Indian literature from the eighteenth
                century to the present titled “English in India/India in English.” Both courses
                embrace Harish Trivedi’s view of colonial discourse as a series of “transactions”
                (1). Both courses could be said to apply Trivedi’s transactional pedagogy by pairing
                texts written by British and Indian authors and asking students to articulate their
                similarities and differences. In the Romantic survey, for example, students read the
                nationalist poetry of Robert Burns alongside that of the Bengali poet, Henry Derozio
                (1809–31), author of <title level="a">The Harp of India</title> (1827–31), a poem that also 
                invites comparisons to Shelley’s poem <title level="a">Ozymandias</title> (1818). In the 
                upper-level seminar, Romantic-era texts include a novel, <title level="m">Hartly House, 
                    Calcutta</title> (1789) by Phebe Gibbes (d. 1805), and a travel narrative, 
                    <title level="m">The Travels of Dean Mahomet</title> (1794) by Dean Mahomet (c. 1759–1851), 
                who also established London’s first Indian curry house. These fascinating texts offer
                opportunities for students to compare genres, on the one hand, and the authors’
                cosmopolitan identities, on the other. The essay concludes with suggested approaches
                to teaching Sydney Owenson’s novel <title level="m">The Missionary: An Indian
                    Tale</title> (1811).</p>
            <p>The final two essays offer two different approaches to teaching Transatlantic
                Romanticism, the pedagogy of which already has some presence online;<note place="foot"

                ways in which Romantic-era literature creates a space for readers to empathize with social justice 
                issues across the world. <title level="m">Translating Revolution into Spanish: British Romanticism 
                    and the Spanish-Speaking World</title> shares what the author, Juan Sanchez, calls 
                “transoceanic perspectives” on the pamphlet wars of the 1790s, abolitionist literature of the 
                eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and fiction and nonfiction about the era’s independence 
                movements. By teaching <title level="m">The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah
                    Equiano</title> (1789) alongside historical texts focused on independence movements
                in Jamaica, Haiti, and South America, faculty can offer students an example of Homi
                K. Bhabha’s concept of colonial mimicry. The essay also elaborates approaches to
                teaching two texts by women writers—Hannah More’s <title level="a">Slavery, A Poem</title> 
                (1788) and Leonora Sansay’s <title level="m">Secret History; or, The Horrors of St.
                    Domingo</title> (1808). Sanchez explicitly addresses Simpson’s argument about
                poetry and translation (see above), and provides an original translation of Simon
                Bolívar’s <title level="a">Jamaica Letter</title> (<title level="a">Carta de 
                    Jamaica,</title> 1815). Engaging with this text alongside Edmund Burke’s 
                <title level="m">Reflections on the Revolution in France</title> (1790), Thomas Paine’s 
                <title level="m">The Rights of Man</title> (1791), and Mary Wollstonecraft’s 
                <title level="m">Vindications of the Rights of Woman</title> (1792) reminds students of the 
                limits, possibilities, cultural nuances, and linguistic diversity of the human rights discourse 
                around 1800. Thus, Sanchez makes a compelling case for bringing canonical British authors 
                like Burke and Wollstonecraft into conversation with the authors of independence movements 
                in the Southern Hemisphere, especially because doing so uncovers links not only between
                nations, but also links between the past and a present that is still often
                characterized by cultural amnesia regarding the history of slavery and enslaved
                peoples.</p>
            <p><title level="m">Teaching Global Romanticism</title> concludes with a multimodal
                teaching demonstration of a course on <title level="a">Black Atlantic 
                    Romanticisms.</title> The essay <title level="a">#BlackLivesMatter: The Black Atlantic 
                        Matters</title> by Joel Pace discusses American literature in the context of the 
                transatlantic slave trade, one of the major global networks of the eighteenth century. 
                Pace shares ideas for teaching Phillis Wheatley’s poem <title level="a">On Being Brought from 
                    Africa to America</title> (1773) in conjunction with the Black Lives Matter movement on 
                Twitter, and draws on W. E. B. Du Bois’s notion of double consciousness to introduce students 
                to the “double-voicedness” of Wheatley’s poem. This approach is applied in ways that 
                emphasize the visual and aural aspects of poetry. One method involves comparing the “mind maps” 
                generated by the online content company Credo Reference. The essay also provides ingenious
                techniques for helping students appreciate Wheatley’s own “map to salvation”;
                students learn scansion by exploring syncopation in musical traditions from the
                African diaspora. Globalism, in “<title level="a">#BlackLivesMatter,</title> indicates 
                communication, lack of communication, and hidden communications about a legacy of 
                discrimination.</p>
            <p>In rethinking the scope of Romantic-era literature, the six essays that form this
                volume on Teaching Global Romanticism invent new pedagogies. It is our hope that
                this volume will help instructors imagine approaches to expanding the borders of
                Romanticism beyond Britain and America, even when the texts themselves remain from
                those countries or in the English language. Bringing Anglophone Romanticism into
                conversation with writers from Continental Europe, Haiti, South America, or India
                deepens appreciation for the 1820s and 1830s, decades that have sometimes been
                neglected in the field, and revitalizes instructors’ appreciation for Romanticism
                and its unique perspective on the human condition. Collectively these essays
                demonstrate that the best way to teach Romanticism as a global body of literature is
                to expand the limits of our own knowledge as scholars.</p>
