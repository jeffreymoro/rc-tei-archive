                  <head>Introduction: Teaching Romanticism in a Global Age</head>
                  <p>What does it mean to teach Romanticism in a global age? In the eighteenth century,
                global signified “having a spherical form”; the association of global with “relating
                to, or involving the whole world” arose in the mid-nineteenth century (“Global”).
                The term global, however, is not synonymous with <emph>globalization</emph>, as 
                Felicity Nussbaum notes in the introduction to her
                edited collection, <title level="m">The Global Eighteenth Century</title> (2003; 4).
                In the twenty-first century, the term globalization refers to the patterns and
                processes by which technology allows people across the world to rapidly communicate
                and trade goods and ideas, and <emph>global</emph> has come to signify the
                interconnectedness of peoples and the world they share. The essays collected here
                suggest that teaching Romanticism in a global age invites flexibility and
                imagination in the modalities instructors employ and in the texts that they select
                to make a curriculum. Collectively, the essays in this volume define global
                Romanticism as an intersection of world literatures; they present varied approaches
                to teaching Anglophone Romanticism in ways that acknowledge ties to other cultures,
                languages, and literatures through individual assignments, units, and syllabi.</p>
                  <p>This introductory chapter surveys the debate over the shifting meanings of the term
                global in the last two decades among literary scholars and pedagogues in order to
                frame global Romanticism as a concept and field. The term global seems to imply an
                international angle; while the essays here address global themes, issues, and texts,
                they are focused on British and American literature and literature in translation.
                The pervasiveness of English has come to represent its status as a global language
                and its effect on other languages.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Minae 
                    Mizumura’s book, <title level="m">The Fall of Language in the Age of 
                        English</title> (2015).</note>
                Critics from outside the English-speaking world cite the dominance of the English
                language and Anglo-American culture as party to the spread of <emph>globalization</emph>, 
                a word that seems to imply Anglo-centrism. In a 1999
                lecture for UNESCO, <title level="a">Globalisation, Peace, and Cosmopolitanism,</title> 
                Jacques Derrida distinguishes between the French term <foreign xml:lang="fr">mondialisation</foreign> 
                and the similar English and German terms globalization and <foreign xml:lang="de">
                    Globalisierung</foreign>. Whereas mondialisation, for Derrida, denotes the process
                of the world in formation, the finality and ostensible universality of the English term 
                globalization disguises the power imbalances of the “<emph>homo-hegemonizations</emph>” 
                enacted by “the Anglo-American hegemony” and its concomitant governmental and 
                nongovernmental institutions (373).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For an

                            its translator, Francois Raffoul, substitutes “world-forming” for the
                            term <foreign xml:lang="fr">mondialisation</foreign> (44).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Evidence supports Derrida’s argument that Anglo-American language and culture do in
                fact dominate the discourses of globalism and globalization. In <title level="m">
                    English as a Global Language</title> (1997/2003), David Crystal notes that English
                has replaced French “as the chief foreign language in schools in Algeria (a former
                French colony)” (5). More recently, Rwanda changed the language of its education
                system from French to English in order to better access the global economy,
                according to officials (McGreal). The majority of scholarly debates about
                globalization appear to take place in English as well. In the 
                essay <title level="a">A Bibliometric Research Analysis of 20 Years of Globalization 
                    Research: 1990–2009,</title> Xinjian Liu and
                his collaborators examine the search term “globali*” across multiple databases and
                libraries and find that nearly 93% of the journal articles are written in English
                (Liu et al. 197), many of them in the mid-1990s, during the rise of the internet,
                the practice of outsourcing, and the expansion of the European Union (Liu et al.
                198). These findings are perhaps not surprising given that the authors limit their
                search to the term “globali,” which would pick up the Spanish 
                word, <foreign xml:lang="es">globalización</foreign>, but neither 
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">mondialisation</foreign> nor the term in many other languages. 
                The same study found that “the volume of books on globalization peaked around 2002 and 
                declined afterwards” (Liu et al. 198). While many of these publications belong to the social
                sciences, in the field of literary studies, a similar pattern appears. Many scholars
                published special volumes on literature and globalization around the turn of the
                    millennium.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Many literary genres illustrate 
                        “evidence of cultural migrations,” as Giles Gunn remarks in his introductory essay 
                        to a special issue of <title level="j">PMLA</title> on <title level="a">Globalizing
                            Literary Studies</title> in 2001 (17). That same year, the
                            <title level="j">South Atlantic Quarterly</title> published
                            a special issue on the same theme. The guest editors note that literary
                            scholars are uniquely situated to comment on the “numerous discourses or
                            ‘fictions’ of globalization” (O’Brien and Szeman 604). Around this time,
                            in 2005, Suzanne Berger offered a Political Science course at MIT on
                            Globalization that is now available online via

                The essays in this volume offer practical applications of projects such as these for
                the teaching of Romantic-era texts.</p>
                  <p>Scholarly reflection on globalization in the mid-aughts took the form, in the study
                of Romanticism, of work on cosmopolitanism. While most of the examples of
                “cosmopolitan” cited in the <title level="m">OED</title> stem from the 1840s or
                afterwards, the word reflects growing identification with the culture of the
                metropolis, or as Jon Klancher puts it, “London as Cosmopolis” (65). Romantic
                Cosmopolitanism was the theme of the 2004 annual meeting of the North American
                Society for the Study of Romanticism (NASSR). That conference took place the year
                after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, and David Simpson prefaced his talk with the remark
                that “in 2003 precisely 18 students graduated from US universities with advanced
                degrees in Arabic (apparently up from 6 in 2002)” (142). Published in a special
                volume in <title level="j">The European Romantic Review</title> in 2005, the essay
                version of this talk, <title level="a">The Limits of Cosmopolitanism and the Case for 
                    Translation,</title> poses two important questions about translation and “human feeling”:
            <quote>The question for both is the same: can what is written in one language make sense in
                another; can what is felt by one person be the same as what is felt by someone from
                a different place or time? For poetry, which was and is often the site where feeling
                is held to matter most, where we might expect to recognize that “we have all of us
                one human heart,” each question is a version of the other (Simpson 146).</quote>
               The suggestion here, that poetry—the work of translation, and understanding others’
                feelings require the subject to bridge the gap between self and other—is helpful for
                understanding a pedagogy that aims to teach global awareness. The essays in this
                volume attest beautifully to the idea that teaching literature helps to cultivate
                awareness of others, or empathy.</p>
                  <p>Empathy plays a key role in Martha Nussbaum’s argument about what it means to learn,
                teach, and work in a global age. In her book <title level="m">Not for Profit: Why
                    Democracy Needs the Humanities</title> (2016), Nussbaum refers several times to
                what she calls “world citizenship” (89) and at other times “global citizens” (94);
                these are students who are prepared to address issues that humans face across
                national lines, including but not limited to “global warming; decent trade
                regulations; the protection of the environment and animal species; the future of
                nuclear energy and the dangers of nuclear weapons; the movement of labor and the
                establishment of decent labor standards; the protection of children from
                trafficking, sexual abuse, and forced labor” (80). Nussbaum advocates an
                interdisciplinary curriculum that combines the study of the arts and humanities
                “alongside the study of religion and of philosophical theories of justice” (94).
                This course of study aims to cultivate what Nussbaum calls “students’ ‘inner eyes’”
                in order to instill the ability to connect and communicate across barriers that
                traditionally divide humans from each other and the issues that they want to solve
                (Nussbaum 108). While Nussbaum, like Simpson, specifically mentions poetry as a tool
                for teaching empathy, as the essays in this volume illustrate, even nonpoetic texts
                from the Romantic era appear well suited for curricula with these learning goals, in
                part because writers from the period raise issues about social justice.</p>
                  <p>The Romantic period also plays an important role in the larger historical process of
                globalization. According to Roland Robertson, the Romantic era occurs during the
                second of five such phases. Robertson names this “The Incipient Phase,” and
                describes it as:

               As the essays in this volume highlight, global Romanticism at once participates in
                this trend and critiques it. For example, although scholars tend to cite the
                idealized world view of Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) as part of the trend
                toward nationalism that Robertson describes,<note place="foot" resp="editors">Richard

                attempt to synthesize a global ethos for Romanticism.</p>
                  <p>Romanticists have long understood that making sense of trends is as important for our
                own era as it is for scholars of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In the
                lead-up to the 2003 war in Iraq, for example, writers debated the ideological legacy
                of Romanticism in regards to globalization and imperialism. Consider George P.
                Fletcher’s book, <title level="m">Romantics at War: Glory and Guilt in the Age of
                    Terrorism</title> (2002). Fletcher takes as his premise the idea that Romantic
                notions of “authenticity” pervade international law and complicate the arbitration
                of extranational crimes such as terrorism (140). Critics have pointed out that
                Fletcher uses a reductive definition of Romanticism (based largely on Isaiah Berlin)
                and that he fails to acknowledge that many eras besides the eighteenth and
                nineteenth centuries teach “in one form or another that the individual’s good is
                intelligible only against the backdrop of the collective good” (Berkowitz 32). In a
                more nuanced vein, Gayatri Spivak’s <title level="m">An Aesthetic Education in the
                    Era of Globalization</title> (2012) asserts Romanticism’s “ability to imagine the
                other side as another human being, rather than simply an enemy to be psyched out,
                which is [the period’s] . . . greatest gift” (Spivak 483). Like Simpson and
                Nussbaum, Spivak emphasizes the power of Romantic literature to evoke empathy in
                readers.</p>
                  <p>In the years since the official end of the war in Iraq, scholarship on Romanticism
                and the global has largely explored the scientific, economic implications of
                international trade, travel, and communications. Evan Gottlieb’s book, 
                <title level="m">Romantic Globalism: British Literature and Modern World Order,
                    1750–1830</title> (2014), makes a strong case for British writers’ awareness of
                “the global processes and dynamics that were increasingly reshaping their lives,
                their nation, and the world” (2). His coedited collection, <title level="m">Global
                    Romanticism: Origins, Orientations, and Engagements, 1760–1820</title> (2015),
                demonstrates even more diverse views on the subject, with essays on the early
                networks of empire and communication. Gottlieb’s focus on what he terms 
                <emph>globalism</emph> offers a model for future scholarship that seeks to
                integrate the texts and contexts of Romanticism into discussions of globalization in
                a way that acknowledges the need to explore and entertain different angles of such a
                broad and diverse subject. </p>
                  <p>The essays in this volume provide concrete methods of putting recent scholarship on
                Romanticism and the global into action in the classroom. The opening essay by Eric
                Gidal, <title level="a">Teaching Global Romanticisms: Romanticism and the Logic 
                    of Culture,</title> illustrates the ways in which assigning texts with 
                international impact on the movement of Romanticism across Britain and Europe can 
                cultivate a deeper understanding of Romantic writers’ influence on modern culture. Gidal 
                employs William Ray’s model for studying culture in his book <title level="m">The Logic of
                    Culture: Authority and Identity in the Modern Age</title> (2001) in order to
                present a theoretical model, historical background, and institutional framework for
                analyzing the tensions between individual aesthetic experiences and the pressures of
                national traditions. The course that Gidal describes, <title level="a">Literature 
                and Culture of the Romantic Period: The Logic of Culture,</title> incorporates British, 
                French, and German texts. Selections include but are not limited to fictional texts 
                such as Rousseau’s <title level="m">Julie, or the New Heloise </title>(<title level="m">

                (1819/20), <title level="m">Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</title> (1812–18), and 
                <title level="m">The Poems of Ossian</title> (1765). The
                course carefully considers Ossian’s critical reception, thus enabling “students to
                perceive the tension between aestheticism and historicism in Romantic discourse, as
                well as the political and cultural agendas served by various positions.” Gidal
                emphasizes student-centered learning throughout his essay in a fashion that
                underscores the potential for this material to help students see, witness, perceive,
                and explore what the author calls the logic of culture.</p>
                  <p>Like the chapter that precedes it, my essay, <title level="a">European Romanticism 
                and <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>: A Comparative Literature Course for 
                English Majors,</title> reaches beyond the Anglophone canon. The purpose of this 
                exploration, however, is to deepen students’ appreciation for a single canonical 
                British text, Mary Shelley’s novel <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> (1818), by 
                reading the global texts that influenced it. <title level="a">European Romanticism</title> 
                discusses the pedagogical purpose behind the course, designed for English majors, many of 
                whom plan to teach in a U.S. classroom someday. The course begins with the French 
                Revolution in order to orient students to one of the key historical benchmarks of the Romantic 
                timeline. However, some of the reading, notably Rousseau’s 
                <title level="m">Confessions</title> (the 1782 text that Shelley
                read), predates the French Revolution, in order to better understand the function of
                sensibility and parenting in <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. Moreover, the
                first unit covers German and French Romantic poetry, some of which was inspired by
                British and German Romanticism, and thus postdates 1830. The course includes at
                least one of the texts that the creature in <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>
                finds in the forest, <title level="m">The Sufferings of Young Werther</title> (the
                modern translation of <title level="m">
                        <foreign xml:lang="de">Die Leiden des jungen 
                    Werthers</foreign>
                     </title> that comes closer to the original German than 
                <title level="m">The Sorrows of Young Werther</title>). Along with French and German 
                poetry, this novel lays the foundation for students to learn the concept of Romantic irony, 
                which John Fetzer describes as a “bifocal or double vision” (21). Engaging with Romantic 
                irony helps students to better appreciate the ambivalence and contradiction of the second unit,
                    <title level="a">Frankenstein and his Doppelgänger</title>, in which students read
                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, E. T. A. Hoffmann’s <title level="m">The
                    Sandman</title> (<title level="m">
                        <foreign xml:lang="de">Der Sandmann</foreign>
                     </title>, 
                1817), and a play about another ambitious scientist:
                Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s Heinrich Faust, the main protagonist in <title level="m">Faust</title> 
                (1808/1832). This ambitious curriculum frames Romanticism as an international endeavor 
                with interlocking themes and shared issues, such as human rights.</p>
                  <p>Yet to what extent can the literature of Romanticism become global in scope and
                chronology, and still remain a coherent field of study? <title level="a">Taking a Step, Learning
                    from Below, and Imagining Plantetarity in Romanticism: On <title level="m">Poems
                    for the Millennium Volume 3</title>
                     </title> by Marques Redd poses this intriguing
                question, and provides answers by reflecting on a teaching experiment that creates
                “a truly global Romanticism course” by surveying poems originally written in
                Bengali, Chinese, Danish, English, Farsi, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian,
                Italian, Japanese, Polish, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. The essay provides a
                refreshingly candid account of Redd’s experiences teaching a reading-intensive
                course titled <title level="a">Introduction to Global Romanticisms.</title> The 
                wide-ranging anthology of poetry edited by Jerome Rothenberg and Jeffrey C. Robinson 
                in 2009, the third volume of <title level="m">Poems for the Millennium</title>, serves 
                as the basis for this exploration of what a course about Romantic literature can entail. 
                Rothenberg and Robinson organize their volume into three parts: traditional Romanticism, what 
                the editors call post-Romantic poetry, and the modern era. Some readers find this
                approach provocative; in his review of the book, Donald Mackenzie labels it
                “anthology-as-manifesto” (107). According to <title level="a">Taking a Step,</title> the editors 
                make a case for viewing Romanticism as “an artistic movement that leads directly to the
                work of Ezra Pound.” Yet Redd also looks critically at the anthology, applying some
                of Harold Bloom’s criteria for what makes canonical literature great to the
                selection of course readings. This narrative offers readers ways to think about how
                to turn teaching challenges into opportunities for learning.</p>
                  <p>The last three essays in this volume share an interest in questions of empathy,
                communication, and cultural history in Western and non-Western contexts. 
                <title level="a">Teaching Romantic India</title> by Zak Sitter offers another discussion that 
                shows the pedagogical value of foregrounding global exchanges in the classroom. Sitter presents 
                two approaches to incorporating literature pertaining to India in the Romantic period:
                as a unit in a Romantic-era survey of British literature and its global influence,
                and as an advanced seminar on Anglophone Indian literature from the eighteenth
                century to the present titled “English in India/India in English.” Both courses
                embrace Harish Trivedi’s view of colonial discourse as a series of “transactions”
                (1). Both courses could be said to apply Trivedi’s transactional pedagogy by pairing
                texts written by British and Indian authors and asking students to articulate their
                similarities and differences. In the Romantic survey, for example, students read the
                nationalist poetry of Robert Burns alongside that of the Bengali poet, Henry Derozio
                (1809–31), author of <title level="a">The Harp of India</title> (1827–31), a poem that also 
                invites comparisons to Shelley’s poem <title level="a">Ozymandias</title> (1818). In the 
                upper-level seminar, Romantic-era texts include a novel, <title level="m">Hartly House, 
                    Calcutta</title> (1789) by Phebe Gibbes (d. 1805), and a travel narrative, 
                    <title level="m">The Travels of Dean Mahomet</title> (1794) by Dean Mahomet (c. 1759–1851), 
                who also established London’s first Indian curry house. These fascinating texts offer
                opportunities for students to compare genres, on the one hand, and the authors’
                cosmopolitan identities, on the other. The essay concludes with suggested approaches
                to teaching Sydney Owenson’s novel <title level="m">The Missionary: An Indian
                    Tale</title> (1811).</p>
                  <p>The final two essays offer two different approaches to teaching Transatlantic
                Romanticism, the pedagogy of which already has some presence online;<note place="foot" resp="editors">Scholars led by Linda Hughes and Sarah R. Robbins at Texas Christian University

                ways in which Romantic-era literature creates a space for readers to empathize with social justice 
                issues across the world. <title level="m">Translating Revolution into Spanish: British Romanticism 
                    and the Spanish-Speaking World</title> shares what the author, Juan Sanchez, calls 
                “transoceanic perspectives” on the pamphlet wars of the 1790s, abolitionist literature of the 
                eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and fiction and nonfiction about the era’s independence 
                movements. By teaching <title level="m">The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah
                    Equiano</title> (1789) alongside historical texts focused on independence movements
                in Jamaica, Haiti, and South America, faculty can offer students an example of Homi
                K. Bhabha’s concept of colonial mimicry. The essay also elaborates approaches to
                teaching two texts by women writers—Hannah More’s <title level="a">Slavery, A Poem</title> 
                (1788) and Leonora Sansay’s <title level="m">Secret History; or, The Horrors of St.
                    Domingo</title> (1808). Sanchez explicitly addresses Simpson’s argument about
                poetry and translation (see above), and provides an original translation of Simon
                Bolívar’s <title level="a">Jamaica Letter</title> (<title level="a">Carta de 
                    Jamaica,</title> 1815). Engaging with this text alongside Edmund Burke’s 
                <title level="m">Reflections on the Revolution in France</title> (1790), Thomas Paine’s 
                <title level="m">The Rights of Man</title> (1791), and Mary Wollstonecraft’s 
                <title level="m">Vindications of the Rights of Woman</title> (1792) reminds students of the 
                limits, possibilities, cultural nuances, and linguistic diversity of the human rights discourse 
                around 1800. Thus, Sanchez makes a compelling case for bringing canonical British authors 
                like Burke and Wollstonecraft into conversation with the authors of independence movements 
                in the Southern Hemisphere, especially because doing so uncovers links not only between
                nations, but also links between the past and a present that is still often
                characterized by cultural amnesia regarding the history of slavery and enslaved
                peoples.</p>

                     <title level="m">Teaching Global Romanticism</title> concludes with a multimodal
                teaching demonstration of a course on <title level="a">Black Atlantic 
                    Romanticisms.</title> The essay <title level="a">#BlackLivesMatter: The Black Atlantic 
                        Matters</title> by Joel Pace discusses American literature in the context of the 
                transatlantic slave trade, one of the major global networks of the eighteenth century. 
                Pace shares ideas for teaching Phillis Wheatley’s poem <title level="a">On Being Brought from 
                    Africa to America</title> (1773) in conjunction with the Black Lives Matter movement on 
                Twitter, and draws on W. E. B. Du Bois’s notion of double consciousness to introduce students 
                to the “double-voicedness” of Wheatley’s poem. This approach is applied in ways that 
                emphasize the visual and aural aspects of poetry. One method involves comparing the “mind maps” 
                generated by the online content company Credo Reference. The essay also provides ingenious
                techniques for helping students appreciate Wheatley’s own “map to salvation”;
                students learn scansion by exploring syncopation in musical traditions from the
                African diaspora. Globalism, in “<title level="a">#BlackLivesMatter,</title> indicates 
                communication, lack of communication, and hidden communications about a legacy of 
                discrimination.</p>
                  <p>In rethinking the scope of Romantic-era literature, the six essays that form this
                volume on Teaching Global Romanticism invent new pedagogies. It is our hope that
                this volume will help instructors imagine approaches to expanding the borders of
                Romanticism beyond Britain and America, even when the texts themselves remain from
                those countries or in the English language. Bringing Anglophone Romanticism into
                conversation with writers from Continental Europe, Haiti, South America, or India
                deepens appreciation for the 1820s and 1830s, decades that have sometimes been
                neglected in the field, and revitalizes instructors’ appreciation for Romanticism
                and its unique perspective on the human condition. Collectively these essays
                demonstrate that the best way to teach Romanticism as a global body of literature is
                to expand the limits of our own knowledge as scholars.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This article argues that India occupies a central position in Romantic 
                    literature, and that this centrality requires teachers of this period to engage with India 
                    as both a site of cultural production and an object of imaginative fascination. It offers 
                    teachers of Romantic literature a pedagogical framework and three specific case studies to 
                    illustrate approaches to Romantic India across a range of courses. In the first case study, I 
                    suggest how a narrowly focused seminar could pair texts produced by British and South Asian 
                    writers—representatives of the “Anglo-Indian” and “Indo-Anglian” discourse communities, 
                    respectively—to help students grasp how the writing and experience of British and Indian 
                    subjects of the early Indian empire was at once intermingled and strictly segregated. The 
                    second case study considers how a period survey might incorporate a brief unit on Romantic India 
                    that nonetheless treats India as an integral part of the literature of the period. I suggest 
                    pairing some of Robert Burns’s short lyrics with poems by Henry Derozio, who engages analogous 
                    themes of nationalism and poetic vision in the Indian context. Reading Burns and Derozio together, 
                    I suggest, can help students see how literary dialects of English could serve as powerful but 
                    problematic tools of identity-formation and social mobility in both the colonial and domestic 
                    contexts. In the final case study, I examine the possibilities of teaching a longer work, Sydney 
                    Owenson’s <title level="m">The Missionary</title>. I show how Owenson’s novel offers rich 
                    opportunities to engage students with key elements of Britain’s colonial history in India while 
                    simultaneously illustrating many of the formal tensions that characterized the novel in this period.

                    or all of the territories now generally identified as “South Asia”: principally 
                    the nations of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka; and, to a lesser extent, 
                    Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan, and the Maldives.</note> brought with it the baggage of 
                centuries of European fascination with the exotic Orient; in this guise, the subcontinent 
                was merely one part of a vast and relatively undifferentiated mass stretching from North 
                Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean to the shores of China and Japan. At the same time,
                however, Britain’s deepening involvement with India in an economic, cultural, and
                “boots-on-the-ground” capacity helped to specify the subcontinent in the British
                imagination. Britons both at home and abroad began to write with a newly intimate
                and empirical (though not necessarily more accurate) knowledge of the people and
                places of South Asia. And in India itself, the growing influence of the British
                meant that Indian subjects of the (as yet informal) empire increasingly turned to
                English as a medium of communication, advocacy, and expression. Indeed, Gauri
                Viswanathan makes a strong case in <title level="m">Masks of Conquest</title> that the 
                discipline of English itself originated in the schools and colleges administered by the 
                East India Company in the 1820s and 1830s. Thus, if students of Romantic-era Britain are 
                to understand the literature, culture, and politics of the period, they must become to
                some extent students of the India of that era as well; they will need to grasp at
                least the outlines of the relationship that would so crucially mold the literatures
                and histories of both nations—and the development of literature in English around
                the world—in the centuries to follow.</p>
                  <p>To that end, this article suggests some general pedagogical principles, as well as a
                few specific texts and classroom approaches, for the teaching of Romantic India. It
                does so according to the model advocated by Harish Trivedi, among others, which
                views colonial discourse as a series of “transactions”: “an interactive, dialogic,
                two-way process rather than as a simple active-passive one” (Trivedi 1). While
                Trivedi’s model could lend itself to underemphasizing the inequalities that underlie
                these literary-cultural transactions, I will argue that this danger is not disabling
                and that a transactional approach can acknowledge the agency of colonized writers
                without effacing the context of oppression. The single greatest strength of the
                transactional approach, however, is that it breaks down the divisions, sometimes
                tacit, sometimes explicit, that have tended to creep up between British and Indian
                writing, and also between the canonical “literature” produced in Britain versus the
                texts of merely “historical” interest produced—by both British and Indian
                writers—“in the Empire.” By seeing the ways in which writers of different national
                and imperial identities used literature to respond to the opportunities and
                anxieties inspired by the colonial encounter, students can gain a much “thicker”
                sense of the world(s) of the Romantic era.</p>
                  <p>Because the endpoints of our period are so variable and contentious, Romanticists
                are well used to both problematizing and defending the notion of literary
                periodization. In India, “the Romantic period” is an even less coherent entity than
                in Britain, since the subcontinent, even the limited parts of it under British rule
                or influence, was subject to very different historical and cultural pressures than
                operated in Britain itself. To take just two examples: since France’s influence in
                India had atrophied almost completely in the wake of the British East India
                Company’s victories during the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763), the impact of the
                French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, so transformative in Britain and
                continental Europe, was muted on the subcontinent. Similarly, Britain’s ongoing
                industrialization, with the accompanying movements toward enclosure, urbanization,
                and labor unrest, was felt very differently in India, though the emerging
                globalization of the textile industry meant that these material pressures could be
                magnified or refracted unpredictably as well as attenuated by distance and 
                time.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Siraj Ahmed’s excellent

                In short, two of the markers of historical “context” most familiar to scholars and 
                teachers of British Romanticism are of limited value in illuminating the development 
                of colonial discourse in India. </p>
                  <p>Conveniently, however, the conventional endpoints of the Romantic period in the
                1780s and 1830s do contain events of considerable import to life in British India.
                The 1780s witnessed both William Jones’s founding of the Asiatick Society, which
                would produce much of the influential Orientalist scholarship of the next century
                (including the “Indo-European hypothesis” of a fundamental kinship between the
                languages of India and Europe), and the sensational impeachment trial of Warren
                Hastings, then governor-general of Bengal.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                atrocities, and militaristic overreach.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Extracts from

                    taught texts on the sublime and the French Revolution. Sara Suleri’s chapters on Burke in 
                    <title level="m">The Rhetoric of English India</title> remain the definitive readings 
                    of the connections between Burke’s aesthetic theory and his anti-Hastings rhetoric.</note> At 
                the other end of the Romantic period, the 1830s saw a decisive shift away from the engagement 
                with the languages and cultures of India that characterized the “Orientalist” era of
                Jones and Hastings. In its place developed the “Anglicist” program of acculturation
                famously codified in Thomas Babington Macaulay’s <title level="a">Minute on Indian Education</title> 
                of 1835 and implemented through the English Education Act of the same year.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Viswanathan offers an excellent summary of the Orientalist/Anglicist debate

                Macaulay’s call “to form a class of persons who may be interpreters between us and
                the millions whom we govern,—a class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but
                English in tastes, opinions, in morals and in intellect,” which did much to
                inaugurate the ambivalent legacy of English education and literature in India, can
                serve as a symbolic endpoint for the era of “Romantic India” (249).</p>
                  <p>Because curricular resources at most colleges and universities are too limited to
                devote an entire course to the topic of Romantic India, I will discuss approaches to
                teaching a unit on this topic in two different, more broadly focused, types of
                courses. The first is a survey of Romanticism that emphasizes the global reach of
                British literary as well as material interests in this period. The second is an
                upper-level seminar on Indian literature in English, which I have taught under the
                title <title level="a">English in India/India in English.</title> In this course, the Romantic 
                era is one episode in a longitudinal survey of literary transactions between Britain and South
                Asia running from the eighteenth century to the present. The remainder of this
                article is organized around three “case studies,” each presenting a text or pair of
                texts along with some teaching approaches. One caveat: my own experience with these
                texts has come in universities in the United States, a country whose own involvement
                in the complex relationship between Britain and India is, though real, at a
                considerable remove. Clearly, teaching these texts in other places would raise
                different issues and questions for instructors; however, inviting students to
                explore their own geographical and cultural location as they read, as well as those
                of the producers and consumers of these texts, can be an excellent starting point
                for discussion and collective interpretation. How, for example, might these texts
                and events mean differently for readers in Britain, or South Asia, or other former
                British colonies, than they do for readers in the United States? How did they unite
                or divide different audiences in their own time?</p>

                  <head>Case Study 1: Anglo-India vs. Indo-Anglia</head>
                  <p>One textual pairing I have used with some success in an upper-level seminar is
                between Phebe Gibbes’ 1789 novel <title level="m">Hartly House, Calcutta</title> and Dean
                Mahomet’s 1794 travel narrative <title level="m">The Travels of Dean Mahomet</title> (often 
                cited as the first published text by an Indian author), both of which are available in
                recent scholarly editions. I chose relatively short excerpts from the two texts near
                the beginning of my <title level="a">English in India/India in English</title> course to frame 
                two categories important to the history of Indian literature in English: “Anglo-India,”
                which in the nineteenth century described the transplanted society of Britons in
                India, and “Indo-Anglia,” a term that has gained traction in recent decades as a way
                of categorizing writing in English by Indian and diasporic authors.<note place="foot" resp="editors">“Anglo-Indian” has also been used, particularly since the early
                            twentieth century, to describe people of mixed British and Indian
                            ancestry. Although this might cause some confusion, nineteenth-century
                            texts are fairly consistent in limiting the use of the term to Britons
                            living abroad in India. The term “Indo-Anglian” was in at least modest
                            circulation as far back as 1883, when a slim collection of specimens of
                            Indian writing in English titled <title level="m">Indo-Anglian
                                Literature</title> was published in Calcutta (Buck).</note> 
                Seeing these two discourse communities intersect at or near their points of origin
                helps students grasp how the writing and experience of British and Indian subjects
                of the early Indian empire could be at once intermingled and strictly segregated.
                Sophia Goldborne, the narrator of <title level="m">Hartly House, Calcutta</title>, is
                the daughter of an East India Company official who travels to Calcutta during the
                Hastings administration and writes letters recounting her experiences there to a
                friend back in England. Sophia’s experience of India is squarely one of Anglo-India,
                contained entirely within the British settlement at Calcutta and involving minimal
                contact with actual Indians. Nonetheless, even Anglo-India was exotic enough to
                Britons of the day that Sophia narrates her encounters with the company nabobs in
                the kind of ethnographic and loco-descriptive detail that characterized
                eighteenth-century encounters with geographical and cultural “others.” Dean Mahomet,
                in contrast, was a Bengali Muslim who joined the company’s army in 1769, serving as
                a soldier and subaltern officer until 1783, when he emigrated to Ireland. The 
                <title level="m">Travels</title>, written and published several years after Mahomet’s
                arrival in Britain but focusing only on his time in India, is also epistolary in
                form, addressed to an unnamed British “friend” and offering a mixture of
                autobiography and ethnography.</p>
                  <p>My students were quick to see many of the similarities between Gibbes’s and
                Mahomet’s texts—the epistolary form, for example, with its address to an audience at
                once immediate and displaced, and the sometimes awkwardly integrated conventions of
                the travel narrative and amateur ethnography. I found their responses to other
                aspects of these texts more varied and conflicting. Some were quite conscious, for
                example, of Mahomet’s somewhat ambivalent occupation of his position as native
                informant, at once a representative of and alienated from the people he describes.
                For example, when he offers an “account of the form of marriage among the
                Mahometans, which is generally solemnized with all the external show of Oriental
                pageantry,” both the phrase “the Mahometans” and the stereotyped reference to “the
                external show of Oriental pageantry” suggest an unhesitating identification with the
                perspective of the colonizer (65). As other students more sympathetic to Mahomet’s
                divided loyalties pointed out, however, this alienated perspective also has a
                certain cosmopolitan sophistication, and Mahomet often acts as an advocate, if
                sometimes a condescending one, for the civilizations and cultures of his native
                country. While Gibbes attempts a similar cosmopolitanism—such as when her narrator
                Sophia admonishes her correspondent that “all the prejudices you have so long
                cherished against [India] must be done away; and for this plain reason, that they
                are totally groundless”—some students were frustrated by the novel’s stubborn focus
                on the British settlements and the restriction of Indians’ roles to providing “local
                color” (3). These frustrations can be pedagogically useful, however; Sophia
                Goldborne’s limited horizon, for example, suggests the restricted mobility of the
                few British women in India in the early days of empire as well as the “invisibility”
                of many Indians in British accounts of this period. Dean Mahomet’s pioneering
                “Indo-Anglian” narrative, then, might be offered as a corrective to some of the
                omissions of the “Anglo-Indian” texts of the Romantic era.</p>

                  <head>Case Study 2: Comparative Romanticisms</head>
                  <p>In an introductory course on British Romanticism, it is especially important to
                build connections between writing from and about India and other topical clusters,
                so that students see “the India stuff” less as an isolated curiosity than as an
                integral part of the literature and history of the period. One way to do this is by
                emphasizing the points of commonality between colonial difference and other kinds of
                marginalization (e.g., geographical, class, gender, ethnic, linguistic) at work on
                the home front. Juxtaposing Robert Burns with the Bengali poet and reformer Henry
                Derozio, for example, can help students see how literary dialects of English could
                serve as powerful but problematic tools of identity-formation and social mobility in
                both the colonial and domestic contexts. Burns and Derozio make a fascinating
                combination because they and their poetry play to different prevailing myths about
                the figure of the Romantic poet: on the one hand, Burns, celebrated as the poet
                born, not made, whose untutored genius brought him brief glory before his inevitable
                decline. On the other, Derozio, who (like Keats) died extremely young; who (like
                Shelley) flirted with philosophical materialism and even atheism; and who (like
                Byron) adopted a rakish persona, flouted the social mores of polite society, and was
                surrounded by rumors of sexual scandal. While we often treat dispelling these
                “romantic” myths of authorship as a pedagogical duty, students are usually more
                receptive to a gradual complication of these reductive narratives than to a frontal
                assault; in the case of an unfamiliar and marginalized figure like Derozio,
                interesting them in the larger-than-life “character” may be a necessary first step
                toward engaging them with his writing.</p>
                  <p>Fortunately, Derozio, who could adopt the orientalist clichés of a Byron or a Moore
                in a poem like <title level="a">Song of the Hindustanee Minstrel</title> (“There’s many 
                a valued pearl / In richest Oman’s sea; / But none, my fair Cashmerian girl! / O! none 
                can rival thee [lines 5–8]), also produced poetry whose relation to both “East” and 
                “West” is more complex, such as the sonnet <title level="a">The Harp of India</title>:

                There are a number of resonances here that students in a Romanticism class might pick
                up on: in addition to the Aeolian harp figure in line 4, the “ruined monument on
                desert plain” either alludes to or indirectly evokes <title level="a">Ozymandias,</title> 
                raising the question of where Derozio might locate himself in that rumination on empire’s
                transience. Is the speaker here aligned with Shelley’s traveller, or with the
                “Oriental” civilizations whose ruins he contemplates? Students might also be curious
                about the poem’s formal oddness: the repeated rhyme in lines 4 and 5 subverts the
                quatrain pattern that underlies most English sonnets; its rhetorical turn comes at
                the precise middle, between lines 7 and 8, avoiding the sonnet’s characteristic
                asymmetry; and the closing couplet’s return to the “-ain” ending of lines 2, 4, 5,
                and 7 gives the poem’s aural texture an unfamiliar thickness. Students could be
                asked to find evidence to support or refute the proposition that these deviations
                are signs of resistance to British cultural authority—or, alternatively, of an
                incomplete assimilation of the sonnet’s conventions. </p>
                  <p>Although <title level="a">The Harp of India</title> is often described as a patriotic protest 
                against British rule, the ambiguity of its imagery, together with its adoption of European
                conventions (including, obviously, the medium of English), raises interpretive
                questions that can be neatly coupled with an examination of the poem’s form. Is
                Britain’s intervention presented as the cause of India’s long silence—or is it the
                clarion that will awaken her from slumber? Does the poem’s use of a canon of
                nationalist imagery borrowed directly from European sources undermine or enhance its
                nationalism? Conversely, do the echoes of the tradition of resistance from Britain’s
                Celtic fringe that Katie Trumpener has labeled “bardic” nationalism align India with
                other peoples subjected to British colonialism? Pairing <title level="a">The Harp of 
                    India</title> with one or more of Burns’s nationalist songs, such as 
                <title level="a">Caledonia</title> or <title level="a">Such a Parcel of
                Rogues in a Nation,</title> offers students a way to compare the participation of these 
                two very different poets in a literary tradition that both lauded and marginalized their
                efforts. The martial and strikingly defiant tone of a poem like 
                <title level="a">Caledonia,</title> which personifies Scotland as a warrior goddess 
                whose ferocity has taught “The Anglian lion, the terror of France” “to fear in his own 
                native wood” (lines 29, 32) stands in marked contrast to the mournful ambivalence 
                of Derozio’s poem. Similarly, the conditional mood of Derozio’s closing 
                pledge—“<emph>if</emph> thy notes divine / May be by mortal wakened once again, / Harp 
                of my country, let me strike the strain!”—differs starkly from the supreme confidence of 
                Burns’s assertion that “brave Caledonia immortal must be” (line 43). Do these differences 
                reflect a divergence in personal aesthetics or the differing conditions of the poets’ two
                subject nations? Would an Indian poem as defiant as Burns’s have found an
                audience—or even a publisher? Reading Derozio alongside Burns would allow students
                to explore and interrogate parallels between the Indian and the Scottish poets from
                multiple perspectives: poetic and political, textual and contextual.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Chapter 1 of Manu Samriti Chander’s recent <title level="m">Brown Romantics: 
                        Poetry and Nationalism in the Global Nineteenth Century</title> offers a deft 
                    and thoughtful reading of Derozio’s often subversive deployment of 
                    English poetic conventions to “Indocentric” ends.</note>

                  <head>Case Study 3: Teaching a Longer Work</head>
                  <p>Finally, I want to discuss some of the opportunities presented by teaching a longer
                text—in this case, Sydney Owenson’s 1811 novel <title level="m">The Missionary: An
                    Indian Tale</title>, now available in a fine critical edition from Broadview Press.
                While I have not had a chance to teach Owenson’s novel myself, I would like to
                present a case for the potential benefits of assigning it, most likely in an
                upper-level undergraduate or graduate course. Of course, a novel, even a relatively
                short one like <title level="m">The Missionary</title>, consumes a substantial chunk
                of course time; it is a significant advantage, then, to choose a text that can be
                brought into dialogue with more than one set of thematic and contextual concerns.
                Owenson’s novel meets this requirement nicely by mapping the colonial encounter in
                India onto both national (Irish) and gendered struggles for self-determination; in
                addition, it offers an opportunity to expose students to the Romantic novel beyond
                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> and Jane Austen. As an
                Irishwoman, Owenson was a subject of British rule in ways that both mirrored and
                sharply differed from the experience of colonized Indians, and <title level="m">The
                    Missionary</title> is a fascinating instance of the displacement of one set of
                imperial anxieties onto another. The novel is set in the 1630s, when Portugal was
                both a colonial power in India and a subject nation, under Spanish domination since
                1580—a position with obvious parallels to Ireland’s in the early nineteenth century.
                <title level="m">The Missionary</title> details the relationship between a
                Portuguese missionary, Hilarion, and a Brahmin priestess, Luxima, who is the object
                of his efforts—initially toward conversion, but soon toward romantic union in
                defiance of both his priestly vows and the caste prejudices of Hindu India. Their
                relationship bears considerable national-allegorical freight, and Owenson follows a
                popular tendency (to which her 1806 novel <title level="m">The Wild Irish Girl</title>
                had already contributed) to figure the conquering nation as male and the conquered
                as female. Still, however idealized and sacrificial she may seem at times, Luxima is
                a character of considerable agency and interest, whose resistance to colonial
                domination and the “priestcraft” of both Catholic and Hindu establishments clearly
                resonated with certain segments of the Romantic reading public: as Michael Franklin
                notes, Percy Shelley “recommend[ed] Owenson’s novel to friends with a proselytizing
                zeal” (167).</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">The Missionary</title> is also an excellent text for teaching the
                ways in which literature both is and isn’t about its ostensible subject. While Irish
                and protofeminist politics are central to the novel, and while British imperialism
                is displaced onto Portugal and Spain, <title level="m">The Missionary</title> remains
                firmly entrenched in the religious, ideological, and pragmatic concerns of early
                nineteenth-century imperial Britain. As Julia Wright’s excellent introduction to the
                Broadview edition points out, missionary activity in India was a particularly hot
                topic in the years between the Vellore Mutiny of 1806 (which many blamed on
                overzealous proselytizing) and the renewal of the East India Company’s charter in
                1813 (Owenson 40). Like many texts in this period, then,
                 <title level="m">The Missionary</title> was both a work of
                fiction and an implicit argument about the course of empire in India. Its use of
                India—particularly of the “India” that Orientalist scholarship had recently made
                available to Britons—is at once aesthetic and ideological. In a class focused on
                India, a useful comparison point might be Robert Southey’s <title level="m">The
                    Curse of Kehama</title> (1810), which argues implicitly (as Southey did explicitly
                in his periodical writing) for the necessity of British evangelism among the Hindus,
                whose faith he described as “of all false religions [. . .] the most monstrous in
                its fables, and the most fatal in its effects” (3). A juxtaposition between two such
                closely contemporary yet starkly contrasting texts can offer students a portal into
                the complex intertwining of aesthetics and ideology, representation and power, that
                characterized the literary transactions between Britain and its Indian
                “possessions.”</p>

                  <title level="a">Translating Revolution into Spanish: British Romanticism and the

                  <p>One of the most important developments in the study of British literature of
                        the long eighteenth century in the past two decades has been the renewed
                        focus on what Keith Hanley and Greg Kucich call the “global formations” of
                        British literary culture (73). The proliferation of studies in global
                        feminisms, cosmopolitan identities, travel writing, translation, and other
                        transnational encounters has created new critical perspectives for
                        reassessing early-nineteenth-century British literature as explicitly
                        international and global in its concerns rather than isolated and
                            insular.<note place="foot" resp="author">Since the 1997 special edition
                            of <title level="j">European Romantic Review</title> on <title level="a">British Romanticism: Global Crossings</title> (Fay), romantic-era
                            studies have experienced an explosion of critical work on the global
                            dimensions of romantic literature. For foundational work on British
                            romantic imperialism, see Makdisi, Fulford and Kitson, and Leask. For
                            work on romantic travel writing, global feminisms, and cosmopolitanisms,
                            see Mellor, Simpson, Wohlgemut, and Bohls and Duncan. In recent years,
                            investigations into the global contexts of British romanticism has moved
                            steadily away from the postcolonial frameworks of earlier studies toward
                            a broader understanding of romantic literature’s relationship to the
                            history of globalization. As Evan Gottlieb argues, “romantic globalism,”
                            Gottlieb’s term for the globalizing tendencies of romantic-era
                            literature, “took shape as an alternative to, rather than merely an
                            elaboration or anticipation of, imperialism” (10). For more on this
                            particular critical trend, see Annesley, Cooppan, Gupta, and Jay.</note>
                        Similarly, in early American studies, the work of Gretchen Murphy, Felipe
                        Fernandez-Armesto, James Dunkerly, and Anna Brickhouse, among others, has
                        been especially crucial to exploring the global dimensions of American
                        literature by resituating its study within a broader Hemispheric and
                        Pan-American perspective.<note place="foot" resp="author">For more on the
                            transnational trend in American literary scholarship, see Manning and
                            Taylor.</note> Both disciplines are thus increasingly guided by the
                        principles that national contexts alone can no longer provide the
                        explanatory framework for literary analysis they once did and that new
                        critical paradigms are needed if we are to more adequately investigate what
                        Paul Gilroy calls the “system of cultural exchanges” taking place across the
                        globe during the early nineteenth century (14).</p>
                  <p>Yet despite the new critical imperative to explore global dimensions of
                        romantic literature, the Spanish speaking world remains one of the most
                        understudied cultural geographies of the period.<note place="foot" resp="author">Notable exceptions include Diego Saglia’s <title level="m">Poetic Castles in Spain: British Romanticism and Figurations of
                                Iberia</title> (2001), Joselyn Almeida’s <title level="m">Reimagining the Transatlantic, 1780-1890</title> (2011), and
                            Rebecca Cole Heinowitz’s <title level="m">Spanish America and British
                                Romanticism, 1777-1826: Rewriting Conquest</title> (2010).</note>
                        Much of this neglect no doubt has much to do with the vast critical terrain
                        only recently opened to us by the study of romantic globalism. But to some
                        degree, we must also be aware of an English disciplinary resistance to all
                        things Spanish and, in Joselyn Almeida’s view, a dangerous assumption
                        underlying recent transatlantic critical practices, namely that the ideas,
                        texts, and political thought circulating within the Atlantic world occur
                        primarily between Britain and the US and are, as a consequence, conducted
                        primarily in English. The consequences of such critical practices—of,
                        among other things, continuing to think of the Americas in terms of North
                        America alone—is that we not only risk marginalizing Spanish speakers
                        as minor spectators on the world stage, but also risk confining
                        transatlantic studies, as Almeida has written, within safe linguistic and
                        disciplinary boundaries that ultimately work to reinscribe the disciplinary
                        structures that transatlantic studies has worked so hard to break
                            through.<note place="foot" resp="author">See the introduction to
                            Almeida.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Building on David Simpson’s argument for translation as a critical paradigm
                        within which romantic literature is encountered as an “estranged medium,”
                        this essay answers the call for greater attention to the Hispanic dimensions
                        of transatlantic studies by demonstrating some of the ways in which students
                        can explore the meaning of traditional romantic concepts about the
                        imagination, nature, and the rights of man, among others, from a ‘Spanish’
                        perspective (141). The objective of such reading practices is to open up the
                        interpretive possibilities for understanding romantic literary texts as not
                        only engaged with but also profoundly shaped by the ideas, cultures, and
                        peoples of Spain and Spanish America. In order to get from here to there, I
                        will briefly sketch in this essay the outlines of a course I teach on
                        transatlantic romanticism that I have designed to introduce the complex
                        issues related to the interconnectedness of Atlantic-rim cultures. Focusing
                        on the ways in which cultures, ideologies, and political identities are
                        reworked and reinscribed by the transatlantic movement of peoples, ideas,
                        and cultural artifacts, the course seeks to expand accepted notions of
                        romanticism (typically understood within exclusively British and US American
                        contexts) to include transoceanic perspectives that rethink romantic
                        literature as a global phenomenon. Given the limited space here, I will only
                        consider the shifting forms and languages of revolution as they make their
                        way from Britain to the Americas via the transatlantic slave trade. In order
                        to bring the analysis into sharper focus, I shift the discussion in the
                        final section of the essay from a consideration of historical to textual
                        translation, presenting my own English translation of a key passage from
                        Simon Bolívar’s <title level="a">Carta de Jamaica</title> as a case study
                        that highlights the limits and possibilities of linguistic interpretation as
                        a pedagogical tool that challenges students to rethink the meaning of
                        revolution within a Spanish American context.</p>
                  <p>One of the most important debates for exploring the historical context of
                        romantic-era literature remains the pamphlet wars of the 1790s in which
                        Edmund Burke’s <title level="m">Reflections on the Revolution in
                            France</title> and Thomas Paine’s <title level="m">The Rights of
                            Man</title> form the twin pillars of revolutionary and
                        counter-revolutionary thought of the period. Students typically have an
                        easier time with Paine initially, readily identifying with the language of
                        reason and natural rights, and often share Paine’s convictions about
                        liberty, equality, and inalienable rights. When properly understood as a
                        response to Burke’s arguments about the role of prejudice and prescription
                        in maintaining order in society, itself a response to Richard Price’s <title level="m">A Discourse on the Love of our Country</title>, students tend
                        to become even more convinced of the validity of Paine’s argument about “the
                        vanity and presumption of governing beyond the grave,” which Paine views as
                        “the most ridiculous and insolent of all tyrannies” (74). Teaching the
                        revolutionary debates thus more often than not involves mounting a vigorous
                        defense of Burke. I usually begin by pointing out that in the U.S., appeals
                        to a constitution written over two hundred years ago precisely define what
                        it means to govern beyond the grave. Students who defend constitutional
                        authority and legal precedence now find it difficult to support Paine’s
                        essentially anarchist argument that “the more perfect civilization is, the
                        less occasion has it for government,” a statement that assumes the
                        perfectibility of man and the power of human reason to bring it about (193).
                        After introducing a more nuanced discussion of political theory and the
                        revolutionary politics of the romantic period, I reintroduce Burke’s and
                        Paine’s arguments with a few select passages that yield new insights into
                        the nature of the debate in a way that allows students to reflect on the
                        Burkean and Paineite influences on their own political perspectives.</p>
                  <p>Discussion of the contribution of women to the revolutionary debate helps
                        prepare students for thinking about the complex ways in which the “regime of
                        truth,” as Michel Foucault calls it, is challenged and transformed by groups
                        and individuals excluded from the governing discourse (131). Mary
                        Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Vindications of the Rights of
                            Woman</title>, for example, makes the obvious point that the rights of
                        man did not necessarily also translate as the rights of woman. In addition
                        to outlining Wollstonecraft’s proto-feminist arguments about egalitarian
                        marriage, rational love, and other issues of gender inequality, I highlight
                        the rhetorical strategies through which she enacts her “imitation of manly
                        virtues” that become in and of themselves a form of political engagement
                            (110).<note place="foot" resp="author">Regarding the style of <title level="m">Vindication</title>, Wollstonecraft writes, “Animated by
                            this important object, I shall disdain to cull my phrases or polish my
                            style. I aim at being useful, and sincerity will render me unaffected;
                            for wishing rather to persuade by the force of my arguments than dazzle
                            by the elegance of my language, I shall not waste my time in rounding
                            periods, or in fabricating the turgid bombast of artificial feelings”
                            (112).</note> For in stripping her prose intentionally of the “soft
                        phrases” and “delicacy of sentiment” central to the rhetorical flourishes of
                        Burke’s political reflections on the revolution, Wollstonecraft creates a
                        metacommentary that exposes the reliance of Burke on what he himself defined
                        as the feminine aesthetic of the beautiful in order to, as Tom Furniss
                        argues, “remount a critique of the <emph>ancien régime</emph> . . . and turn
                        its aesthetic theory against the politics of <title level="m">Reflections</title>” (Wollstonecraft 111; Furniss 184). When <title level="m">Vindications</title> compares the condition of women to
                        slavery, Wollstonecraft further complicates the Revolution debate by
                        introducing an unwelcome discourse into the discussion of what it means for
                        all men to be equal. Without explicitly invoking the abolitionist movement
                        of which women were key players, Wollstonecraft thus alters the hermeneutic
                        context from which to interpret the principles of the French Revolution,
                        illustrating for students how seemingly straightforward arguments become
                        easily strained when ideas are placed in a context for which they were never
                        intended.</p>
                  <p>Having established the broad parameters of an essentially British perspective
                        on political revolution, our discussion naturally moves on to consider
                        romantic literature and the slave trade, a topic recently illuminated by the
                        work of Deirdre Coleman, Debbie Lee, and Paul Youngquist.<note place="foot" resp="author">See, for example, Coleman, Lee, and Youngquist and
                            Botkin.</note> Before discussing the diverse, overlapping, and sometimes
                        contradictory arguments for and against slavery during the romantic period,
                        I remind students of our shared conviction of the inhumanity of slavery in
                        order to focus our discussion more critically on how literature, as Edward
                        Said writes in <title level="m">Culture and Imperialism</title>, “allowed
                        decent men and women to accept the notion that distant territories and their
                        native peoples should be subjugated” (6). Again encouraging students to look
                        beyond the surface of argumentation, I point out that poems about the slave
                        trade often find themselves troubled by an awareness of the tension between
                        their ideals of universal emancipation and the imperial imperative of the
                        civilizing mission. Of the many abolitionist poems that could be cited,
                        Hannah More’s <title level="a">Slavery, A Poem</title> is one of the best in
                        illustrating the structural entanglements of much abolitionist writing.
                        Though she argues for the dignity of slaves as human beings, More, like many
                        of her contemporaries, cannot escape her racist assumptions or imperialist
                        attitudes. Africans, she argues, “have heads to think, and hearts to feel,”
                        but their souls act with “erring zeal” (More 67; 68). Like the British
                        radicals she curiously invokes at the beginning of the poem, Africans must
                        consequently be contained, their “wild vigour of a savage root” civilized by
                        Christianity (More 74). More difficult for students to discern, however, is
                        More’s anxiety about the implicit critique of empire that unintentionally
                        emerges as a result of her abolitionist arguments. Attempting to clarify her
                        intentions, the poet at one point asks, <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                           <l>Does thirst of empire, does desire of fame,</l>
                           <l>(For these are specious crimes,) our rage inflame?</l>
                           <l>No: sordid lust of gold their [slaves] fate controls,</l>

                        </lg>
                     </quote> More’s resistance to the idea that the “thirst for empire” is
                        inherently wrong and her attribution of the evil of slavery instead to
                        “sordid lust” allows her to champion the cause of emancipation without
                        upsetting the logic of empire. The parenthetical aside, however, at once
                        deflecting attention from the poem and yet integral to its meter, delays the
                        formulation of the poem’s central question, creating an uneasy tension
                        between the poet’s nervous interrogation and resolute reply. The emphatic
                        “no,” made more determined by the syntactical deductive colon separating the
                        monosyllabic answer from the more involved explanation that follows, not
                        only abruptly interrupts the iambic pentameter of the poem, but in doing so
                        calls attention unintentionally to the so-called “specious crimes” the poet
                        works very hard to deny. This passage in particular can thus help students
                        explore how language and form can express unspoken anxieties, or, in Fredric
                        Jameson’s terms, reveal the “political unconscious” (9).</p>
                  <p>No discussion of the cultural impact of the slave trade on romanticism is
                        complete without a reading of any number of the many slave narratives of the
                        period of which Helen Thomas’s <title level="m">Romanticism and Slave
                            Narratives: Transatlantic Testimonies</title> (2000) provides an
                        excellent selection. I continue, however, to remain partial to <title level="m">The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah
                            Equiano</title> because of the way in which it allows students to
                        discuss the complex process of what Homi Bhabha calls the “ambivalence of
                        mimicry” occurring at the intersection of the various discourses brought
                        together in what Angelo Contanzo describes as “a new genre of writing that
                        became known as the slave narrative” (129; 10). From its frontispiece and
                        opening address to the British Parliament to its narrative of spiritual
                        conversion and naval adventure stories, <title level="m">The Interesting
                            Narrative</title> establishes Equiano as a civilized, self-made man
                        whose natural inclinations toward masculine British values grant him the
                        authority to speak on the national stage from which he would normally be
                        excluded. Yet, Equiano’s anecdotal accounts as a free man of his persistent
                        mistreatment at the hands of British slave owners remind readers that he
                        will never be more than “almost an Englishman,” one who is free but not
                        free, “almost the same, <emph>but not quite</emph>” (Equiano 92; Bhabha
                        123). For some students, Equiano’s attempt to establish an authentic African
                        voice is compromised by a “stronger desire to resemble” his English masters,
                        resulting in an ambivalence over his own identity that he registers in the
                        title of his narrative (Equiano 93). The question of Equiano’s identity is
                        further complicated by notable passages revealing his participation in the
                        slave trade, his support of the British colonization of Africa, and the
                        still controversial arguments discounting his African birth. In order to
                        generate further discussion, however, I typically introduce a
                        counterargument that suggests that such ambivalence is intentional. By
                        engaging in a form of “self-invention,” as Vincent Carretta describes it,
                        Equiano not only displays what W. E. B. Du Bois calls double consciousness,
                        but also in the process returns the mobility of his identity back within his
                        control, which he formally expresses in the title as a choice he allows
                        readers to make in constructing their own meaning of his narrative in a way
                        that spotlights the artificiality of such constructions (6). <title level="m">Interesting Narrative</title> is, in other words, a perfect
                        example of colonial mimicry, a discursive process that depends on its own
                        indeterminacy to disrupt normalized knowledge, not only for slave owners who
                        rely on racist assumptions about the capacity of Africans for rational
                        thought and moral feelings, but also for abolitionists who continue to deny
                        equal rights for Blacks attempting to assimilate into British society.</p>
                  <p>Equiano’s text provides an excellent introduction to what Paul Youngquist and
                        Frances Botkin have called “Black Romanticism,” a critical focus in romantic
                        studies that seeks to restore certain geographies, particularly the West
                        Indies, back to the center of literary analysis. Although some students will
                        have encountered Equiano before, such encounters will have rarely led to
                        alternative perspectives for reading romantic literature in which the Maroon
                        War, the Haitian Revolution, and the Independence movements of South America
                        form the natural historical backdrop to a literature just as invested in
                        translation and cross-cultural exchange as it is in national formation.
                        According to Youngquist and Botkin, the problem is a disciplinary one, which
                        they provocatively articulate in no uncertain terms in the opening statement
                        of their introduction to the recent volume of collected essays <title level="m">Circulations: Romanticism and the Black Atlantic</title>
                        (2011): “With notable exceptions, studies in British Romanticism remain
                        pretty white” (1).<note place="foot" resp="author">In-text citations refer
                            to paragraph numbers.</note> For Youngquist and Botkin, “the whiteness
                        of Romantic studies is a symptom of amnesia . . . a massive act of
                        forgetting on the part of contemporary scholarship” that has blinded us to
                        “the complex network of exchanges circulating people, ideas, practices, and
                        things throughout the Atlantic” (1; 8). In transatlantic studies more
                        broadly defined, this form of amnesia is especially evident in the general
                        neglect of the intersections of romanticism and the Spanish-speaking world
                        in which the voices of Haiti, Cuba, Venezuela, Mexico, and a whole host of
                        other geographies of the Spanish Atlantic commanded the world stage.</p>
                  <p>The students I teach usually become excited by this ‘confession’ of sorts,
                        often citing this fact as the main reason for initially enrolling in the
                        class. When asked to provide a brief account of major events in the South
                        Atlantic in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, however,
                        some students will remember the Haitian Revolution and fewer still will
                        mention the Latin American Independence movements, let alone provide more
                        than cursory details to these events. Employing visual aids, provocative
                        excerpts, and online resources, I outline the important events of the period
                        from the 1780s Andean rebellion through the Bolívar Wars of the 1820s,
                        introducing students to the fiery brilliance of revolutionaries like Antonio
                        Nariño, Francisco de Miranda, San Martín, and the <foreign xml:lang="sp">libertador</foreign> himself, Simon Bolívar. With republics springing
                        up first in Venezuela in 1810, soon followed by Buenos Aires and New
                        Granada, then Chile and finally Mexico, Latin America soon rivaled their
                        North American neighbors in political innovation and radical change. Back in
                        Europe, I explain, Spain was experiencing its own revolution of sorts. With
                        the invasion of Napoleon in 1808, Spain not only found itself locked in a
                        life and death struggle for national independence, but also became deeply
                        engaged in its own political experimentations. The liberal intelligentsia in
                        Spain, self-dubbed <foreign xml:lang="sp">liberales</foreign>, fought to
                        secure their national sovereignty against Napoleon, but they also viewed the
                        political crisis as a rare opportunity for political and social reform, an
                        opportunity to completely revamp and modernize the Spanish government,
                        transform its traditional social structure, and draft a constitution along
                        more liberal and revolutionary lines.</p>
                  <p>As the site of wars and invasions, revolutions and constitutional inventions,
                        the Spanish Atlantic opened up a new space for political and ideological
                        discussion in Britain that touched on key issues of national and imperial
                        concerns. The imperial relationship between Spain and its colonies at a time
                        when both the colonies and metropole were formulating new ideas about
                        individual autonomy, national sovereignty, and civil liberties brought into
                        full view the inescapable conflict between liberal thought and the logic of
                        empire. As an early sympathizer of Latin American independence and now an
                        ally of Spain, Britain found itself caught between its moral obligation to
                        support Latin American claims for freedom against tyranny and oppression,
                        and their political responsibilities to honor their new alliance with Spain.
                        Yet, Britain had ulterior motives at play. Long coveting Latin American
                        markets, Britain understood the implications of Spanish American
                        independence for the expansion of its commercial empire. Thus, placed in a
                        position of savior to Spain and Latin America’s hope for independence,
                        Britain became an increasingly significant and politically charged space of
                        converging and conflicting interests: the place of revolutionary plotting on
                        the one hand—Miranda, Bolívar, and others all developed their
                        revolutionary programs in London—and the source of a growing
                        pro-Spanish sentiment on the other.<note place="foot" resp="author">See

                            the relationship between the Spanish-speaking world and the development

                  </p>
                  <p>To introduce students to the interconnections between romantic literature and
                        the history of the struggle for Haitian independence, I assign the Broadview
                        edition of Leonora Sansay’s <title level="m">Secret History; or, The Horrors
                            of St. Domingo</title> (1808), a text that interweaves the events of the
                        Haitian Revolution with a romance plot that explores the gender and race
                        implications of interracial love, violence against women, and desire for
                        female community. I require students to read the introduction, which
                        provides an excellent initiation to the history of the Revolution from the
                        1791 slave revolt and the rise of Toussaint Louverture to the establishment
                        of the world’s first black republic in 1804 and the massacre of white French
                        colonists at the hands of Jean-Jacques Dessalines. The introduction also
                        provides a helpful discussion of racial politics in the Americas and their
                        complex relationship to constructions of gender and sex exemplified in the
                        interactions between mixed-race mulatto women, white Creole women born in
                        the Caribbean, and white European women. I think Gretchen Woertendyke is
                        absolutely correct to suggest that “Sansay’s tale joins the domestic terror
                        of Clara’s marriage to St. Louis to the revolutionary horror of
                        Saint-Domingue,” a point I tease out by highlighting the ways in which the
                        text deploys similar strategies of elision to hide both the violence of
                        revolution and the violence against women (256). Attempts at textual erasure
                        are immediate. In the opening letter to the novel, Mary expresses a desire
                        to bury her memories of the Revolution in the past, preferring instead to
                        dwell on the “profound tranquility of the ocean, the uninterrupted view, the
                        beautiful horizon . . . with a new world opening to my view” (61). Mary’s
                        romantic reflections at sea, however, are violently interrupted on landing
                        by the “terrible picture of desolation” that itself “cannot be imagined”
                        (61). Recognizing the tension between the romantic imagination and the
                        reality of revolution helps students organize their reading of the ways in
                        which history consistently interrupts the romance narrative of Sansay’s text
                        in order to, one might argue, dramatize the limits of the imagination and
                        reveal the secret process by which some histories become hidden.</p>
                  <p>Despite Mary’s attempt to narrate the reestablishment of polite society in
                        St. Domingue in which new fashions, plays, and, most importantly, balls
                        transform the “heap of ruins” throughout the city into “a fairy palace” of
                        pleasure and love-making, sporadic attacks by marauding former slaves and
                        daily accounts of gratuitous violence on both sides soon convince Mary that
                        “[t]he romantic visions of happiness I once delighted to indulge in, are
                        fading fast away before the exterminating touch of cold reality” (61; 74;
                        93). The links between revolutionary and sexual politics are tangible in the
                        novel, from Mary’s comparison of the masculinity of slave insurrectionists
                        with the effeminacy of French men to Rochambeau’s literal deployment of the
                        military to secure his sexual conquest of Clara. Yet, Mary’s scattered
                        anecdotes of domestic abuse against her sister Clara, like the episodes of
                        revolutionary violence punctuating the text, convey the “silent horror”
                        experienced by not only Clara, but all women in general, Mary remarking at
                        one point that “Clara is not the first wife that has been locked up at St.
                        Domingo” (103; 87). The parallels between Clara’s confinement and the
                        “brutal subjection” of slaves, who “have at length acquired a knowledge of
                        their own strength,” formally justify Clara’s own revolt not only from the
                        tyranny of her husband, but arguably also from the oppressive moral codes
                        Mary herself invokes to judge her sister’s sudden elopement with Don Alonzo
                        (76; 26). Although students may not always grasp all of the nuances of the
                        complex intersections between race, gender, sexuality, and revolutionary
                        violence in the novel, most will begin to understand how different forms of
                        oppression are often linked in romantic literature, recalling, for instance,
                        Wollstonecraft’s comparison of the institution of marriage to slavery, and
                        how new contexts almost always alter meaning, even of self-evident truths
                        about the inalienable rights of man.</p>

                  <head>Bolívar, Latin American Independence, and the Case for Translation</head>
                  <p>In turning to Bolívar and the Independence movements of South America, I
                        conclude this essay with a case study exploring the pedagogical value of
                        translating texts written in Spanish for students who typically encounter
                        the transatlantic and romantic concepts of revolution exclusively in
                        English. I begin by posing the question David Simpson asks in his evaluation
                        of Romantic cosmopolitanism: “can what is written in one language make sense
                        in another; can what is felt by one person be the same as what is felt by
                        someone from a different place or time?” (146). The question is a helpful
                        one because it not only speaks to the purpose of literary interpretation in
                        general, but also seeks to understand that purpose in terms of important
                        questions about the value of translations in literary analysis. According to
                        C. C. Wharram, “translation changes—or might prompt us to
                        change—the way we approach the teaching of texts of British
                        Romanticism in particular, and literature in general, within a planetary
                        context” (1). Although readings of translations, as Lesa Scholl notes, can
                        help students understand how British romantic literature “incorporates
                        foreignness” into its very structures of meaning, I find myself consistently
                        returning to Simpson’s notion of “translation not as the fantasy of
                        dialogism but as the impasse of blocked communication” (Scholl 17; Simpson
                        151). The key to the pedagogical strategy I have adopted for this course is
                        finding ways to demonstrate how seemingly straightforward romantic concepts
                        like the imagination, nature, liberty, and the rights of man not only
                        acquire new meanings when interpreted and read from one context to the next,
                        but also how the concepts themselves take shape in response to intentional
                        misreadings, unauthorized interpolations, contextual obfuscation, and other
                        forms of textual distortions.</p>
                  <p>One of the most compelling texts to advance the case for romantic translation
                        as a pedagogical strategy is Simon Bolívar’s <title level="a">Carta de
                            Jamaica</title> (1815), a letter written originally in Spanish but
                        immediately translated and published in English.<note place="foot" resp="author">All English translations of <title level="a">Carta de
                                Jamaica</title> are from Frederick H. Fornoff in Bolívar. For
                            instructors considering teaching other Bolívar texts in English, David
                            Bushnell’s edited collection of Bolívar’s writings is the most
                            accessible to students.</note> Composed during his exile in the British
                        colony of Jamaica and addressed to the British resident Henry Cullen in an
                        effort to solicit British support for independence from Spain, Bolívar’s
                            <title level="a">Letter from Jamaica</title> finds itself at the center
                        of a transatlantic textual network triangulating between Britain, Spain, and
                        Spanish America during the early nineteenth century. Students who read this
                        letter expecting to find a revolutionary document worthy of Bolívar’s
                        reputation as <foreign xml:lang="sp">El Libertador</foreign> are surprised
                        by what appears to be clear anti-democratic statements. In addition to
                        supporting the rise of dictatorships throughout South America, Bolívar
                        mounts a powerful argument against the adoption of a “democratic and
                        federalist model” of government based on pragmatic considerations, arguing
                        that “institutions which are wholly representative are not suited to our
                        character, customs, and present knowledge” (23). Although Bolívar cites a
                        number of Enlightenment <foreign xml:lang="fr">philosophes</foreign>
                        throughout his political writings, it was Montesquieu not Rousseau that
                        Bolívar preferred to rewrite when imagining the future of Latin America.
                        Within a colonial context in which the colonized are excluded from “the
                        science of government and administration of the state,” a process Bolívar
                        argues has “left us in a kind of permanent infancy with respect to public
                        affairs,” the right to self-determination, Bolívar argues, trumps the right
                        of individuals to political equality (20; 19).</p>
                  <p>Burke, I remind students, advances a similar pragmatic argument when he
                        suggests that “all men have equal rights; but not to equal things,”
                        particularly with respect to “the share of power, authority, and . . . the
                        management of the state” (218). Like Bolívar, Burke also endorsed the idea
                        that the form of government of a nation ought to “emanate” from its
                        “national character” (249). Burke, after all, supported the American
                        Revolution, a fact that his opponents interpreted as hypocritical but Burke
                        defended by citing the differences of the American situation. If the share
                        of power, authority, and management of the state is at the crux of the
                        Revolution debate, what are we to make of Bolívar’s wholesale dismissal of
                        such an idea? What are we also to make of Bolívar’s class- and race-based
                        skepticism of the masses, particularly the “African hordes” who “rarely
                        manage to appreciate the wholesome condition of freedom”? (qtd. in Bolívar
                        xl; 27). If time allows for the inclusion of other writings of Bolívar, this
                        line of inquiry can be sharpened by questions concerning Bolívar’s
                        denunciation of the “ideal of tolerance” and “exaggerated notion of the
                        rights of man” in <title level="m">The Cartagena Manifesto</title> (1812),
                        his preference for “correct” elections over “popular elections” in the same
                        document, and his inclusion of provisions for a lifetime presidency in the
                        1826 Bolivian Constitution (3; 7). A brief survey of the rise of <foreign xml:lang="sp">caudillos</foreign>—local strongmen among whom
                        historians include nineteenth-century figures like Juan Manuel de Rosas and
                        Antonio López de Santa Anna, dictators of Argentina and Mexico respectively,
                        and modern dictators like Fidel Castro, Manuel Noriega, and Augusto
                        Pinochet—emphasizes the contemporary relevance of such questions by
                        alerting students to the long history of authoritarian violence in Latin
                        America that renowned historian John Lynch argues “was essentially a product
                        of the wars of independence” (5). Admittedly intended for dramatic effect,
                        one might ask how it is possible to get from life, liberty, and the pursuit
                        of happiness to death squads, dictators, and desaparecidos?</p>
                  <p>Bolívar’s political writings, especially the <title level="a">Carta de
                            Jamaica,</title> can also open up important questions about the nature of
                        translation, not only in the way in which it challenges traditional readings
                        of influence, but also in the way in which it defamiliarizes and estranges
                        concepts we think we know. By explicitly citing the works of Enlightenment
                        thinkers like Abbé Raynal, Baron von Humboldt, and Montesquieu, and
                        translating his letter into English, Bolívar suggests that he and his
                        interlocutor are speaking the same language. Ulterior motives aside, Bolívar
                        understands the importance of translating the Spanish American experience
                        within the perceived parameters of a shared discourse, a strategy of
                        “enforcing meaning” that is noticeably absent in texts like <title level="m">The Angostura Address</title>, despite the fact that it essentially
                        develops the same ideas as his <title level="a">Carta de Jamaica</title>
                        (151). Intertextuality, consequently, is essential to the construction of
                        its meaning, a fact that is problematized by Bolívar’s intentional
                        misreadings of many of the texts he cites in his letter, most notably José
                        María Blanco White’s <title level="m">El Español</title>, which Bolívar
                        refers to as evidence of broad support for the cause of independence in
                        Spanish America. Although he initially defended Latin American autonomy
                        while Spain itself fought for its own independence, Blanco White made it
                        clear that he did not intend for his arguments to be interpreted as support
                        of independence.<note place="foot" resp="author">In 1811 Blanco White wrote
                            in <title level="m">El Español</title>, “La América española no ha
                            pasado aun el noviciado de la libertad, y quererlo hacer todo de repente
                            y á la vez, paredes, techos, y cimientos es exponerse á no hacer mas que
                            un edificio de apariencia que se vendri abaxo al primer soplo. La
                            América Española por necesidad será independiente en algun tiempo (no
                            sabré decir qundo) . . . Pero si los americanos quieren no retardar este
                            período; no lo apresuren” (3:303).</note>Reading against Blanco White’s
                        ‘original’ intentions, Bolívar selectively reconstructs a transatlantic
                        discourse in order to fashion a political statement that is familiar in its
                        form but peculiar in its implications.</p>
                  <p>What would it mean to read Bolívar’s letter in Spanish? Would we find an
                        original text with clarified concepts and meanings or would we find new
                        problems of interpretation as we subject the text to the new distortions of
                        our own translations? Consider, for example, Bolívar’s discussion of the
                        reasons why Spanish Americans are unfit for a federal republic. First in
                        English: <quote> Slave states are identified as such by virtue of their
                            constitution or the abuse of it. People are slaves when the government,
                            by its essence or through its vices, tramples and usurps the rights of
                            the citizen or subject. Applying these principles, we will find that
                            America was not only deprived of its freedom but deprived as well of the
                            opportunity to practice its own active tyranny. (19) </quote> From this
                        translation, it is unclear what precisely Bolívar means by “slave states.”
                        The analogy of citizens as slaves under an oppressive government hardly
                        clarifies the issue. Unlike oppressed subjects, slave states enslave
                        themselves unless Bolívar means for the second statement to elaborate his
                        first, suggesting then that states in which the government tramples on the
                        rights of the people are the slave states alluded to in the previous
                        statement. Even if this latter meaning is granted, it is difficult to see
                        how these “principles” help us to understand the American situation.
                        Depriving one of rights does appear tantamount to depriving one of freedom,
                        but how is that the same as depriving one of the opportunity to practice
                        tyranny? This last question is of course resolved if we agree that Bolívar
                        is suggesting that citizens have the right to govern themselves and by
                        depriving them of rights in general, the slave state deprives them of this
                        right as well. But Bolívar does not believe citizens have the right to
                        govern, a point he repeatedly makes throughout his writing. We still have
                        yet to touch on the bizarre notion of participating in one’s own active
                        tyranny, an idea that returns us to the concept of slave states that enslave
                        themselves, which we were supposed to have already clarified. Add to this
                        the history of Bolívar’s relationship to the recently independent black
                        republic Haiti, where he travelled and received military support on the
                        promise he would incorporate abolition as part of his revolutionary program
                        (hitherto not a part), and Bolívar’s discussion of the slave state becomes
                        even more curious.</p>
                  <p>Let us now turn to the passage in Spanish to see if we can sort out some of
                        these issues: <quote> Los estados son esclavos por la naturaleza de su
                            constitución o por el abuso de ella; luego, un pueblo es esclavo cuando
                            el gobierno, por su esencia o por sus vicios, holla y usurpa los
                            derechos del ciudadano o subdito. Aplicando estos principios, hallaremos
                            que la América no solamente estaba privada de su libertad, sino también
                            de la tiranía activa y dominante. (<title level="a">Carta</title>)
                        </quote> Translating with the intent to clarify the questions I posed, I
                        might rewrite this passage in English in the following way: <quote> States
                            are subject to despotic rule when they are formed as subject states or
                            when those in power elsewhere act despotically toward it. Tyrannical
                            governments, however, enslave their own people when they reduce and
                            usurp the power of their citizens or subjects to participate in the
                            administration of the state, regardless of whether these governments
                            were formed to do so or not. Applying the principle of subject states,
                            we can see how America as a state has been deprived of its political
                            autonomy. Applying the principle of enslaving governments, however, we
                            can see how Americans have also been deprived of the possibility of
                            participating in the active and dominant tyrannical rule of the state.
                        </quote> In this interpretation, I seek to clarify the comparison between
                        states and governments by removing the reference to states as slaves in the
                        first statement, which to me creates confusion with regard to another
                        possible analogy between enslaved states and enslaved people. I then mark a
                        contrast between states as political entities sometimes subject to external
                        rule and the mechanisms of governments concerned with the administration of
                        the state in order to create two principles and two applications: the
                        principle of subject states explaining America’s loss of political autonomy
                        and the principle of tyrannical governments explaining the people’s
                        inability to rule themselves. In some ways, I have ironed out some of the
                        wrinkles of confusion; in other ways, I have created more than I began with
                        and have most certainly contained some of the dynamism of the passage. If we
                        reinsert the analogy between enslaved states and enslaved people, for
                        example, we recover Bolívar’s sublimated and far more disturbingly racist
                        view that although Spanish rule has enslaved America, some Americans, like
                        the constitution of subject states, are naturally formed for slavery.
                        Although we do not have time here to tease out the nuances of Bolívar’s view
                        of race in the Americas, it is enough to point out that the racial diversity
                        of the Americas created great anxiety for Bolívar who even in this letter
                        represents race as a stumbling block to unity in the Americas.</p>
                  <p>Similarly, in seeking to normalize the strange reference to the desire of the
                        people to tyrannize themselves, I, like the translator before me, invent a
                        phrase to prevent readers from interpreting this passage as an advocacy for
                        tyranny: in Fornoff’s translation, “opportunity to practice” and in mine,
                        “possibility of participating.” Yet, tyranny is precisely what this passage
                        is advocating. Since Americans have been kept “in a kind of permanent
                        infancy,” they have never learned how to use the mechanisms of power to
                        control entire populations, especially those as vast and diverse as those in
                        the Americas. Although the <title level="a">Carta de Jamaica</title> is at
                        its heart a solicitation for British aid, Bolívar understands its role as a
                        statement of his revolutionary agenda, which for him always involves
                        imagining post-colonial rule. Arguments against representative republics are
                        not simply enlightenment speculations on the best form of government; they
                        are in many ways an anticipation and justification of the authoritarian rule
                        that Bolívar believed must be established while the population is educated
                        and gains experience in managing a state. The letter’s disproportionate
                        attention to the process of decolonization and the post-colonial state makes
                        sense when viewed as an assurance to a potential ally concerned about the
                        implications of an independent America in light of anxieties occasioned by
                        nations like Haiti. Yet, as Bolívar’s letter made clear, revolution must be
                        translated into Spanish. In the sentence immediately following this passage,
                        Bolívar writes, “Me explicaré” [Let me explain what I mean]. Translation may
                        never be able to fulfill such a promise, but as a “core Romantic paradigm,”
                        Wharram might be correct in suggesting that “translation changes everything”

               <p rend="noCount">This essay distills the experience of teaching an upper-division
                    English course entitled <title level="a">An Introduction to Global Romanticisms.</title> This class
                    focused on one text over the course of the semester – Jerome Rothenberg and
                    Jeffrey Robinson’s experimental anthology <title level="m">Poems for the Millennium Volume 3: The
                    University of California Book of Romantic &amp; Postromantic Poetry</title>. This collection
                    attempts to construct a truly global Romantic tradition. In addition to the
                    standard writers of the European Romantic canon, North and South American,
                    Scandinavian, Eastern European, and Asian authors are included here as well. The
                    broad scope of the anthology presents exciting opportunities and challenges.
                    This essay assesses the potential of this volume to reform our teaching of and
                    scholarship about Romanticism, and it briefly articulates a thesis about the
                    “cosmic” dimension of literary texts, which can possibly provide an organizing
                    rubric for engaging with the expansive richness of global Romanticism once
                    conventional formalist and historicist methods are shown to be inadequate for
                    managing its complexity.</p>

                  <p>In her book <title level="m">Death of a Discipline</title>, comprised of the
                    Wellek Library Lectures in Critical Theory, Gayatri Spivak implores scholars to
                    “take a step, learning to learn from below, toward imagining planetarity” (100).
                    These types of calls are common in the contemporary era of literary studies as
                    scholars discover how to navigate through a sea of new universalizing
                    terms—planetarity, planetary, globality, globalism, worldness, worlding,
                    deep time, and transcultural.<note place="foot" resp="author">For a few examples
                        of scholars who develop these terms in powerful ways, see Wai Chee Dimock,
                        R. Radhakrishnan, Pheng Cheah, Amy Elias, Mary Emery, Djelal Kadir,
                        Christian Moraru, and Masao Miyoshi.</note> The mission is clear—we
                    must create transformative curricula that refuse to mirror and support the
                    hierarchies and inequities of the social world and that engage with the
                    florescence of human creativity within the largest framework possible.</p>
                  <p>Yet when it comes to the field of Romanticism, this is a large task indeed.
                    Teaching even a traditional class on European Romanticism would be difficult
                    enough, requiring as it would knowledge of at least the French, German, and
                    English traditions. Yet what would happen if one attempted to construct a truly
                    global Romanticism course, adding to the syllabus North and South American
                    elaborations of Romantic traditions, Scandinavian and Eastern European Romantic
                    episodes, or even a glimpse into various Asian literary developments? While one
                    might, with the best of intentions, want to pursue the laudable goal of
                    “planetarity,” implementing it threatens to push a solitary course past a basic
                    level of coherence and instructors past their areas of expertise and ability.
                    (My own particular areas of expertise are British Romanticism, African-American
                    literature, and nineteenth-century American literature.)</p>
                  <p>With the publication in 2009 of volume three of the anthology series <title level="m">Poems for the Millennium</title>, edited by Jerome Rothenberg and
                    Jeffrey Robinson, a new tool has arrived to help scholars and teachers think
                    about how to teach Romanticism from a global perspective. This anthology has a
                    capacious sweep, and it covers a wide range of poetry and poetic manifestos from
                    Europe, Asia, and the Americas. It moves chronologically from “pre-Romantic”
                    figures such as Erasmus Darwin and Christopher Smart down to early modernists
                    like Guillaume Apollinaire. The global reinterpretation of Romanticism on
                    display here is quite stunning, and it is rare to see East Indian, Japanese,
                    Hungarian, and Brazilian poets placed on the same stage. (Every area of the
                    world is represented here, except Australia and Africa.) In the spring of 2011,
                    I taught an upper-division English course at Marquette University entitled
                        <title level="a">An Introduction to Global Romanticisms,</title> which used
                    this collection as the main text of the class. In this essay, I will distill
                    this experience, assess the potential of this volume to reform our teaching of
                    and scholarship about Romanticism, and end with a discussion of how to maintain
                    a sense of the full global possibilities of Romanticism.</p>
                  <p>I will begin by describing the larger <title level="m">Poems for the
                        Millennium</title> project. Edited by Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris,
                    the first two volumes are explorations of twentieth-century poetry from the
                    perspective of its many avant-gardes, including movements such as Futurism,
                    Dada, and Expressionism. The first volume moves from the fin-de-siècle to
                    negritude, exploring international modernism in the historical period stretching
                    from 1890 to 1945, while the second tackles poetry from the postwar moment to
                    the millennium. After the focus on Romanticism in the third volume, the fourth
                    volume, edited by Pierre Joris and Habib Tengour, provides a comprehensive
                    overview of the written and oral literatures of North Africa. The series
                    culminates with Rothenberg and John Bloomber-Rissman’s Volume Five, which is
                    subtitled <title level="m">Barbaric Vast &amp; Wild: A Gathering of Outside
                        &amp; Subterranean Poetry from Origins to Present</title>. These texts burst
                    at the seams with an anti-traditionalist and anti-mainstream energy, and they
                    delight in the paradox of attempting to canonize works that aim to be
                    anti-canonical, to conserve the poetic gestures of the self-proclaimed radical.
                    The volumes are boldly attentive to poetic activity happening around the globe,
                    including work from the Vienna Group, the Fluxus artists, the Arabic-language
                    Tammuzi poets, and the Chinese Misty Poets. As such, they emphasize the vitality
                    of global movements and propound an eclectic cosmopolitanism.</p>
                  <p>Romanticism was important to the aims of the <title level="m">Poems for the
                        Millennium</title> project from the very beginning. The first volume, for
                    example, opens with a section entitled <title level="a">Prologue to
                        Forerunners,</title> which includes selections from William Blake, Friedrich
                    Hölderlin, and Walt Whitman. In the introduction, the editors take a line of
                    Blake’s—“poetry fetter’d, fetters the human race”—as a battle cry
                    and draw a genealogy that traces the emergence of vibrant twentieth-century
                    poetry “out of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment and…the seed-bed of a
                    radical romanticism” (1). In other words, Romanticism is viewed as a central
                    precursor for understanding the various avant-gardes and major poetic work of
                    contemporary times. Volume Three covers work written chronologically before the
                    two volumes that precede it and is therefore a homecoming of sorts, insofar as
                    it gives Rothenberg and Robinson a venue to explore nineteenth-century
                    precursors to poetry movements with which they feel immediate kinship.<note place="foot" resp="author">Throughout the rest of this essay, I will focus
                        on Rothenberg as the major editorial presence behind the <title level="m">Poems for the Millennium</title> project because he participated in
                        constructing four out of the five anthologies. There is not enough space in
                        the context of this essay to give a full appreciation of the contributions
                        made by Pierre Joris, Jeffrey Robinson, and Habib Tengour to this
                        effort.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third volume of the <title level="m">Poems for the Millennium</title> opens
                    with a “Preludium” of eighteenth-century figures who set the stage for the
                    romantic movement proper—such as the Marquis de Sade, Emanuel Swedenborg,
                    Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Erasmus Darwin. According to the book’s introduction,
                    Rothenberg and Robinson were trying to emphasize figures who do not fit into
                    stereotypical visions of the period as one dominated by neo-classicism and
                    melancholy lyric sensibility. The text is then divided into sections called
                    “galleries,” “clusters,” and “books.” There are three galleries of poets
                    chronologically organized with brief biographical commentaries provided after
                    each poet. The first—featuring poets for the most part born before
                    1800—stretches from Goethe and Blake to Dionysios Solomos and Aleksander
                    Pushkin. The second contains figures from Victor Hugo and Elias Lonnrot to
                    Swinburne and Mallarmé. This gallery highlights Romanticism’s coming of age, in
                    which it becomes recognized as a coherent movement and begins to develop
                    generational splits and differences, while moving across the Atlantic and all
                    throughout Europe. The final gallery extends from Hopkins and Nietzsche to
                    Yosano Akiko and Apollinaire. This section tracks the movement into a
                    post-Romanticism, featuring early Modernists, pre-Raphaelites,
                    Transcendentalists, <foreign xml:lang="sp">modernistas</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">poètes maudits</foreign>, and Symbolists.</p>
                  <p>These sections follow the standard anthology format, and in truth, most figures
                    covered here could be found in mainstream anthologies such as <title level="m">The Norton Anthology of World Literature</title>. (There are only about ten
                    people included in <title level="m">Poems for the Millennium Vol. 3</title>
                    [henceforth <title level="m">PFM3</title>] that one
                    could not find in there.) The major difference is that some of the continental
                    lyricists featured in the <title level="m">Norton</title>—such as Anna
                    Bunina, Rosalía de Castro, and Gustavo Bécquer—are removed in favor of
                    nationalist icons—like the Polish Cyprian Norwid and Cuban José
                    Martí—and figures writing in local dialects difficult to
                    translate—such as the Italian Giuseppe Belli, which gives <title level="m">PFM3</title> a more overtly political and
                    anti-conventional slant.</p>
                  <p>Inside of each of these three galleries, <title level="m">PFM3</title> includes a small cluster of poems organized around
                    a theme. The first, <title level="a">Some Asian Poets,</title> tracks the work
                    of a few groundbreaking poets writing from various Asian locations in the
                    nineteenth century—such as Kobayashi Issa (Japan), Ho Xuan Huong
                    (Vietnam), Bibi Hayati (Iran), and Wu Tsao (China). It is a quick survey of
                    figures working on a track parallel to the mainstream “Romantic” movement, but
                    not really in dialogue with it (except in the case of the Indian poet
                    Rabindranath Tagore).</p>
                  <p>The next unit, <title level="a">Some Outsider Poets,</title> seeks to take
                    account of para-literary activity happening outside of the sanction of the
                    official literary purview, hegemonic literary institutions, or dominant means of
                    production/distribution. Featured in this section are figures such as Raifteiri
                    the Poet, a bard writing in Irish/Gaelic; James Reuben, author of an 1880
                    history of the Nez Percé nation; and the politically radical poet Thomas
                    Cooper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="a">Some Orientalisms,</title> the final cluster, corresponds quite
                    nicely with the first unit, and it works to explode the myth of a static “Asia”
                    untouched by cultural development and locked into a stultifying “tradition.”
                    This section highlights creative work influenced by the opening of the “East”
                    due to the machinations of nineteenth-century colonialism, work that is often at
                    odds with colonial premises. Selections from works like Goethe’s <title level="m">Arabian Ballad</title>, Lord Byron’s <title level="m">The
                        Giaour</title>, Victor Segalen’s <title level="m">Stelae</title>, and Hugo’s
                        <title level="m">Les Orientales</title> are included.</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">PFM3</title> also includes two sections
                    called “books” that are placed in between the three galleries. Like the
                    clusters, the <title level="a">Book of Origins</title> and the <title level="a">Book of Extensions</title> forego chronological organization and exhibit a
                    collection of texts that transforms conventional opinion about Romanticism’s
                    relationship with the poetic past while demonstrating the projection of an
                    experimental poetic future. Jerome Rothenberg is most well-known for his work
                    with the concept of ethnopoetics, which describes the study of various types of
                    global folk poetry, oral literature, ceremonial and ritual speech, and mythic
                    tales and draws deeply from disciplines such as linguistics and
                        anthropology.<note place="foot" resp="author">See Jerome and Diane
                        Rothenberg.</note> The <title level="a">Book of Origins</title> allows
                    Rothenberg to emphasize this element of his poetic interests by taking into
                    account three categories of texts: texts rediscovered and/or translated by the
                    modern West in the nineteenth century (e.g., <title level="m">Pistis
                        Sophia</title>, <title level="m">The Egyptian Book of the Dead</title>,
                        <title level="m">The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</title>); examples of folk
                    poetry alive in the nineteenth century (e.g., Negro Spirituals); and
                    transcriptions of lengthy oral traditions prepared by nineteenth-century
                    folklore collectors and others (e.g., Daniel Brinton’s <title level="m">Rig Veda
                        Americanus</title>, the Navajo <title level="m">Night Chant</title>).</p>
                  <p>Rothenberg is also a practicing poet, and in collections like <title level="m">White Sun Black Sun</title> he plays with syntax, image, and form in ways
                    that place him in line with what he would call a “radical and experimental
                    modernism,” or an “avant-garde” tradition (<title level="m">PFM3</title> 3). In
                    the <title level="a">Book of Extensions,</title> he and Robinson highlight a
                    range of visual, performative, and conceptual work not normally associated with
                    Romanticism but rather as an important starting point for twentieth-century
                    poetic practice. Particularly important in this section are poetic techniques
                    such as the interaction of image and text in Blake’s <title level="m">Laocoön</title>, the typographical play of Lewis Carroll’s <title level="m">Concrete Poem: A Mouse</title>, and the use of phonetic syllables in August
                    Strindberg’s sound poem <title level="m">Holy Trinity Night: The Nightingale’s
                        Song</title>.</p>
                  <p>Finally, <title level="m">PFM3</title> closes with a section of manifestos and
                    statements of poetics, with excerpts taken from texts ranging from Schlegel’s
                        <title level="m">Athenaeum Fragment 116</title> to Goethe’s <title level="m">Toward a World Literature</title> and from Whitman’s <title level="m">Preface to Leaves of Grass</title> to Victor Hugo’s <title level="m">Preface to Cromwell</title>. The book closes with ambitious statements of
                    guiding principles and projects that still resonate in the present day.</p>
                  <p>As one can see, the breadth of the project is astounding. Without a doubt, this
                    text helps one take quite a step toward imagining planetarity. Not only is there
                    a geographically expansive selection of writers presented here to make the case
                    for Romanticism as a worldwide movement, but there is also a recontextualization
                    of familiar “major” writers, an introduction of so-called “minor” writers, an
                    attempt to highlight working-class, women, and politically engaged writers, and
                    selections organized by theme (in addition to chronology) that force one to
                    expand one’s definition of Romanticism. Yet in solving one problem in
                    constructing courses in global Romanticism—the problem of actually
                    assembling readings from all over the world—<title level="m">PFM3</title>
                    raises another issue just as major: is there an ideal framework that can be used
                    (by either the editors or teachers using this anthology) to coherently present
                    and order the riches of the material given?</p>
                  <p>In full disclosure, this is the first literature course I had taught after a
                    graduate-student career of teaching composition courses, so I was fresh with the
                    ambition (and possibly naiveté) of wanting to tackle “the globe” in the
                    classroom. The first thing I immediately realized when organizing a course
                    around this book is that I would not be able to cover the entire text. It
                    contains over 950 pages of poetry! Given the limitations of the semester, one
                    has to make selections and condense material into a palatable size. There were
                    only 14 full weeks of instruction, and in the three galleries alone, over 50
                    poets are presented, with more to be found in the other “clusters” and “books.”
                    I decided to make the course reading intensive, forgoing long essay assignments
                    for short reading quizzes (in addition to a midterm and final) in order to
                    expose the students to as much of this material as possible. This is why the
                    class was entitled an <title level="a">Introduction to Global
                        Romanticisms,</title> because I knew that even with providing glimpses of
                    approximately fifty writers, I could not do much more than scratch the surface.
                    My syllabus is attached to this article for those who would like to see on a
                    day-to-day basis how the class was organized (<ref target="http://www.romantic-circles.org/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixC.html">Appendix C</ref>).</p>
                  <p>The question of canonization—always a persistent one in English
                    departments—becomes even more acute in the struggle to construct a global
                    syllabus. Based on what criteria does one choose or exclude? Rothenberg and
                    Robinson never fully address this question, and they use the introduction to
                    take up a polemic against the work of Harold Bloom, the critic who is probably
                    most synonymous with the question of canonization and to whom Rothenberg has
                    devoted a much longer and nastier critique (involving the comparison of Bloom
                    and Joseph Mengele) elsewhere.<note place="foot" resp="author">See Rothenberg
                        2008.</note> Rothenberg and Robinson say, “It is our desire in fact to
                    embrace as much of the poetic past as we can and to repudiate in so doing that
                    ‘anxiety of influence’ (H. Bloom) that would separate us (against our finer
                    instincts) from our fellow poets” (8). However, I can imagine that Bloom would
                    respond, as he does in his book <title level="m">The Western Canon</title>, “The
                    overpopulation of books (and authors) brought about by the length and complexity
                    of the world’s recorded history is at the center of canonical dilemmas, now more
                    than ever” (491). When one strips away much of Bloom’s bombastic rhetoric, one
                    can see the value in his list of criteria for canonical stature—“mastery
                    of figurative language, originality, cognitive power, knowledge, exuberance of
                    diction” (<title level="m">Western Canon</title> 27–28)—which is elsewhere
                    shortened to “aesthetic splendor, intellectual power, wisdom” (<title level="m">Wisdom</title> 5). Rothenberg and Robinson’s criterion for selection, on
                    the other hand, revolves around drawing a “fundamental, systematic continuity”
                    between “the most vital strain of nineteenth-century poetry and the Modernism
                    and avant-gardism of the twentieth century” (3), or in other words emphasizing
                    connections between Romantic poetry and the contemporary poetry movements most
                    closely aligned to Rothenberg’s own mode of poetry writing. This, as I will
                    explain, has very peculiar consequences.</p>
                  <p>In determining what elements of the book to not include at all, I decided to
                    remove whole sections that, while interesting, were sure to cause pedagogical
                    problems. Many students came into the class not knowing the difference between
                    even Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, and if they in general do not have a good
                    grasp on “insider poets,” if non-conformist figures like these can be called
                    that, what is the value of studying <title level="a">Some Outsider
                        Poets?</title> Admittedly, the institution of “literature” is a precarious
                    one, constructed by a variety of ideological factors, but it is bizarre to ask
                    students to challenge a category with which they have very little
                    familiarity.</p>
                  <p>Along the same lines, the section <title level="a">Some Orientalisms</title>
                    seemed to lend itself to a too easy deployment of a term for which students have
                    not been fully prepared. It is extremely difficult to study Orientalism in any
                    real detail when one is given a quick sweep of poets from different nations,
                    language traditions, and political vantage points responding to the historically
                    shifting idea of “Asia” and more specific locales such as China, Arabia, and
                    India.</p>
                  <p>Out of the three “clusters,” therefore, I only chose to keep <title level="a">Some Asian Poetics.</title> This was the section that made the most direct
                    intervention into the question of how to construct a global Romanticism by
                    reaching out to an area of the world rarely considered under this rubric. The
                    Asian poetics section is probably one of the most unique characteristics of the
                    book, yet of course it presented its own round of pedagogical difficulties, as
                    it almost stretches the term “Romanticism” to its breaking point. Rothenberg and
                    Robinson define the “romantic” as a concept referring “less to a historical
                    period and more to a quality of poetic intention—a visionary, expansive,
                    at times comic/ironic quickening of impulse and mind that can lead beyond poetry
                    to the larger world” (5–6). It refers to a set of “vital energies” that “counter
                    the perceived narrowness of vision and language imposed upon persons by
                    hegemonic and repressive societies then and now” (7).</p>
                  <p>This definition, broad though it is, was the only thread joining the poets in
                    this section together. The figures featured here, from Japan, Vietnam, China,
                    India, and Persia, produced work stretching from the late eighteenth century
                    into the early twentieth. They wrote in completely different forms—from
                    haiku to lu-shih and tz’u—occupied different social positions, and
                    responded to varying cultural and historical situations. This section, as it is
                    probably not hard to imagine, frustrates standard pedagogical methodologies, be
                    they formalist or historicist. First of all, it is difficult to perform nuanced
                    formal readings of excerpts of texts, much less of texts translated from
                    languages drastically different from English. Furthermore, it is close to
                    impossible to reproduce the history of such as wide group of countries for the
                    purpose of contextualizing poets, as well as situating poems in the contexts of
                    a poet’s wider career.</p>
                  <p>This move to the global, therefore, forces one to compensate for the loss of
                    these familiar tools. It does so by provoking the realization that literary
                    texts possess a dimension of meaning that could be called the “cosmic,” which
                    stretches beyond the formal and sociohistorical, although the latter dimensions
                    have garnered the greatest focus in literary studies. The word “cosmic” often
                    makes positivist and resolutely secular intellectuals sneer, but one can define
                    it simply as a trans-personal, trans-social ordering structure that cannot be
                    reduced to personal fantasy or projection on one hand, or the work of political
                    ideology on the other. It is the realm that exists, in Bibi Hayati’s words,
                    “before there was a hint of civilization,” and it is invoked in Rabindranath
                    Tagore’s phrase “heaven of freedom” (288, 291). Exploring the cosmic dimension
                    of literary texts—outside the realm of formal conventions, individual
                    psyches, and historical movements—helped add substance to Rothenberg and
                    Robinson’s definition of the “romantic” as a “visionary, expansive quickening of
                    impulse and mind that leads beyond poetry to the larger world,” where the larger
                    world comes to mean even the universe beyond the earth itself.</p>
                  <p>Centralizing “the cosmic” as a guiding hermeneutic made it easy to incorporate
                    the <title level="a">Book of Origins</title> into the syllabus, as many of the
                    texts—such as <title level="m">The Night Chant</title> and <title level="m">The Yarjurveda</title>—are overtly ritualistic in nature and
                    aim to access levels of reality transcending the mundane. Furthermore, my own
                    research focuses on the influence of ancient Egypt and various hermetic
                    traditions on the Romantic period, so this section provided an opportunity to
                    walk students through texts with which I was more familiar, such as <title level="m">The Egyptian Book of the Dead</title> and the <title level="m">Pistis Sophia</title>. However, this section also brought up questions
                    about Rothenberg and Robinson’s construction of a Romantic tradition. For
                    example, Wallis Budge did not translate the <title level="m">Book of the
                        Dead</title> until 1895, the very end of the nineteenth century. In what
                    respect, then, can Rothenberg and Robinson position this work as a Romantic
                    achievement or source text, other than the fact that it falls between a
                    pre-given structure of dates? It did not start to wield a large influence until
                    the work of early modernists like Joyce, Pound, and later figures such as
                    Lawrence Durrell. Again, it seems that Rothenberg and Robinson are stretching
                    the term Romanticism to a point of incoherence, which is not helped by the fact
                    none of the texts in this section are accompanied by any commentary which would
                    situate them in any respect, leaving the instructor to puzzle alone over how to
                    create coherent conversations about Scottish ballads, Aztec hymns, Welsh
                    folktales, and Sanskrit translations. Marching through this plethora of texts
                    brought so much battle fatigue that by the end of the semester, I decided to
                    remove the <title level="a">Book of Extensions</title> section from the syllabus
                    altogether and drastically condense the <title level="a">Manifestos and
                        Poetics</title> in order to have a series of review sessions.</p>
                  <p>The bulk of the class was spent reading through the galleries filled with poets
                    from Goethe to Apollinaire. In trying to winnow these down to a manageable size
                    (if reading over fifty poets in a semester can be called manageable), I tried to
                    keep Bloom’s criteria in mind—“aesthetic splendor, intellectual power,
                    wisdom”—but I did not have time to finish reading the entire anthology
                    before teaching with it, which will likely be the fate of most teachers of
                    global literature. Therefore, the goal became to include writers from as many
                    different countries as possible. Although I had never read or taught Sandor
                    Petofi before, he ended up on the syllabus as the representative of Hungary.
                    Rubén Darío (Nicaragua) and Sigbjørn Obstfelder (Norway) were other national
                    representatives. Often, I had to delete other authors for the same reason.
                    Because I wanted to focus on the French Symbolist line of Baudelaire, Mallarmé,
                    and Rimbaud, I felt comfortable removing Jules Laforgue and Joseph Joubert.
                    Great Britain was very well represented in this anthology, so I chose to cut
                    figures like John Clare, Thomas de Quincey, and Dorothy Wordsworth. As much as I
                    wanted to take out Lord Byron, as I am more interested in vatic than satiric
                    strains of Romanticism, it did not make sense to do so, especially given his
                    international influence. Removing him would have made discussions of others such
                    as Aleksandr Pushkin and Adam Mickiewicz quite difficult.</p>
                  <p>Yet as an organizing principle, trying to cover a spread of nations was certainly
                    random, as the anthology frustrates these and many other types of ordering
                    moves. The writers are all presented in chronological order, so it is difficult
                    for students to get a sense of the development of national traditions in
                    relationship to the global. Even now the class is over, I am sure that the
                    majority of the students do not remember that Leopardi is Italian, Kierkegaard
                    is Danish, and so on. If Rothenberg and Robinson had provided a simple chart of
                    everyone’s nationality, or even a timeline of the publishing of major works,
                    that would have helped tremendously.</p>
                  <p>While being attentive to the issue of representing voices from all over the
                    world, I also wanted to be sensitive to including the voices of women. Several
                    canonical Western women were included in this survey: de Staël, Dickinson,
                    Browning, Rossetti, Stein, Shelley, and Lady Guest. Mary Robinson, Dorothy
                    Wordsworth, and Adah Menken were the only women of European descent highlighted
                    in the anthology who were not in the syllabus. All of the Asian women excerpted
                    in <title level="m">PFM3</title> were added to the syllabus: Yosano Akiko, Bibi
                    Hayati, Wu Tsao, and Ho Xuan Huong.</p>
                  <p>At the risk of sounding repetitive, Rothenberg and Robinson’s definition of
                    Romanticism becomes quite hazy as the galleries unfold. For example, the poet
                    Arno Holz is included, although he is typically known as the first important
                    German theorist of naturalism. The major innovation of his major poem <title level="m">Phantasus</title> is that all of the lines are typographically
                    centered. Rothenberg and Robinson turn to Friedrich Kittler’s <title level="m">Discourse Networks</title>, 1800/1900 for commentary: “What the verses have
                    in view, then, are not readers and their understanding, but eyes and their
                    psychophysics, in other words…Holz’s <title level="m">Phantasus</title>, rather
                    than addressing fantasy as the surrogate of all senses in the finest romantic
                    manner, reckons with unconscious optokinetics” (835). If Holz moves away from
                    the “finest romantic manner,” in what respect can he be seen as an example of
                    Romanticism? It does not help that Rothenberg and Robinson add in the
                    introduction that “we wish to blur the distinctions of Romantic and Postromantic
                    as much as to insist on them” (7). Moves like this seem to make Romanticism
                    signify everything written in the extended nineteenth century, in contradiction
                    to the earlier definition provided of the romantic as a quality of poetic
                    intention.</p>
                  <p>Taking into account all these considerations and creating a syllabus after making
                    a large number of cuts, I still ended up with about four new writers on the
                    syllabus for each class meeting. (Classes were held every Tuesday and Thursday
                    for an hour and 15 minutes). The problem with this kind of organization is
                    obvious. For one, you completely overwhelm students who do not have any sense at
                    all of literary history. The most ridiculous effort was trying to use one class
                    period to speak about the Frenchmen Victor Hugo and Gérard de Nerval, the
                    Brownings (Robert and Elizabeth), and Thomas L. Beddoes. Admittedly, some weeks
                    were just a complete blur.</p>
                  <p>Attempting to survey the globe is demanding—for students and instructors. I
                    cannot say that I am an expert in Norwegian poetry, Finnish creation myth, and
                    haiku, yet I found myself in the strange position of having to mediate these
                    texts for students with no help. The major struggle of teaching a global
                    literature class is how to balance coverage with depth, and one has to be
                    prepared to spend hours figuring out how to achieve that balance. One of the
                    major disadvantages of <title level="m">PFM3</title> is that there is no
                    teaching apparatus analogous to what might be found in other anthologies such as
                    the Norton or Broadview—no annotations of unclear terms, no
                    bibliographies, no helpful charts or maps, no hints about classroom strategies
                    or topics for discussion and writing, etc. Furthermore, the presentation of
                    material is often distressing. In a section of excerpts from Blake’s <title level="m">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</title>, for example, there
                    is no editorial note to tell the reader which poems are of “innocence” and which
                    are of “experience,” and they are mixed together. In the Rimbaud section, poems
                    from <title level="m">A Season in Hell</title> and <title level="m">Illuminations</title> were jumbled without hints for new readers.</p>
                  <p>I attempted to turn this lack of an editorial apparatus into an opportunity for
                    teaching. For written work, I assigned biweekly assignments, where the students
                    were responsible for writing lists of discussion questions for each writer
                    covered and creating an annotated list of unfamiliar allusions and vocabulary.
                    And as I removed readings from the syllabus toward the end of the semester to
                    help us all maintain our sanity, I assigned presentations requiring students to
                    organize a discussion of three writers around a given theme.</p>
                  <p>Yet in addition to this lack of an editorial apparatus, the major difficulty of
                    using this text for teaching is its very specific frame and agenda for
                    interpreting global Romanticism. Rothenberg and Robinson’s goal here is to
                    redefine Romanticism so that it becomes a precursor to a very partisan
                    definition of “experimental modernism,” and to turn to Bloomian terminology
                    again, this is a very creative misreading. Rothenberg and Robinson privilege
                    texts that rely heavily on stylistic fragmentation, collage/montage techniques,
                    engagement with nonsense, obscure uses of grammar and syntax, the deprivileging
                    of the lyric self, opaque textures, and discontinuous typography. In effect,
                    Romanticism is portrayed as an artistic movement that leads directly to the work
                    of Ezra Pound.</p>
                  <p>This is not an exaggeration, and one can turn to any number of the commentaries
                    to see Pound as the spectral influence behind this collection, which is
                    especially odd given Pound’s many broadsides against the movement. One can
                    return to Rothenberg and Robinson’s commentary on Arno Holz for a first example:
                    “Increasingly experimental in his later writings (<title level="m">Phantasus</title> would expand to 60,000 lines by 1925 &amp; show a
                    Pound-like ambition to write a ‘<emph>Weltgedicht: a Nuova-Divinia</emph> after
                    Dante or <emph>Über-Odysee</emph> after Homer’), he reemerges today as a still
                    vital linking figure across the nineteenth- &amp; twentieth-century divide”
                    (835). And instead of focusing on the highly readable and teachable odes and
                    elegies of a figure like Friedrich Hölderlin, Rothenberg and Robinson choose to
                    emphasize severely fragmented works like the late palimpsestic <title level="m">Columbus</title>, from which I confess I could not draw any meaning,
                    especially given that the reader is only presented an excerpt from an already
                    incomplete piece. Rothenberg and Robinson quote the translator Richard Sieburth:
                    “The French phrases [in <title level="m">Columbus</title>] that punctuate the
                    text in Poundian fashion may be snippets overheard in the ports of Bordeaux
                    during Hölderlin’s residence in that city” (159). As a final (but not the last)
                    example, the Brazilian poet Sousandrade’s <title level="m">O Guesa
                        Errante</title>, which follows a legendary figure of the Colombian Muisca
                    Indians into the inferno of nineteenth-century Wall Street, is said to be “a
                    forerunner of EP’s Cantos and of many other modern poets” (663).</p>
                  <p>Since Rothenberg and Robinson work with the dictum that “experiments in form
                    often equate to, or imply the possibility of, social and spiritual/mental
                    transformations” (17), centralizing Pound in this way allows Rothenberg and
                    Robinson to wage a mimic war between those “radicals” that experiment with form
                    and the “conservatives” who work in traditional boundaries, between innovators
                    who favor the “playful, proliferating” Fancy and reactionaries who turn toward
                    the “synthetic, disinterested” Imagination (8). It is never made clear how
                    formal radicalism is related to political radicalism, and this polemic is not
                    only distracting, but it muddles the presentation of the material, as I will
                    show.</p>
                  <p>It is not a surprise that the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz was chosen for this
                    anthology. He almost fits a profile—he was directly involved in all sorts
                    of political intrigues and battles for independence and also the creator of a
                    nationalist epic (<title level="m">Pan Tadeusz</title>). An excerpt of that text
                    from Donald Davie’s “transcreation” is provided in <title level="m">PFM3</title>:

                           <l>unknown to proper Polish etiquette!</l>
                           <l>Such chaotic scenes would surely bother</l>
                           <l>the Judge, who’d rail to show he was upset.</l>
                           <l>Various dishes were brought to this company</l>
                           <l>by servants balancing immense trays</l>

                           <l>they walked through steamy, aromatic haze with tiny pots of coffee
                                and Dresden</l>
                           <l>China, each cup with its own jug of cream.</l>

                           <l>its preparation a custom held in esteem</l>

                     </quote> From Kress’ translation, one can more clearly see that the poem is an
                    epic in the mode of Byron and Pushkin, not a work of (proto)modernist
                    fragmentation. If one is trying to give a quick overview of Mickiewicz in a
                    survey of global literature, the latter translation is demonstrably better for
                    giving a flavor of his style, tone, and rhetorical stance. If Davie’s
                    translation is “radical,” then “radicalism” is a project verging on willful
                    incoherence, one that does a great disservice in the classroom. How rewritings
                    of this sort hasten spiritual or social transformation is quite beyond me,
                    unless the transformation is alienating a potential audience for poetry even
                    more. These types of problematic translations are found throughout the book,
                    with the next most egregious example being Robin Blaser’s translations of Gérard
                    de Nerval.</p>
                  <p>Rothenberg and Robinson’s fetishization of “radicalism” is also tied to an
                    ideology of collectivism that runs throughout this anthology and others that
                    Rothenberg has produced. In the introduction to his <title level="m">America a
                        Prophecy: A New Reading of American Poetry from Pre-Columbian Times to the
                        Present</title>, Rothenberg says: “our general intention has been to show
                    modes of poetry rather than individual poets, and any reader who takes what
                    follows as an attempt to draw up definitive lists of poets or to chart
                    chronologies of careers will have missed one of the fundamental premises of this
                    anthology” (xxxvi). (Even in this earlier project, the Romantic influence was
                    strong. The title comes from a William Blake poem.) Following this same goal in
                        <title level="m">Poems for the Millennium Volume Three</title>, Rothenberg
                    attempts to decenter the individual poet to think about Romanticism not only as
                    an international, but as a collective movement. There are many sophisticated
                    philosophical positions supporting this stance which I cannot explore here in
                    depth, and I do recognize the powerful tradition of critiques launched against
                    orthodox constructions of the modern bourgeois individual. However, I want to
                    point to the difficulty of teaching “modes of poetry” rather than “individual
                    poets.” Granted, this might simply be a sign of my lack of seasoned teaching,
                    but I found that I could not devise methods of teaching, creating assignments
                    on, and crafting assessments based on students’ grasp of modes of poetry, rather
                    than modes of poetry as concretized by specific figures in specific texts. In
                    reality, what this decentering of the individual seemed to amount to was having
                    a poet’s work spread throughout different sections. Poems by William Blake, for
                    example, were included in the <title level="a">Preludium,</title>
                     <title level="a">First Gallery,</title>
                     <title level="a">Book of Origins,</title>
                     <title level="a">Book of Extensions,</title>
                     <title level="a">Some Orientalisms,</title> and <title level="a">Manifestos
                        &amp; Poetics.</title> It seems that a more radical and consistent method of
                    imagining Romanticism as a collective project, one that allows the voice of
                    Poetry itself to speak, would have been to produce an anthology with no names of
                    poets (or editors) listed anywhere.</p>
                  <p>All in all, however, this course was a grand “experiment” (to use a favorite
                    Rothenberg and Robinson term) in learning how to imagine planetarity and teach
                    global Romanticism. The class was exciting, but not as successful as I might
                    have hoped. The students were not always kind in their reaction to this
                    demanding and eclectic course. The majority opinion was articulated in the pithy
                    comment: “Intense amount of reading for this class for painfully uninteresting
                    material. Tests are hard.” Thankfully, in the midst of negative feedback, there
                    were a few counter-voices, such as the following: “Doctor Redd’s class was a
                    very challenging, but rewarding one. The material is difficult, but he presents
                    it with an interesting spin. After working a lot, I walk away with an
                    appreciation of the subject matter.”</p>
                  <p>I surmise that elements of this course were deemed “intense,” “painfully
                    uninteresting,” “challenging,” and “difficult” for many reasons. Trying to
                    absorb the work of approximately fifty authors writing in vastly different
                    languages, styles, and forms over the course of a semester would be a challenge
                    even for a seasoned literary scholar, so it was unfair to expect that of
                    undergraduates without more of a structure to mediate this material for them.
                    Placing all of these writers on the syllabus seemed (before actually teaching
                    the course) to be an effective way to meet the challenge of presenting the full
                    global panoply of Romantic writing, but the sheer number of writers covered
                    meant that the course discussion could not dive deeply into any particular
                    figure or literary issue. The surface treatment of so many figures possibly
                    hindered the students from developing rich emotional connections to the
                    material, hence their rejection of it as “uninteresting.” This course went to an
                    extreme limit in its ambition to represent the global, and future courses on
                    global Romanticism will have to continue to think about how to balance broad and
                    deep coverage.</p>
                  <p>In the last week of teaching this course, I came across David Damrosch’s book
                        <title level="m">What Is World Literature?</title> I was surprised to see
                    him articulate something of my experience with this class and point toward a new
                    direction: <quote> Anthologies have been growing larger and larger, as teachers
                        and publishers have sought to encompass our ever-expanding canon. When we
                        are presenting a single national tradition, there is still a logic to giving
                        some sense of most of the currently acknowledged major authors, particularly
                        as time and space generally allow the inclusion of a range of less-known
                        figures as well. The task becomes impossible with any truly global vision of
                        world literature, and other approaches are plainly needed. At minimum, it
                        takes three points to define a plane surface, and perhaps three works,
                        interestingly juxtaposed and studied with care, can define a literary field.
                        (10) </quote> Damrosch here moves to the opposite extreme from my course.
                    Instead of broadening the syllabus, he calls for a radical stripping down of it.
                    The ideal global romanticism course probably lies between the minimalist
                    approach for which Damrosch advocates and the maximalist approach I pursued.
                    However, working with Damrosch’s “definition of world literature: not a set
                    canon of texts but a mode of reading, a detached engagement with a world beyond
                    our own” (297) will provide a key for building the theoretical infrastructure
                    needed to make teaching global Romanticism a project more coherent than the
                    juxtaposition of wide-ranging texts. This mode of reading might usefully engage
                    with the idea hastily sketched above about a “cosmic” dimension of the literary
                    text—one that interacts with its formal and sociohistorical dimensions
                    while transcending and not being reducible to them. It is this cosmic dimension
                    that could potentially help us understand nonlocal and nonlinear influences that
                    link seemingly unrelated writers and texts; discover new spiritual, political,
                    and ethical imperatives in our reading of world literature; and proclaim our
                    deep connectedness as a human species, despite boundaries that often assert
                    cultural incommensurability.</p>
                  <p>In the seven years since I taught this course in 2011, I have transitioned from a
                    faculty role to an administrative one. I no longer teach, so I write this
                    article to memorialize the thinking and effort that went into constructing this
                    course, an experiment that I hope other scholars of global Romanticism will take
                    up after me. I offer this course’s chaos and idiosyncrasies, yet also its
                    potential, daring, and boundary breaking.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">My aim is to consider the ways in which the “black Atlantic” and
                its combined focus on music and literature redefine the field of Romanticism and how
                this redefinition translates into the classroom. One pedagogical approach is to
                examine how Wheatley maps time, space, and memory through meter. Through attention
                Wheatley’s use of syncopation, it’s possible to see how her verse subverts the
                colonialist notion of mapping, accounting for and claiming ownership of internal and
                external space as well as rhythmical spaces of lines of poetry and typography. Her
                versified maps have spaces and places that are unaccounted for, that are merely
                implied and must be imagined, like a pulse that is felt but not heard. Such
                interstitial spaces are represented in her poetry by syncopation’s silences,
                omissions, ambiguities, ironies, reversals, (un)stressed syllables, and the music
                theory surrounding “on beats” and “off beats.” <title level="a">On Imagination</title> and <title level="a">On Being
                Brought from Africa to America</title> metaphorically re-plot the coordinates of her memory
                of the middle passage, as a metrically mapped journey from earth to heaven. Before
                Wordsworth and Coleridge, Wheatley’s autobiographical pentameter testified to the
                spiritually and politically transformative power of the Imag-I-Nation(s), remapping
                national, spiritual, emotional, racial, and spatial coordinates to challenge the
                understanding of the Enlightenment’s legacy in her day as well as the present.</p>

                        As teachers and scholars of Romanticism, we are in a position to address
                        these suggestions in our classrooms and publications. One important story
                        left largely untold to students of the long eighteenth century and Romantic
                        age is that of Phillis Wheatley and her versified journeys across “the color
                        line.” There is an urgent need to develop teaching techniques to counter the
                        legacies of segregation and erasure. One such approach involves reclaiming
                        the notion of “mapping” from its colonialist and imperialist past, and
                        deploying it as an anti-racist technology that charts the erasures,
                        silences, symbolisms, and double meanings and consciousnesses in a diverse
                        array of texts, from Wheatley’s poems to hashtagged phrases on Twitter. </p>
                  <p>The above hashtags, for instance, are calls for equality reverberating across
                        the world that have resonance beyond the literal. Indeed, the power of the
                        phrases even affects the hashtags themselves, imbuing them with a
                        double-voicedness and making them not just markers to categorize tweets, but
                        also symbols. From this perspective they are tiny graphs or miniature maps.
                        Their longitudinal and latitudinal lines chart the legacy of the slave trade
                        by mapping human rights violations of the past onto those of the present.
                        The off-kilter gridlines of the hashtags symbolize the fact that education’s
                        mapping of history did not involve (the) right angles, but skewed
                        perspectives: “School curriculums often whitewash the history of slavery and
                        the state’s role in oppressing Black people.” As a miniature map, a hashtag
                        has the subversive power to rechart conversations, connecting those tweeting
                        on a topic across the world. Symbolically, the points where the lines of a
                        hashtag meet represent intersections that connect the blank spaces bordered
                        by the lines. Reading against the grain and between the lines of hashtags,
                        song lyrics, and poetry, however, leads to the opposite notion: that it is
                        also the seemingly empty spaces, silences, and omissions that connect the
                        lines. </p>
                  <p>This essay suggests just such “mapping” as an interpretive and pedagogical
                        strategy to address the pressing need to create “Curriculums That Critically
                        Examine the Political, Economic, and Social Impacts of Colonialism and
                        Slavery.” Doing so necessitates charting the places, texts, oral histories,
                        artifacts, and traditions that were left off the map and changing its
                        orientation to expose the lines the colonizers erased, distorted, and/or
                        never delineated. The blank spaces between the hashtags’ lines represent
                        “erasure”: “Stories of African American history are often left untold or are
                        under-told, and many individuals have no understanding of the extraordinary
                        sacrifices that were made and hardships that were overcome” (<title level="a">Reparations</title>). One such under-told narrative is that of
                        Wheatley’s radicalism. Lines have been drawn around the lines she has
                        written that—like the borders of the Atlantic rim’s still-segregated
                        cities—do not become abundantly clear to all until viewed on a map. </p>

                        an exponential number of connections between any two topics; however,
                        juxtaposing the “Mind Maps” of “Romanticism” and “Phillis Wheatley” yields
                        not even a single connection between the two. Segregation—one of the
                        lasting effects of slavery—is not limited to the housing of people,
                        but also the living spaces of ideas and (a)venues of thought.

                        Connecting these two seemingly separate fields of study does not
                        involve mapping Wheatley to Romanticism, but the opposite. Simply adding a
                        Wheatley poem to a course on the Romantics is not enough. Wheatley’s work
                        merits a central spot in the syllabus and a concomitant examination of the
                        ways her centrality forces a reconsideration and reconfiguration of the
                        field, remapping its borders and boundaries. See

                        of a syllabus that examines Black Atlantic Romanticisms, connecting early
                        writers of the African Diaspora with canonical Romantics as well as
                        present-day musical artists. </p>

                  <p>Susan Manning’s <title level="m">Fragments of Union</title>, particularly the
                        final chapter: <title level="a">Mapping the Language: A Scottish-American
                            Stylistics of Consciousness,</title> examines how Scottish authors used
                        punctuation and syntax politically to disrupt the King’s and Queen’s English
                        and colonial authority, dividing and unifying not just sentence structures,
                        but also political ones. Manning’s contextualization and positioning of the
                        Scottish-American rhetoric of the American Revolution helps clarify
                        Wheatley’s subversive relationship to the Enlightenment and Romanticism. It
                        reveals a reading of <ref target="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45465/on-being-brought-from-africa-to-america)">
                        <title level="a">On Being Brought from Africa to
                            America</title>
                     </ref> that radically departs from previous
                        interpretations and connects Wheatley to Romanticism. It illuminates how her
                        verse subverts the colonialist notion of mapping by accounting for and
                        claiming ownership of internal and external space. Wheatley’s conceptual
                        maps have spaces and places that are merely implied and must be imagined. 
                        Such interstitial spaces are represented in her poetry by silences,
                        syncopations, omissions, ambiguities, ironies, and reversals. Some of the
                        most interesting moments occur when she metaphorically re-plots the
                        coordinates of her memory of the middle passage, as a journey from earth to
                        heaven. In her poetry, Wheatley remaps spiritual, emotional, racial, and
                        spatial coordinates, challenging the understanding of the Enlightenment’s
                        legacy for readers then and now.</p>
                  <p>When teaching <title level="a">On Being Brought from Africa to
                            America</title> I ask the students to meet in groups and request that
                        they scan the poem, paying attention to which words are accentuated by the
                        meter and which are not; note the rhythm of the verse and how it’s affected
                        by punctuation; and interpret the poem word for word, being sure to map how
                        Wheatley represents herself through elisions, silences, double meanings,
                        voicedness, and consciousnesses. The most intriguing technique employed by
                        Wheatley is her mapping metrically through syncopation, which can form the
                        basis of a class-wide analysis of the way she uses iambic pentameter in this
                        poem. In order to implement this classroom activity, students will need
                        chalk (or dry-erase) boards or computers with screens that can be made
                        visible to the whole class via projection. In order to build the ideological
                        foundation, they will also need a basic understanding of iambic pentameter
                        and the notion of syncopation in poetry and music. Once they have a working
                        knowledge of these ideas, it will be possible to see how she not only
                        syncopates poetic beats by using apostrophes to contract words, but also
                        uses this grammatical syncopation to bring about a musical one through her
                        use of iambic pentameter.  In the first line of <title level="a">On Being
                            Brought from Africa to America,</title> for instance, any reference to
                        herself occurs on a weak or unstressed beat.  In order to examine how the
                        poem’s stressed and unstressed beats reveal the radical ideas of the
                        poet/and or speaker, students will also need to be grounded theoretically in
                        W. E. B. Du Bois’s concept of “double consciousness” and Paul Gilroy’s
                        notion of the “Black Atlantic.” If students copy the poem onto a dry-erase
                        board and circle all of the stressed words and/or syllables, it will become
                        apparent at a glance that although “me” occurs on an unstressed beat in the
                        first line of the poem, in subsequent lines Wheatley begins to refer to
                        herself, God, and fellow black people on stressed beats, thereby utilizing
                        syncopation to illuminate metrically and rhythmically the beatitudinal
                        notion that the “weak” shall be strong and the last shall be first. It is
                        important here to point out that in musical syncopation the weak beat
                        becomes the strong one, which is absent. In the essay that follows, I will
                        attempt to reconstruct this classroom activity in a reading of the poem that
                        maps the double-voicedness of each line of the poem, highlighting a more
                        radical interpretation as well as historical context along the way. As a
                        pedagogical and interpretive technique, mapping combines close reading with
                        critical race theory to examine and interpret subversion in texts written by
                        authors who did not have the freedom to be openly radical.</p>
                  <p>A course on Romanticism(s) that begins with Black Atlantic writers and
                        abolitionists as a precursor to the American, French, and Haitian
                        revolutions as well as other revolts against slavery and colonialism
                        provides an important starting point for students’ understanding the modes
                        of revolutionary discourse available to radical writers, like Wheatley.
                        Although Wordsworth and Coleridge are credited with penning autobiographical
                        pentameter that testifies to the spiritually and politically transformative
                        power of the imagination, Wheatley’s poetry makes it abundantly clear that
                        she helped originate a style (that subverted Enlightenment poetry in ways)
                        that the big 6 Romantics have been credited with creating. A useful
                        pedagogical concept for teaching Wheatley and Romanticism(s) is
                        “Imag-I-Nations”: a term that denotes the ways Atlantic thinkers represent
                        themselves and construct identity along (trans)national lines as well as the
                        way the imagination embroiders the representation of self through metaphors
                        that map authors’ and readers’ journeys across nations, realms, and borders
                        (geographic, physical, spiritual, temporal, transcendental, and mental)
                        (Pace 238).</p>
                  <p> What Manning refers to as “The Cartography of Consciousness” (12) becomes
                        the cartographies of double-consciousness (Du Bois 2–3) when applied to
                        Wheatley, whose support for the American Revolution is linked to her own
                        sense of identity in New England and the way the “integrity and structure of
                        selfhood (or its disintegration) mirror those of the nation: both are unions
                        of potentially disjunctive parts. Disintegration of the nation threatens
                        integrity of personal identity” (Manning 12). The double consciousness in
                        Wheatley’s poetry will become evident to students as they draw parallels
                        between America’s struggle for freedom from British rule and her own fight
                        for liberty from slavery. To understand how this poem functions as
                        Wheatley’s declaration of independence, it is necessary to map the poem’s
                        double voicedness in the context of Atlantic revolutionary rhetoric.
                        Wheatley’s <title level="m">Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and
                            Moral</title> (1773) was printed in London three years before America
                        declared independence. The book begins with a <title level="a">Copy of a
                            Letter sent by the Author’s Master to the Publisher,</title> in which
                        John Wheatley notes that “Phillis was brought from <emph>Africa</emph> to
                            <emph>America</emph> in the Year 1761, between Seven and Eight Years of
                        Age.” Phillis echoes this language in the title of <title level="a">On Being
                            Brought from Africa to America.</title> In order to map the double
                        consciousness of the poem and its subversion of her “master’s” narrative,
                        students should look up each of the poem’s nouns and verbs in the <title level="m">Oxford English Dictionary</title>; ask them to search, on the
                        one hand, for definitions that would have proven amenable to pro-slavery
                        readers and, on the other, ones that would have challenged the racist
                        ideologies and rhetoric that undergirded the slave trade. Mapping the
                        double-voicedness of each and every noun and verb gives students the
                        opportunity to see how the title’s seemingly innocuous passive verb phrase
                        becomes subversive when “Being” is read as a noun. Mapping the space between
                        the double meaning of “Being” as a helping verb, and also as representing
                        the idea that slave ships are carrying not only human beings across the
                        Atlantic, but also the philosophical notion of <emph>being</emph> and its
                        concomitant notions of human rights indicates the double consciousness of
                        the author and/or speaker. In the context of the transatlantic discourses of
                        liberty that the Declaration of Independence arises from, Wheatley’s notion
                        of “Being” carries the import of a “living creature, either corporeal or
                        spiritual; <emph>esp.</emph> a human being, a person” (<title level="m">OED</title>), who thus has inherent rights: “We hold these truths to be
                        self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their
                        Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty
                        and the pursuit of Happiness” (<title level="a">Declaration of
                            Independence</title> 127).</p>
                  <p>As Manning points out, Jefferson’s Declaration is drawing its notion of human
                        rights from Scottish Enlightenment philosophy’s reaction to René Descartes
                        and others. In his language of self-evident truths, Jefferson is also
                        influenced by a philosophical tradition indebted to Descartes’s notion of
                        thought as the foundation of being: “Cogito Ergo Sum”: <quote> What then am
                            I? A thing which thinks. What is a thing which thinks? It is a thing
                            which doubts, understands, conceives, affirms, denies, wills, refuses,
                            which also imagines and feels … For it is so <emph>evident of
                                itself</emph> that it is I who doubts, who understands, and who
                            desires, that there is no reason here to add anything to explain it. And
                            I have certainly the power of imagining likewise; for although it may
                            happen (as I formerly supposed) that none of the things which I imagine
                            are true, nevertheless this power of imagining does not cease to be
                            really in use, and it forms part of my thought. (Descartes 37) </quote>
                        The unwritten motto of Wheatley’s book of poems can be summarized as, “I
                        write therefore I have rights.” Her mastery of language and rhetoric makes
                        her equality self-evident to readers and remaps their thinking causing them
                        to imagine a world and afterlife built on this principle, which is why
                        Jefferson is threatened enough to disparage her in his <title level="m">Notes on the State of Virginia</title> (1786): <quote> Misery is often
                            the parent of the most affecting touches in poetry.—Among the
                            blacks is misery enough, God knows, but no poetry. Love is the peculiar
                            oestrum of the poet. Their love is ardent, but it kindles the senses
                            only, not the imagination. Religion indeed has produced a Phyllis
                            Whately [<emph>sic</emph>]; but it could not produce a poet. The
                            compositions published under her name are below the dignity of
                            criticism. (Jefferson 234) </quote> Were he to admit the merit of her
                        poetry, Jefferson would have to concede the equality of African Americans
                        and concomitantly abolish slavery, as his opponent Benjamin Rush is quick to
                        point out (Rush 2n). Descartes and Jefferson hinge their notions of innate
                        and divinely appointed rights, respectively, on the presence of the godlike
                        capacity of imagination. To declare her equality, Wheatley pens a poem
                            <title level="a">On Imagination.</title> In a rhetorical move that
                        anticipates Coleridge’s writing an <title level="a">Ode to Dejection</title>
                        (that declares his lack of ability to write in a beautifully written poem),
                        Wheatley double-voicedly proclaims her lack of imagination in a poem that
                        subtly points readers to its (and her) divine origin. With a radical
                        politics and poetics of liberation theology, she uses her moral compass to
                        set a course (away from the duality that underwrites slavery) towards
                        salvation, and she employs the telescope of verse to “measure the skies, and
                        range the realms above. / There in one view we grasp the mighty whole, / Or
                        with new worlds amaze th’unbounded soul” (<title level="a">On
                            Imagination,</title> ll. 20–22). Rather than bodies arriving in chains
                        to the “new world,” the soul arrives in the “new worlds” of heaven
                        “unbounded,” or free. Instead of endorsing the slave trade and echoing her
                        master’s passive diction about her being brought from Africa to America,
                        Wheatley maps a middle passage between earth and heaven to illustrate a
                        godlike perspective of unity that exposes the artificial binaries intact in
                        the Anglo-American discourse that underwrites the slave trade.</p>
                  <p>A beneficial classroom activity is to compare Wheatley to spoken word or hip
                        hop artists, such as Lauryn Hill or Kendrick Lamar, who directly and
                        forcefully denounce racism, and then to ask students to imagine how the poem
                        would have read if Wheatley were free to speak her mind. Reading the poem
                        alongside her 11 February 1774 letter to the Native American minister Samson
                        Occom and its open condemnation of slavery and oppression draws attention to
                        the radicalism of the missive and function of silence (on this topic) in the
                        poem. In <title level="a">On Being Brought from Africa to America,</title>
                        Wheatley also maps silence and omission: missing from the title, but present
                        in the minds of her readers, is what connects Africa to America: the
                        Atlantic. The presence of the Atlantic is more powerful for its absence, and
                        the poem continues to make use of elision to map interstitial spaces and
                        conceal powerful presences in the first line of the poem: “’Twas mercy
                        brought me from my <emph>Pagan</emph> land.” Just as the passive verb form
                        of the title removes herself and any agency, so too does the opening
                        character of the poem. The apostrophe is turned outward, a closing single
                        quotation mark facing a letter printed in invisible ink. It erases
                        Wheatley’s presence by metonymically standing in for the “I,” which should
                        be the first letter of the poem. The “I” has been removed, displaced.</p>
                  <p>Another way to make this poem more accessible to students is to teach it
                        alongside relevant songs by Bob Marley. For instance, although the following
                        lines from his “Redemption Song” were written more than two centuries later,
                        they explain the metaphorical significance of the missing “I” in Wheatley’s
                        first line: <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                           <l>Old pirates, yes, they rob I;</l>
                           <l>Sold I to the merchant ships,</l>
                           <l>Minutes after they took I</l>
                           <l>From the bottomless pit. (Marley)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> In one possible reading of this double-voiced poem, the passivity
                        of the title and opening character remove “being” and selfhood, as does
                        slavery; however, remapping the negative space, the selves and concomitant
                        rights are powerfully, self-evidently present. Eliding the first letter of
                        the poem is a literal silence in this opening line of iambic pentameter. The
                        unstressed/stressed cadence of the iamb gives the poem a musical pattern. A
                        Black Atlantic analysis of Wheatley’s use of iambic feet and her “sounds of
                        silence” (Simon) stretches back further in space and time than Pope’s, or
                        even Chaucer’s, use of heroic couplets in England. Syncopation, like an
                        iambic foot, depends upon the interplay between stressed and unstressed to
                        create a rhythm. In poetry, syncopation is the “contraction of a word by
                        omission of one or more syllables or letters in the middle” (<title level="m">OED</title>), which is exemplified by the first word in the
                        poem.</p>
                  <p>In music, syncopation is the “action of beginning a note on a normally
                        unaccented part of the bar and sustaining it into the normally accented
                        part, so as to produce the effect of shifting back or anticipating the
                        accent; the shifting of accent so produced” (<title level="m">OED</title>).
                        African syncopation found its way into European music via the Mediterranean,
                        Greece, and Rome, as well as through the Berber tribes in southern Spain and
                        Italy (Strange), before it crossed the Atlantic and fused with
                        already-existing syncopation of Native American tribes and civilizations, as
                        well as English and Irish folk music in the unaccounted for roots and routes
                        of African American spirituals and jazz (Radano). Wheatley musically
                        syncopates poetic syncopation by contracting the word at the beginning
                        rather than the middle. In closing the typographical and sonic space between
                        “It was” and removing the “I” in “’Twas,” Wheatley is subtly remapping her
                        (readers’) journey across space and time and using syncopation as a
                        chronotope. By demonstrating her ability to alter space and time in the
                        world of verse, Wheatley is not only echoing the power of the
                        Judeo-Christian God of slaveholders, but also subtly asserting her own
                        divine origin and destination. She anticipates the Coleridgean primary
                        imagination and the “infinite I am,” implying (Supreme) “Being” in the title
                        as well as the unnamed bestower of the first line’s “mercy.”</p>
                  <p> One pedagogical approach is to break the students into 8 groups, one for
                        each line of the poem. Then, ask each group to map the rhythm of their line
                        by writing it on a dry-erase board with the stressed beats or words in bold,
                        encouraging them to look up each word in the <title level="m">OED</title>
                        and to examine Wheatley’s use of meter, which (parts of) words she chooses
                        to stress or not. Moving line by line through the poem with attentiveness to
                        its shifts in tone from self as passive recipient of action to the
                        imperative tone of the final couplet affords students the opportunity to
                        plot the coordinates of their journey as readers and the poem’s abolitionist
                        self actualization. The poem begins, however, by deemphasizing or concealing
                        the self: <quote>
                        <lg type="line">
                           <l>’Twas <hi rend="bold">mer</hi>cy <hi rend="bold">brought</hi> me
                                        <hi rend="bold">from</hi> my <hi rend="bold">
                                 <emph>Pa</emph>
                              </hi>
                              <hi rend="italic">gan</hi>
                           </l>
                           <l>
                              <hi rend="bold">land</hi>, (l. 1)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> The words “me” and “my” are carefully placed on unstressed
                        syllables of the iambic feet, and despite the active verb, the self is acted
                        upon, (as in the title), but does not act and is not emphasized. However, if
                        the “I” of the poem’s first word were restored (to read “It was” rather than
                        “’Twas”), the poem would scan differently with “me” and “my” being stressed
                        rather than unstressed. Wheatley uses iamb to declare “I Am.” Also, in the
                        typography of the first edition, the word “land” appears alone, in its own
                        line, and thus metaphorically positioned as the slave ship (which is not
                        mentioned in the narrative poetry) moving between the first and second line
                        of the poem and floating in an Atlantic of blank space (McKenzie).</p>
                  <p>The second line takes a significant, but subtle, step forward in emphasizing
                        the self by accenting the first-person possessive pronoun: <quote>
                        <lg type="line">
                           <l>Taught <hi rend="bold">my</hi> be<hi rend="bold">night</hi>ed <hi rend="bold">soul</hi> to <hi rend="bold">un</hi>der<hi rend="bold">stand</hi> (l. 2)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> In accenting the word “my,” the poem functions like syncopation in
                        music, emphasizing that which has been de-emphasized. The first three
                        emphasized syllables taken together (without the unaccented ones in between)
                        read “my night soul.” These words can be thrown into relief by their
                        appearance in bold on the board, and also by leading a class-wide recitation
                        of each line in which the students also clap while articulating the accented
                        syllables. These three little words celebrate both Wheatley’s blackness and
                        fly in the face of the theology of slaveholders, who claimed that black
                        people did not have souls and thus could not be saved. Wesley and Whitefield
                        moved a step beyond this racist theology by preaching to black people, slave
                        and “free” alike; however, their theology still accommodated the existence
                        of slavery. In Wheatley’s theology, she transcends the theology of the
                        preachers of the Great Awakening: she holds that her soul has understanding,
                        anticipating the Coleridgean distinction between reason and
                        understanding.</p>
                  <p>Although in the first couplet, the speaker still does not perform actively as
                        the subject of a verb, her soul is the indirect object of “taught” and the
                        implied subject of the infinitive “to understand.” Also, “soul” moves a
                        small step closer to subject-hood in the third line, for it is (the direct
                        object of) “taught”: <quote>
                        <lg type="line">

                        </lg>
                     </quote> As in the first syllable of the first line, the apostrophe (of
                        “there’s”) removes the “i” in both accented occurrences. Significantly and
                        importantly for the theological implications of typography and scansion in
                        this poem, “God” is accented, indicating a consciousness of the importance
                        of emphasizing divinity and paralleling the divine being with the spiritual
                        being of Wheatley’s soul in the previous line and title. This third line
                        also maps double consciousness: the single consciousness “That there’s a
                        God” is twinned by the awareness “That there’s a <emph>Saviour</emph> too.”
                        The repetition creates parallelism by contrasting the wrathful god of the
                        Torah (seemingly placating readers who held the racist view that dark skin
                        is the “mark of Cain,” but then subtly subverting this view) with the
                        presence of the merciful Jesus of the Christian New Testament, not implying
                        damnation, but rather salvation for black people.</p>
                  <p>In order to map the subversive qualities of the rhythm in the opening three
                        lines, it’s necessary to prepare the class with lectures or student
                        presentations on the presence and history of syncopation in music. In
                        traditional African American and Black Atlantic music from spirituals to
                        jazz to reggae to hip hop, syncopation is subversive: it accentuates the
                        usually unaccented beat, referred to as the “and” of the beat, while the
                        accented “strong” beat is left silent or unaccented. This aspect can be
                        exemplified by dividing the class and leading them in clapping their hands
                        to a 4/4 rhythm with one half clapping on the “on beat” and the other on the
                        “off beat.” There’s also the possibility of analyzing the rhetoric of why we
                        refer to these beats as “on” and “strong” as opposed to “off” and “weak.”
                        Wheatley’s removing herself from the beginning of the poem is symbolic
                        syncopation, a performative poetics and logical reversal, in accord with the
                        Biblical injunction, “So the last shall be first, and the first last”
                        (Matthew 20:16).</p>
                  <p>The connection between syncopated rhythms, the history of slavery, and
                        disenfranchised people is made clear in Bob Marley’s reggae “riddims,” which
                        accentuate the “weak” beat throughout as he renders this musical reversal
                        political by singing, “Now the weak must be strong” (Marley <title level="a">Them Belly Full…</title>). Playing reggae aloud in the classroom will
                        allow students to hear how the chucking of the guitar and bubbling of the
                        keyboard land on the “weak” beat, which is made strong by these instruments
                        emphasizing it in unison. In classical music, a beat is divided into an
                        accented “downbeat” followed by unaccented “and” of the beat. However, the
                        rhythm of an iamb, exactly like syncopation, reverses this emphasis by
                        beginning with the unstressed syllable, followed by the stressed one. In a
                        more abstract way, a similar reversal occurs over the first half of the
                        poem. Continuing to map the poem’s marked shift in the first four lines from
                        deemphasizing the passive self to emphasizing the active self, the next
                        coordinate is where the “I” is finally accentuated: <quote>
                        <lg type="line">
                           <l>Once <hi rend="bold">I</hi> re<hi rend="bold">demp</hi>tion <hi rend="bold">nei</hi>ther <hi rend="bold">sough</hi>t nor
                                    <hi rend="bold" xml:space="preserve">knew </hi>(l. 4)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> As in musical syncopation, the poem uses rhythm to make the “weak”
                        “strong” implying a theological reversal of fortunes. Wheatley masks this
                        revolutionary moment syntactically with the “neither/nor” construct; now the
                        action of self is negated, or only implied by what the “I” does not do. In
                        the first line, all references to Wheatley land on unaccented syllables, but
                        in the fourth line “I” lands on an accented syllable. The beat is reversed,
                        so to speak, as is the line from and emphasis from <title level="a">Amazing
                            Grace</title>: “I once was lost.” Thus what was once unstressed becomes
                        stressed; similarly, syncopation accents the previously unaccented part of
                        the beat. This line is rhythmically double voiced: it can scan two ways. It
                        is possible also to scan the “Once” as stressed, creating an accent shift
                        that syncopates the iambic foot by making it trochaic. In-class listening to
                        African American spirituals with attention to the reversals of being damned
                        or saved and the function of water (anticipating or perhaps influencing
                        Coleridge’s <title level="a">Rime of the Ancient Mariner</title>) is an
                        illuminating way out from Wheatley to wider contexts of interplay among
                        rhythms, words, and liberation theology.</p>
                  <p>Two contexts emerge as equally important to understanding the subtle
                        gradations of meaning and concomitant power shifts in the poem: musical
                        syncopation and Atlantic revolutionary rhetoric. The latter is established
                        in Manning’s chapter on <title level="a">Mapping the Language,</title> the
                        perfect reading to assign to the class as a way to bridge the European
                        American and Black Atlantic rhetoricities of revolution. Wheatley’s shift in
                        this poem models, according to Hugh Blair’s 1759 <title level="m">Lectures
                            in Rhetoric and Belles Lettres</title>, the linguistic progression from
                        “primitive” to “civilized” cultures. Manning discusses Blair’s racist
                        understanding of the relationship between civilization and syntax: <quote>
                            Primitive peoples like the American Indians order their sentences
                            according to instinct and imagination, first naming the object of
                            attention, then indicating their desired relationship to it. As
                            civilizations progress, their use of language inverts this order,
                            placing the self at the head, and distancing the thing, the object,
                            further into the syntax of the sentence. This new order ‘may be called
                            the order of the understanding.’ (247) </quote> Manning provides the
                        perspective to see what is at stake for Wheatley in exemplifying this shift
                        to prove her ability with language, as she had to do before the group of
                        Boston rimy-wigged statesmen who interviewed her to certify that she
                        actually wrote the poems. In the first four lines, Wheatley mirrors this
                        progression. Take, for instance, the first line: “’Twas Mercy brought me
                        from my <emph>Pagan</emph> land,” which seemingly names the object of
                        attention “Mercy” and states her relationship to it. However, Wheatley again
                        subverts established revolutionary rhetoric: rather than moving herself
                        further from her object (election) she juxtaposes the two of them, moving as
                        close as possible to salvation: “Once <emph>I redemption</emph>” (4).</p>
                  <p>In 1778, the Anglo-Scot James Beattie articulated just what was at stake for
                        the colonized in adopting the language of the colonizer and indicated that
                        the practice of slavery was supported by Atlantic English; transatlantic
                        rhetoric had glossed over the horrors of slavery, naturalizing it in
                        metaphor: <quote> We are slaves to the language we write, and are
                            continually afraid of committing <emph>gross</emph> blunders. [….] An
                            English author of learning is the master, not the slave, of his
                            language, and wields it gracefully, because he wields it with ease, and
                            with full assurance that he has command of it. (Forbes 17) </quote> In
                        order to overturn the slave trade, Wheatley had to subvert it
                        linguistically, poetically, and theologically. Manning comments on Beattie’s
                        words by noting that “self-consciousness about style had an edge of fear
                        which elided the social and the eschatological. Somewhere within it was a
                        belief that to get it wrong was not simply to risk derision but damnation”
                        (242). The poem accommodates a pro-slavery reading as well as an
                        abolitionist one, ultimately reflecting the readers’ views in their
                        interpretation and perhaps changing readers’ minds with the possibility of
                        the more radical interpretation that extends the principles of the
                        Enlightenment to all. In this way, the poem functions as a map to salvation,
                        potentially charting a course for equality in the reader’s mind. This
                        context maps how Wheatley reversed the roles of the colonizer and colonized
                        in her poem: she wields language so carefully that she becomes the master
                        and her reader in need of emancipation “from mental slavery” (Marley, <title level="a">Redemption Song</title>). Wheatley’s poem, to paraphrase
                        Blake, cleanses the doors of perception, removing the “mind-forg’d manacles”
                        (line 8) so the slavery advocate can become an abolitionist. John Newton
                        leads his readers on a similar journey from passivity to agency in words
                        that are as close to Wheatley’s in meaning as they are in date of
                        composition (1772): <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                           <l>Amazing grace! (how sweet the sound)</l>

                           <l>I once was lost, but now I am found,</l>
                           <l>Was blind, but now I see. (Newton)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> This hymn, like Wheatley’s poem, maps a route to heaven.</p>
                  <p> Just as the class is able to map the double voicedness of each word’s
                        meanings as well as the metric binary of stressed and unstressed beats, it
                        is also important that the class map the split between the first four lines
                        of the poem and the last. Before arriving at salvation, Wheatley pauses to
                        reflect on earthly limitations. The second half of <title level="a">On Being
                            Brought from Africa to America</title> contains a shift from the past to
                        the present tense. Wheatley’s identity emerges through the use of the word
                        “our.” She identifies herself as black and separates potentially racist
                        readers from her and her people: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>Some <hi rend="bold">view</hi> our <hi rend="bold">sa</hi>ble <hi rend="bold">race</hi> with <hi rend="bold">scorn</hi>ful <hi rend="bold">eye</hi>

                           <l>‘Their <hi rend="bold">co</hi>lour <hi rend="bold">is</hi> a <hi rend="bold">di</hi>a<hi rend="bold">bo</hi>lic <hi rend="bold">die</hi>’ (ll. 5–6)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> The heraldic “sable” linked with “race” is positive, subverting the
                        negative view of those who believe the racist theology of dark skin as the
                        mark of Cain. The “I” disappears again in the sight of the prejudice in the
                        “eye” of the slaveholder, but “sable” shows that beauty is in the “I” of the
                        be(-k)nighted poet and quill holder. In heraldry, “sable” is symbolized as a
                        shield that is half black and half white with black gridlines over the white
                        background, symbolizing being protected by the aegis of blackness. This
                        symbolism creates a counter-reading to the racist theology about dark skin,
                        with a scriptural allusion to the mark of Cain as a sign that its bearer is
                        unable to be killed, a hint at afterlife and reversal of “die” and death.
                        The other half of the shield with the gridlines represents an almost
                        yin-yang deconstruction of the Manichean duality that undergirds slavery,
                        mapping a journey across opposites. Wheatley’s fifth line also reflects the
                        mapping of the journey of slave ships, since “sable” is also defined as “by
                        sea” and “race” as a “journey” (<title level="m">OED</title>).</p>
                  <p> The final couplet contains the most powerful language. The verb tense
                        undergoes a giant shift from passive in the first line to imperative in the
                        penultimate one: <quote>
                        <lg>

                        </lg>
                     </quote> Whereas the lines appear as a plea for the possibility of slaves in
                        the afterlife, the fact that “me,” “Christ,” “black,” “join,” and “train”
                        are all accented hints at a reading far more radical in the context of
                        Puritanical Boston than at first appears: Wheatley and her fellow black
                        people occupy the seats among the elect that the Puritans had reserved for
                        themselves, for they are with Christ among those predestined for salvation.
                        The implied subject of the imperative “Remember” is “you,” although her
                        hortatory auditors are “Christians”; thus, Wheatley commands the subjects of
                        her (death) sentence to recall that they (the pro-slavery readers) may also
                        “be refin’d.” The emphasis on “<hi rend="bold">Christ</hi>ianity” puts the
                        “I” (sound) back in the word, mapping the difference between Christ-ians
                        (those who are Christ-like) and <emph>Christians</emph> (those who support
                        slavery). The slaveholders, however, “may [possibly] be refin’d, and join
                        the angelic train” should they follow this poem’s map to salvation
                        correctly.</p>
                  <p>According to the hegemonic reading, the final couplet seems to be using what
                        Manning refers to as hypotaxis, use of syntax to imply a hierarchical
                        relationship, seemingly making the black people subordinate to the elect,
                        independent white people; however, the punctuation also allows for a
                        subversive reading that reveals the opposite: “so the last shall be first,
                        and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen” (Matthew 20:16).
                        This reading goes significantly beyond Whitefield and Wesley to a Greater
                        Awakening of abolitionist theology. A third reading reveals parataxis, the
                        “placing of propositions or clauses one after another, without indicating by
                        connecting words the relation (of coordination or subordination) between
                        them” (<title level="m">OED</title>). Susan Manning notes how parataxis
                        eliminates hierarchy, making the items in the list equal and
                        interchangeable, and in this instance Wheatley maps the spaces between them.
                        This indicates the potential sinfulness and subsequent salvation for all
                        through the process of being “refin’d.” In this reading, the politics of
                        punctuation become crucial; focusing on the commas that separate
                        “Christians, Negros, black as Cain” makes the items listed interchangeable,
                        thus opening up the possibility that it is the slaveholding Christians whose
                        souls are black as Cain” and in need of refinement, and not the opposite as
                        the hegemonic reading would yield. The possibilities the poem’s parataxis
                        opens up require that students examine the ways the poem is freighted with
                        double meanings and double consciousness. Wheatley uses syntax to levy a tax
                        on sin. With one reading it becomes the duty of the reader to critique the
                        customs of society steeped in the Atlantic slave trade and acknowledge that
                        even the souls of slave traders and owners can be saved. Even the other
                        far-less-radical reading posits that black people have souls and may be
                        among the elect, ideas not accepted widely (or even outright denied) among
                        pro-slavery Christians.</p>
                  <p>Scholars, such as Philip Gould, have noted the final couplet’s metaphorical
                        resonance with the refining of cane sugar on plantations (Gould), but have
                        not discussed how the imagery of this process sustains the metaphor, with
                        the cut stalks of cane appearing as bones and referred to with such words as
                        “black, white, and ivory bone char” that are placed in boiling houses
                        through seven smaller and increasingly hotter kettles (baptismal fonts) only
                        to emerge as the stardust of white sugar crystals, or as molasses syrup
                        decolorized through filtration. The molasses and sugar were shipped across
                        the Atlantic and sold in England and other countries with the profit going
                        toward purchasing more slaves. Quaker leader William Fox noted the mock
                        transubstantiation of sugar plantations and the taste for sugar that
                        sustained them, noting that every pound of sugar consumed may be considered
                        as consuming two ounces of human flesh. Wheatley’s final couplet likens the
                        processes by which cane is cut, refined, and transformed into sugar to
                        death, resurrection, and ascension, thereby charting the coordinates of the
                        voyage from earth to heaven, as opposed to the journey from Africa to
                        American slavery. The intimation that the suffering of slaves on plantations
                        is comparable to Christ’s suffering, crucifixion, and death is made clear in
                        the juxtaposition of “Christians, Negros.” Adding “Black as Cain” reverses
                        the idea that enslaved black people have the mark of Cain and, instead,
                        marks them as Abel, murdered by their brothers. This anticipates a similar
                        juxtaposition by Coleridge in the title of his poem
                            <emph>Christ</emph>[-]<emph>abel</emph>.</p>
                  <p>According to the Credo <title level="a">Mind Map,</title> Wheatley’s poetry
                        and Romanticism do not even contain “related concepts.” As a classroom
                        activity, students can work in groups to draw up more inclusive mind maps
                        that link African American literature with British Romanticism, eighteenth-
                        and nineteenth-century American literature, writers of the black Atlantic,
                        and other oral traditions and writings of the Americas, Canada, and the
                        Caribbean. The Credo Mind Maps for Wheatley and Romanticism can be placed
                        side by side, and class-wide brainstorming can chart continua as well as
                        points of contact, contestation, and connection between them. Some of the
                        many connections that <emph>should</emph> be present on the Credo <title level="a">Mind Maps</title> for “Romanticism” and “Phillis Wheatley” are
                        Wheatley’s critiques of Enlightenment ideology, which anticipate
                        Romanticism. Wheatley’s poem is a refinery of its readers’ sensibilities
                        about slavery, each line subtly removing impure connotations surrounding
                        blackness (“Their colour is a diabolic die,” l. 6) and replacing them with
                        regal ones such as those associated with “sable.” Wheatley maps the ways in
                        which, to use Hugh Blair’s terms, “linguistic authority” becomes a
                        substitute for “spiritual authority” (Manning 247). She also purifies the
                        language and spirituality of the emerging Republic in the hope that it will
                        affect the government and vice versa, a sentiment evident in her poem to
                        George Washington and echoed by John Adams in his 1780 letter to the
                        President of Congress: <quote> As eloquence is cultivated with more care in
                            free republics than in other governments, it has been found by constant
                            experience that such republics have produced greater purity,
                            copiousness, and perfection of language. It is not to be disputed that
                            the form of government has an influence upon language, and language in
                            its turn influences not only the form of government, but the temper, the
                            sentiments, and manners of the people. (qtd. in Manning 251). </quote>
                        Memory and imagination are the processes through which Wheatley’s experience
                        is refined into democratic poetry. Her images function as more than words,
                        as reminders to her readers in her spiritual logos-centric poetry that “the
                        Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us” (John 1:14). Her poetry crosses the
                        Atlantic (from publication in London to be sold in America) as a commodity,
                        reversing the route of the slave ships showing the power of the book trade
                        to defeat the slave trade with the voice of a prophet to eliminate the
                        profit of “Being Brought from Africa to America.” In the last two lines of
                        the poem, Wheatley extends Cartesian innatism beyond the self by alluding to
                        her knowledge of her readers’ divinely implanted knowledge, for she bids
                        them “Remember” something they once knew and have apparently forgotten: “in
                        every human breast God has implanted a principle, which we call love of
                        freedom” (Wheatley <title level="a">Letter to Rev. Samson Occom</title>
                        226). Wheatley links the enslaved and the free not with chains, but by using
                        rhetoric and syncopation to map hearts beating as one across oceans of
                        space, time, race, class, and gender. Her poetry calls to mind the advice of
                            <title level="m">Black Panther</title>’s T’Challa, who echoes an ancient
                        African proverb: “In times of trouble, the wise build bridges and the
                        foolish build walls.” </p>

                    Shelley’s <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> to acknowledge the novel’s French and German 
                    influences. Such influences include Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s <title level="m">Confessions</title> 
                    and <title level="m">The Sufferings of Young Werther</title> by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, one 
                    of the texts that the creature finds in the forest. The essay offers ways to introduce topics 
                    such as the French Revolution (the backdrop for the DeLacey family’s story) and argues for the 
                    importance of teaching Romantic irony as a way to approach literature of the period, particularly 
                    French and German Romantic poetry. The course invites students to explore European texts with 
                    similar themes as <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. E. T. A. Hoffmann’s novella

                  <p>Romanticism did not arise in isolation, even though many British writers remained in
                their home countries during the Napoleonic Wars. As soon as the Congress of Vienna
                brought peace, many writers left Britain, some never to return home. Mary Shelley
                wrote <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> (1818) in Switzerland, Keats and Percy
                Bysshe Shelley died in Italy, and Bryon expired in Greece. It was abroad, too, that
                the idea of Romanticism flourished in academic circles. European writers like August
                Wilhelm Schlegel, Heinrich Heine, and Victor Hugo recognized and celebrated the term
                    <emph>romantic</emph> well before Victorian critics in Britain
                rediscovered it in the 1850s. The English Department at my institution serves many
                future and current teachers. Thus, our curriculum favors the British and American
                literature that forms the English canon at the secondary level in the United States.
                With this in mind, I created a comparative literature course that would prepare
                students to teach one of the major works of the British canon: Mary Shelley’s 
                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. For 14 weeks, we focus on some of the European
                texts that influenced this famous novel. In addition, this course aims to foster
                in-depth critical understanding of <emph>romantic irony</emph>, especially
                as it relates to the fiction and poetry in Britain, France, and Germany circa 1780
                to 1830; to engage students’ understanding of the ways in which writers and artists
                influenced sociopolitical thinking about key issues of the day, such as the French
                Revolution and human rights; and to teach an appreciation for the ways in which
                literary movements transcend national and generic borders. Moreover, students in
                this course gain a nuanced understanding of the historical and aesthetic discourse
                that informed the reading and writing of British and European Romantic texts. An
                online syllabus includes links to electronic texts and resources on this subject
                (<ref target="http://www.romantic-circles.org/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixB.html">Appendix B</ref>).</p>
                  <p>Recent scholarship on <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> engaging with the theme of
                globalism has focused on the novel’s frame narrative and depiction of travel through
                the polar region.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Miranda Burgess, <title level="a">Frankenstein’s 
                    Transport: Modernity, Mobility, and the Science of Feeling</title> (2015), and Siobhan

                describe a course on European Romanticism for English majors that includes a global
                reading history: the texts that Shelley read, those her monster reads, literature
                from pre-Romantic movements, and other major authors of European Romanticism. For
                example, Shelley read Rousseau’s <title level="m">Confessions</title> (1770/71–1782)
                and other works by the Swiss author. So along with this autobiography, we read the
                <title level="m">Discourse on the Origin of Inequality</title> 
                    (<title level="m">
                        <foreign xml:lang="fr">Discours sur l’origine et les fondements de 
                        l’inégalité parmi les hommes</foreign>
                     </title>, commonly referred to as the 
                    <title level="m">Second Discourse</title>, 1755) and/or the <title level="m">Social Contract</title> 
                (<title level="m">
                        <foreign xml:lang="fr">Du contrat social</foreign>
                     </title>, 1762). These 
                    texts and Goethe’s <title level="m">The Sufferings of Young Werther</title> 
                (<title level="m">
                        <foreign xml:lang="fr">Die Leiden des jungen Werthers</foreign>
                     </title>, 1774) 
                instruct students about the roles literature and nature play in what becomes 
                Romantic sensibility.</p>
                  <p>The goal of this approach is to provide critical terminology for reading 
                 <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> as not just a piece of the British canon, but
                also as an international text. The first unit covers Romantic movements in France
                and Germany. Poems by André Chénier, Heinrich Heine, Alphonse de Lamartine, Alfred
                de Musset, and Annette von Droste-Hülshoff introduce students to the major features
                of literature in the Romantic era. In the second unit, we discuss 
                 <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> and other European texts that feature scientists 
                 and doubles. Goethe’s two-part tragedy <title level="m">Faust</title> (1808/1832), E. T. A.
                 Hoffmann’s novella <title level="m">The Sandman</title> 
                 (<title level="m">
                        <foreign xml:lang="de">Der Sandmann</foreign>
                     </title>, 1817), and Shelley’s 
                 text were published within 10 years of each other and consequently raise similar issues, such as the 
                (traumatic) legacy of paternity and the ethics of science and violence. The eponymous 
                protagonist of Goethe’s <title level="m">Faust</title> resembles Victor Frankenstein, and 
                E. T. A. Hoffmann’s <title level="m">The Sandman</title> aids students’ critical understanding
                of doubling and romantic irony in <title level="m">Faust</title> and 
                 <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. These concepts give students tools with which to 
                compare works of literature from around the globe.</p>

                  <head>Unit I: Romantic Movements in France and Germany</head>
                  <p>French Romanticism is often left out of discussions of British Romanticism, for the
                reason that it began later than Romantic movements in Britain and German-speaking
                territories. Yet the manifesto of French Romanticism, Victor Hugo’s preface to his
                drama <title level="m">Cromwell</title> (1827), offers students a guide to some of the
                aesthetics of the period. Hugo announces a new age for poetry, characterized by an
                interest in the grotesque and the fantastical. Romanticism represented breaking with
                classical traditions for Hugo and his young cohort, which included Théophile Gautier
                (1811–1872). Gautier narrated what he called the battle over Hugo’s <title level="m">
                    Hernani</title> (1830) in his <title level="m">History of Romanticism</title> 
                (<title level="m">
                        <foreign xml:lang="fr">Histoire du Romantisme</foreign>
                     </title>, 1870). 
                This drama announced the beginning of Romanticism in France, because it contained
                non-classical elements such as colloquial language that upset the audience.</p>
                  <p>Beginning the course with Hugo’s <title level="m">Preface to Cromwell</title>
                introduces students to the asynchronous nature of Romantic movements. Romanticism
                arose in France so late, in part, owing to the Revolution. An online timeline can
                clarify the events of the Revolution for students 
                (<title level="a">
                        <ref target="http://www.marxists.org/history/france/revolution/timeline.htm">
                        Principal Dates</ref>
                     </title>). The leaders of the
                Revolution (1789–1799) curtailed authors’ freedom, and of course their lives. The
                poetry of André Chénier (1762–1794) gives students a personal sense of the
                historical impact of the French Revolution. Chénier composed one of his best-known
                poems, <title level="a">The Young Captive</title> 
                (<title level="a">
                        <foreign xml:lang="fr">La jeune captive</foreign>,</title> 1794) in prison. 
                Aimée Franquetot de Coigny (1769–1820), the former Duchess of Fleury, is likely the young 
                captive in the poem (Ferber 165). It is difficult <emph>not</emph> to read another 
                of Chénier’s poems, <title level="a">When the Somber Slaughterhouse Opens Its Caverns of 
                    Death</title> (<title level="a">
                        <foreign xml:lang="fr">Quand au mouton bêlant
                la sombre boucherie</foreign>
                     </title>), through the lens of his death on the guillotine. 
                Chénier remains important to the history of Romanticism owing to his inspiration of young
                Romantics like Hugo (Ferber 165). Chénier remains popular today; Umberto Giordano’s
                opera about the life of author, <title level="m">Andrea Chénier</title> (1896),
                appears regularly onstage. This poem might also encourage discussions of Shelley’s
                depiction of capital punishment in <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> through the
                fate of Justine.</p>
                  <p>Chénier’s poem also offers a lesson in romantic irony. John Fetzer reminds us that
                romantic irony requires readers “to straddle a middle ground of ambivalence between
                dichotomous or contrastive options” (Fetzer 22). <title level="a">Somber 
                    Slaughterhouse</title> offers contrasting views between the ironic perspective, 
                symbolized by the slaughterhouse, and the naïve view of “happier days” 
                (<foreign xml:lang="fr">de plus heureux temps</foreign>, line 24). The “caverns
                of death” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">caverns de mort</foreign>, line 1), “this abyss” 
                (<foreign xml:lang="fr">cet abîme</foreign>, line 10), “frightful
                lair” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">affreux repaire</foreign>, line 13), “the bloody hooks 
                of the people’s larder” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">crocs sanglants du charnier 
                populaire</foreign>, line 15), “my withered soul” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">mon âme 
                fléterie</foreign>, line 19), and “tears of misfortune” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">pleurs de 
                l’infortune</foreign>, line 25) comprise this ironic perspective. Yet Chénier contrasts 
                these somber reflections with memories of “shepherds, dogs, the other sheep, the whole farm” 
                (<foreign xml:lang="fr">Pâtres chiens et moutons, toute
                la bergerie</foreign>, line 3), “children” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">Les enfants</foreign>, 
                line 5), “maidens with lovely complexions” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">Les vierges aux belles 
                couleurs</foreign>, line 6), and “knots of ribbons and flowers” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">
                Entrelaçaient rubans et fleurs</foreign>, line 8). In these examples, the specter of
                death stands in contrast to the images of life. Yet neither view attains precedence
                over the other. Fetzer’s concept of the “bifocal or double vision” provides a tool
                to understand such examples because the ironic perspective does not necessarily
                undermine the naïve perspective (21). In this way, romantic irony teaches students
                the important lesson that contradictory sentiments can, and do, coexist together.</p>
                  <p>Instruction in romantic irony paves the way for a better understanding of
                contradictions and ambivalence in Romantic literature, such as Victor Frankenstein’s
                ethical vacillations. Contradictions also exist in the ostensibly universal values
                that characterize Romanticism. On the one hand, Romantic writers shared the values
                espoused by French Republicans: universalism, democracy, and equality. On the other
                hand, these privileges did not apply to all human beings. Jean Jacques Rousseau
                acknowledges and illustrates many of these hypocrisies. His <title level="m">Social
                    Contract</title> begins with the famous admonishment that all men are in “chains”
                (1). Yet the “savage man” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">homme sauvage</foreign>) of his
                second <title level="m">Discourse</title>, or the many women who
                read his works, had little access to all the privileges of citizenship. The monster
                resembles Rousseau’s description of savage man in his
                second <title level="m">Discourse</title>; the way that the
                monster eats berries, lives in the forest, discovers fire, and acquires language
                “conforms both in general outline and specific details to the life of Rousseau’s
                savage” (Marshall 183). The creature’s demands for equal privileges also evoke
                Rousseau’s discourse on inequality, although he inserts “interesting problems into
                it,” such as the demand for a community (Reese 49).</p>
                  <p>These first few weeks on the French Revolution include reading the Declaration of
                Independence (1776) alongside the French document it inspired, The Declaration of
                the Rights of Man and Citizen (La déclaration des droits de l’homme et du citoyen,
                1789). Doing so allows students to understand the international nature of the
                discourse of human rights, and the exclusion of some members of the population from
                these privileges. We read <title level="m">The Rights of Woman and Female
                    Citizen</title> (<title level="m">
                        <foreign xml:lang="fr">La déclaration 
                    des droits de la femme et de la citoyenne</foreign>
                     </title>) by the protofeminist 
                activist, writer, and dramatist Olympe de Gouges (1748–1793). Gouges rewrites 
                the <title level="m">Rights of Man</title> for female citizens 
                (<foreign xml:lang="fr">citoyennes</foreign>). Another online text that could 
                supplement this reading is the memoir of Toussaint L’Ouverture, the leader of the 
                revolution in Haiti 1791. These texts teach the universal values that tie international 
                Romantic movements together. These online texts also give students the historical 
                background to understand the plights of Safie and the De Lacey family in Shelley’s 
                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. Safie’s father threatens Felix with a 
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">lettre de cachet</foreign>, a secret warrant for arrest that 
                could be wielded indiscriminately. Such abuses of power made many thinkers sympathetic 
                to the need for a revolution in France. </p>
                  <p>The next few weeks of the course focus on the cult of sensibility in French and
                German literature. On the surface, <title level="m">Confessions</title> appears to
                present a travelogue of the author’s journey through Switzerland and France, and
                such information contextualizes the geography of <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>
                for students. However, Rousseau’s <title level="m">Confessions</title> is also an
                important text for understanding the discourse of sensibility in 
                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. The monster’s appeal for sympathy from his 
                creator resembles Rousseau’s narrative, which likewise contains tales of theft and 
                misdeeds committed with a tortured conscience. There are more direct parallels between 
                <title level="m">Confessions</title> and <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, such as
                being locked out of the gates of Geneva and the abandonment of children. Rousseau
                felt motivated to write <title level="m">Confessions</title> after Voltaire revealed
                he abandoned his five children in orphanages (McAlpin 260). According to Marshall,
                “Shelley had Rousseau in mind as she tells the story of a parent who made his
                offspring a monster—precisely by abandoning him” (187). After all, Shelley wrote
                about Rousseau’s abandoned children in her entry on the Swiss author for 
                <title level="m">Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of France</title> (Marshall 187).</p>
                  <p>In Rousseau, students might identify the conflicting dualities that characterize
                Victor Frankenstein, or what Rousseau calls his own “almost irreconcilable
                opposites” (110–11). The author of <title level="m">Confessions</title> is full of
                contradictions. On the one hand, this son of a watchmaker becomes a philosopher and
                man of letters, and in his early life he works as a servant while also garnering
                knowledge from those around him. He demonstrates other inconsistencies as well: he
                converts to Catholicism and back to Calvinism, clings to people but becomes an
                incessant wanderer, and steals but believes in honesty. In this way, Rousseau’s
                autobiography functions as an introduction to the social mores of the period. When I
                taught this class partially online, I randomly assigned aliases to students and
                invited them to write their journals from the perspective of these fictional
                personae. I assigned students professions from the period (banker, soldier,
                preacher, servant, musician, writer, artist, aristocrat) and different genders (so
                some students were wives, daughters, or sons of members of the aforementioned
                professions). Students chose their own names and nationalities from a list. While
                reading <title level="m">Confessions</title>, we discussed what contradictions their
                alter egos might have in their own lives. This exercise helped students to better
                identify with Romantic-era readers and writers.</p>
                  <p>Goethe’s novel, <title level="m">The Sufferings of Young Werther</title>, resembles
                Rousseau’s <title level="m">Confessions</title> in its narrative style and purpose.
                Werther’s letters seem to ask for readers’ sympathies in a way that corresponds to
                the confessional structure of Rousseau’s autobiography. And like Rousseau, Goethe’s
                protagonist finds solace in the beauty of nature, while he suffers from the
                constraints of a society that censures him. He finds a world in himself (Goethe 6).
                Literature, too, allows Rousseau and Goethe to escape from the perceived evils of
                society. Werther experiences a moment of intimacy when he witnesses a rainstorm with
                his unrequited love, Lotte, who exclaims, “Klopstock!” (Goethe 17–18). They refer to
                Klopstock’s poem, <title level="a">The Spring Festival</title> 
                (<title level="a">
                        <foreign xml:lang="de">Frühlingsfeier</foreign>,</title> 1759/1764). 
                This poem hallmarks the Storm and Stress Movement (<foreign xml:lang="de">Sturm und 
                    Drang</foreign>), and Michael Ferber includes it in his anthology 
                <title level="m">European Romantic Poetry</title> (2005). At the same time, these 
                themes allow students to appreciate the ways in which Rousseau and Goethe suggest 
                that nature itself can become a source of religious contemplation.</p>
                  <p>Goethe’s popular novel is the third book that Shelley’s creature finds in the woods.
                Many critics have noted the importance of one of these books, <title level="m">Paradise 
                    Lost</title>, to <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Johnson and Georgiana, Lamb, Ping, and Sanderson write about the 
                        influence of <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> on 
                        <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>.</note> The second book, Plutarch’s 
                <title level="m">Lives</title>, was of course popular reading across Europe,
                particularly during the second half of the eighteenth century. Yet Goethe’s novel is
                important for understanding the monster’s <emph>emotional</emph> development. The monster
                responds to Werther’s “despondency and gloom” (Shelley 87). Perhaps Werther’s
                obsession with a woman, Lotte, fuels the creature’s search for a mate. In 
                <title level="m">Werther</title>, students can also reacquaint themselves with
                romantic irony, for <title level="m">Werther</title> contains a bifocal perspective:
                that of Werther (in Book I), and that of the editor (in Book II). Goethe came to
                regret both the book and his association with it, in part owing to the copycat
                suicides it inspired (Sondrup 164). Shelley’s creature, too, promises to embrace
                self-inflicted death. Students who have read <title level="m">Werther</title> will
                recognize the Romantic sentiment of this gesture. <title level="m">Werther</title> and
                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> thus share the characteristic of resembling
                    <emph>anti</emph>-Bildungsromane. Instead of beginning a path of
                maturation into adulthood, the protagonists of each novel come of age and then
                succumb to death.</p>
                  <p>Two weeks on nature and irony in French and German poetry follow these readings. The
                class reads Gérard de Nerval’s (1808–1855) poem, <title level="a">Delphica</title> 
                (<title level="a">
                        <foreign xml:lang="fr">Delfica</foreign>,</title> 1845).
                Nerval exemplifies the cross-fertilization of European writing. He translated the
                first part of Goethe’s tragedy, <title level="m">Faust</title>, in 1827, and he became
                part of Hugo’s <foreign xml:lang="fr">cénacle</foreign> in 1830 (Ferber 248). 
                <title level="a">Delfica</title> shows some affinity for Goethe’s religious viewpoint. 
                The eponymous protagonist of <title level="m">Sufferings of Young Werther</title> searches 
                for God in the secular world (nature, children), and <title level="a">Delfica</title> 
                champions a type of <emph>hybrid</emph> religious sentiment as well. The first stanza 
                evokes Daphne, the name of the girl Apollo chases in Greek myth, heralding the return of 
                the pagan spirit: “They will come back, those gods you always mourn for” 
                (<foreign xml:lang="fr">Ils reviendront, ces Dieux que tu pleures toujours</foreign>, 
                line 9). In the final lines, however, the speaker
                refers to the first Christian emperor of the Roman empire: “But the sibyl with the
                Roman countenance / Lies still asleep under Constantine’s Arch: / —And nothing has
                disturbed the austere gate” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">Cependant la sibylle au visage latin 
                    / Est endormie encore sous l’arc de Constantin / —Et rien n’a dérangé le sévère 
                    portique</foreign>, lines 12–14). The hope for religious renewal is thus an 
                intermingling of the pagan and Christian ethos. This expansive view of religious sentiment 
                resembles themes in Rousseau’s writing, such as <title level="m">Profession of Faith of the 
                    Savoyard Vicar</title>, in the fourth book of <title level="m">Emile</title>. Nerval even
                planned to write a play about the death of Rousseau, based on the mistaken
                assumption that the Swiss writer had committed suicide (Kneller 159). The invocation
                of Daphne and “That song of love” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">Cette chanson d’amour</foreign>, 
                line 4) in <title level="a">Delphica</title> would allow students to compare Rousseau’s and 
                Nerval’s search for “a lost feminine ideal” (Kneller 169).</p>
                  <p>Reading French and German poetry after Rousseau and <title level="m">Werther</title>
                would also allow students to reflect on the subject of the femme fatale. One
                interpretation of Lotte might be of the siren who lures men to their deaths. Besides
                Werther, she has already driven Heinrich mad, and encourages Werther even though she
                knows about his obsessive passion. Comparing poems on the Lorelei myth allows
                students to understand this recurring motif in Romantic literature. The most famous
                of the Lorelei poems is Heinrich Heine’s, <title level="a">Lorelei, or I Do Not Know What 
                    It Means . . .</title> (<title level="a">
                        <foreign xml:lang="de">Ich weiss nicht was soll 
                    es bedeuten</foreign>,</title> 1824). Lorelei is a siren figure from
                German legend who sits in the middle of the Rhine river and lures sailors to their
                deaths: “The boatman listens, and o’er him / Wild-aching passions roll; / He sees
                but the maiden before him, / He sees not reef or shoal” (<foreign xml:lang="de">Den Schiffer, 
                im kleinen Schiffe, / Ergreift es mit wildem Weh; / Er schaut nicht die Felsenriffe, / Er
                schaut nur hinauf in die Höh</foreign>, lines 17–20). This poem fits in with discussions of
                romantic irony, for the speaker is unsure of the conclusion of the legend: “I think,
                at last the wave swallows / The boat and the boatman’s cry; / And this is the fate
                that follows / The song of the Lorelei” (<foreign xml:lang="de">Ich glaube, die Wellen 
                    verschlingen / Am Ende Schiffer und Kahn; / Und das hat mit ihrem Singen / Die Lore-Ley 
                    getan</foreign>, lines 21–24). Online recordings of Heine’s poem could give the class 
                a sense of its musicality; Friedrich Silcher and Franz Liszt adapted the poem to music. 
                Students could also read Clemens Brentano’s poem <title level="a">Lore Lay</title> (1801) as 
                a point of contrast, for the poem lacks a frame narrative.</p>
                  <p>German and French Romantic poems allow students to contemplate the intersecting
                themes of nature and death, themes that also occur in <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. 
                Annette von Droste-Hülshoff’s (1797–1848) poem, <title level="a">In the
                Moss</title> (<title level="a">
                        <foreign xml:lang="de">Im Moose</foreign>,</title> 1844) 
                begins with a frame narrative. The speaker envisions his or
                her own death in the future, as seen through the refracting light of “the forest
                moss” (Waldes Moose, line 3). Hülshoff offers readers a vision of the cycle of life.
                The speaker contemplates the smallest creatures: “All round so still, that in the
                leaves I sensed / The caterpillar chew, and like green dust / Felt gently whirling
                flakes of leafage fall” (<foreign xml:lang="de">Ringsum so still, daß ich vernahm im Laub 
                    / Der Raupe Nagen, und wie grüner Staub / Mich leise wirbelnd Blätterflöckchen 
                    trafen</foreign>, line 13–15). But in the penultimate stanza the speaker declares: 
                “And then at last I saw myself, like mist, / Drift quietly into the pores of earth” 
                (<foreign xml:lang="de">Und noch zuletzt sah ich, gleich einem Rauch, / Mich leise in der 
                    Erde Poren ziehen</foreign>, lines 41–42). The irony of the poem rests in the speaker’s 
                ambivalence about which vision remains true.</p>
                  <p>A French Romantic poem, <title level="a">The Village (Church) Bell</title> 
                (<title level="a">
                        <foreign xml:lang="fr">La Cloche du village</foreign>,</title> 1839) by
                Alphonse de Lamartine (1790–1869), also treats the themes of nature and death. The
                specter of “death” (la mort, line 6) contrasts with the naïve point of view in this
                poem, the speaker’s “mind” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">ma pensée</foreign>, line 1) that 
                reflects on “that song which silences with envy / Its rivals attached to the brambles of life, 
                / And which is lost in the furthest reaches of heaven!” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">ce chant qui 
                    fait taire d’envie / Ses rivaux attachés aux ronces de la vie, / Et qui se perd au fond 
                    des cieux</foreign>, lines 28–30). Students might contrast Lamartine’s Deist sentiments 
                with those of other Romantic writers, providing a way to discuss the role of religion in 
                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. Such scenes include the godlike role that
                Victor adopts when he creates the creature, the clergy’s role in forcing false
                confessions of the condemned during Justine’s execution, and the novel’s allusions
                to Milton’s <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title>.</p>

                  <head>Unit II: Frankenstein and his Doppelgänger</head>
                  <p>In the final unit, students read <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, 
                <title level="m">Faust</title>, and <title level="m">The Sandman</title>. These texts
                feature scientists whose ambitions put human lives in danger, even while they
                interact with artificial life. Like <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, 
                <title level="m">The Sandman</title> begins with an exchange of letters, and then
                shifts to an editorial perspective. And like Shelley’s novel, <title level="m">The
                    Sandman</title> concludes with the death of the protagonist. Students should read
                Freud’s essay <title level="a">The Uncanny</title> 
                (<title level="a">
                        <foreign xml:lang="de">Das Unheimliche</foreign>,</title> 1919) after reading 
                Hoffmann’s text and before reading <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> in order to 
                learn the concept of Doppelgänger. If time permitted, students could also read Otto Rank’s 
                book, <title level="m">The Double: A Psychoanalytic Study</title> (1914). The novel begins
                with characters that mirror each other, Walton and Frankenstein, as Beth Newman
                points out, and one could argue that the creature is Victor Frankenstein’s dark
                double.</p>
                  <p>Goethe’s two-part tragedy, <title level="m">Faust</title>, contains many similarities
                to <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. In both works, the protagonist is a
                scientist whose experiments endanger humanity, yet he remains unrepentant for the
                suffering he causes others. Faust and Frankenstein resemble each other in their
                scientific methods, for they both begin with the Medieval occult before creating
                artificial life. Faust resembles Rousseau and Frankenstein in that he possesses two
                sides. On the one hand, he might appear to be a victim of a devil and an arbitrary
                Lord (line 315). On the other hand, he acts like a shrewd client of the devil (line
                1690). He made potions with his father that killed people (lines 995–1005), but he
                also serves as doctor who masters the elements (lines 355–65). While he presents
                himself as a lover (lines 3155–89), he acts like a seducer and a libertine (line
                3510). </p>
                  <p>A common theme in <title level="m">Faust</title> and <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> 
                is death and rebirth. Faust begins his journey of discovery
                when he despairs of ever becoming godlike, and nearly commits suicide (line 735).
                The season of Easter symbolizes his return to life. In fact, Goethe uses the rituals
                of spring as a backdrop for other scenes of the play. Faust and Mephistopheles lose
                themselves in dancing and drinking on Walpurgis Night, the eve of May Day, while
                Gretchen gives birth to her and Faust’s illegitimate child. At the beginning of 
                <title level="m">Faust</title>, Part II, Faust lies in the Elysian fields, a
                spring-like setting announcing his rebirth after the destruction of Gretchen and her
                family. These themes work well with <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> and the
                novel’s documented ties to birth, rebirth, and regeneration. Arguably, Mary
                Shelley’s grief for her children and her wish to reanimate them finds a corollary in
                Victor Frankenstein, who creates his monster in response to his mother’s death. In
                her journal entry from March 19, 1815, Shelley records: “Dream that my little baby
                came to life again—that it had only been cold &amp; that we rubbed it by the fire
                &amp; it lived” (70). After <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, Shelley wrote short
                stories that also touched on reanimation: <title level="a">Valerius</title> (1819), 
                <title level="a">The Transformation</title> (1824), and <title level="a">The Reanimated 
                    Man</title> (1826).</p>
                  <p>In <title level="m">Faust</title> II, students find a direct corollary to
                Frankenstein’s creation, another artificial creation: Homunculus. Faust’s assistant
                Wagner brings Homunculus to life in an alembic. Elsewhere Goethe refers to him as “a
                little chemical man” (<title level="a">Second</title> 525). Homunculus dies in a scene 
                that symbolizes rebirth. He travels the ocean with Proteus, who transforms into a dolphin, 
                and then falls in love with the sea nymph Galatea, who rides on Aphrodite’s shell. At the
                moment of their union, however, the glass around Homunculus breaks, and he dies,
                mingled for eternity with Galatea. The ultimate rebirth in <title level="m">Faust</title> 
                is his apotheosis at the end of the tragedy, when he ascends to
                Heaven and is reunited with Gretchen.</p>
                  <p>The assignments in the course assess students’ ability to close read these texts
                comparatively. In the middle of the semester, students write a long essay comparing
                two works. This assignment encourages students to start thinking about connections
                between the works we read. The final paper in the semester asks students to compare
                characteristics and traits of European Romantic literature to Mary Shelley’s novel
                and to speculate in what ways
                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> might be read as a critique
                of Romantic-era values, considering some of the ethical dilemmas Shelley raises
                about parental responsibility, the pursuit of genius, and the rights of citizens.
                The reading journey for this course is ambitious and wide-ranging. It aims to teach
                students, many of whom graduate with teaching credentials, to view one of the most
                important novels in the English language as the product of Mary Shelley’s interest
                in literature from beyond the shores of Britain, and to remind them of the
                importance of global connections in creating great works of literature.</p>

                  <p>This paper describes a course that covers the Romantic period of European and
                American literature as the moment and site of the modern invention and institution
                of “culture”—both as an object of study and as a historical and ethical basis for
                the establishment of self and society. I last taught the course in 2012, and so this
                paper is something of a retrospective account. I maintain the present tense in my
                description, however, because this report has inspired me to take up the course
                again in the near future. It has also alerted me to the need to update its
                approaches to reflect the fine work in global Romanticism published in the interval
                and to reconsider how instructional approaches to Romanticism’s “logic of culture”
                might intersect with accounts of its “global imaginary.” This is a pedagogical
                report, not a scholarly intervention, and so I will simply acknowledge the
                compelling recent work of Samuel Baker, Evan Gottlieb, James Mulholland, Juliet
                Shields, Julie Carr, and Jeffrey Robinson among others whose varied meditations on
                the interplay between Romantic forms and mobile networks of global trade,
                communication, and empire must now inform any sustained reading of the authors I
                cover in this course. It is a confirmation of many of their varied but complementary
                models of Romanticism that a course focused primarily on the question of culture
                turns repeatedly in its concerns to the question of the global.</p>
                  <p>During a 15-week semester, the students and I read, in English, aesthetic treatises
                by Blair, Herder, and Schiller, poetry by Macpherson and Byron, and novels by
                Rousseau, Goethe, Staël, and Cooper. These texts are supplemented by theoretical
                work on the logic of culture in the modern era and the condition of the modern
                university. Our primary concerns are to enjoy the rich complexities of these
                literary projects, to understand their role in establishing culture as a new model
                of authority and identity, and to perceive the centrality of Romanticism in shaping
                current cultural paradigms and dilemmas. </p>
                  <p>Both the title of my course and our initial historical and theoretical parameters are
                taken from William Ray’s <title level="m">The Logic of Culture: Authority and
                    Identity in the Modern Age</title>, a rich and suggestive meditation on culture
                that draws upon the sociological models of Pierre Bourdieu and Jürgen Habermas with
                nods back to Matthew Arnold, Norbert Elias, F. R. Leavis, and Raymond Williams, and
                which contains extended engagements with Rousseau, Herder, Kant, and Schiller. Ray’s
                work is exceptionally productive in the advanced undergraduate classroom not only
                for his lucid prose and clear explications of social and aesthetic theories, but for
                the remarkably capacious extent of his argument. In just under 200 pages, Ray offers
                a) a theoretical model of culture and identity formation in the modern era; b) an
                intellectual history of European Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment critique; c) a
                survey of social and literary “institutions” (the museum, the novel) that are both
                determined by and determinative of cultural logic; and d) a telling and provocative
                consideration of recent debates over globalization and multiculturalism. Even
                limiting ourselves to his introduction and first chapter on the roots of cultural
                logic, paired with Raymond Williams’s treatment of the term <emph>culture</emph> 
                in <title level="m">Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and
                    Society</title> and the entry from the OED, we are able to begin interrogating an
                idea most students simply take for granted. </p>
                  <p>I pair these theoretical writings with the opening passages from two primary texts
                (of sorts) which lay bare the modern ideology of culture, David Finn’s 
                <title level="m">How to Visit a Museum</title> and John Sutherland’s <title level="m">
                How to Read a Novel: A User’s Guide</title>. Each of these works offer accessible
                case studies in how regulatory norms are prescribed through idealizations of
                subjective responses under the aegis of culture. Finn promotes the cultural
                management of freedom most succinctly in his opening lines by telling his readers
                that “there is no right or wrong way to visit a museum. The most important rule you
                should keep in mind as you go through the front door is to follow your own
                instincts” (10). Sutherland offers an equally normative valorization of acculturated
                subjectivity through Tolstoy’s depiction of Anna Karenina’s “sublimely languorous”
                immersion in a Trollope novel on a train from Moscow to St. Petersburg (3). Both
                Finn and Sutherland insist on the individuality of aesthetic response in contrast to
                a perceived surfeit of objects and texts in the modern world, constructing aesthetic
                pleasure as a marker of human intelligence, a badge of honor for the cultured
                visitor/reader, a skill to be mastered, and a mechanism of social improvement.
                Through a humorous deconstruction of the rhetoric of these writings, students
                apprehend how culture and its institutions instantiate a dialectic between autonomy
                and law, identity and custom, which marks a paradoxical yet productive model of
                authority in the modern age.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Donald Preziosi 
                    performs a masterful critique of Finn’s rhetoric in <title level="a">Brain of 
                        the Earth’s Body: Museums and the Framing of Modernity.</title>

                  </p>
                  <p>The class is thus prepared for Schiller’s <title level="m">On the Aesthetic
                    Education of Man</title>, which I suggest might just as well be entitled 
                <title level="m">How to Have an Aesthetic Experience . . . and Why</title>. After the
                unwitting examples of Finn and Sutherland, students can perceive in Schiller’s more
                demanding prose how the antinomies of law and nature opened up by the political and
                philosophical revolutions of the eighteenth century mandated new programs for
                cultural education. Alongside passages from the
                <title level="m">Declaration of Independence</title> and
                the <title level="m">Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen</title>
                (<ref target="http://www.romantic-circles.org/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixA.html">Appendix A</ref>), 
                we attend to what Schiller calls “the building up of true political
                freedom [as] the most perfect of all works of art” (25). By emphasizing the social,
                political, and hence moral motives for Schiller’s valorization of aesthetic culture,
                I help students to see his proliferating sequence of dichotomies (sense and form,
                feeling and reason, savagery and barbarism, etc.) as both epistemological and
                historical categories leading towards the mediating and transformative experiences
                of beauty, freedom, and culture. It is the aesthetic state alone for Schiller which
                “carries out the will of the whole through the nature of the individual,” and thus
                confers a “social character” upon humanity: “Taste alone brings harmony into
                society, because it establishes harmony in the individual” (137–38).</p>
                  <p>These formulations are echoed by any number of Schiller’s contemporaries, of course, and 
                a glance at brief quotations from Schlegel, Hölderlin, Shelley, and Keats allows students 
                to appreciate Schiller’s letters as articulations of a dominant strain of Romantic thought 
                (<ref target="http://www.romantic-circles.org/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixA.html">Appendix A</ref>). 
                Helen Maria Williams’s oft reprinted celebration of
                the Fête de la Fédération from her <title level="m">Letters Written in France</title>
                makes clear the ideological dimensions of this program: “Half a million of people
                assembled at a spectacle, which furnished every image that can elevate the mind of
                man; which connected the enthusiasm of moral sentiment with the solemn pomp of
                religious ceremonies; which addressed itself at once to the imagination, the
                understanding, and the heart!” (64–65).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Two articles

                  </p>
                  <p>This project is Kantian to the core, as Schiller freely announces, but he opens his
                work with an epigraph from Rousseau’s <title level="m">Julie</title> 
                (“<foreign xml:lang="fr">Si c’est la raison qui fait l’homme, c’est le sentiment qui le 
                    conduit</foreign>” [“if it is reason that makes man, it is sentiment 
                that guides him”]), and it is to that crucial novel of
                European Romanticism, in the excellent and affordable edition from Dartmouth
                University Press (translated and edited by Philip Stewart and Jean Vaché) that we
                next turn. Despite, or perhaps because of the increasingly surreal lunacy of
                Rousseau’s project, undergraduates thoroughly enjoy this novel’s odd and
                disorienting conflation of irony and sincerity, while its epistolary form appeals to
                a generation brought up on texting and instant messaging. Nicholas Paige has
                outlined an “aesthetics of renunciation” in Rousseau’s novel and its contemporary
                reception that reveals important affinities between the bifurcated reading
                experience of the sentimental novel and the modern logic of culture (Paige 131–54),
                and Ray himself argues that Rousseau seeks to instill in his readers a conscious
                division of acculturated reflections (<title level="m">Logic of Culture</title> 84–94;
                <title level="m">Story and History</title> 240–69). I likewise aim to underscore
                with my students how the novel solicits and regulates naturalized responses under
                the twin standards of freedom and law.</p>
                  <p>Rousseau repeatedly valorizes authentic sentiments, honest communication, and
                virtuous self-regard, even as he emphasizes the necessity of education and
                cultivation to join such characteristics to moral duty. In its twin prefaces (which
                might be entitled <title level="m">How to Read a Novel . . . If You Must</title>) and
                its bizarre annotations (my favorite being his recommendation of fera, requested by
                Julie on her deathbed, as “an excellent fish particular to Lake Geneva, found only
                at certain times” [599]), the novel repudiates the received authority of cultural
                norms and expresses a conviction in the existence of natural values, even as it
                suggests that such values are insufficient without moral guidance and are, in any
                case, no longer available to the readers of this work. Rousseau’s prefatory fantasy
                of a virtuous farm couple reading his novel after their daily chores is
                counterbalanced by his satirical aside that it is only in “depraved ages” that
                people enjoy reading nostalgically about virtue (19).</p>
                  <p>As the class encounters the rebellious romance and the methodical submission of Julie
                and St. Preux, the imaginative origins of Schiller’s aesthetic education become
                clear. In the movement of the two lovers from passion to duty, we encounter the
                proliferating dialectics of contingent desire and autonomous law, all mediated by
                love and portrayed as a poetics of virtue. Neither Julie’s rational submission to
                faith nor St. Preux’s flirtation with suicidal despair, which follow their failed
                affair and conclude the first half of the novel, suffice for the building of a moral
                society. Instead, it is in the utopia of Clarens under Monsieur de Wolmar’s
                direction, delineated throughout the novel’s second half, in which “innocence and
                peace” are programmatically produced through “the confidence of beautiful souls”
                (342, 346). In the domestic economy of Clarens, Wolmar and Julie represent the twin
                authorities of law and beauty, producing through custom and sentiment a pure
                morality which “follows and corrects” nature and a pure subordination which becomes
                the expression of individual will (375). The seduction and the horror of this
                totalitarian vision are perceptible within a twenty-first-century classroom, and the
                construction of absolute authority as the union of custom and nature allows students
                to apprehend both the dream and the nightmare of the Romantic project. </p>
                  <p>Understanding Rousseau’s novel as both a representation and an enactment of moral
                sentiments to provide a new basis of reflexive cultural communion helps students
                perceive the relation of the novel genre more broadly as an institution of culture,
                aiding in “the transition from the state of nature to the civil state” theorized by
                Rousseau in <title level="m">The Social Contract</title> as a substitution of justice
                for instinct and celebrated by Schiller as “[carrying] out the will of the whole
                through the nature of the individual” 
                (<ref target="http://www.romantic-circles.org/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixA.html">Appendix A</ref>). 
                Hence they are well prepared to
                appreciate the dialogue between ancient poetry and modern taste staged in the pages
                of Macpherson’s <title level="m">Poems of Ossian</title>. As we read selections from
                the <title level="m">Fragments of Ancient Poetry</title>, <title level="m">Fingal</title>, 
                and <title level="m">Temora</title>, which Macpherson composed,
                compiled, and heavily annotated, alongside critical treatises by Blair and Herder,
                Staël and Chateaubriand, we encounter an archetypal instance of the invention of
                tradition within explicitly nationalized contexts. </p>

                Russian, Danish, Hungarian, Spanish, Polish, Czech, Latin, and Classical Greek, the
                <title level="m">Poems of Ossian</title> form arguably the single most influential
                work of British poetry of the Romantic era (Gaskill). Yet, to my knowledge, these
                works are rarely taught and occupy only a marginal position, if they are included at
                all, in the standard anthologies of Romantic verse (Moore). Their reputation as
                forgeries certainly contribute to this neglect, as does the absence of any
                affordable edition for use in the classroom. Neither Howard Gaskill’s excellent but
                prohibitively priced University of Edinburgh edition nor the cheaper but less
                reliable nineteenth-century reprint from Dover Press provide a complete sense of the
                dynamic interface between poetry and annotation that Macpherson constructed in the
                early editions of his works. Some universities and colleges will have these editions
                in their special collections, and they are also available through ECCO for those
                with institutional subscriptions. The <title level="m">Ossian Online</title> project
                at the University of Galway, edited by Rebecca Barr and Justin Tonra, now offers a
                compelling and open access resource that reproduces the combination of translation,
                ethnography, and comparative literature at work in the pages of Macpherson’s texts
                (see <title level="m">Fingal</title> in 
                <ref target="http://www.romantic-circles.org/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixA.html">
                    Appendix A</ref>).</p>
                  <p>What the students are able to perceive materially in the pages of these editions is
                the invention of culture as a dialogue between tradition and innovation, heritage
                and taste. Fiona Stafford argues that “Macpherson’s ‘translations’ involved acts of
                interpretation not only between Gaelic and English, but also between the oral
                culture of the depressed rural communities of the Scottish Highlands and the
                prosperous urban centers of Lowland Scotland, where the printed word was
                increasingly dominant,” and that therefore we should view his project as neither
                naïve nor deceptive but as “a sophisticated attempt to mediate between two
                apparently irreconcilable cultures” (viii). Whether or not they are willing to grant
                Macpherson this degree of latitude, students are able to witness the efficient
                transfer of cultural authority from the oral traditions Macpherson evokes to the
                aesthetic tastes of a modern print culture, which he paradoxically repudiates as
                degraded from the martial and sentimental purity of the ancient Gaels. The poems
                themselves thematize this anxiety of cultural transmission throughout, obsessed as
                they are with proleptic self-eulogy, poetic lament, and a general atmosphere of loss
                in which the value of any deed is only realized in the affective response of belated
                reflection. Akin to Julie and St. Preux’s tour to the locations of their former
                romance, the result is a highly reflexive bardic history which, in concert with the
                extensive annotations that occupy equal space in Macpherson’s pages, is more about
                its own reception as aesthetic tableau and archaeological record than about the
                deeds of its warriors.</p>
                  <p>Hugh Blair’s <title level="a">Critical Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian,</title> 
                which was included in all later editions of the work, offers an extended argument for the 
                mutual implication of historical inquiry and aesthetic response as complementary modes 
                of cultural evaluation. Reading his dissertation, the class is able to explore the
                general contours of conjectural history, the valorization of poetry as moral
                imagination, and the celebration of the melancholic sublime (Ossian’s “joys of
                grief”) as superior to the beauties of classical antiquity—arguably the three
                primary ingredients of Romanticism as a self-conscious literary style. We turn from
                Blair to selections from Herder, who celebrates Ossian as an authentic voice of oral
                folk tradition and the vitality of primitive cultures. Mme de Staël comparably
                valorizes Ossian as the origin of a northern Romanticism in contest with a southern
                classicism, while François-René de Chateaubriand critiques her convictions by
                reasserting the necessity of Christianity and advanced society for the cultivation
                of beautiful morality. Chateaubriand views the sentimental effusions of Ossian’s
                warriors as evidence of their historical inaccuracy and makes Macpherson’s poetry a
                locus for his battle with atheistic philosophy and doctrines of perfectibility.
                Reading through these examples of Ossian’s critical reception enables students to
                perceive the tension between aestheticism and historicism in Romantic discourse
                (Leerssen), as well as the political and cultural agendas served by various positions 
                (<ref target="http://www.romantic-circles.org/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixA.html">Appendix A</ref>).</p>
                  <p>Of all the documents of Ossian’s reception, it is Goethe’s <title level="m">Sorrows
                    of Young Werther</title> which had the greatest influence on European letters, and,
                indeed, helped to promote Macpherson’s work to a wider audience. Goethe’s novella
                replays both Rousseau’s sentimental education and Macpherson’s cultural archaeology
                in a tragic mode, presenting a paradigmatic instance of the Romantic turn towards
                interiority and despondency as a staged response to the tensions of social
                transformation. Like Rousseau, Goethe presents his fiction as an edited sequence of
                letters valuable as testimonials of sincerity and objects of sympathy. Werther is,
                in many ways, another St. Preux, skeptical of cultural mores and seeking beauty as
                an amelioration to a degenerate society. Such beauty is to be found in the natural
                world, in literature (especially Klopstock and Ossian), and, of course, in Lotte.
                The conclusion, in which the melancholic antihero extensively recites the Ossianic
                “Songs of Selma” to his idealized object of desire, stands as one of the almost
                literally seminal moments of European Romanticism. As both a last attempt at sexual
                consummation and a retrospective farewell to his beloved, Werther’s recitation,
                encompassing a disproportionate <emph>one-fifteenth</emph> of the entire
                narrative, deploys the sequential lamentations of Macpherson’s bardic performances
                towards a sentimental expression of heartsick regret (Lamport).</p>
                  <p>Goethe famously disavowed this early melodramatic fantasia as a product of youthful
                self-indulgence and the morbid temperament of his generation, but the novella
                itself, along with Goethe’s later reflections, nicely included in the Signet
                Classics edition (translated by Catherine Hutter), enables the class to perceive the
                Romantic affinities between melancholic confession and cultural ennui. The
                significance of the work, Goethe argues, emerges precisely out of the social and
                historical disparities revealed between the heroic cadences of Ossianic lament and
                the performatively self-indulgent letters of a lovesick hero: “Defunct heroes and
                wan maidens hovered around us until, in the end, we really thought we could see the
                terrible shape of the spirit of Loda. In such an atmosphere, with fancies and
                studies of this nature, tortured by unsatisfied passion, with no external
                inspiration to do anything really important, our only prospect to succumb, in the
                end, to a dreary, uncultured, bourgeois existence—we began to think kindly of
                departing this life ” (146). Werther’s Ossianic recitation is at once an elegiac
                identification with a supposedly anterior poetry, itself a performance of elegy as a
                cultural rite, and an ironic revelation of the gulf separating the ideals informing
                his love for Lotte and the social realities that prevent its consummation.</p>
                  <p>With this range of cultural and psychological maneuvers in mind, we approach two of
                the most paradigmatic literary works of the Napoleonic era, Mme de Staël’s novel 
                <title level="m">Corinne, or Italy</title> and Lord Byron’s <title level="m">Childe
                    Harold’s Pilgrimage</title>. Both share multiple generic affinities with Schiller’s
                aesthetic treatise, Rousseau’s sentimental novel, Macpherson’s bardic ethnography,
                and Goethe’s melancholic parable, all framed within travel narratives in which the
                conflicts between duty and sensibility are played out through a topography of
                historical rupture and cultural alienation.</p>
                  <p>The entire plot of <title level="m">Corinne</title> can be read as a prolonged crisis
                of the absence of paternal authority contemporaneous with the French Revolution, an
                absence restored through the fraught logic of national culture. Oswald’s early
                residence in revolutionary France coincides with his father’s demise, a father whom
                he mourns to the brink of self-destruction, yet who himself was ambivalent about
                exercising his authority in deference to “the purity of affection, which depends on
                what is most free and involuntary in our nature” (214). His eventual return to
                Scotland marks a necessary submission to public and domestic dignity and hence a
                substitution of paternal authority by national spirit, “the prejudices, if you like,
                which unite us and our nation” as his father writes from beyond the grave: “we are a
                group, a community, which is free but indissoluble, and can perish only with the
                last one of us” (335). Between this liberation in France from the unexercised law of
                the father and the willful submission in Scotland to national duty, Oswald
                encounters Corinne and Italy through a cult of genius that is simultaneously a cult
                of the nation. Corinne distills the best of Italian climate, arts, and history while
                she surmounts the failings to which those very factors have condemned her people. In
                gazing upon her, both natives and foreigners perceive an idealized image of poetic
                self-determination even as they recognize the social and political contingencies
                that make such self-determination impossible. Corinne is not Italy, as the secret of
                her birth finally reveals and as the title of the novel, with its impossible
                imperative to choose between the individual and the nation, makes clear; but she
                does personify the tension between identity and authority with which Oswald must
                contend.</p>
                  <p>The novel itself involves its readers in an analogous contention between nation and
                selfhood. Staël’s narrative rhetoric insists upon a normative perspective for the
                appreciation of landscape, the fine arts, and general scenes of cultural life,
                suggesting a universal aesthetic position by which culture may be apprehended and
                critiqued. Whether it is the picturesque beauty of Ancona or the sublime terror of
                Vesuvius, the sailors in the Adriatic or the citizens of Naples, the ruins of Rome
                or the buildings and galleries of Bologna, Italian culture is offered as a sequence
                of visual tableaux not only for the perceptions of the individual characters, whose
                responses inevitably serve to signify their national dispositions, but for an
                idealized reader whose sympathetic assent to a cosmopolitan taste is presupposed and
                thereby reaffirmed. Staël positions the reader as a cultivated and autonomous mind
                free of the confines of national customs and habits, though she repeatedly insists
                not only on the necessity of the conclusions they derive but also on the collective
                understandings and beliefs that shape all individuals, common and refined alike. We
                are repeatedly lectured on the aesthetic sensibilities of the Italians, the rational
                predilections of the Scots, and the careless sociability of the French through a
                narrative logic that explicitly conjoins character to national customs and those
                customs in turn to climate, religion, politics, and history as well as the
                individual endeavors of poets and artists—the very characters whose impulses
                allegedly are being explained.</p>
                  <p>Explaining himself to Corinne by the tombs of Rome, Oswald speaks in the first-person
                plural as an emissary from the North: “We probably want sadness to surround death .
                . . and even before Christianity enlightened us, our ancient mythology, our Ossian,
                places only regrets and funeral chants beside the grave” (62–63). Later, as Corinne
                sings and plays Scottish laments besides George Wallis’s painting from Ossian’s 
                <title level="m">Temora</title> of Connal asleep on his father’s tomb, which she hangs
                in her private gallery as evidence of her own cultural patrimony, Oswald is overcome
                and begs her to “follow me to those retreats peopled by my memories” (162). Oswald
                and Lucille’s daughter Juliet assumes the same pose at the end of the novel, having
                learned the melody from Corinne at the cost of great suffering. This line of
                Ossianic references converts the bardic song from an already invented tradition of
                Scottish nationalism to a symptom of national character, a marker of aesthetic
                response, and an expression of personal sorrow, and in all cases a signifier of the
                tension between submission to cultural inheritance and assertion of individual
                desire.</p>
                  <p>By the time we turn to <title level="m">Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</title>, students
                are getting used to the contours of the Romantic wanderer. St. Preux, Werther,
                Oswald, Harold—all appear variations of a single character. Alienated from the
                cultural mores of his own society, each takes at least temporary refuge in the road,
                traveling for distraction while acquiring a storehouse of social tableaux and
                natural vistas against which to formulate his own moral identity. That such journeys
                of discovery never fulfill their stated goals of liberation, but instead drive these
                figures either back to the comforts of duty and obligation or into a spiral of
                self-destruction, also seems to be a basic premise of the Romantic pilgrimage.
                Byron’s genius is not to concern himself with conclusions, but to use the template
                of cultural alienation as the medium for a range of aesthetic and historical
                reflections which exceed the limits of convention. As he notes, “a fictitious
                character is introduced for the sake of giving some connexion to the piece” (19),
                but this ironic device helps reveal Romantic character as primarily a conduit for
                binding sociological and historical reflection under the sign of culture.</p>
                  <p>Reading <title level="m">Childe Harold</title> as a fusion of travelogue and memoir,
                the class perceives how culture becomes yet again an object of contemplation 
                <emph>and</emph> a vehicle of self-realization, with aesthetic meditation
                serving as a mode of political as well as historical commentary. Like Staël, whom he
                eulogizes in the fourth canto, Byron constructs poetic pilgrimage both as a response
                to the continental turmoil of the Napoleonic wars and as an alternative
                cosmopolitanism at once skeptical and sympathetic. Students are generally unfamiliar
                with the multitude of locations surveyed in Byron’s work, as well as the many
                political treaties, military battles, and other topical references, and, more than
                in any of the other works in this course, such references can place a barrier
                towards appreciation, particularly in the first two cantos. But they also
                underscore, in the form of Byron’s own copious annotations, how everything from
                ancient ruins to current events can be united within the imperatives of Romantic
                culture to replace content with judgment.</p>
                  <p>The poem’s later set pieces of natural beauty in the third canto take us once again
                back to Vevey and Rousseauvian epiphanies, and I match Byron’s evocation of the Alps
                alongside not only the relevant passages from <title level="m">Julie</title> and the
                <title level="m">Confessions</title>, noted by Byron himself, but the renderings
                of the solitary sublime in Werther (“From the forbidding mountain range, across the
                barren plain untrodden by the foot of man, to the ends of the unknown seas, the
                spirit of the Eternal Creator can be felt rejoicing over every grain of dust that
                comprehends Him <emph>and lives</emph>!” [64]) and Ossian (“When the
                storms of the mountain come; when the north lifts the waves on high; I sit by the
                sounding shore, and look on the fatal rock. Often by the setting moon I see the
                ghosts of my children” [170]). Schiller once again helps us here, specifically his
                reflection in <title level="a">Naïve and Sentimental Poetry</title> on the experience 
                of loss so constitutive of the modern: “Our feeling for nature is like the sick person’s
                feeling for health” (195). Yet the fourth canto returns us to the aesthetic ideal in
                its celebration of “the beings of the mind” (4.5.37) amidst the “marble wilderness”
                (4.79.710) of Rome. We spend a day looking at the masterpieces of antiquity
                alongside Byron’s meditations and find ourselves back in the world of David Finn’s
                <title level="m">How to Visit a Museum</title>, only with a far more eloquent and
                skeptical guide (Siegel).</p>
                  <p>The course could end here, the students having read and considered some of the most
                popular, influential, and archetypal literary expressions of European Romanticism.
                But I find it particularly instructive in an American classroom to jump the Atlantic
                and read James Fenimore Cooper’s first Leatherstocking Tale, <title level="m">The
                    Pioneers</title>, for its rendering of nature and character in perpetual
                transformation—the cultural ethos of the new American nation. Borrowing thematically
                and stylistically from Scott, whose novels would work equally well within the
                paradigms of this course, Cooper presents culture as a state of constant change.
                Culture marks the transition from wilderness to civilization, from the Native to the
                European, but also from the colonies to the states, the early settlements to the
                established cities. As with Staël and Byron, indeed as with Rousseau, Macpherson,
                and Goethe, Cooper marks his own narrative perspective on events as essential, here
                severed irretrievably from the America of his youth and a natural world that is
                itself subject to radical alteration.</p>
                  <p>Throughout the novel, we as readers are made aware of our role in judging the various
                characters and their actions in relation to cultural and historical contingencies.
                Natty Bumpo and Indian John offer us highly mediated echoes of older ways of life
                and stand, like Ossianic heroes, as elegiac markers of historical change, figures
                for stages in a developmental history of the modern nation who must give way to the
                laws of Judge Temple, even as their rightful claims to the land are repeatedly
                recognized in the language of the narrative (Hayne). Also akin to Macpherson’s
                project—and those of Rousseau, Goethe, Staël, and Byron—Cooper’s extensive use of
                footnotes alerts his readers to their own mediated relationship to a cultural (and,
                in Cooper’s case, ecological) past, one to which they are indebted for the
                cultivation of the new world even as their reflective reading experience attests to
                the necessity of its eradication. Even in the optimistic setting of Cooper’s pioneer
                town, the culture of modernity assumes a constitutively elegiac mode: “This was the
                last that they ever saw of the Leather-stocking,” the novel ends, “whose rapid
                movements preceded the pursuit which Judge Temple both ordered and conducted. He had
                gone far towards the setting sun,—the foremost in that band of Pioneers, who are
                opening the way for the march of the nation across the continent” (456). Such a
                conclusion fulfills the transfer of cultural authority to the modern reader. The
                Romantic logic of Cooper’s novel—like every one of the works covered in this
                course—replaces tradition with judgment, offering its readers an aesthetic education
                by which nature and law are reconciled and sublated in the free play of art. As
                Byron notes at the conclusion of <title level="m">Childe Harold</title>, “Farewell!
                with <emph>him</emph> alone may rest the pain / If such there were—with
                    <emph>you</emph>, the moral of his strain!” (4.186.1673–74).</p>
                  <p>This model of cultural identity informs most facets of our modern society, and while
                tracing its roots may be enlightening, it is also worth considering its demise under
                the pressures of globalization. By way of a coda, then, I turn with the students to
                Bill Readings’s <title level="m">The University in Ruins</title>, a critique of the
                culture wars in the modern university that extends the narrative of this course
                through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and suggests our current relation to
                the breakdown of national culture. Readings begins his history where Ray leaves off,
                moving from Schiller’s promotion of aesthetic culture through the German Idealists,
                the celebration of <foreign xml:lang="de">bildung</foreign>, and the Anglo-American promotion
                of the university as the site for the cultivation of the liberal arts within overtly
                national frameworks. With glances at the writings of Matthew Arnold, Cardinal
                Newman, F. R. Leavis, and Allan Bloom, the class is able to perceive the resiliency
                of the models of culture we have been tracing throughout the term. But in equally
                compelling glances at a variety of statements on culture taken from our university’s
                promotional literature (and duplicated, no doubt, at any current institution of
                higher learning), we are able to witness the evacuation of culture as a site of
                meaning under pressure from the corporate discourse of excellence which Readings so
                brilliantly critiques. Arguing that the logic of culture is inextricable from the
                rise and fall of the nation-state and the modern university, Readings helps situate
                the practice as well as the subject of the class within historical and institutional
                parameters.</p>
                  <p>What are the advantages of this approach to the teaching of Romanticism over some of
                the more exclusively British models in which many of us have been trained and which
                this selection of essays aims to widen if not critique? Besides the very real
                problem of literary provincialism, a problem only partially and imperfectly
                addressed by the inclusion of French, German, and American works, I would argue that
                the sampling of Romantic literature I offer my students is more representative of
                the historical phenomenon itself, emphasizing as it does works whose influence
                spread throughout Europe and the wider world far more so than the writings of many
                other poets, essayists, and novelists typically included in anthologies of Romantic
                literature. From a European perspective, it is Rousseau, Goethe, and Byron who
                constitute fountainheads of Romantic expression. It is Schiller and Staël who
                articulate through literary and critical works the profound traumas of the
                revolution, and it is Ossian who offers a new aesthetic for poets, a tradition of
                “ethnopoetics” whose relation to the equally vibrant experimental strain of
                nineteenth-century poetries can be traced wonderfully through the use of Jerome
                Rothenberg and Jeffrey C. Robinson’s <title level="m">Poems for the Millennium,
                    Volume Three: The University of California Book of Romantic and Postromantic
                    Poetry</title>. Furthermore, by exploring Romanticism as imbricated within a modern
                logic of culture, students can appreciate it as an influential response to social
                and intellectual transformations still unfolding in the present day. Hard choices of
                selection are always necessary. What I have tried to outline in this essay is a
                combination of texts and approaches that I have found to work well in the advanced
                undergraduate classroom. They offer students a compelling survey of European
                Romanticism while offering instructors a provocative challenge to reimagine this
                exciting moment in literary history.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Description</head>
                  <p rend="noCount">This course examines imaginative representations of the self in the poems, novels,
                autobiographies, essays, and sermons of the earliest African American writers,
                including the works of Phillis Wheatley, Harriet Jacobs, and Frederick Douglass and
                draws connections with contemporary writers and musicians. “Imag-I-Nations” is a
                term that denotes the ways writers represent themselves and construct identity along
                (trans)national lines as well as the way the imagination embroiders the
                representation of self through metaphors that cut across nations, realms, and
                borders (both physical and imagined). “Imag-I-Nations” is a nod towards Homi K.
                Bhabha’s “DissemiNation” and its acknowledgement of Derrida’s book of the same title
                (sans capital “N”). Paul Gilroy’s notion of an “Ethiopianist Imaginary” is an
                important way of understanding how black Atlantic writers recreate a home that
                reifies the black identity that the white supremacist power structures attempt to
                destroy or define and confine (9). Ultimately, Wheatley maps a heavenly home—a room
                in the “bright abode / Th’Empyreal palace of the thund’ring God” (<title level="m">On Imagination,</title>
                lines 3–4),—that exists in her lines of poetry, not wholly unlike Whitman’s
                casting himself as a house unto himself “a cosmos” or Wordsworth “whose dwelling is
                in the light of setting suns,” or Dickinson’s dwelling “in possibility— / A
                fairer house than prose—&gt;” (Poem 466, 1–2). Ultimately, the
                transnational Imag-I-Nation creates a place that can’t be mapped or owned, an
                imaginary place. </p>
                  <p rend="noCount"> Gilroy’s <emph>Black Atlantic</emph> makes an irrefutable case for the
                centrality of music to understanding the interplay among Atlantic cultures. He
                demonstrates that African American liberation theology that dates from the time of
                slavery is a central theme in music of the “black Atlantic.” In the tradition of
                Wheatley, many black Atlantic artists have created spiritual utopias with words to
                express their hopes, but these artists have also used syncopated poetry in the form
                of hip hop lyrics to create dystopias that give vent to the persistence of racism in
                the wake of colonialism and slavery. Reggae, dancehall, and hip hop artists in the
                late 20th to early 21st century create an urban identity
                through the interplay between the representation of self and city. In the lyrics of
                many artists, ghettos are cast in biblical terms as utopias or dystopias, and the
                rapper or singer as the old testament prophet warning of the fall of Babylon and/or
                the voice prophesying Zion/New Jerusalem: as is exemplified by the difference
                between the dystopic America of Childish Gambino, the New York City of Grandmaster
                Flash’s <title level="a">Message</title> and Nas’s <title level="a">N.Y. State of Mind</title> compared with beatific Big Apple of
                Jay Z and Alicia Keys’s <title level="a">Empire State of Mind</title>; Kendrick Lamar’s Compton; Lauryn
                Hill’s <title level="a">New Jersey</title> as Zion; and, to cross the Atlantic, Apache Indian’s union of
                self, Birmingham (UK) and his ancestral home in India in terms of a blessed
                combination of the four elements as well as Rastafarian and Hindu religions in “Om
                Numah Shivaya.” One of the many links among these writers is the message that, in
                the words of Salman Rushdie, “we will not be capable of reclaiming precisely the
                thing that was lost; that we will, in short, create fictions, not actual cities of
                villages, but invisible ones, imaginary homelands” (10). According to Credo’s Mind
                Maps, even these imaginary homelands are segregated by library classification
                systems of call numbers, and shelf marks as well academic curricula that house these
                fictional homes in separate dwelling spaces. What are the connections between these
                forms of separation in the way knowledges and cities are constructed? </p>

                  <head>Description</head>
                  <p rend="noCount">Originating in the late-18th century and flowering in the
                    19th, Romanticism was a multi-faceted, complex literary movement that radically
                    altered the way language expresses the human condition. Reacting against a
                    dehumanizing industrialization, an excessive scientific rationalization of
                    nature, and unimaginative philosophical, political, and religious orthodoxies,
                    Romantic writing at its best was a clarion call for liberation of all sorts
                    -physical, spiritual, mental, and formal. In this course, we will explore how
                    poets from all over the world, particularly the Americas, Europe, and Asia,
                    participated in the Romantic project. We will focus particularly on the Romantic
                    exploration of new forms of language, consciousness, and social/biological
                    relationships; experiments with dreamwork and other visionary practices;
                    reassessments of ancient cultural terrains; foregrounding of the subjective,
                    emotional, and transcendental; movement towards globalism; and reconstruction of
                    the concept of the poem itself.</p>

                  <head>Description:</head>
                  <p rend="noCount">What were French and German authors writing about before and after Shelley
                composed <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>? The European Romantic Movement
                aims to foster understanding of the term “Romantic,” especially as it relates to the
                fiction, prose, poetry, and drama in Britain, France, Germany, and abroad ca. 1780
                to 1830. We will read harbingers of the European Romanticism (Rousseau’s 
                <title level="m">Confessions</title>, and Goethe’s <title level="m">Sufferings of
                    Young Werther</title>); key texts of the period (Goethe’s 
                <title level="m">Faust</title>, Shelley’s <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, and Hoffmann’s 
                <title level="m">Sandman</title>); poetry by Droste-Hülshoff, Novalis and Heine; and
                overlooked writers and artists who influenced major issues of the day like the
                French Revolution, colonialism, and women’s rights. The class will discuss themes
                common to Romantic-era writing, such as nature, utopia, freedom, the grotesque, and
                the uncanny across several fictional genres (poetry, drama, prose, memoir, and
                novellas). Students will leave the course with an appreciation for the ways in which
                literary movements transcend national and generic borders.</p>

                     <hi rend="bold">Comparative Paper</hi>: Write a 10-page essay on any two texts we
                have read so far. Choose from one of the following general topics &amp; work on
                specifying them:
                <quote>
                        <emph>Liberty</emph>: Which of the authors we have read so far embodies some of the 
                    freedoms you think are most important espoused in the Declarations (American, 
                    French, &amp;/or Gouges) or Rousseau’s <title level="m">Second Discourse</title>? 
                    Consider the ways in which an author depicts freedom of speech &amp; religion; equality 
                    among all races &amp; between men &amp; women; &amp;/or the right to one’s own body, 
                    healthcare, life, protection, knowledge, privacy, &amp;/or a fair trial by closing 
                    analyzing the text for tone, symbolism, word choice, etc.. Your paper proposal should 
                    begin to specify which of these values you want to focus on &amp; brainstorm about what 
                    they mean to you, &amp; what kinds of specific questions you can generate about them 
                    vis-a-vis Romantic-era literature. Your final paper should argue which text (the 
                    Declaration-type or the literary one) is a more effective medium for teaching readers the 
                    values you associate with the term liberty.</quote>
                     <quote>
                        <emph>Nature</emph>: What do literary depictions of nature teach readers? Consider the 
                    list of freedoms &amp; rights listed above; gender roles; &amp;/or religion/death. Your paper 
                    proposal should brainstorm about any one of these subtopics (what they mean to you, what 
                    specific questions you can generate about them vis-a-vis the theme of nature, etc.). The 
                    final paper should argue which of the two texts is a better vehicle for teaching readers 
                    to <emph>act like better people/children of nature</emph> (or: insert your own focus here) 
                    by closely analyzing the authors’ use of tone, symbolism, word choice, etc.</quote>

                     <hi rend="bold">Final Exam</hi>: Trace the presence of the uncanny, Romantic irony, the sublime, 
                    and human rights in <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> and argue which of the French, German 
                    texts we have read this semester seems to resonate most with the themes and issues of the novel.</p>

                unmasked, and, although still armed with power, sneaks no dignity any more; men have
                awoken from their long lethargy and self-deception, and by an impressive majority
                they are demanding the restitution of their inalienable rights. Nor are they merely
                demanding them: on every side they are bestirring themselves to seize by force what
                has, in their opinion, been wrongfully withheld from them. The fabric of the natural
                State is tottering, its rotten foundations are yielding, and there seems to be a 
                <emph>physical</emph> possibility of setting Law upon the throne, of
                honouring Man at last as an end in himself and making true freedom the basis of
                political association. Vain hope! The <emph>moral</emph> possibility is
                wanting, and the favourable moment finds an apathetic generation.</p>

                  <p rend="noCount">I am now convinced that the highest act of reason, by encompassing all ideas, is an
                aesthetic act, and that truth and goodness are only siblings in beauty...Until we
                make ideas aesthetic, that is, mythological, they are of no interest to the people,
                and vice versa: until mythology is rational, it will be an embarrassment to
                philosophy. Thus those who are enlightened and those who are not must finally make
                common cause, mythology must become philosophical, to make the people rational, and
                philosophy must become mythological, to make philosophy sensuous. Then eternal unity
                will reign among us. Never again the arrogant glance, never again the blind
                shuddering of the people before its wise men and priests. Only then will equal
                development of all of our powers await us, for the particular person as well as for
                all individuals. Now power will again be suppressed, then general freedom and
                equality will reign among spirits! – A higher spirit, sent from heaven, must found

                  <p rend="noCount">The whole objection however of the immorality of poetry rests upon a misconception
                of the manner in which poetry acts to produce the moral improvement of man. Ethical
                science arranges the elements which poetry has created, and propounds schemes and
                proposes examples of civil and domestic life: nor is it for want of admirable
                doctrines that men hate, and despise, and censure, and deceive, and subjugate one
                another. But Poetry acts in another and a diviner manner. It awakens and enlarges
                the mind itself by rendering it the receptacle of a thousand unapprehended
                combinations of thought. Poetry lifts the veil from the hidden beauty of the world,
                and makes familiar objects be as if they were not familiar; it reproduces all that
                it represents, and the impersonations clothed in its Elysian light stand
                thenceforward in the minds of those who have once contemplated them, as memorials of
                that gentle and exalted content which extends itself over all thoughts and actions
                with which it coexists. The great secret of morals is Love; or a going out of our
                own nature, and an identification of ourselves with the beautiful which exists in
                thought, action, or person, not our own.</p>

                fall of the Bastille]: but it is not to be described! One must have been present, to
                form any judgment of a scene, the sublimity of which depended much less on its
                external magnificence than on the effect it produced on the minds of the spectators.
                ‘The people, sure, the people were the sight!’ I may tell you of pavilions, of
                triumphal arches, of altars on which incense was burnt, of two hundred thousand men
                walking in procession; but how am I to give you an adequate idea of the behaviour of
                the spectators? How am I to paint the impetuous feelings of that immense, that
                exulting multitude? Half a million of people assembled at a spectacle, which
                furnished every image that can elevate the mind of man; which connected the
                enthusiasm of moral sentiment with the solemn pomp of religious ceremonies; which
                addressed itself at once to the imagination, the understanding, and the heart!</p>

                  <p rend="noCount">The transition from the state of nature to the civil state produces a very
                remarkable change in man, by substituting in his behavior justice for instinct, and
                by imbuing his actions with a moral quality they previously lacked. Only when the
                voice of duty prevails over physical impulse, and law prevails over appetite, does
                man, who until then was preoccupied only with himself, understand that he must act
                according to other principles, and must consult his reason before listening to his
                inclinations. Although, in this state, he gives up many advantages that he derives
                from nature, he acquires equally great ones in return; his faculties are used and
                developed; his ideas are expanded; his feelings are ennobled; his entire soul is
                raised to such a degree that, if the abuses of this new condition did not often
                degrade him below that from which he has emerged, he ought to bless continually the
                wonderful moment that released him from it forever, and transformed him from a
                stupid, limited animal into an intelligent being and a man.</p>

                the ethical State can only make it (morally) necessary, by subjecting the individual
                to the general will; the aesthetic State alone can make it actual, since it carries
                out the will of the whole through the nature of the individual. Though need may
                drive Man into society, and Reason implant social principles in him, Beauty alone
                can confer on him a social character. Taste alone brings harmony into society,
                because it establishes harmony in the individual.</p>

                  <p rend="noCount">In the progress of society, the genius and manners of men undergo a change more
                favourable to accuracy than to sprightliness and sublimity. As the world advances,
                the understanding gains ground upon the imagination; the understanding is more
                exercised; the imagination, less. Fewer objects occur that are new or surprizing.
                Men apply themselves to trace the causes of things; they correct and refine one
                another; they subdue or disguise their passions; they form their exterior manners
                upon one uniform standard of politeness and civility. Human nature is pruned
                according to method and rule. Language advances from sterility to copiousness, and
                at the same time, from fervour and enthusiasm, to correctness and precision. Style
                becomes more chaste; but less animated. The progress of the world in this respect
                resembles the progress of age in man. The powers of imagination are most vigorous
                and predominant in youth; those of the understanding ripen more slowly, and often
                attain not their maturity, till the imagination begins to flag. Hence, poetry, which
                is the child of imagination, is frequently most glowing and animated in the first
                ages of society. As the ideas of our youth are remembered with a peculiar pleasure
                on account of their liveliness and vivacity; so the most ancient poems have often
                proved the greatest fovourites of nations.</p>

                  <p rend="noCount">Fingal being talked of, Dr. Johnson, who used to boast that he had, from the first,
                resisted both Ossian and the Giants of Patagonia, averred his positive disbelief of
                its authenticity. Lord Elibank said, ‘I am sure it is not Macpherson’s. Mr. Johnson,
                I keep company a great deal with you; it is known I do. I may borrow from you better
                things than I can say myself, and give them as my own; but if I should, everybody
                will know whose they are.’ The Doctor was not softened by this compliment. He denied
                merit to Fingal, supposing it to be the production of a man who has had the
                advantages that the present age affords, and said, ‘Nothing is more easy than to
                write enough in that style if once you begin.’ One gentleman in company expressing
                his opinion that Fingal was certainly genuine, for that he had heard a great part of
                it repeated in the original, Dr. Johnson indignantly asked him whether he understood
                the original; to which an answer being given in the negative, ‘Why then,’ said Dr.
                Johnson, ‘we see to what this testimony comes: thus it is.’</p>

                never existed, even if he mourns her as something having existed and now lost. When
                Ossian tells of the days which are no more, and of the heroes who have disappeared,
                his poetic power has long since transformed those images of recollection into
                ideals, and those heroes into gods. The experience of a particular loss has been
                broadened into the idea of universal evanescence and the bard, affected and pursued
                by the image of omnipresent ruin, elevates himself to the skies to find there, in
                the cycle of the sun, an image of the immutable.</p>

                  <p rend="noCount">There are, it seems to me, two entirely distinct literatures, that coming up from
                the South and that coming down from the North, that of which Homer is the main
                source and that of which Ossian is the origin. The English poets, it may be said,
                are noteworthy for their philosophic spirit – it is displayed in all their works –
                whereas Ossian has almost no serious ideas: he narrates a succession of incidents
                and impressions. I answer to this objection that the most common images and ideas in
                Ossian are those that call to mind the brevity of life, respect for the dead and the
                celebration of their memory, and the devotion of those who remain to those who are
                departed. If the poet has not combined with these sentiments any moral maxims or
                philosophical reflections, it is because in that era the human mind was not yet
                capable of the abstraction necessary for the drawing of conclusions. But the shock
                to the imagination caused by the songs of Ossian dispose the mind to the most
                profound meditations.</p>

                  <p rend="noCount">None but foreigners are still the dupes of Ossian; all England is convinced 
                that the poems which bear the name of his are the works of Mr. Macpherson himself. I was for
                a long time deceived by this ingenious fraud; an enthusiast in Ossian, like a young
                man, as I was then, I was obliged to pass several years among the literati of London
                before I could be entirely undeceived. But at length, conviction was no longer to be
                resisted, and the palaces of Fingal vanished away from before me like many other of
                my dreams . . .</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">To say the truth it seems now wholly incredible how any one ever could have 
                been deceived with respect to the true author of Ossian’s poems. The man of the
                eighteenth century peeps through the thin veil at every moment. I will only instance
                by way of example the apostrophe of the bard to the sun. ‘O sun,’ he says, ‘whence
                comest thou, whither dost thou go, wilt thou not fall one day,’ &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">Madame de Staël who is so well versed in the history of the human understanding 
                will see that there are here so many complex ideas under moral, physical, and
                metaphysical relations, that they can scarcely without palpable absurdity be
                ascribed to a savage. Besides this, the most abstract ideas on time, on duration,
                and on eternity, occur at almost every page of Ossian. I have lived among the
                savages of America, and I have observed that they often talk of the times that are
                past, but never of those that are to come. Some grains of dust at the bottom of the
                tomb, remain to them as a testimony of life in the vacuum of the past, but what can
                indicate to them existence in the vacuum of the future. This anticipation of the
                future, which is so familiar to us, is nevertheless one of the strongest
                abstractions at which the ideas of mankind have arrived. Happy the savage who does
                not know like us, that grief is followed by grief, and whose soul devoid of
                recollection or of foresight does not concenter in itself, by a sort of painful
                eternity, the past, the present, and the future.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">But what proves incontestably that Mr. Macpherson is the author of Ossian’s 
                poems, is the perfection or the beautiful ideal of morals which reigns in them. This deserves
                to be somewhat dwelt upon. The beautiful ideal is the offspring of society; men
                nearly in a state of nature have no conception of it. They content themselves in
                their songs, with painting exactly what they see; and as they live in the midst of
                deserts, their pictures are always grand and poetical; for this reason no bad taste
                is to be found in their compositions, but then they are and must be, monotonous, and
                the sentiments they express cannot arrive at true heroism. . . .</p>
                  <p rend="noCount">I ask now where Ossian could have imbibed those perfect ideas of morals with which he
                adorns his heroes. It was not in his religion, since it is agreed on all hands that
                there is no religion among his savages. Could it be from nature itself? – And how
                should the savage Ossian seated upon a rock in Caledonia, while every thing around
                him was cruel, barbarous, gross and sanguinary, arrive so rapidly at those notions
                of morals which were scarcely understood by Socrates in the most enlightened days of
                Greece? – notions, which the Gospel alone revealed to the world, as the result of
                observations pursued for four thousand years upon the character of man....In fine,
                Mr. Macpherson has been guilty of mistakes in Natural History, which would alone
                suffice to betray the imposture: he has planted oaks where nothing but gorse ever
                grew, and made eagles scream, where nothing was ever heard but the voice of the
                barnacle, or the whistling of the curlew.”</p>
