            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">This article argues that India occupies a central position in Romantic 
                    literature, and that this centrality requires teachers of this period to engage with India 
                    as both a site of cultural production and an object of imaginative fascination. It offers 
                    teachers of Romantic literature a pedagogical framework and three specific case studies to 
                    illustrate approaches to Romantic India across a range of courses. In the first case study, I 
                    suggest how a narrowly focused seminar could pair texts produced by British and South Asian 
                    writers—representatives of the “Anglo-Indian” and “Indo-Anglian” discourse communities, 
                    respectively—to help students grasp how the writing and experience of British and Indian 
                    subjects of the early Indian empire was at once intermingled and strictly segregated. The 
                    second case study considers how a period survey might incorporate a brief unit on Romantic India 
                    that nonetheless treats India as an integral part of the literature of the period. I suggest 
                    pairing some of Robert Burns’s short lyrics with poems by Henry Derozio, who engages analogous 
                    themes of nationalism and poetic vision in the Indian context. Reading Burns and Derozio together, 
                    I suggest, can help students see how literary dialects of English could serve as powerful but 
                    problematic tools of identity-formation and social mobility in both the colonial and domestic 
                    contexts. In the final case study, I examine the possibilities of teaching a longer work, Sydney 
                    Owenson’s <title level="m">The Missionary</title>. I show how Owenson’s novel offers rich 
                    opportunities to engage students with key elements of Britain’s colonial history in India while 
                    simultaneously illustrating many of the formal tensions that characterized the novel in this period.

            <p>India figures in English writing of the Romantic period as both an important
                literary <emph>topos</emph> and a geographic and discursive site from
                which British and Indian writers produced a diverse array of texts. As an imagined
                space, “India”<note place="foot" resp="editors">For the purposes of this article, 
                    I will use “India” to reflect common usage among English speakers in the Romantic 
                    era. “India” was a capacious category that included, at one time or another, most 
                    or all of the territories now generally identified as “South Asia”: principally 
                    the nations of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka; and, to a lesser extent, 
                    Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan, and the Maldives.</note> brought with it the baggage of 
                centuries of European fascination with the exotic Orient; in this guise, the subcontinent 
                was merely one part of a vast and relatively undifferentiated mass stretching from North 
                Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean to the shores of China and Japan. At the same time,
                however, Britain’s deepening involvement with India in an economic, cultural, and
                “boots-on-the-ground” capacity helped to specify the subcontinent in the British
                imagination. Britons both at home and abroad began to write with a newly intimate
                and empirical (though not necessarily more accurate) knowledge of the people and
                places of South Asia. And in India itself, the growing influence of the British
                meant that Indian subjects of the (as yet informal) empire increasingly turned to
                English as a medium of communication, advocacy, and expression. Indeed, Gauri
                Viswanathan makes a strong case in <title level="m">Masks of Conquest</title> that the 
                discipline of English itself originated in the schools and colleges administered by the 
                East India Company in the 1820s and 1830s. Thus, if students of Romantic-era Britain are 
                to understand the literature, culture, and politics of the period, they must become to
                some extent students of the India of that era as well; they will need to grasp at
                least the outlines of the relationship that would so crucially mold the literatures
                and histories of both nations—and the development of literature in English around
                the world—in the centuries to follow.</p>
            <p>To that end, this article suggests some general pedagogical principles, as well as a
                few specific texts and classroom approaches, for the teaching of Romantic India. It
                does so according to the model advocated by Harish Trivedi, among others, which
                views colonial discourse as a series of “transactions”: “an interactive, dialogic,
                two-way process rather than as a simple active-passive one” (Trivedi 1). While
                Trivedi’s model could lend itself to underemphasizing the inequalities that underlie
                these literary-cultural transactions, I will argue that this danger is not disabling
                and that a transactional approach can acknowledge the agency of colonized writers
                without effacing the context of oppression. The single greatest strength of the
                transactional approach, however, is that it breaks down the divisions, sometimes
                tacit, sometimes explicit, that have tended to creep up between British and Indian
                writing, and also between the canonical “literature” produced in Britain versus the
                texts of merely “historical” interest produced—by both British and Indian
                writers—“in the Empire.” By seeing the ways in which writers of different national
                and imperial identities used literature to respond to the opportunities and
                anxieties inspired by the colonial encounter, students can gain a much “thicker”
                sense of the world(s) of the Romantic era.</p>
            <p>Because the endpoints of our period are so variable and contentious, Romanticists
                are well used to both problematizing and defending the notion of literary
                periodization. In India, “the Romantic period” is an even less coherent entity than
                in Britain, since the subcontinent, even the limited parts of it under British rule
                or influence, was subject to very different historical and cultural pressures than
                operated in Britain itself. To take just two examples: since France’s influence in
                India had atrophied almost completely in the wake of the British East India
                Company’s victories during the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763), the impact of the
                French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, so transformative in Britain and
                continental Europe, was muted on the subcontinent. Similarly, Britain’s ongoing
                industrialization, with the accompanying movements toward enclosure, urbanization,
                and labor unrest, was felt very differently in India, though the emerging
                globalization of the textile industry meant that these material pressures could be
                magnified or refracted unpredictably as well as attenuated by distance and 
                time.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Siraj Ahmed’s excellent
                    <title level="m">The Stillbirth of Capital: Enlightenment Writing and Colonial India</title> 
                    for a detailed account of how the entanglement of British and Indian economies in 
                    the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was reflected in the period’s literature.</note> 
                In short, two of the markers of historical “context” most familiar to scholars and 
                teachers of British Romanticism are of limited value in illuminating the development 
                of colonial discourse in India. </p>
            <p>Conveniently, however, the conventional endpoints of the Romantic period in the
                1780s and 1830s do contain events of considerable import to life in British India.
                The 1780s witnessed both William Jones’s founding of the Asiatick Society, which
                would produce much of the influential Orientalist scholarship of the next century
                (including the “Indo-European hypothesis” of a fundamental kinship between the
                languages of India and Europe), and the sensational impeachment trial of Warren
                Hastings, then governor-general of Bengal.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                    <title level="j">Asiatick Researches</title>, which began publication in 1788, 
                    was the organ of the Asiatick Society and contains most of Jones’s scholarly treatises, 
                    along with articles by other important orientalist scholars, such as H. T. Colebrooke 
                    and Horace Hayman Wilson. Facsimiles of most of the issues of <title level="j">Asiatick 
                        Researches</title> are available through open-access resources like Google Books 
                    and the Internet Archive.</note> Edmund Burke’s speeches before and
                during the trial, which were hugely popular (and controversial) for their florid,
                often sentimental rhetoric, alleged that Hastings’s regime was marred by corruption,
                atrocities, and militaristic overreach.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Extracts from 
                    these speeches would make a suggestive intertext to read alongside Burke’s more frequently 
                    taught texts on the sublime and the French Revolution. Sara Suleri’s chapters on Burke in 
                    <title level="m">The Rhetoric of English India</title> remain the definitive readings 
                    of the connections between Burke’s aesthetic theory and his anti-Hastings rhetoric.</note> At 
                the other end of the Romantic period, the 1830s saw a decisive shift away from the engagement 
                with the languages and cultures of India that characterized the “Orientalist” era of
                Jones and Hastings. In its place developed the “Anglicist” program of acculturation
                famously codified in Thomas Babington Macaulay’s <title level="a">Minute on Indian Education</title> 
                of 1835 and implemented through the English Education Act of the same year.<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">Viswanathan offers an excellent summary of the Orientalist/Anglicist debate 
                    in chapter 1 of <title level="m">Masks of Conquest</title>.</note> 
                Macaulay’s call “to form a class of persons who may be interpreters between us and
                the millions whom we govern,—a class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but
                English in tastes, opinions, in morals and in intellect,” which did much to
                inaugurate the ambivalent legacy of English education and literature in India, can
                serve as a symbolic endpoint for the era of “Romantic India” (249).</p>
            <p>Because curricular resources at most colleges and universities are too limited to
                devote an entire course to the topic of Romantic India, I will discuss approaches to
                teaching a unit on this topic in two different, more broadly focused, types of
                courses. The first is a survey of Romanticism that emphasizes the global reach of
                British literary as well as material interests in this period. The second is an
                upper-level seminar on Indian literature in English, which I have taught under the
                title <title level="a">English in India/India in English.</title> In this course, the Romantic 
                era is one episode in a longitudinal survey of literary transactions between Britain and South
                Asia running from the eighteenth century to the present. The remainder of this
                article is organized around three “case studies,” each presenting a text or pair of
                texts along with some teaching approaches. One caveat: my own experience with these
                texts has come in universities in the United States, a country whose own involvement
                in the complex relationship between Britain and India is, though real, at a
                considerable remove. Clearly, teaching these texts in other places would raise
                different issues and questions for instructors; however, inviting students to
                explore their own geographical and cultural location as they read, as well as those
                of the producers and consumers of these texts, can be an excellent starting point
                for discussion and collective interpretation. How, for example, might these texts
                and events mean differently for readers in Britain, or South Asia, or other former
                British colonies, than they do for readers in the United States? How did they unite
                or divide different audiences in their own time?</p>

                between Phebe Gibbes’ 1789 novel <title level="m">Hartly House, Calcutta</title> and Dean
                Mahomet’s 1794 travel narrative <title level="m">The Travels of Dean Mahomet</title> (often 
                cited as the first published text by an Indian author), both of which are available in
                recent scholarly editions. I chose relatively short excerpts from the two texts near
                the beginning of my <title level="a">English in India/India in English</title> course to frame 
                two categories important to the history of Indian literature in English: “Anglo-India,”
                which in the nineteenth century described the transplanted society of Britons in
                India, and “Indo-Anglia,” a term that has gained traction in recent decades as a way
                of categorizing writing in English by Indian and diasporic authors.<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">“Anglo-Indian” has also been used, particularly since the early
                            twentieth century, to describe people of mixed British and Indian
                            ancestry. Although this might cause some confusion, nineteenth-century
                            texts are fairly consistent in limiting the use of the term to Britons
                            living abroad in India. The term “Indo-Anglian” was in at least modest
                            circulation as far back as 1883, when a slim collection of specimens of
                            Indian writing in English titled <title level="m">Indo-Anglian
                                Literature</title> was published in Calcutta (Buck).</note> 
                Seeing these two discourse communities intersect at or near their points of origin
                helps students grasp how the writing and experience of British and Indian subjects
                of the early Indian empire could be at once intermingled and strictly segregated.
                Sophia Goldborne, the narrator of <title level="m">Hartly House, Calcutta</title>, is
                the daughter of an East India Company official who travels to Calcutta during the
                Hastings administration and writes letters recounting her experiences there to a
                friend back in England. Sophia’s experience of India is squarely one of Anglo-India,
                contained entirely within the British settlement at Calcutta and involving minimal
                contact with actual Indians. Nonetheless, even Anglo-India was exotic enough to
                Britons of the day that Sophia narrates her encounters with the company nabobs in
                the kind of ethnographic and loco-descriptive detail that characterized
                eighteenth-century encounters with geographical and cultural “others.” Dean Mahomet,
                in contrast, was a Bengali Muslim who joined the company’s army in 1769, serving as
                a soldier and subaltern officer until 1783, when he emigrated to Ireland. The 
                <title level="m">Travels</title>, written and published several years after Mahomet’s
                arrival in Britain but focusing only on his time in India, is also epistolary in
                form, addressed to an unnamed British “friend” and offering a mixture of
                autobiography and ethnography.</p>
            <p>My students were quick to see many of the similarities between Gibbes’s and
                Mahomet’s texts—the epistolary form, for example, with its address to an audience at
                once immediate and displaced, and the sometimes awkwardly integrated conventions of
                the travel narrative and amateur ethnography. I found their responses to other
                aspects of these texts more varied and conflicting. Some were quite conscious, for
                example, of Mahomet’s somewhat ambivalent occupation of his position as native
                informant, at once a representative of and alienated from the people he describes.
                For example, when he offers an “account of the form of marriage among the
                Mahometans, which is generally solemnized with all the external show of Oriental
                pageantry,” both the phrase “the Mahometans” and the stereotyped reference to “the
                external show of Oriental pageantry” suggest an unhesitating identification with the
                perspective of the colonizer (65). As other students more sympathetic to Mahomet’s
                divided loyalties pointed out, however, this alienated perspective also has a
                certain cosmopolitan sophistication, and Mahomet often acts as an advocate, if
                sometimes a condescending one, for the civilizations and cultures of his native
                country. While Gibbes attempts a similar cosmopolitanism—such as when her narrator
                Sophia admonishes her correspondent that “all the prejudices you have so long
                cherished against [India] must be done away; and for this plain reason, that they
                are totally groundless”—some students were frustrated by the novel’s stubborn focus
                on the British settlements and the restriction of Indians’ roles to providing “local
                color” (3). These frustrations can be pedagogically useful, however; Sophia
                Goldborne’s limited horizon, for example, suggests the restricted mobility of the
                few British women in India in the early days of empire as well as the “invisibility”
                of many Indians in British accounts of this period. Dean Mahomet’s pioneering
                “Indo-Anglian” narrative, then, might be offered as a corrective to some of the
                omissions of the “Anglo-Indian” texts of the Romantic era.</p>

            <head>Case Study 2: Comparative Romanticisms</head>
            <p>In an introductory course on British Romanticism, it is especially important to
                build connections between writing from and about India and other topical clusters,
                so that students see “the India stuff” less as an isolated curiosity than as an
                integral part of the literature and history of the period. One way to do this is by
                emphasizing the points of commonality between colonial difference and other kinds of
                marginalization (e.g., geographical, class, gender, ethnic, linguistic) at work on
                the home front. Juxtaposing Robert Burns with the Bengali poet and reformer Henry
                Derozio, for example, can help students see how literary dialects of English could
                serve as powerful but problematic tools of identity-formation and social mobility in
                both the colonial and domestic contexts. Burns and Derozio make a fascinating
                combination because they and their poetry play to different prevailing myths about
                the figure of the Romantic poet: on the one hand, Burns, celebrated as the poet
                born, not made, whose untutored genius brought him brief glory before his inevitable
                decline. On the other, Derozio, who (like Keats) died extremely young; who (like
                Shelley) flirted with philosophical materialism and even atheism; and who (like
                Byron) adopted a rakish persona, flouted the social mores of polite society, and was
                surrounded by rumors of sexual scandal. While we often treat dispelling these
                “romantic” myths of authorship as a pedagogical duty, students are usually more
                receptive to a gradual complication of these reductive narratives than to a frontal
                assault; in the case of an unfamiliar and marginalized figure like Derozio,
                interesting them in the larger-than-life “character” may be a necessary first step
                toward engaging them with his writing.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, Derozio, who could adopt the orientalist clichés of a Byron or a Moore
                in a poem like <title level="a">Song of the Hindustanee Minstrel</title> (“There’s many 
                a valued pearl / In richest Oman’s sea; / But none, my fair Cashmerian girl! / O! none 
                can rival thee [lines 5–8]), also produced poetry whose relation to both “East” and 
                “West” is more complex, such as the sonnet <title level="a">The Harp of India</title>:

                There are a number of resonances here that students in a Romanticism class might pick
                up on: in addition to the Aeolian harp figure in line 4, the “ruined monument on
                desert plain” either alludes to or indirectly evokes <title level="a">Ozymandias,</title> 
                raising the question of where Derozio might locate himself in that rumination on empire’s
                transience. Is the speaker here aligned with Shelley’s traveller, or with the
                “Oriental” civilizations whose ruins he contemplates? Students might also be curious
                about the poem’s formal oddness: the repeated rhyme in lines 4 and 5 subverts the
                quatrain pattern that underlies most English sonnets; its rhetorical turn comes at
                the precise middle, between lines 7 and 8, avoiding the sonnet’s characteristic
                asymmetry; and the closing couplet’s return to the “-ain” ending of lines 2, 4, 5,
                and 7 gives the poem’s aural texture an unfamiliar thickness. Students could be
                asked to find evidence to support or refute the proposition that these deviations
                are signs of resistance to British cultural authority—or, alternatively, of an
                incomplete assimilation of the sonnet’s conventions. </p>
            <p>Although <title level="a">The Harp of India</title> is often described as a patriotic protest 
                against British rule, the ambiguity of its imagery, together with its adoption of European
                conventions (including, obviously, the medium of English), raises interpretive
                questions that can be neatly coupled with an examination of the poem’s form. Is
                Britain’s intervention presented as the cause of India’s long silence—or is it the
                clarion that will awaken her from slumber? Does the poem’s use of a canon of
                nationalist imagery borrowed directly from European sources undermine or enhance its
                nationalism? Conversely, do the echoes of the tradition of resistance from Britain’s
                Celtic fringe that Katie Trumpener has labeled “bardic” nationalism align India with
                other peoples subjected to British colonialism? Pairing <title level="a">The Harp of 
                    India</title> with one or more of Burns’s nationalist songs, such as 
                <title level="a">Caledonia</title> or <title level="a">Such a Parcel of
                Rogues in a Nation,</title> offers students a way to compare the participation of these 
                two very different poets in a literary tradition that both lauded and marginalized their
                efforts. The martial and strikingly defiant tone of a poem like 
                <title level="a">Caledonia,</title> which personifies Scotland as a warrior goddess 
                whose ferocity has taught “The Anglian lion, the terror of France” “to fear in his own 
                native wood” (lines 29, 32) stands in marked contrast to the mournful ambivalence 
                of Derozio’s poem. Similarly, the conditional mood of Derozio’s closing 
                pledge—“<emph>if</emph> thy notes divine / May be by mortal wakened once again, / Harp 
                of my country, let me strike the strain!”—differs starkly from the supreme confidence of 
                Burns’s assertion that “brave Caledonia immortal must be” (line 43). Do these differences 
                reflect a divergence in personal aesthetics or the differing conditions of the poets’ two
                subject nations? Would an Indian poem as defiant as Burns’s have found an
                audience—or even a publisher? Reading Derozio alongside Burns would allow students
                to explore and interrogate parallels between the Indian and the Scottish poets from
                multiple perspectives: poetic and political, textual and contextual.<note place="foot"

            <head>Case Study 3: Teaching a Longer Work</head>
            <p>Finally, I want to discuss some of the opportunities presented by teaching a longer
                text—in this case, Sydney Owenson’s 1811 novel <title level="m">The Missionary: An
                    Indian Tale</title>, now available in a fine critical edition from Broadview Press.
                While I have not had a chance to teach Owenson’s novel myself, I would like to
                present a case for the potential benefits of assigning it, most likely in an
                upper-level undergraduate or graduate course. Of course, a novel, even a relatively
                short one like <title level="m">The Missionary</title>, consumes a substantial chunk
                of course time; it is a significant advantage, then, to choose a text that can be
                brought into dialogue with more than one set of thematic and contextual concerns.
                Owenson’s novel meets this requirement nicely by mapping the colonial encounter in
                India onto both national (Irish) and gendered struggles for self-determination; in
                addition, it offers an opportunity to expose students to the Romantic novel beyond
                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> and Jane Austen. As an
                Irishwoman, Owenson was a subject of British rule in ways that both mirrored and
                sharply differed from the experience of colonized Indians, and <title level="m">The
                    Missionary</title> is a fascinating instance of the displacement of one set of
                imperial anxieties onto another. The novel is set in the 1630s, when Portugal was
                both a colonial power in India and a subject nation, under Spanish domination since
                1580—a position with obvious parallels to Ireland’s in the early nineteenth century.
                <title level="m">The Missionary</title> details the relationship between a
                Portuguese missionary, Hilarion, and a Brahmin priestess, Luxima, who is the object
                of his efforts—initially toward conversion, but soon toward romantic union in
                defiance of both his priestly vows and the caste prejudices of Hindu India. Their
                relationship bears considerable national-allegorical freight, and Owenson follows a
                popular tendency (to which her 1806 novel <title level="m">The Wild Irish Girl</title>
                had already contributed) to figure the conquering nation as male and the conquered
                as female. Still, however idealized and sacrificial she may seem at times, Luxima is
                a character of considerable agency and interest, whose resistance to colonial
                domination and the “priestcraft” of both Catholic and Hindu establishments clearly
                resonated with certain segments of the Romantic reading public: as Michael Franklin
                notes, Percy Shelley “recommend[ed] Owenson’s novel to friends with a proselytizing
                zeal” (167).</p>
             <p><title level="m">The Missionary</title> is also an excellent text for teaching the
                ways in which literature both is and isn’t about its ostensible subject. While Irish
                and protofeminist politics are central to the novel, and while British imperialism
                is displaced onto Portugal and Spain, <title level="m">The Missionary</title> remains
                firmly entrenched in the religious, ideological, and pragmatic concerns of early
                nineteenth-century imperial Britain. As Julia Wright’s excellent introduction to the
                Broadview edition points out, missionary activity in India was a particularly hot
                topic in the years between the Vellore Mutiny of 1806 (which many blamed on
                overzealous proselytizing) and the renewal of the East India Company’s charter in
                1813 (Owenson 40). Like many texts in this period, then,
                 <title level="m">The Missionary</title> was both a work of
                fiction and an implicit argument about the course of empire in India. Its use of
                India—particularly of the “India” that Orientalist scholarship had recently made
                available to Britons—is at once aesthetic and ideological. In a class focused on
                India, a useful comparison point might be Robert Southey’s <title level="m">The
                    Curse of Kehama</title> (1810), which argues implicitly (as Southey did explicitly
                in his periodical writing) for the necessity of British evangelism among the Hindus,
                whose faith he described as “of all false religions [. . .] the most monstrous in
                its fables, and the most fatal in its effects” (3). A juxtaposition between two such
                closely contemporary yet starkly contrasting texts can offer students a portal into
                the complex intertwining of aesthetics and ideology, representation and power, that
                characterized the literary transactions between Britain and its Indian
                “possessions.”</p></div>
