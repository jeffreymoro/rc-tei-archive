               <p class="noCount">We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they
                  are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are
                  Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. —That to secure these rights, Governments
                  are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,
                  —That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the
                  Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying
                  its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them
                  shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.</p>
               <p class="noCount">—<em>Declaration of Independence</em> (1776)</p><br/><hr/><br/><p class="noCount">The representatives of the French people, constituted as a National Assembly, considering
                  that ignorance, neglect, or contempt for the rights of man are the sole causes of
                  public misfortunes and of the corruption of governments, have resolved to set forth,
                  in a solemn declaration, the natural, inalienable and sacred rights of man, in order
                  that this declaration, constantly present to all members of the social body, will
                  ceaselessly remind them of their rights and their duties; so that the acts of the
                  legislative and the executive powers, able to be compared at any moment with the aim
                  of all political institutions, will be better respected; so that the claims of citizens,
                  based henceforth on simple and incontestable principles, will always contribute to
                  maintaining the Constitution and the happiness of all.</p>
               <p class="noCount">—<em>Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen</em> (1789)</p><br/><hr/><br/><p class="noCount">It is true that deference to authority has declined, that its lawlessness is unmasked,
                  and, although still armed with power, sneaks no dignity any more; men have awoken
                  from their long lethargy and self-deception, and by an impressive majority they are
                  demanding the restitution of their inalienable rights. Nor are they merely demanding
                  them: on every side they are bestirring themselves to seize by force what has, in
                  their opinion, been wrongfully withheld from them. The fabric of the natural State
                  is tottering, its rotten foundations are yielding, and there seems to be a <em>physical</em> possibility of setting Law upon the throne, of honouring Man at last as an end in
                  himself and making true freedom the basis of political association. Vain hope! The
                  <em>moral</em> possibility is wanting, and the favourable moment finds an apathetic generation.</p>

               <p class="noCount">Poetry is republican speech: a speech which is its own law and end unto itself, and
                  in which all the parts are free citizens and have the right to vote.</p>
               <p class="noCount">—Friedrich Schlegel, 
                  “Critical Fragments”
                  (1798)</p><br/><hr/><br/><p class="noCount">I am now convinced that the highest act of reason, by encompassing all ideas, is an
                  aesthetic act, and that truth and goodness are only siblings in beauty...Until we
                  make ideas aesthetic, that is, mythological, they are of no interest to the people,
                  and vice versa: until mythology is rational, it will be an embarrassment to philosophy.
                  Thus those who are enlightened and those who are not must finally make common cause,
                  mythology must become philosophical, to make the people rational, and philosophy must
                  become mythological, to make philosophy sensuous. Then eternal unity will reign among
                  us. Never again the arrogant glance, never again the blind shuddering of the people
                  before its wise men and priests. Only then will equal development of all of our powers
                  await us, for the particular person as well as for all individuals. Now power will
                  again be suppressed, then general freedom and equality will reign among spirits! –
                  A higher spirit, sent from heaven, must found this new religion among us, it will
                  be the last, greatest task of humanity.</p>
               <p class="noCount">—Friedrich Hölderlin, 
                  “Oldest Programme for a System of German Idealism”
                  (1796)</p><br/><hr/><br/><p class="noCount">The whole objection however of the immorality of poetry rests upon a misconception
                  of the manner in which poetry acts to produce the moral improvement of man. Ethical
                  science arranges the elements which poetry has created, and propounds schemes and
                  proposes examples of civil and domestic life: nor is it for want of admirable doctrines
                  that men hate, and despise, and censure, and deceive, and subjugate one another. But
                  Poetry acts in another and a diviner manner. It awakens and enlarges the mind itself
                  by rendering it the receptacle of a thousand unapprehended combinations of thought.
                  Poetry lifts the veil from the hidden beauty of the world, and makes familiar objects
                  be as if they were not familiar; it reproduces all that it represents, and the impersonations
                  clothed in its Elysian light stand thenceforward in the minds of those who have once
                  contemplated them, as memorials of that gentle and exalted content which extends itself
                  over all thoughts and actions with which it coexists. The great secret of morals is
                  Love; or a going out of our own nature, and an identification of ourselves with the
                  beautiful which exists in thought, action, or person, not our own.</p>

                  magnificence than on the effect it produced on the minds of the spectators. ‘The people,
                  sure, the people were the sight!’ I may tell you of pavilions, of triumphal arches,
                  of altars on which incense was burnt, of two hundred thousand men walking in procession;

               <p class="noCount">The transition from the state of nature to the civil state produces a very remarkable
                  change in man, by substituting in his behavior justice for instinct, and by imbuing
                  his actions with a moral quality they previously lacked. Only when the voice of duty
                  prevails over physical impulse, and law prevails over appetite, does man, who until
                  then was preoccupied only with himself, understand that he must act according to other
                  principles, and must consult his reason before listening to his inclinations. Although,
                  in this state, he gives up many advantages that he derives from nature, he acquires
                  equally great ones in return; his faculties are used and developed; his ideas are
                  expanded; his feelings are ennobled; his entire soul is raised to such a degree that,
                  if the abuses of this new condition did not often degrade him below that from which
                  he has emerged, he ought to bless continually the wonderful moment that released him
                  from it forever, and transformed him from a stupid, limited animal into an intelligent
                  being and a man.</p>
               <p class="noCount">—Rousseau, 
                  “The Civil State,”
                  <em>The Social Contract</em> (1762)</p><br/><hr/><br/><p class="noCount">The dynamic state can only make society possible, by curbing Nature through Nature;
                  the ethical State can only make it (morally) necessary, by subjecting the individual
                  to the general will; the aesthetic State alone can make it actual, since it carries
                  out the will of the whole through the nature of the individual. Though need may drive
                  Man into society, and Reason implant social principles in him, Beauty alone can confer
                  on him a social character. Taste alone brings harmony into society, because it establishes
                  harmony in the individual.</p>
               <p class="noCount">—Friedrich Schiller, <em>On the Aesthetic Education of Man</em> (1794)</p><br/><hr/><br/><p class="noCount">In the progress of society, the genius and manners of men undergo a change more favourable
                  to accuracy than to sprightliness and sublimity. As the world advances, the understanding
                  gains ground upon the imagination; the understanding is more exercised; the imagination,
                  less. Fewer objects occur that are new or surprizing. Men apply themselves to trace
                  the causes of things; they correct and refine one another; they subdue or disguise
                  their passions; they form their exterior manners upon one uniform standard of politeness
                  and civility. Human nature is pruned according to method and rule. Language advances
                  from sterility to copiousness, and at the same time, from fervour and enthusiasm,
                  to correctness and precision. Style becomes more chaste; but less animated. The progress
                  of the world in this respect resembles the progress of age in man. The powers of imagination
                  are most vigorous and predominant in youth; those of the understanding ripen more
                  slowly, and often attain not their maturity, till the imagination begins to flag.
                  Hence, poetry, which is the child of imagination, is frequently most glowing and animated
                  in the first ages of society. As the ideas of our youth are remembered with a peculiar
                  pleasure on account of their liveliness and vivacity; so the most ancient poems have
                  often proved the greatest fovourites of nations.</p>

               <p class="noCount">Fingal being talked of, Dr. Johnson, who used to boast that he had, from the first,
                  resisted both Ossian and the Giants of Patagonia, averred his positive disbelief of
                  its authenticity. Lord Elibank said, ‘I am sure it is not Macpherson’s. Mr. Johnson,
                  I keep company a great deal with you; it is known I do. I may borrow from you better
                  things than I can say myself, and give them as my own; but if I should, everybody
                  will know whose they are.’ The Doctor was not softened by this compliment. He denied
                  merit to Fingal, supposing it to be the production of a man who has had the advantages
                  that the present age affords, and said, ‘Nothing is more easy than to write enough
                  in that style if once you begin.’ One gentleman in company expressing his opinion
                  that Fingal was certainly genuine, for that he had heard a great part of it repeated
                  in the original, Dr. Johnson indignantly asked him whether he understood the original;
                  to which an answer being given in the negative, ‘Why then,’ said Dr. Johnson, ‘we
                  see to what this testimony comes: thus it is.’</p>
               <p class="noCount">—James Boswell, <em>Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides with Samuel Johnson</em> (1785)</p><br/><hr/><br/><p class="noCount">The elegiac poet seeks nature, but as an idea and in perfection in which she has never
                  existed, even if he mourns her as something having existed and now lost. When Ossian
                  tells of the days which are no more, and of the heroes who have disappeared, his poetic
                  power has long since transformed those images of recollection into ideals, and those
                  heroes into gods. The experience of a particular loss has been broadened into the
                  idea of universal evanescence and the bard, affected and pursued by the image of omnipresent
                  ruin, elevates himself to the skies to find there, in the cycle of the sun, an image
                  of the immutable.</p>
               <p class="noCount">—Friedrich Schiller, <em>Naïve and Sentimental Poetry</em> (1795)</p><br/><hr/><br/><p class="noCount">There are, it seems to me, two entirely distinct literatures, that coming up from
                  the South and that coming down from the North, that of which Homer is the main source
                  and that of which Ossian is the origin. The English poets, it may be said, are noteworthy
                  for their philosophic spirit – it is displayed in all their works – whereas Ossian
                  has almost no serious ideas: he narrates a succession of incidents and impressions.
                  I answer to this objection that the most common images and ideas in Ossian are those
                  that call to mind the brevity of life, respect for the dead and the celebration of
                  their memory, and the devotion of those who remain to those who are departed. If the
                  poet has not combined with these sentiments any moral maxims or philosophical reflections,
                  it is because in that era the human mind was not yet capable of the abstraction necessary
                  for the drawing of conclusions. But the shock to the imagination caused by the songs
                  of Ossian dispose the mind to the most profound meditations.</p>
               <p class="noCount">—Mme de Staël, <em>On Literature</em> (1800)</p><br/><hr/><br/><p class="noCount">None but foreigners are still the dupes of Ossian; all England is convinced that the
                  poems which bear the name of his are the works of Mr. Macpherson himself. I was for
                  a long time deceived by this ingenious fraud; an enthusiast in Ossian, like a young
                  man, as I was then, I was obliged to pass several years among the literati of London
                  before I could be entirely undeceived. But at length, conviction was no longer to
                  be resisted, and the palaces of Fingal vanished away from before me like many other
                  of my dreams . . .</p>
               <p class="noCount">To say the truth it seems now wholly incredible how any one ever could have been deceived
                  with respect to the true author of Ossian’s poems. The man of the eighteenth century
                  peeps through the thin veil at every moment. I will only instance by way of example
                  the apostrophe of the bard to the sun. ‘O sun,’ he says, ‘whence comest thou, whither
                  dost thou go, wilt thou not fall one day,’ &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Madame de Staël who is so well versed in the history of the human understanding will
                  see that there are here so many complex ideas under moral, physical, and metaphysical
                  relations, that they can scarcely without palpable absurdity be ascribed to a savage.
                  Besides this, the most abstract ideas on time, on duration, and on eternity, occur
                  at almost every page of Ossian. I have lived among the savages of America, and I have
                  observed that they often talk of the times that are past, but never of those that
                  are to come. Some grains of dust at the bottom of the tomb, remain to them as a testimony
                  of life in the vacuum of the past, but what can indicate to them existence in the
                  vacuum of the future. This anticipation of the future, which is so familiar to us,
                  is nevertheless one of the strongest abstractions at which the ideas of mankind have
                  arrived. Happy the savage who does not know like us, that grief is followed by grief,
                  and whose soul devoid of recollection or of foresight does not concenter in itself,
                  by a sort of painful eternity, the past, the present, and the future.</p>
               <p class="noCount">But what proves incontestably that Mr. Macpherson is the author of Ossian’s poems,
                  is the perfection or the beautiful ideal of morals which reigns in them. This deserves
                  to be somewhat dwelt upon. The beautiful ideal is the offspring of society; men nearly
                  in a state of nature have no conception of it. They content themselves in their songs,
                  with painting exactly what they see; and as they live in the midst of deserts, their
                  pictures are always grand and poetical; for this reason no bad taste is to be found
                  in their compositions, but then they are and must be, monotonous, and the sentiments
                  they express cannot arrive at true heroism. . . .</p>
               <p class="noCount">I ask now where Ossian could have imbibed those perfect ideas of morals with which
                  he adorns his heroes. It was not in his religion, since it is agreed on all hands
                  that there is no religion among his savages. Could it be from nature itself? – And
                  how should the savage Ossian seated upon a rock in Caledonia, while every thing around
                  him was cruel, barbarous, gross and sanguinary, arrive so rapidly at those notions
                  of morals which were scarcely understood by Socrates in the most enlightened days
                  of Greece? – notions, which the Gospel alone revealed to the world, as the result
                  of observations pursued for four thousand years upon the character of man....In fine,
                  Mr. Macpherson has been guilty of mistakes in Natural History, which would alone suffice
                  to betray the imposture: he has planted oaks where nothing but gorse ever grew, and
                  made eagles scream, where nothing was ever heard but the voice of the barnacle, or
                  the whistling of the curlew.”</p>
