               <h2><span class="head">Introduction: Teaching Romanticism in a Global Age</span></h2>
               <p>What does it mean to teach Romanticism in a global age? In the eighteenth century,
                  global signified “having a spherical form”; the association of global with “relating
                  to, or involving the whole world” arose in the mid-nineteenth century (“Global”).
                  The term global, however, is not synonymous with <em>globalization</em>, as Felicity Nussbaum notes in the introduction to her edited collection, <em>The Global Eighteenth Century</em> (2003; 4). In the twenty-first century, the term globalization refers to the patterns
                  and processes by which technology allows people across the world to rapidly communicate
                  and trade goods and ideas, and <em>global</em> has come to signify the interconnectedness of peoples and the world they share. The
                  essays collected here suggest that teaching Romanticism in a global age invites flexibility
                  and imagination in the modalities instructors employ and in the texts that they select
                  to make a curriculum. Collectively, the essays in this volume define global Romanticism
                  as an intersection of world literatures; they present varied approaches to teaching
                  Anglophone Romanticism in ways that acknowledge ties to other cultures, languages,
                  and literatures through individual assignments, units, and syllabi.</p>

                  <p>This introductory chapter surveys the debate over the shifting meanings of the term
                     global in the last two decades among literary scholars and pedagogues in order to
                     frame global Romanticism as a concept and field. The term global seems to imply an
                     international angle; while the essays here address global themes, issues, and texts,
                     they are focused on British and American literature and literature in translation.
                     The pervasiveness of English has come to represent its status as a global language
                     and its effect on other languages.

                     </div> Critics from outside the English-speaking world cite the dominance of the English
                     language and Anglo-American culture as party to the spread of <em>globalization</em>, a word that seems to imply Anglo-centrism. In a 1999 lecture for UNESCO, 
                     “Globalisation, Peace, and Cosmopolitanism,”
                      Jacques Derrida distinguishes between the French term <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">mondialisation</span> and the similar English and German terms globalization and <span xml:lang="de" lang="de" class="foreign">Globalisierung</span>. Whereas mondialisation, for Derrida, denotes the process of the world in formation,
                     the finality and ostensible universality of the English term globalization disguises
                     the power imbalances of the “<em>homo-hegemonizations</em>” enacted by “the Anglo-American hegemony” and its concomitant governmental and nongovernmental
                     institutions (373).

                              (2007). See also Jean-Luc Nancy’s book The Creation of the World or Globalization
                              (2007); its translator, Francois Raffoul, substitutes “world-forming” for the term

                  <p>Evidence supports Derrida’s argument that Anglo-American language and culture do in
                     fact dominate the discourses of globalism and globalization. In <em>English as a Global Language</em> (1997/2003), David Crystal notes that English has replaced French “as the chief foreign
                     language in schools in Algeria (a former French colony)” (5). More recently, Rwanda
                     changed the language of its education system from French to English in order to better
                     access the global economy, according to officials (McGreal). The majority of scholarly
                     debates about globalization appear to take place in English as well. In the essay 
                     “A Bibliometric Research Analysis of 20 Years of Globalization Research: 1990–2009,”
                      Xinjian Liu and his collaborators examine the search term “globali*” across multiple
                     databases and libraries and find that nearly 93% of the journal articles are written
                     in English (Liu et al. 197), many of them in the mid-1990s, during the rise of the
                     internet, the practice of outsourcing, and the expansion of the European Union (Liu
                     et al. 198). These findings are perhaps not surprising given that the authors limit
                     their search to the term “globali,” which would pick up the Spanish word, <span xml:lang="es" lang="es" class="foreign">globalización</span>, but neither <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">mondialisation</span> nor the term in many other languages. The same study found that “the volume of books
                     on globalization peaked around 2002 and declined afterwards” (Liu et al. 198). While
                     many of these publications belong to the social sciences, in the field of literary
                     studies, a similar pattern appears. Many scholars published special volumes on literature
                     and globalization around the turn of the millennium.

               <p>Scholarly reflection on globalization in the mid-aughts took the form, in the study
                  of Romanticism, of work on cosmopolitanism. While most of the examples of “cosmopolitan”
                  cited in the <em>OED</em> stem from the 1840s or afterwards, the word reflects growing identification with
                  the culture of the metropolis, or as Jon Klancher puts it, “London as Cosmopolis”
                  (65). Romantic Cosmopolitanism was the theme of the 2004 annual meeting of the North
                  American Society for the Study of Romanticism (NASSR). That conference took place
                  the year after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, and David Simpson prefaced his talk with
                  the remark that “in 2003 precisely 18 students graduated from US universities with
                  advanced degrees in Arabic (apparently up from 6 in 2002)” (142). Published in a special
                  volume in <em>The European Romantic Review</em> in 2005, the essay version of this talk, 
                  “The Limits of Cosmopolitanism and the Case for Translation,”
                  poses two important questions about translation and “human feeling”: <span class="quote">‘The question for both is the same: can what is written in one language make sense
                     in another; can what is felt by one person be the same as what is felt by someone
                     from a different place or time? For poetry, which was and is often the site where
                     feeling is held to matter most, where we might expect to recognize that “we have all
                     of us one human heart,” each question is a version of the other (Simpson 146).’</span> The suggestion here, that poetry—the work of translation, and understanding others’
                  feelings require the subject to bridge the gap between self and other—is helpful for
                  understanding a pedagogy that aims to teach global awareness. The essays in this volume
                  attest beautifully to the idea that teaching literature helps to cultivate awareness
                  of others, or empathy.</p>
               <p>Empathy plays a key role in Martha Nussbaum’s argument about what it means to learn,
                  teach, and work in a global age. In her book <em>Not for Profit: Why Democracy Needs the Humanities</em> (2016), Nussbaum refers several times to what she calls “world citizenship” (89)
                  and at other times “global citizens” (94); these are students who are prepared to
                  address issues that humans face across national lines, including but not limited to
                  “global warming; decent trade regulations; the protection of the environment and animal
                  species; the future of nuclear energy and the dangers of nuclear weapons; the movement
                  of labor and the establishment of decent labor standards; the protection of children
                  from trafficking, sexual abuse, and forced labor” (80). Nussbaum advocates an interdisciplinary
                  curriculum that combines the study of the arts and humanities “alongside the study
                  of religion and of philosophical theories of justice” (94). This course of study aims
                  to cultivate what Nussbaum calls “students’ ‘inner eyes’” in order to instill the
                  ability to connect and communicate across barriers that traditionally divide humans
                  from each other and the issues that they want to solve (Nussbaum 108). While Nussbaum,
                  like Simpson, specifically mentions poetry as a tool for teaching empathy, as the
                  essays in this volume illustrate, even nonpoetic texts from the Romantic era appear
                  well suited for curricula with these learning goals, in part because writers from
                  the period raise issues about social justice.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The Romantic period also plays an important role in the larger historical process
                     of globalization. According to Roland Robertson, the Romantic era occurs during the
                     second of five such phases. Robertson names this “The Incipient Phase,” and describes
                     it as: <span class="quote">‘Lasting—mainly in Europe—from the mid-eighteenth century until the 1870s. Sharp shift
                        towards the idea of the homogeneous, unitary state; crystallization of conceptions
                        of formalized international relations, of standardized citizenly individuals and a
                        more concrete conception of humankind. Sharp increases in legal conventions and agencies
                        concerned with international and transnational regulation and communication. (58)’</span> As the essays in this volume highlight, global Romanticism at once participates in
                     this trend and critiques it. For example, although scholars tend to cite the idealized
                     world view of Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) as part of the trend toward nationalism
                     that Robertson describes,

                     </div> In fact, problems arise when scholars attempt to synthesize a global ethos for Romanticism.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Romanticists have long understood that making sense of trends is as important for
                  our own era as it is for scholars of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In the
                  lead-up to the 2003 war in Iraq, for example, writers debated the ideological legacy
                  of Romanticism in regards to globalization and imperialism. Consider George P. Fletcher’s
                  book, <em>Romantics at War: Glory and Guilt in the Age of Terrorism</em> (2002). Fletcher takes as his premise the idea that Romantic notions of “authenticity”
                  pervade international law and complicate the arbitration of extranational crimes such
                  as terrorism (140). Critics have pointed out that Fletcher uses a reductive definition
                  of Romanticism (based largely on Isaiah Berlin) and that he fails to acknowledge that
                  many eras besides the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries teach “in one form or another
                  that the individual’s good is intelligible only against the backdrop of the collective
                  good” (Berkowitz 32). In a more nuanced vein, Gayatri Spivak’s <em>An Aesthetic Education in the Era of Globalization</em> (2012) asserts Romanticism’s “ability to imagine the other side as another human
                  being, rather than simply an enemy to be psyched out, which is [the period’s] . .
                  . greatest gift” (Spivak 483). Like Simpson and Nussbaum, Spivak emphasizes the power
                  of Romantic literature to evoke empathy in readers.</p>
               <p>In the years since the official end of the war in Iraq, scholarship on Romanticism
                  and the global has largely explored the scientific, economic implications of international
                  trade, travel, and communications. Evan Gottlieb’s book, <em>Romantic Globalism: British Literature and Modern World Order, 1750–1830</em> (2014), makes a strong case for British writers’ awareness of “the global processes
                  and dynamics that were increasingly reshaping their lives, their nation, and the world”
                  (2). His coedited collection, <em>Global Romanticism: Origins, Orientations, and Engagements, 1760–1820</em> (2015), demonstrates even more diverse views on the subject, with essays on the early
                  networks of empire and communication. Gottlieb’s focus on what he terms <em>globalism</em> offers a model for future scholarship that seeks to integrate the texts and contexts
                  of Romanticism into discussions of globalization in a way that acknowledges the need
                  to explore and entertain different angles of such a broad and diverse subject.</p>
               <p>The essays in this volume provide concrete methods of putting recent scholarship on
                  Romanticism and the global into action in the classroom. The opening essay by Eric
                  Gidal, 
                  “Teaching Global Romanticisms: Romanticism and the Logic of Culture,”
                  illustrates the ways in which assigning texts with international impact on the movement
                  of Romanticism across Britain and Europe can cultivate a deeper understanding of Romantic
                  writers’ influence on modern culture. Gidal employs William Ray’s model for studying
                  culture in his book <em>The Logic of Culture: Authority and Identity in the Modern Age</em> (2001) in order to present a theoretical model, historical background, and institutional
                  framework for analyzing the tensions between individual aesthetic experiences and
                  the pressures of national traditions. The course that Gidal describes, 
                  “Literature and Culture of the Romantic Period: The Logic of Culture,”
                  incorporates British, French, and German texts. Selections include but are not limited
                  to fictional texts such as Rousseau’s <em>Julie, or the New Heloise </em>(<em><span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse</span></em>, 1761), Staël’s <em>Corinne, or Italy</em> (<em><span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Corinne, ou L'Italie</span></em>, 1807), and Goethe’s <em>Sorrows of Young Werther</em> (<em><span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Die Leiden des jungen Werthers</span></em>, 1774); short nonfiction texts such as <em>The Declaration of Independence</em> (1776) and <em>The Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen</em> (1789); extracts from Schiller’s <em>On the Aesthetic Education of Man</em> (<em><span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Über die ästhetische Erziehung des Menschen</span></em>, 1795), Shelley’s <em>Defence of Poetry</em> (1821), and Williams’s <em>Letters Written in France</em> (1790); and poems: <em>Ode on a Grecian Urn</em> (1819/20), <em>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</em> (1812–18), and <em>The Poems of Ossian</em> (1765). The course carefully considers Ossian’s critical reception, thus enabling
                  “students to perceive the tension between aestheticism and historicism in Romantic
                  discourse, as well as the political and cultural agendas served by various positions.”
                  Gidal emphasizes student-centered learning throughout his essay in a fashion that
                  underscores the potential for this material to help students see, witness, perceive,
                  and explore what the author calls the logic of culture.</p>
               <p>Like the chapter that precedes it, my essay, 
                  “European Romanticism and <em>Frankenstein</em>: A Comparative Literature Course for English Majors,”
                  reaches beyond the Anglophone canon. The purpose of this exploration, however, is
                  to deepen students’ appreciation for a single canonical British text, Mary Shelley’s
                  novel <em>Frankenstein</em> (1818), by reading the global texts that influenced it. 
                  “European Romanticism”
                  discusses the pedagogical purpose behind the course, designed for English majors,
                  many of whom plan to teach in a U.S. classroom someday. The course begins with the
                  French Revolution in order to orient students to one of the key historical benchmarks
                  of the Romantic timeline. However, some of the reading, notably Rousseau’s <em>Confessions</em> (the 1782 text that Shelley read), predates the French Revolution, in order to better
                  understand the function of sensibility and parenting in <em>Frankenstein</em>. Moreover, the first unit covers German and French Romantic poetry, some of which
                  was inspired by British and German Romanticism, and thus postdates 1830. The course
                  includes at least one of the texts that the creature in <em>Frankenstein</em> finds in the forest, <em>The Sufferings of Young Werther</em> (the modern translation of <em><span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Die Leiden des jungen Werthers</span></em> that comes closer to the original German than <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther</em>). Along with French and German poetry, this novel lays the foundation for students
                  to learn the concept of Romantic irony, which John Fetzer describes as a “bifocal
                  or double vision” (21). Engaging with Romantic irony helps students to better appreciate
                  the ambivalence and contradiction of the second unit, 
                  “Frankenstein and his Doppelgänger”
                  , in which students read <em>Frankenstein</em>, E. T. A. Hoffmann’s <em>The Sandman</em> (<em><span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Der Sandmann</span></em>, 1817), and a play about another ambitious scientist: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s
                  Heinrich Faust, the main protagonist in <em>Faust</em> (1808/1832). This ambitious curriculum frames Romanticism as an international endeavor
                  with interlocking themes and shared issues, such as human rights.</p>
               <p>Yet to what extent can the literature of Romanticism become global in scope and chronology,
                  and still remain a coherent field of study? 
                  “Taking a Step, Learning from Below, and Imagining Plantetarity in Romanticism: On
                  <em>Poems for the Millennium Volume 3</em>”
                  by Marques Redd poses this intriguing question, and provides answers by reflecting
                  on a teaching experiment that creates “a truly global Romanticism course” by surveying
                  poems originally written in Bengali, Chinese, Danish, English, Farsi, Finnish, French,
                  German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish.
                  The essay provides a refreshingly candid account of Redd’s experiences teaching a
                  reading-intensive course titled 
                  “Introduction to Global Romanticisms.”
                  The wide-ranging anthology of poetry edited by Jerome Rothenberg and Jeffrey C. Robinson
                  in 2009, the third volume of <em>Poems for the Millennium</em>, serves as the basis for this exploration of what a course about Romantic literature
                  can entail. Rothenberg and Robinson organize their volume into three parts: traditional
                  Romanticism, what the editors call post-Romantic poetry, and the modern era. Some
                  readers find this approach provocative; in his review of the book, Donald Mackenzie
                  labels it “anthology-as-manifesto” (107). According to 
                  “Taking a Step,”
                  the editors make a case for viewing Romanticism as “an artistic movement that leads
                  directly to the work of Ezra Pound.” Yet Redd also looks critically at the anthology,
                  applying some of Harold Bloom’s criteria for what makes canonical literature great
                  to the selection of course readings. This narrative offers readers ways to think about
                  how to turn teaching challenges into opportunities for learning.</p>
               <p>The last three essays in this volume share an interest in questions of empathy, communication,
                  and cultural history in Western and non-Western contexts. 
                  “Teaching Romantic India”
                  by Zak Sitter offers another discussion that shows the pedagogical value of foregrounding
                  global exchanges in the classroom. Sitter presents two approaches to incorporating
                  literature pertaining to India in the Romantic period: as a unit in a Romantic-era
                  survey of British literature and its global influence, and as an advanced seminar
                  on Anglophone Indian literature from the eighteenth century to the present titled
                  “English in India/India in English.” Both courses embrace Harish Trivedi’s view of
                  colonial discourse as a series of “transactions” (1). Both courses could be said to
                  apply Trivedi’s transactional pedagogy by pairing texts written by British and Indian
                  authors and asking students to articulate their similarities and differences. In the
                  Romantic survey, for example, students read the nationalist poetry of Robert Burns
                  alongside that of the Bengali poet, Henry Derozio (1809–31), author of 
                  “The Harp of India”
                  (1827–31), a poem that also invites comparisons to Shelley’s poem 
                  “Ozymandias”
                  (1818). In the upper-level seminar, Romantic-era texts include a novel, <em>Hartly House, Calcutta</em> (1789) by Phebe Gibbes (d. 1805), and a travel narrative, <em>The Travels of Dean Mahomet</em> (1794) by Dean Mahomet (c. 1759–1851), who also established London’s first Indian
                  curry house. These fascinating texts offer opportunities for students to compare genres,
                  on the one hand, and the authors’ cosmopolitan identities, on the other. The essay
                  concludes with suggested approaches to teaching Sydney Owenson’s novel <em>The Missionary: An Indian Tale</em> (1811).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The final two essays offer two different approaches to teaching Transatlantic Romanticism,
                     the pedagogy of which already has some presence online;

                     </div> each course emphasizes the ways in which Romantic-era literature creates a space for
                     readers to empathize with social justice issues across the world. <em>Translating Revolution into Spanish: British Romanticism and the Spanish-Speaking
                        World</em> shares what the author, Juan Sanchez, calls “transoceanic perspectives” on the pamphlet
                     wars of the 1790s, abolitionist literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
                     and fiction and nonfiction about the era’s independence movements. By teaching <em>The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano</em> (1789) alongside historical texts focused on independence movements in Jamaica, Haiti,
                     and South America, faculty can offer students an example of Homi K. Bhabha’s concept
                     of colonial mimicry. The essay also elaborates approaches to teaching two texts by
                     women writers—Hannah More’s 
                     “Slavery, A Poem”
                      (1788) and Leonora Sansay’s <em>Secret History; or, The Horrors of St. Domingo</em> (1808). Sanchez explicitly addresses Simpson’s argument about poetry and translation
                     (see above), and provides an original translation of Simon Bolívar’s 
                     “Jamaica Letter”
                      (
                     “Carta de Jamaica,”
                      1815). Engaging with this text alongside Edmund Burke’s <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em> (1790), Thomas Paine’s <em>The Rights of Man</em> (1791), and Mary Wollstonecraft’s <em>Vindications of the Rights of Woman</em> (1792) reminds students of the limits, possibilities, cultural nuances, and linguistic
                     diversity of the human rights discourse around 1800. Thus, Sanchez makes a compelling
                     case for bringing canonical British authors like Burke and Wollstonecraft into conversation
                     with the authors of independence movements in the Southern Hemisphere, especially
                     because doing so uncovers links not only between nations, but also links between the
                     past and a present that is still often characterized by cultural amnesia regarding
                     the history of slavery and enslaved peoples.</p>
               </div>
               <p><em>Teaching Global Romanticism</em> concludes with a multimodal teaching demonstration of a course on 
                  “Black Atlantic Romanticisms.”
                  The essay 
                  “#BlackLivesMatter: The Black Atlantic Matters”
                  by Joel Pace discusses American literature in the context of the transatlantic slave
                  trade, one of the major global networks of the eighteenth century. Pace shares ideas
                  for teaching Phillis Wheatley’s poem 
                  “On Being Brought from Africa to America”
                  (1773) in conjunction with the Black Lives Matter movement on Twitter, and draws on
                  W. E. B. Du Bois’s notion of double consciousness to introduce students to the “double-voicedness”
                  of Wheatley’s poem. This approach is applied in ways that emphasize the visual and
                  aural aspects of poetry. One method involves comparing the “mind maps” generated by
                  the online content company Credo Reference. The essay also provides ingenious techniques
                  for helping students appreciate Wheatley’s own “map to salvation”; students learn
                  scansion by exploring syncopation in musical traditions from the African diaspora.
                  Globalism, in “
                  “#BlackLivesMatter,”
                  indicates communication, lack of communication, and hidden communications about a
                  legacy of discrimination.</p>
               <p>In rethinking the scope of Romantic-era literature, the six essays that form this
                  volume on Teaching Global Romanticism invent new pedagogies. It is our hope that this
                  volume will help instructors imagine approaches to expanding the borders of Romanticism
                  beyond Britain and America, even when the texts themselves remain from those countries
                  or in the English language. Bringing Anglophone Romanticism into conversation with
                  writers from Continental Europe, Haiti, South America, or India deepens appreciation
                  for the 1820s and 1830s, decades that have sometimes been neglected in the field,
                  and revitalizes instructors’ appreciation for Romanticism and its unique perspective
                  on the human condition. Collectively these essays demonstrate that the best way to
                  teach Romanticism as a global body of literature is to expand the limits of our own
                  knowledge as scholars.</p>

               in his introductory essay to a special issue of <em>PMLA</em> on 
               “Globalizing Literary Studies”
               in 2001 (17). That same year, the <em>South Atlantic Quarterly</em> published a special issue on the same theme. The guest editors note that literary
               scholars are uniquely situated to comment on the “numerous discourses or ‘fictions’
               of globalization” (O’Brien and Szeman 604). Around this time, in 2005, Suzanne Berger
               offered a Political Science course at MIT on Globalization that is now available online
