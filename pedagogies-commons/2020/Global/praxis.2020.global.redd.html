            <p class="noCount">This essay distills the experience of teaching an upper-division English course entitled
               
               “An Introduction to Global Romanticisms.”
               This class focused on one text over the course of the semester – Jerome Rothenberg
               and Jeffrey Robinson’s experimental anthology <em>Poems for the Millennium Volume 3: The University of California Book of Romantic &amp;
                  Postromantic Poetry</em>. This collection attempts to construct a truly global Romantic tradition. In addition
               to the standard writers of the European Romantic canon, North and South American,
               Scandinavian, Eastern European, and Asian authors are included here as well. The broad
               scope of the anthology presents exciting opportunities and challenges. This essay
               assesses the potential of this volume to reform our teaching of and scholarship about
               Romanticism, and it briefly articulates a thesis about the “cosmic” dimension of literary
               texts, which can possibly provide an organizing rubric for engaging with the expansive
               richness of global Romanticism once conventional formalist and historicist methods
               are shown to be inadequate for managing its complexity.</p>

                  <p>In her book <em>Death of a Discipline</em>, comprised of the Wellek Library Lectures in Critical Theory, Gayatri Spivak implores
                     scholars to “take a step, learning to learn from below, toward imagining planetarity”
                     (100). These types of calls are common in the contemporary era of literary studies
                     as scholars discover how to navigate through a sea of new universalizing terms—planetarity,
                     planetary, globality, globalism, worldness, worlding, deep time, and transcultural.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For a few examples of scholars who develop these terms in powerful ways, see Wai Chee
                              Dimock, R. Radhakrishnan, Pheng Cheah, Amy Elias, Mary Emery, Djelal Kadir, Christian
                              Moraru, and Masao Miyoshi.</span></div>
                     </div> The mission is clear—we must create transformative curricula that refuse to mirror
                     and support the hierarchies and inequities of the social world and that engage with
                     the florescence of human creativity within the largest framework possible.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Yet when it comes to the field of Romanticism, this is a large task indeed. Teaching
                  even a traditional class on European Romanticism would be difficult enough, requiring
                  as it would knowledge of at least the French, German, and English traditions. Yet
                  what would happen if one attempted to construct a truly global Romanticism course,
                  adding to the syllabus North and South American elaborations of Romantic traditions,
                  Scandinavian and Eastern European Romantic episodes, or even a glimpse into various
                  Asian literary developments? While one might, with the best of intentions, want to
                  pursue the laudable goal of “planetarity,” implementing it threatens to push a solitary
                  course past a basic level of coherence and instructors past their areas of expertise
                  and ability. (My own particular areas of expertise are British Romanticism, African-American
                  literature, and nineteenth-century American literature.)</p>
               <p>With the publication in 2009 of volume three of the anthology series <em>Poems for the Millennium</em>, edited by Jerome Rothenberg and Jeffrey Robinson, a new tool has arrived to help
                  scholars and teachers think about how to teach Romanticism from a global perspective.
                  This anthology has a capacious sweep, and it covers a wide range of poetry and poetic
                  manifestos from Europe, Asia, and the Americas. It moves chronologically from “pre-Romantic”
                  figures such as Erasmus Darwin and Christopher Smart down to early modernists like
                  Guillaume Apollinaire. The global reinterpretation of Romanticism on display here
                  is quite stunning, and it is rare to see East Indian, Japanese, Hungarian, and Brazilian
                  poets placed on the same stage. (Every area of the world is represented here, except
                  Australia and Africa.) In the spring of 2011, I taught an upper-division English course
                  at Marquette University entitled 
                  “An Introduction to Global Romanticisms,”
                  which used this collection as the main text of the class. In this essay, I will distill
                  this experience, assess the potential of this volume to reform our teaching of and
                  scholarship about Romanticism, and end with a discussion of how to maintain a sense
                  of the full global possibilities of Romanticism.</p>
               <p>I will begin by describing the larger <em>Poems for the Millennium</em> project. Edited by Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris, the first two volumes are
                  explorations of twentieth-century poetry from the perspective of its many avant-gardes,
                  including movements such as Futurism, Dada, and Expressionism. The first volume moves
                  from the fin-de-siècle to negritude, exploring international modernism in the historical
                  period stretching from 1890 to 1945, while the second tackles poetry from the postwar
                  moment to the millennium. After the focus on Romanticism in the third volume, the
                  fourth volume, edited by Pierre Joris and Habib Tengour, provides a comprehensive
                  overview of the written and oral literatures of North Africa. The series culminates
                  with Rothenberg and John Bloomber-Rissman’s Volume Five, which is subtitled <em>Barbaric Vast &amp; Wild: A Gathering of Outside &amp; Subterranean Poetry from Origins to
                     Present</em>. These texts burst at the seams with an anti-traditionalist and anti-mainstream energy,
                  and they delight in the paradox of attempting to canonize works that aim to be anti-canonical,
                  to conserve the poetic gestures of the self-proclaimed radical. The volumes are boldly
                  attentive to poetic activity happening around the globe, including work from the Vienna
                  Group, the Fluxus artists, the Arabic-language Tammuzi poets, and the Chinese Misty
                  Poets. As such, they emphasize the vitality of global movements and propound an eclectic
                  cosmopolitanism.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Romanticism was important to the aims of the <em>Poems for the Millennium</em> project from the very beginning. The first volume, for example, opens with a section
                     entitled 
                     “Prologue to Forerunners,”
                      which includes selections from William Blake, Friedrich Hölderlin, and Walt Whitman.
                     In the introduction, the editors take a line of Blake’s—“poetry fetter’d, fetters
                     the human race”—as a battle cry and draw a genealogy that traces the emergence of
                     vibrant twentieth-century poetry “out of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment and…the
                     seed-bed of a radical romanticism” (1). In other words, Romanticism is viewed as a
                     central precursor for understanding the various avant-gardes and major poetic work
                     of contemporary times. Volume Three covers work written chronologically before the
                     two volumes that precede it and is therefore a homecoming of sorts, insofar as it
                     gives Rothenberg and Robinson a venue to explore nineteenth-century precursors to
                     poetry movements with which they feel immediate kinship.

                              presence behind the Poems for the Millennium project because he participated in constructing
                              four out of the five anthologies. There is not enough space in the context of this
                              essay to give a full appreciation of the contributions made by Pierre Joris, Jeffrey
                              Robinson, and Habib Tengour to this effort.</span></div>
                     </div>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>The third volume of the <em>Poems for the Millennium</em> opens with a “Preludium” of eighteenth-century figures who set the stage for the
                  romantic movement proper—such as the Marquis de Sade, Emanuel Swedenborg, Jean-Jacques
                  Rousseau, and Erasmus Darwin. According to the book’s introduction, Rothenberg and
                  Robinson were trying to emphasize figures who do not fit into stereotypical visions
                  of the period as one dominated by neo-classicism and melancholy lyric sensibility.
                  The text is then divided into sections called “galleries,” “clusters,” and “books.”
                  There are three galleries of poets chronologically organized with brief biographical
                  commentaries provided after each poet. The first—featuring poets for the most part
                  born before 1800—stretches from Goethe and Blake to Dionysios Solomos and Aleksander
                  Pushkin. The second contains figures from Victor Hugo and Elias Lonnrot to Swinburne
                  and Mallarmé. This gallery highlights Romanticism’s coming of age, in which it becomes
                  recognized as a coherent movement and begins to develop generational splits and differences,
                  while moving across the Atlantic and all throughout Europe. The final gallery extends
                  from Hopkins and Nietzsche to Yosano Akiko and Apollinaire. This section tracks the
                  movement into a post-Romanticism, featuring early Modernists, pre-Raphaelites, Transcendentalists,
                  <span class="foreign" xml:lang="sp" lang="sp">modernistas</span>, <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poètes maudits</span>, and Symbolists.</p>
               <p>These sections follow the standard anthology format, and in truth, most figures covered
                  here could be found in mainstream anthologies such as <em>The Norton Anthology of World Literature</em>. (There are only about ten people included in <em>Poems for the Millennium Vol. 3</em> [henceforth <em>PFM3</em>] that one could not find in there.) The major difference is that some of the continental
                  lyricists featured in the <em>Norton</em>—such as Anna Bunina, Rosalía de Castro, and Gustavo Bécquer—are removed in favor
                  of nationalist icons—like the Polish Cyprian Norwid and Cuban José Martí—and figures
                  writing in local dialects difficult to translate—such as the Italian Giuseppe Belli,
                  which gives <em>PFM3</em> a more overtly political and anti-conventional slant.</p>
               <p>Inside of each of these three galleries, <em>PFM3</em> includes a small cluster of poems organized around a theme. The first, 
                  “Some Asian Poets,”
                  tracks the work of a few groundbreaking poets writing from various Asian locations
                  in the nineteenth century—such as Kobayashi Issa (Japan), Ho Xuan Huong (Vietnam),
                  Bibi Hayati (Iran), and Wu Tsao (China). It is a quick survey of figures working on
                  a track parallel to the mainstream “Romantic” movement, but not really in dialogue
                  with it (except in the case of the Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore).</p>
               <p>The next unit, 
                  “Some Outsider Poets,”
                  seeks to take account of para-literary activity happening outside of the sanction
                  of the official literary purview, hegemonic literary institutions, or dominant means
                  of production/distribution. Featured in this section are figures such as Raifteiri
                  the Poet, a bard writing in Irish/Gaelic; James Reuben, author of an 1880 history
                  of the Nez Percé nation; and the politically radical poet Thomas Cooper.</p>
               <p>
                  “Some Orientalisms,”
                  the final cluster, corresponds quite nicely with the first unit, and it works to explode
                  the myth of a static “Asia” untouched by cultural development and locked into a stultifying
                  “tradition.” This section highlights creative work influenced by the opening of the
                  “East” due to the machinations of nineteenth-century colonialism, work that is often
                  at odds with colonial premises. Selections from works like Goethe’s <em>Arabian Ballad</em>, Lord Byron’s <em>The Giaour</em>, Victor Segalen’s <em>Stelae</em>, and Hugo’s <em>Les Orientales</em> are included.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p><em>PFM3</em> also includes two sections called “books” that are placed in between the three galleries.
                     Like the clusters, the 
                     “Book of Origins”
                      and the 
                     “Book of Extensions”
                      forego chronological organization and exhibit a collection of texts that transforms
                     conventional opinion about Romanticism’s relationship with the poetic past while demonstrating
                     the projection of an experimental poetic future. Jerome Rothenberg is most well-known
                     for his work with the concept of ethnopoetics, which describes the study of various
                     types of global folk poetry, oral literature, ceremonial and ritual speech, and mythic
                     tales and draws deeply from disciplines such as linguistics and anthropology.

                              (3)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See Jerome and Diane Rothenberg.</span></div>
                     </div> The 
                     “Book of Origins”
                      allows Rothenberg to emphasize this element of his poetic interests by taking into
                     account three categories of texts: texts rediscovered and/or translated by the modern
                     West in the nineteenth century (e.g., <em>Pistis Sophia</em>, <em>The Egyptian Book of the Dead</em>, <em>The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</em>); examples of folk poetry alive in the nineteenth century (e.g., Negro Spirituals);
                     and transcriptions of lengthy oral traditions prepared by nineteenth-century folklore
                     collectors and others (e.g., Daniel Brinton’s <em>Rig Veda Americanus</em>, the Navajo <em>Night Chant</em>).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Rothenberg is also a practicing poet, and in collections like <em>White Sun Black Sun</em> he plays with syntax, image, and form in ways that place him in line with what he
                  would call a “radical and experimental modernism,” or an “avant-garde” tradition (<em>PFM3</em> 3). In the 
                  “Book of Extensions,”
                  he and Robinson highlight a range of visual, performative, and conceptual work not
                  normally associated with Romanticism but rather as an important starting point for
                  twentieth-century poetic practice. Particularly important in this section are poetic
                  techniques such as the interaction of image and text in Blake’s <em>Laocoön</em>, the typographical play of Lewis Carroll’s <em>Concrete Poem: A Mouse</em>, and the use of phonetic syllables in August Strindberg’s sound poem <em>Holy Trinity Night: The Nightingale’s Song</em>.</p>
               <p>Finally, <em>PFM3</em> closes with a section of manifestos and statements of poetics, with excerpts taken
                  from texts ranging from Schlegel’s <em>Athenaeum Fragment 116</em> to Goethe’s <em>Toward a World Literature</em> and from Whitman’s <em>Preface to Leaves of Grass</em> to Victor Hugo’s <em>Preface to Cromwell</em>. The book closes with ambitious statements of guiding principles and projects that
                  still resonate in the present day.</p>
               <p>As one can see, the breadth of the project is astounding. Without a doubt, this text
                  helps one take quite a step toward imagining planetarity. Not only is there a geographically
                  expansive selection of writers presented here to make the case for Romanticism as
                  a worldwide movement, but there is also a recontextualization of familiar “major”
                  writers, an introduction of so-called “minor” writers, an attempt to highlight working-class,
                  women, and politically engaged writers, and selections organized by theme (in addition
                  to chronology) that force one to expand one’s definition of Romanticism. Yet in solving
                  one problem in constructing courses in global Romanticism—the problem of actually
                  assembling readings from all over the world—<em>PFM3</em> raises another issue just as major: is there an ideal framework that can be used
                  (by either the editors or teachers using this anthology) to coherently present and
                  order the riches of the material given?</p>
               <p>In full disclosure, this is the first literature course I had taught after a graduate-student
                  career of teaching composition courses, so I was fresh with the ambition (and possibly
                  naiveté) of wanting to tackle “the globe” in the classroom. The first thing I immediately
                  realized when organizing a course around this book is that I would not be able to
                  cover the entire text. It contains over 950 pages of poetry! Given the limitations
                  of the semester, one has to make selections and condense material into a palatable
                  size. There were only 14 full weeks of instruction, and in the three galleries alone,
                  over 50 poets are presented, with more to be found in the other “clusters” and “books.”
                  I decided to make the course reading intensive, forgoing long essay assignments for
                  short reading quizzes (in addition to a midterm and final) in order to expose the
                  students to as much of this material as possible. This is why the class was entitled
                  an 
                  “Introduction to Global Romanticisms,”
                  because I knew that even with providing glimpses of approximately fifty writers, I
                  could not do much more than scratch the surface. My syllabus is attached to this article
                  for those who would like to see on a day-to-day basis how the class was organized
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixC.html">Appendix C</a>).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The question of canonization—always a persistent one in English departments—becomes
                     even more acute in the struggle to construct a global syllabus. Based on what criteria
                     does one choose or exclude? Rothenberg and Robinson never fully address this question,
                     and they use the introduction to take up a polemic against the work of Harold Bloom,
                     the critic who is probably most synonymous with the question of canonization and to
                     whom Rothenberg has devoted a much longer and nastier critique (involving the comparison
                     of Bloom and Joseph Mengele) elsewhere.

                     </div> Rothenberg and Robinson say, “It is our desire in fact to embrace as much of the poetic
                     past as we can and to repudiate in so doing that ‘anxiety of influence’ (H. Bloom)
                     that would separate us (against our finer instincts) from our fellow poets” (8). However,
                     I can imagine that Bloom would respond, as he does in his book <em>The Western Canon</em>, “The overpopulation of books (and authors) brought about by the length and complexity
                     of the world’s recorded history is at the center of canonical dilemmas, now more than
                     ever” (491). When one strips away much of Bloom’s bombastic rhetoric, one can see
                     the value in his list of criteria for canonical stature—“mastery of figurative language,
                     originality, cognitive power, knowledge, exuberance of diction” (<em>Western Canon</em> 27–28)—which is elsewhere shortened to “aesthetic splendor, intellectual power, wisdom”
                     (<em>Wisdom</em> 5). Rothenberg and Robinson’s criterion for selection, on the other hand, revolves
                     around drawing a “fundamental, systematic continuity” between “the most vital strain
                     of nineteenth-century poetry and the Modernism and avant-gardism of the twentieth
                     century” (3), or in other words emphasizing connections between Romantic poetry and
                     the contemporary poetry movements most closely aligned to Rothenberg’s own mode of
                     poetry writing. This, as I will explain, has very peculiar consequences.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In determining what elements of the book to not include at all, I decided to remove
                  whole sections that, while interesting, were sure to cause pedagogical problems. Many
                  students came into the class not knowing the difference between even Walt Whitman
                  and Emily Dickinson, and if they in general do not have a good grasp on “insider poets,”
                  if non-conformist figures like these can be called that, what is the value of studying
                  
                  “Some Outsider Poets?”
                  Admittedly, the institution of “literature” is a precarious one, constructed by a
                  variety of ideological factors, but it is bizarre to ask students to challenge a category
                  with which they have very little familiarity.</p>
               <p>Along the same lines, the section 
                  “Some Orientalisms”
                  seemed to lend itself to a too easy deployment of a term for which students have not
                  been fully prepared. It is extremely difficult to study Orientalism in any real detail
                  when one is given a quick sweep of poets from different nations, language traditions,
                  and political vantage points responding to the historically shifting idea of “Asia”
                  and more specific locales such as China, Arabia, and India.</p>
               <p>Out of the three “clusters,” therefore, I only chose to keep 
                  “Some Asian Poetics.”
                  This was the section that made the most direct intervention into the question of how
                  to construct a global Romanticism by reaching out to an area of the world rarely considered
                  under this rubric. The Asian poetics section is probably one of the most unique characteristics
                  of the book, yet of course it presented its own round of pedagogical difficulties,
                  as it almost stretches the term “Romanticism” to its breaking point. Rothenberg and
                  Robinson define the “romantic” as a concept referring “less to a historical period
                  and more to a quality of poetic intention—a visionary, expansive, at times comic/ironic
                  quickening of impulse and mind that can lead beyond poetry to the larger world” (5–6).
                  It refers to a set of “vital energies” that “counter the perceived narrowness of vision
                  and language imposed upon persons by hegemonic and repressive societies then and now”
                  (7).</p>
               <p>This definition, broad though it is, was the only thread joining the poets in this
                  section together. The figures featured here, from Japan, Vietnam, China, India, and
                  Persia, produced work stretching from the late eighteenth century into the early twentieth.
                  They wrote in completely different forms—from haiku to lu-shih and tz’u—occupied different
                  social positions, and responded to varying cultural and historical situations. This
                  section, as it is probably not hard to imagine, frustrates standard pedagogical methodologies,
                  be they formalist or historicist. First of all, it is difficult to perform nuanced
                  formal readings of excerpts of texts, much less of texts translated from languages
                  drastically different from English. Furthermore, it is close to impossible to reproduce
                  the history of such as wide group of countries for the purpose of contextualizing
                  poets, as well as situating poems in the contexts of a poet’s wider career.</p>
               <p>This move to the global, therefore, forces one to compensate for the loss of these
                  familiar tools. It does so by provoking the realization that literary texts possess
                  a dimension of meaning that could be called the “cosmic,” which stretches beyond the
                  formal and sociohistorical, although the latter dimensions have garnered the greatest
                  focus in literary studies. The word “cosmic” often makes positivist and resolutely
                  secular intellectuals sneer, but one can define it simply as a trans-personal, trans-social
                  ordering structure that cannot be reduced to personal fantasy or projection on one
                  hand, or the work of political ideology on the other. It is the realm that exists,
                  in Bibi Hayati’s words, “before there was a hint of civilization,” and it is invoked
                  in Rabindranath Tagore’s phrase “heaven of freedom” (288, 291). Exploring the cosmic
                  dimension of literary texts—outside the realm of formal conventions, individual psyches,
                  and historical movements—helped add substance to Rothenberg and Robinson’s definition
                  of the “romantic” as a “visionary, expansive quickening of impulse and mind that leads
                  beyond poetry to the larger world,” where the larger world comes to mean even the
                  universe beyond the earth itself.</p>
               <p>Centralizing “the cosmic” as a guiding hermeneutic made it easy to incorporate the
                  
                  “Book of Origins”
                  into the syllabus, as many of the texts—such as <em>The Night Chant</em> and <em>The Yarjurveda</em>—are overtly ritualistic in nature and aim to access levels of reality transcending
                  the mundane. Furthermore, my own research focuses on the influence of ancient Egypt
                  and various hermetic traditions on the Romantic period, so this section provided an
                  opportunity to walk students through texts with which I was more familiar, such as
                  <em>The Egyptian Book of the Dead</em> and the <em>Pistis Sophia</em>. However, this section also brought up questions about Rothenberg and Robinson’s
                  construction of a Romantic tradition. For example, Wallis Budge did not translate
                  the <em>Book of the Dead</em> until 1895, the very end of the nineteenth century. In what respect, then, can Rothenberg
                  and Robinson position this work as a Romantic achievement or source text, other than
                  the fact that it falls between a pre-given structure of dates? It did not start to
                  wield a large influence until the work of early modernists like Joyce, Pound, and
                  later figures such as Lawrence Durrell. Again, it seems that Rothenberg and Robinson
                  are stretching the term Romanticism to a point of incoherence, which is not helped
                  by the fact none of the texts in this section are accompanied by any commentary which
                  would situate them in any respect, leaving the instructor to puzzle alone over how
                  to create coherent conversations about Scottish ballads, Aztec hymns, Welsh folktales,
                  and Sanskrit translations. Marching through this plethora of texts brought so much
                  battle fatigue that by the end of the semester, I decided to remove the 
                  “Book of Extensions”
                  section from the syllabus altogether and drastically condense the 
                  “Manifestos and Poetics”
                  in order to have a series of review sessions.</p>
               <p>The bulk of the class was spent reading through the galleries filled with poets from
                  Goethe to Apollinaire. In trying to winnow these down to a manageable size (if reading
                  over fifty poets in a semester can be called manageable), I tried to keep Bloom’s
                  criteria in mind—“aesthetic splendor, intellectual power, wisdom”—but I did not have
                  time to finish reading the entire anthology before teaching with it, which will likely
                  be the fate of most teachers of global literature. Therefore, the goal became to include
                  writers from as many different countries as possible. Although I had never read or
                  taught Sandor Petofi before, he ended up on the syllabus as the representative of
                  Hungary. Rubén Darío (Nicaragua) and Sigbjørn Obstfelder (Norway) were other national
                  representatives. Often, I had to delete other authors for the same reason. Because
                  I wanted to focus on the French Symbolist line of Baudelaire, Mallarmé, and Rimbaud,
                  I felt comfortable removing Jules Laforgue and Joseph Joubert. Great Britain was very
                  well represented in this anthology, so I chose to cut figures like John Clare, Thomas
                  de Quincey, and Dorothy Wordsworth. As much as I wanted to take out Lord Byron, as
                  I am more interested in vatic than satiric strains of Romanticism, it did not make
                  sense to do so, especially given his international influence. Removing him would have
                  made discussions of others such as Aleksandr Pushkin and Adam Mickiewicz quite difficult.</p>
               <p>Yet as an organizing principle, trying to cover a spread of nations was certainly
                  random, as the anthology frustrates these and many other types of ordering moves.
                  The writers are all presented in chronological order, so it is difficult for students
                  to get a sense of the development of national traditions in relationship to the global.
                  Even now the class is over, I am sure that the majority of the students do not remember
                  that Leopardi is Italian, Kierkegaard is Danish, and so on. If Rothenberg and Robinson
                  had provided a simple chart of everyone’s nationality, or even a timeline of the publishing
                  of major works, that would have helped tremendously.</p>
               <p>While being attentive to the issue of representing voices from all over the world,
                  I also wanted to be sensitive to including the voices of women. Several canonical
                  Western women were included in this survey: de Staël, Dickinson, Browning, Rossetti,
                  Stein, Shelley, and Lady Guest. Mary Robinson, Dorothy Wordsworth, and Adah Menken
                  were the only women of European descent highlighted in the anthology who were not
                  in the syllabus. All of the Asian women excerpted in <em>PFM3</em> were added to the syllabus: Yosano Akiko, Bibi Hayati, Wu Tsao, and Ho Xuan Huong.</p>
               <p>At the risk of sounding repetitive, Rothenberg and Robinson’s definition of Romanticism
                  becomes quite hazy as the galleries unfold. For example, the poet Arno Holz is included,
                  although he is typically known as the first important German theorist of naturalism.
                  The major innovation of his major poem <em>Phantasus</em> is that all of the lines are typographically centered. Rothenberg and Robinson turn
                  to Friedrich Kittler’s <em>Discourse Networks</em>, 1800/1900 for commentary: “What the verses have in view, then, are not readers and
                  their understanding, but eyes and their psychophysics, in other words…Holz’s <em>Phantasus</em>, rather than addressing fantasy as the surrogate of all senses in the finest romantic
                  manner, reckons with unconscious optokinetics” (835). If Holz moves away from the
                  “finest romantic manner,” in what respect can he be seen as an example of Romanticism?
                  It does not help that Rothenberg and Robinson add in the introduction that “we wish
                  to blur the distinctions of Romantic and Postromantic as much as to insist on them”
                  (7). Moves like this seem to make Romanticism signify everything written in the extended
                  nineteenth century, in contradiction to the earlier definition provided of the romantic
                  as a quality of poetic intention.</p>
               <p>Taking into account all these considerations and creating a syllabus after making
                  a large number of cuts, I still ended up with about four new writers on the syllabus
                  for each class meeting. (Classes were held every Tuesday and Thursday for an hour
                  and 15 minutes). The problem with this kind of organization is obvious. For one, you
                  completely overwhelm students who do not have any sense at all of literary history.
                  The most ridiculous effort was trying to use one class period to speak about the Frenchmen
                  Victor Hugo and Gérard de Nerval, the Brownings (Robert and Elizabeth), and Thomas
                  L. Beddoes. Admittedly, some weeks were just a complete blur.</p>
               <p>Attempting to survey the globe is demanding—for students and instructors. I cannot
                  say that I am an expert in Norwegian poetry, Finnish creation myth, and haiku, yet
                  I found myself in the strange position of having to mediate these texts for students
                  with no help. The major struggle of teaching a global literature class is how to balance
                  coverage with depth, and one has to be prepared to spend hours figuring out how to
                  achieve that balance. One of the major disadvantages of <em>PFM3</em> is that there is no teaching apparatus analogous to what might be found in other
                  anthologies such as the Norton or Broadview—no annotations of unclear terms, no bibliographies,
                  no helpful charts or maps, no hints about classroom strategies or topics for discussion
                  and writing, etc. Furthermore, the presentation of material is often distressing.
                  In a section of excerpts from Blake’s <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>, for example, there is no editorial note to tell the reader which poems are of “innocence”
                  and which are of “experience,” and they are mixed together. In the Rimbaud section,
                  poems from <em>A Season in Hell</em> and <em>Illuminations</em> were jumbled without hints for new readers.</p>
               <p>I attempted to turn this lack of an editorial apparatus into an opportunity for teaching.
                  For written work, I assigned biweekly assignments, where the students were responsible
                  for writing lists of discussion questions for each writer covered and creating an
                  annotated list of unfamiliar allusions and vocabulary. And as I removed readings from
                  the syllabus toward the end of the semester to help us all maintain our sanity, I
                  assigned presentations requiring students to organize a discussion of three writers
                  around a given theme.</p>
               <p>Yet in addition to this lack of an editorial apparatus, the major difficulty of using
                  this text for teaching is its very specific frame and agenda for interpreting global
                  Romanticism. Rothenberg and Robinson’s goal here is to redefine Romanticism so that
                  it becomes a precursor to a very partisan definition of “experimental modernism,”
                  and to turn to Bloomian terminology again, this is a very creative misreading. Rothenberg
                  and Robinson privilege texts that rely heavily on stylistic fragmentation, collage/montage
                  techniques, engagement with nonsense, obscure uses of grammar and syntax, the deprivileging
                  of the lyric self, opaque textures, and discontinuous typography. In effect, Romanticism
                  is portrayed as an artistic movement that leads directly to the work of Ezra Pound.</p>
               <p>This is not an exaggeration, and one can turn to any number of the commentaries to
                  see Pound as the spectral influence behind this collection, which is especially odd
                  given Pound’s many broadsides against the movement. One can return to Rothenberg and
                  Robinson’s commentary on Arno Holz for a first example: “Increasingly experimental
                  in his later writings (<em>Phantasus</em> would expand to 60,000 lines by 1925 &amp; show a Pound-like ambition to write a ‘<em>Weltgedicht: a Nuova-Divinia</em> after Dante or <em>Über-Odysee</em> after Homer’), he reemerges today as a still vital linking figure across the nineteenth-
                  &amp; twentieth-century divide” (835). And instead of focusing on the highly readable
                  and teachable odes and elegies of a figure like Friedrich Hölderlin, Rothenberg and
                  Robinson choose to emphasize severely fragmented works like the late palimpsestic
                  <em>Columbus</em>, from which I confess I could not draw any meaning, especially given that the reader
                  is only presented an excerpt from an already incomplete piece. Rothenberg and Robinson
                  quote the translator Richard Sieburth: “The French phrases [in <em>Columbus</em>] that punctuate the text in Poundian fashion may be snippets overheard in the ports
                  of Bordeaux during Hölderlin’s residence in that city” (159). As a final (but not
                  the last) example, the Brazilian poet Sousandrade’s <em>O Guesa Errante</em>, which follows a legendary figure of the Colombian Muisca Indians into the inferno
                  of nineteenth-century Wall Street, is said to be “a forerunner of EP’s Cantos and
                  of many other modern poets” (663).</p>
               <p>Since Rothenberg and Robinson work with the dictum that “experiments in form often
                  equate to, or imply the possibility of, social and spiritual/mental transformations”
                  (17), centralizing Pound in this way allows Rothenberg and Robinson to wage a mimic
                  war between those “radicals” that experiment with form and the “conservatives” who
                  work in traditional boundaries, between innovators who favor the “playful, proliferating”
                  Fancy and reactionaries who turn toward the “synthetic, disinterested” Imagination
                  (8). It is never made clear how formal radicalism is related to political radicalism,
                  and this polemic is not only distracting, but it muddles the presentation of the material,
                  as I will show.</p>
               <p>It is not a surprise that the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz was chosen for this anthology.
                  He almost fits a profile—he was directly involved in all sorts of political intrigues
                  and battles for independence and also the creator of a nationalist epic (<em>Pan Tadeusz</em>). An excerpt of that text from Donald Davie’s “transcreation” is provided in <em>PFM3</em>: </p>

               <p> From Kress’ translation, one can more clearly see that the poem is an epic in the
                  mode of Byron and Pushkin, not a work of (proto)modernist fragmentation. If one is
                  trying to give a quick overview of Mickiewicz in a survey of global literature, the
                  latter translation is demonstrably better for giving a flavor of his style, tone,
                  and rhetorical stance. If Davie’s translation is “radical,” then “radicalism” is a
                  project verging on willful incoherence, one that does a great disservice in the classroom.
                  How rewritings of this sort hasten spiritual or social transformation is quite beyond
                  me, unless the transformation is alienating a potential audience for poetry even more.
                  These types of problematic translations are found throughout the book, with the next
                  most egregious example being Robin Blaser’s translations of Gérard de Nerval.</p>
               <p>Rothenberg and Robinson’s fetishization of “radicalism” is also tied to an ideology
                  of collectivism that runs throughout this anthology and others that Rothenberg has
                  produced. In the introduction to his <em>America a Prophecy: A New Reading of American Poetry from Pre-Columbian Times to the
                     Present</em>, Rothenberg says: “our general intention has been to show modes of poetry rather
                  than individual poets, and any reader who takes what follows as an attempt to draw
                  up definitive lists of poets or to chart chronologies of careers will have missed
                  one of the fundamental premises of this anthology” (xxxvi). (Even in this earlier
                  project, the Romantic influence was strong. The title comes from a William Blake poem.)
                  Following this same goal in <em>Poems for the Millennium Volume Three</em>, Rothenberg attempts to decenter the individual poet to think about Romanticism not
                  only as an international, but as a collective movement. There are many sophisticated
                  philosophical positions supporting this stance which I cannot explore here in depth,
                  and I do recognize the powerful tradition of critiques launched against orthodox constructions
                  of the modern bourgeois individual. However, I want to point to the difficulty of
                  teaching “modes of poetry” rather than “individual poets.” Granted, this might simply
                  be a sign of my lack of seasoned teaching, but I found that I could not devise methods
                  of teaching, creating assignments on, and crafting assessments based on students’
                  grasp of modes of poetry, rather than modes of poetry as concretized by specific figures
                  in specific texts. In reality, what this decentering of the individual seemed to amount
                  to was having a poet’s work spread throughout different sections. Poems by William
                  Blake, for example, were included in the 
                  “Preludium,”
                  
                  “First Gallery,”
                  
                  “Book of Origins,”
                  
                  “Book of Extensions,”
                  
                  “Some Orientalisms,”
                  and 
                  “Manifestos &amp; Poetics.”
                  It seems that a more radical and consistent method of imagining Romanticism as a collective
                  project, one that allows the voice of Poetry itself to speak, would have been to produce
                  an anthology with no names of poets (or editors) listed anywhere.</p>
               <p>All in all, however, this course was a grand “experiment” (to use a favorite Rothenberg
                  and Robinson term) in learning how to imagine planetarity and teach global Romanticism.
                  The class was exciting, but not as successful as I might have hoped. The students
                  were not always kind in their reaction to this demanding and eclectic course. The
                  majority opinion was articulated in the pithy comment: “Intense amount of reading
                  for this class for painfully uninteresting material. Tests are hard.” Thankfully,
                  in the midst of negative feedback, there were a few counter-voices, such as the following:
                  “Doctor Redd’s class was a very challenging, but rewarding one. The material is difficult,
                  but he presents it with an interesting spin. After working a lot, I walk away with
                  an appreciation of the subject matter.”</p>
               <p>I surmise that elements of this course were deemed “intense,” “painfully uninteresting,”
                  “challenging,” and “difficult” for many reasons. Trying to absorb the work of approximately
                  fifty authors writing in vastly different languages, styles, and forms over the course
                  of a semester would be a challenge even for a seasoned literary scholar, so it was
                  unfair to expect that of undergraduates without more of a structure to mediate this
                  material for them. Placing all of these writers on the syllabus seemed (before actually
                  teaching the course) to be an effective way to meet the challenge of presenting the
                  full global panoply of Romantic writing, but the sheer number of writers covered meant
                  that the course discussion could not dive deeply into any particular figure or literary
                  issue. The surface treatment of so many figures possibly hindered the students from
                  developing rich emotional connections to the material, hence their rejection of it
                  as “uninteresting.” This course went to an extreme limit in its ambition to represent
                  the global, and future courses on global Romanticism will have to continue to think
                  about how to balance broad and deep coverage.</p>
               <p>In the last week of teaching this course, I came across David Damrosch’s book <em>What Is World Literature?</em> I was surprised to see him articulate something of my experience with this class
                  and point toward a new direction: <span class="quote">‘Anthologies have been growing larger and larger, as teachers and publishers have
                     sought to encompass our ever-expanding canon. When we are presenting a single national
                     tradition, there is still a logic to giving some sense of most of the currently acknowledged
                     major authors, particularly as time and space generally allow the inclusion of a range
                     of less-known figures as well. The task becomes impossible with any truly global vision
                     of world literature, and other approaches are plainly needed. At minimum, it takes
                     three points to define a plane surface, and perhaps three works, interestingly juxtaposed
                     and studied with care, can define a literary field. (10) ’</span> Damrosch here moves to the opposite extreme from my course. Instead of broadening
                  the syllabus, he calls for a radical stripping down of it. The ideal global romanticism
                  course probably lies between the minimalist approach for which Damrosch advocates
                  and the maximalist approach I pursued. However, working with Damrosch’s “definition
                  of world literature: not a set canon of texts but a mode of reading, a detached engagement
                  with a world beyond our own” (297) will provide a key for building the theoretical
                  infrastructure needed to make teaching global Romanticism a project more coherent
                  than the juxtaposition of wide-ranging texts. This mode of reading might usefully
                  engage with the idea hastily sketched above about a “cosmic” dimension of the literary
                  text—one that interacts with its formal and sociohistorical dimensions while transcending
                  and not being reducible to them. It is this cosmic dimension that could potentially
                  help us understand nonlocal and nonlinear influences that link seemingly unrelated
                  writers and texts; discover new spiritual, political, and ethical imperatives in our
                  reading of world literature; and proclaim our deep connectedness as a human species,
                  despite boundaries that often assert cultural incommensurability.</p>
               <p>In the seven years since I taught this course in 2011, I have transitioned from a
                  faculty role to an administrative one. I no longer teach, so I write this article
                  to memorialize the thinking and effort that went into constructing this course, an
                  experiment that I hope other scholars of global Romanticism will take up after me.
                  I offer this course’s chaos and idiosyncrasies, yet also its potential, daring, and
                  boundary breaking.</p>
