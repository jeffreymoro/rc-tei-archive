                    Spanish-Speaking World</title> offers ways of teaching British Romanticism through the
                    lens of human rights. The proposed course covers the pamphlet wars of the 1790s
                    in Edmund Burke’s <title level="m">Reflections on the Revolution in France</title>, Thomas Paine’s <title level="m">The

                    Students also consider abolitionist literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth

                    understanding of the era’s independence movements by introducing historical

                    <p>One of the most important developments in the study of British literature of
                        the long eighteenth century in the past two decades has been the renewed
                        focus on what Keith Hanley and Greg Kucich call the “global formations” of
                        British literary culture (73). The proliferation of studies in global
                        feminisms, cosmopolitan identities, travel writing, translation, and other
                        transnational encounters has created new critical perspectives for
                        reassessing early-nineteenth-century British literature as explicitly
                        international and global in its concerns rather than isolated and
                            insular.<note place="foot" resp="author">Since the 1997 special edition
                            of <title level="j">European Romantic Review</title> on <title level="a"
                                >British Romanticism: Global Crossings</title> (Fay), romantic-era
                            studies have experienced an explosion of critical work on the global
                            dimensions of romantic literature. For foundational work on British
                            romantic imperialism, see Makdisi, Fulford and Kitson, and Leask. For
                            work on romantic travel writing, global feminisms, and cosmopolitanisms,
                            see Mellor, Simpson, Wohlgemut, and Bohls and Duncan. In recent years,
                            investigations into the global contexts of British romanticism has moved
                            steadily away from the postcolonial frameworks of earlier studies toward
                            a broader understanding of romantic literature’s relationship to the
                            history of globalization. As Evan Gottlieb argues, “romantic globalism,”
                            Gottlieb’s term for the globalizing tendencies of romantic-era
                            literature, “took shape as an alternative to, rather than merely an
                            elaboration or anticipation of, imperialism” (10). For more on this
                            particular critical trend, see Annesley, Cooppan, Gupta, and Jay.</note>
                        Similarly, in early American studies, the work of Gretchen Murphy, Felipe
                        Fernandez-Armesto, James Dunkerly, and Anna Brickhouse, among others, has
                        been especially crucial to exploring the global dimensions of American
                        literature by resituating its study within a broader Hemispheric and
                        Pan-American perspective.<note place="foot" resp="author">For more on the
                            transnational trend in American literary scholarship, see Manning and
                            Taylor.</note> Both disciplines are thus increasingly guided by the
                        principles that national contexts alone can no longer provide the
                        explanatory framework for literary analysis they once did and that new
                        critical paradigms are needed if we are to more adequately investigate what
                        Paul Gilroy calls the “system of cultural exchanges” taking place across the
                        globe during the early nineteenth century (14).</p>
                    <p>Yet despite the new critical imperative to explore global dimensions of
                        romantic literature, the Spanish speaking world remains one of the most
                        understudied cultural geographies of the period.<note place="foot"
                            resp="author">Notable exceptions include Diego Saglia’s <title level="m"
                                >Poetic Castles in Spain: British Romanticism and Figurations of
                                Iberia</title> (2001), Joselyn Almeida’s <title level="m"

                        Much of this neglect no doubt has much to do with the vast critical terrain
                        only recently opened to us by the study of romantic globalism. But to some
                        degree, we must also be aware of an English disciplinary resistance to all
                        things Spanish and, in Joselyn Almeida’s view, a dangerous assumption
                        underlying recent transatlantic critical practices, namely that the ideas,
                        texts, and political thought circulating within the Atlantic world occur
                        primarily between Britain and the US and are, as a consequence, conducted
                        primarily in English. The consequences of such critical practices&#8212;of,
                        among other things, continuing to think of the Americas in terms of North
                        America alone&#8212;is that we not only risk marginalizing Spanish speakers
                        as minor spectators on the world stage, but also risk confining
                        transatlantic studies, as Almeida has written, within safe linguistic and
                        disciplinary boundaries that ultimately work to reinscribe the disciplinary
                        structures that transatlantic studies has worked so hard to break
                            through.<note place="foot" resp="author">See the introduction to
                            Almeida.</note></p>
                    <p>Building on David Simpson’s argument for translation as a critical paradigm
                        within which romantic literature is encountered as an “estranged medium,”
                        this essay answers the call for greater attention to the Hispanic dimensions
                        of transatlantic studies by demonstrating some of the ways in which students
                        can explore the meaning of traditional romantic concepts about the
                        imagination, nature, and the rights of man, among others, from a ‘Spanish’
                        perspective (141). The objective of such reading practices is to open up the
                        interpretive possibilities for understanding romantic literary texts as not
                        only engaged with but also profoundly shaped by the ideas, cultures, and
                        peoples of Spain and Spanish America. In order to get from here to there, I
                        will briefly sketch in this essay the outlines of a course I teach on
                        transatlantic romanticism that I have designed to introduce the complex
                        issues related to the interconnectedness of Atlantic-rim cultures. Focusing
                        on the ways in which cultures, ideologies, and political identities are
                        reworked and reinscribed by the transatlantic movement of peoples, ideas,
                        and cultural artifacts, the course seeks to expand accepted notions of
                        romanticism (typically understood within exclusively British and US American
                        contexts) to include transoceanic perspectives that rethink romantic
                        literature as a global phenomenon. Given the limited space here, I will only
                        consider the shifting forms and languages of revolution as they make their
                        way from Britain to the Americas via the transatlantic slave trade. In order
                        to bring the analysis into sharper focus, I shift the discussion in the
                        final section of the essay from a consideration of historical to textual
                        translation, presenting my own English translation of a key passage from
                        Simon Bolívar’s <title level="a">Carta de Jamaica</title> as a case study
                        that highlights the limits and possibilities of linguistic interpretation as
                        a pedagogical tool that challenges students to rethink the meaning of
                        revolution within a Spanish American context.</p>
                    <p>One of the most important debates for exploring the historical context of
                        romantic-era literature remains the pamphlet wars of the 1790s in which
                        Edmund Burke’s <title level="m">Reflections on the Revolution in
                            France</title> and Thomas Paine’s <title level="m">The Rights of
                            Man</title> form the twin pillars of revolutionary and
                        counter-revolutionary thought of the period. Students typically have an
                        easier time with Paine initially, readily identifying with the language of
                        reason and natural rights, and often share Paine’s convictions about
                        liberty, equality, and inalienable rights. When properly understood as a
                        response to Burke’s arguments about the role of prejudice and prescription
                        in maintaining order in society, itself a response to Richard Price’s <title
                            level="m">A Discourse on the Love of our Country</title>, students tend
                        to become even more convinced of the validity of Paine’s argument about “the
                        vanity and presumption of governing beyond the grave,” which Paine views as
                        “the most ridiculous and insolent of all tyrannies” (74). Teaching the
                        revolutionary debates thus more often than not involves mounting a vigorous
                        defense of Burke. I usually begin by pointing out that in the U.S., appeals
                        to a constitution written over two hundred years ago precisely define what
                        it means to govern beyond the grave. Students who defend constitutional
                        authority and legal precedence now find it difficult to support Paine’s
                        essentially anarchist argument that “the more perfect civilization is, the
                        less occasion has it for government,” a statement that assumes the
                        perfectibility of man and the power of human reason to bring it about (193).
                        After introducing a more nuanced discussion of political theory and the
                        revolutionary politics of the romantic period, I reintroduce Burke’s and
                        Paine’s arguments with a few select passages that yield new insights into
                        the nature of the debate in a way that allows students to reflect on the
                        Burkean and Paineite influences on their own political perspectives.</p>
                    <p>Discussion of the contribution of women to the revolutionary debate helps
                        prepare students for thinking about the complex ways in which the “regime of
                        truth,” as Michel Foucault calls it, is challenged and transformed by groups
                        and individuals excluded from the governing discourse (131). Mary
                        Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Vindications of the Rights of
                            Woman</title>, for example, makes the obvious point that the rights of
                        man did not necessarily also translate as the rights of woman. In addition
                        to outlining Wollstonecraft’s proto-feminist arguments about egalitarian
                        marriage, rational love, and other issues of gender inequality, I highlight
                        the rhetorical strategies through which she enacts her “imitation of manly
                        virtues” that become in and of themselves a form of political engagement
                            (110).<note place="foot" resp="author">Regarding the style of <title
                                level="m">Vindication</title>, Wollstonecraft writes, “Animated by
                            this important object, I shall disdain to cull my phrases or polish my
                            style. I aim at being useful, and sincerity will render me unaffected;
                            for wishing rather to persuade by the force of my arguments than dazzle
                            by the elegance of my language, I shall not waste my time in rounding
                            periods, or in fabricating the turgid bombast of artificial feelings”
                            (112).</note> For in stripping her prose intentionally of the “soft
                        phrases” and “delicacy of sentiment” central to the rhetorical flourishes of
                        Burke’s political reflections on the revolution, Wollstonecraft creates a
                        metacommentary that exposes the reliance of Burke on what he himself defined
                        as the feminine aesthetic of the beautiful in order to, as Tom Furniss
                        argues, “remount a critique of the <emph>ancien régime</emph> . . . and turn
                        its aesthetic theory against the politics of <title level="m"
                            >Reflections</title>” (Wollstonecraft 111; Furniss 184). When <title
                            level="m">Vindications</title> compares the condition of women to
                        slavery, Wollstonecraft further complicates the Revolution debate by
                        introducing an unwelcome discourse into the discussion of what it means for
                        all men to be equal. Without explicitly invoking the abolitionist movement
                        of which women were key players, Wollstonecraft thus alters the hermeneutic
                        context from which to interpret the principles of the French Revolution,
                        illustrating for students how seemingly straightforward arguments become
                        easily strained when ideas are placed in a context for which they were never
                        intended.</p>
                    <p>Having established the broad parameters of an essentially British perspective
                        on political revolution, our discussion naturally moves on to consider
                        romantic literature and the slave trade, a topic recently illuminated by the
                        work of Deirdre Coleman, Debbie Lee, and Paul Youngquist.<note place="foot"
                            resp="author">See, for example, Coleman, Lee, and Youngquist and
                            Botkin.</note> Before discussing the diverse, overlapping, and sometimes
                        contradictory arguments for and against slavery during the romantic period,
                        I remind students of our shared conviction of the inhumanity of slavery in
                        order to focus our discussion more critically on how literature, as Edward
                        Said writes in <title level="m">Culture and Imperialism</title>, “allowed
                        decent men and women to accept the notion that distant territories and their
                        native peoples should be subjugated” (6). Again encouraging students to look
                        beyond the surface of argumentation, I point out that poems about the slave
                        trade often find themselves troubled by an awareness of the tension between
                        their ideals of universal emancipation and the imperial imperative of the
                        civilizing mission. Of the many abolitionist poems that could be cited,
                        Hannah More’s <title level="a">Slavery, A Poem</title> is one of the best in
                        illustrating the structural entanglements of much abolitionist writing.
                        Though she argues for the dignity of slaves as human beings, More, like many
                        of her contemporaries, cannot escape her racist assumptions or imperialist
                        attitudes. Africans, she argues, “have heads to think, and hearts to feel,”
                        but their souls act with “erring zeal” (More 67; 68). Like the British
                        radicals she curiously invokes at the beginning of the poem, Africans must
                        consequently be contained, their “wild vigour of a savage root” civilized by
                        Christianity (More 74). More difficult for students to discern, however, is
                        More’s anxiety about the implicit critique of empire that unintentionally
                        emerges as a result of her abolitionist arguments. Attempting to clarify her
                        intentions, the poet at one point asks, <quote>
                            <lg type="stanza">
                                <l>Does thirst of empire, does desire of fame,</l>
                                <l>(For these are specious crimes,) our rage inflame?</l>
                                <l>No: sordid lust of gold their [slaves] fate controls,</l>
                                <l>The basest appetite of basest souls. (More 125–28)</l>
                            </lg>
                        </quote> More’s resistance to the idea that the “thirst for empire” is
                        inherently wrong and her attribution of the evil of slavery instead to
                        “sordid lust” allows her to champion the cause of emancipation without
                        upsetting the logic of empire. The parenthetical aside, however, at once
                        deflecting attention from the poem and yet integral to its meter, delays the
                        formulation of the poem’s central question, creating an uneasy tension
                        between the poet’s nervous interrogation and resolute reply. The emphatic
                        “no,” made more determined by the syntactical deductive colon separating the
                        monosyllabic answer from the more involved explanation that follows, not
                        only abruptly interrupts the iambic pentameter of the poem, but in doing so
                        calls attention unintentionally to the so-called “specious crimes” the poet
                        works very hard to deny. This passage in particular can thus help students
                        explore how language and form can express unspoken anxieties, or, in Fredric
                        Jameson’s terms, reveal the “political unconscious” (9).</p>
                    <p>No discussion of the cultural impact of the slave trade on romanticism is
                        complete without a reading of any number of the many slave narratives of the
                        period of which Helen Thomas’s <title level="m">Romanticism and Slave
                            Narratives: Transatlantic Testimonies</title> (2000) provides an
                        excellent selection. I continue, however, to remain partial to <title
                            level="m">The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah
                            Equiano</title> because of the way in which it allows students to
                        discuss the complex process of what Homi Bhabha calls the “ambivalence of
                        mimicry” occurring at the intersection of the various discourses brought
                        together in what Angelo Contanzo describes as “a new genre of writing that
                        became known as the slave narrative” (129; 10). From its frontispiece and
                        opening address to the British Parliament to its narrative of spiritual
                        conversion and naval adventure stories, <title level="m">The Interesting
                            Narrative</title> establishes Equiano as a civilized, self-made man
                        whose natural inclinations toward masculine British values grant him the
                        authority to speak on the national stage from which he would normally be
                        excluded. Yet, Equiano’s anecdotal accounts as a free man of his persistent
                        mistreatment at the hands of British slave owners remind readers that he
                        will never be more than “almost an Englishman,” one who is free but not
                        free, “almost the same, <emph>but not quite</emph>” (Equiano 92; Bhabha
                        123). For some students, Equiano’s attempt to establish an authentic African
                        voice is compromised by a “stronger desire to resemble” his English masters,
                        resulting in an ambivalence over his own identity that he registers in the
                        title of his narrative (Equiano 93). The question of Equiano’s identity is
                        further complicated by notable passages revealing his participation in the
                        slave trade, his support of the British colonization of Africa, and the
                        still controversial arguments discounting his African birth. In order to
                        generate further discussion, however, I typically introduce a
                        counterargument that suggests that such ambivalence is intentional. By
                        engaging in a form of “self-invention,” as Vincent Carretta describes it,
                        Equiano not only displays what W. E. B. Du Bois calls double consciousness,
                        but also in the process returns the mobility of his identity back within his
                        control, which he formally expresses in the title as a choice he allows
                        readers to make in constructing their own meaning of his narrative in a way
                        that spotlights the artificiality of such constructions (6). <title
                            level="m">Interesting Narrative</title> is, in other words, a perfect
                        example of colonial mimicry, a discursive process that depends on its own
                        indeterminacy to disrupt normalized knowledge, not only for slave owners who
                        rely on racist assumptions about the capacity of Africans for rational
                        thought and moral feelings, but also for abolitionists who continue to deny
                        equal rights for Blacks attempting to assimilate into British society.</p>
                    <p>Equiano’s text provides an excellent introduction to what Paul Youngquist and
                        Frances Botkin have called “Black Romanticism,” a critical focus in romantic
                        studies that seeks to restore certain geographies, particularly the West
                        Indies, back to the center of literary analysis. Although some students will
                        have encountered Equiano before, such encounters will have rarely led to
                        alternative perspectives for reading romantic literature in which the Maroon
                        War, the Haitian Revolution, and the Independence movements of South America
                        form the natural historical backdrop to a literature just as invested in
                        translation and cross-cultural exchange as it is in national formation.
                        According to Youngquist and Botkin, the problem is a disciplinary one, which
                        they provocatively articulate in no uncertain terms in the opening statement
                        of their introduction to the recent volume of collected essays <title
                            level="m">Circulations: Romanticism and the Black Atlantic</title>
                        (2011): “With notable exceptions, studies in British Romanticism remain
                        pretty white” (1).<note place="foot" resp="author">In-text citations refer
                            to paragraph numbers.</note> For Youngquist and Botkin, “the whiteness
                        of Romantic studies is a symptom of amnesia . . . a massive act of
                        forgetting on the part of contemporary scholarship” that has blinded us to
                        “the complex network of exchanges circulating people, ideas, practices, and
                        things throughout the Atlantic” (1; 8). In transatlantic studies more
                        broadly defined, this form of amnesia is especially evident in the general
                        neglect of the intersections of romanticism and the Spanish-speaking world
                        in which the voices of Haiti, Cuba, Venezuela, Mexico, and a whole host of
                        other geographies of the Spanish Atlantic commanded the world stage.</p>
                    <p>The students I teach usually become excited by this ‘confession’ of sorts,
                        often citing this fact as the main reason for initially enrolling in the
                        class. When asked to provide a brief account of major events in the South
                        Atlantic in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, however,
                        some students will remember the Haitian Revolution and fewer still will
                        mention the Latin American Independence movements, let alone provide more
                        than cursory details to these events. Employing visual aids, provocative
                        excerpts, and online resources, I outline the important events of the period
                        from the 1780s Andean rebellion through the Bolívar Wars of the 1820s,
                        introducing students to the fiery brilliance of revolutionaries like Antonio
                        Nariño, Francisco de Miranda, San Martín, and the <foreign xml:lang="sp"
                            >libertador</foreign> himself, Simon Bolívar. With republics springing
                        up first in Venezuela in 1810, soon followed by Buenos Aires and New
                        Granada, then Chile and finally Mexico, Latin America soon rivaled their
                        North American neighbors in political innovation and radical change. Back in
                        Europe, I explain, Spain was experiencing its own revolution of sorts. With
                        the invasion of Napoleon in 1808, Spain not only found itself locked in a
                        life and death struggle for national independence, but also became deeply
                        engaged in its own political experimentations. The liberal intelligentsia in
                        Spain, self-dubbed <foreign xml:lang="sp">liberales</foreign>, fought to
                        secure their national sovereignty against Napoleon, but they also viewed the
                        political crisis as a rare opportunity for political and social reform, an
                        opportunity to completely revamp and modernize the Spanish government,
                        transform its traditional social structure, and draft a constitution along
                        more liberal and revolutionary lines.</p>
                    <p>As the site of wars and invasions, revolutions and constitutional inventions,
                        the Spanish Atlantic opened up a new space for political and ideological
                        discussion in Britain that touched on key issues of national and imperial
                        concerns. The imperial relationship between Spain and its colonies at a time
                        when both the colonies and metropole were formulating new ideas about
                        individual autonomy, national sovereignty, and civil liberties brought into
                        full view the inescapable conflict between liberal thought and the logic of
                        empire. As an early sympathizer of Latin American independence and now an
                        ally of Spain, Britain found itself caught between its moral obligation to
                        support Latin American claims for freedom against tyranny and oppression,
                        and their political responsibilities to honor their new alliance with Spain.
                        Yet, Britain had ulterior motives at play. Long coveting Latin American
                        markets, Britain understood the implications of Spanish American
                        independence for the expansion of its commercial empire. Thus, placed in a
                        position of savior to Spain and Latin America’s hope for independence,
                        Britain became an increasingly significant and politically charged space of
                        converging and conflicting interests: the place of revolutionary plotting on

                        revolutionary programs in London&#8212;and the source of a growing

                    <p>To introduce students to the interconnections between romantic literature and
                        the history of the struggle for Haitian independence, I assign the Broadview
                        edition of Leonora Sansay’s <title level="m">Secret History; or, The Horrors
                            of St. Domingo</title> (1808), a text that interweaves the events of the
                        Haitian Revolution with a romance plot that explores the gender and race
                        implications of interracial love, violence against women, and desire for
                        female community. I require students to read the introduction, which
                        provides an excellent initiation to the history of the Revolution from the
                        1791 slave revolt and the rise of Toussaint Louverture to the establishment
                        of the world’s first black republic in 1804 and the massacre of white French
                        colonists at the hands of Jean-Jacques Dessalines. The introduction also
                        provides a helpful discussion of racial politics in the Americas and their
                        complex relationship to constructions of gender and sex exemplified in the
                        interactions between mixed-race mulatto women, white Creole women born in
                        the Caribbean, and white European women. I think Gretchen Woertendyke is
                        absolutely correct to suggest that “Sansay’s tale joins the domestic terror
                        of Clara’s marriage to St. Louis to the revolutionary horror of
                        Saint-Domingue,” a point I tease out by highlighting the ways in which the
                        text deploys similar strategies of elision to hide both the violence of
                        revolution and the violence against women (256). Attempts at textual erasure
                        are immediate. In the opening letter to the novel, Mary expresses a desire
                        to bury her memories of the Revolution in the past, preferring instead to
                        dwell on the “profound tranquility of the ocean, the uninterrupted view, the
                        beautiful horizon . . . with a new world opening to my view” (61). Mary’s
                        romantic reflections at sea, however, are violently interrupted on landing
                        by the “terrible picture of desolation” that itself “cannot be imagined”
                        (61). Recognizing the tension between the romantic imagination and the
                        reality of revolution helps students organize their reading of the ways in
                        which history consistently interrupts the romance narrative of Sansay’s text
                        in order to, one might argue, dramatize the limits of the imagination and
                        reveal the secret process by which some histories become hidden.</p>
                    <p>Despite Mary’s attempt to narrate the reestablishment of polite society in
                        St. Domingue in which new fashions, plays, and, most importantly, balls
                        transform the “heap of ruins” throughout the city into “a fairy palace” of
                        pleasure and love-making, sporadic attacks by marauding former slaves and
                        daily accounts of gratuitous violence on both sides soon convince Mary that
                        “[t]he romantic visions of happiness I once delighted to indulge in, are
                        fading fast away before the exterminating touch of cold reality” (61; 74;
                        93). The links between revolutionary and sexual politics are tangible in the
                        novel, from Mary’s comparison of the masculinity of slave insurrectionists
                        with the effeminacy of French men to Rochambeau’s literal deployment of the
                        military to secure his sexual conquest of Clara. Yet, Mary’s scattered
                        anecdotes of domestic abuse against her sister Clara, like the episodes of
                        revolutionary violence punctuating the text, convey the “silent horror”
                        experienced by not only Clara, but all women in general, Mary remarking at
                        one point that “Clara is not the first wife that has been locked up at St.
                        Domingo” (103; 87). The parallels between Clara’s confinement and the
                        “brutal subjection” of slaves, who “have at length acquired a knowledge of
                        their own strength,” formally justify Clara’s own revolt not only from the
                        tyranny of her husband, but arguably also from the oppressive moral codes
                        Mary herself invokes to judge her sister’s sudden elopement with Don Alonzo
                        (76; 26). Although students may not always grasp all of the nuances of the
                        complex intersections between race, gender, sexuality, and revolutionary
                        violence in the novel, most will begin to understand how different forms of
                        oppression are often linked in romantic literature, recalling, for instance,
                        Wollstonecraft’s comparison of the institution of marriage to slavery, and
                        how new contexts almost always alter meaning, even of self-evident truths
                        about the inalienable rights of man.</p>

                    <head>Bolívar, Latin American Independence, and the Case for Translation</head>
                    <p>In turning to Bolívar and the Independence movements of South America, I
                        conclude this essay with a case study exploring the pedagogical value of
                        translating texts written in Spanish for students who typically encounter
                        the transatlantic and romantic concepts of revolution exclusively in
                        English. I begin by posing the question David Simpson asks in his evaluation
                        of Romantic cosmopolitanism: “can what is written in one language make sense
                        in another; can what is felt by one person be the same as what is felt by
                        someone from a different place or time?” (146). The question is a helpful
                        one because it not only speaks to the purpose of literary interpretation in
                        general, but also seeks to understand that purpose in terms of important
                        questions about the value of translations in literary analysis. According to
                        C. C. Wharram, “translation changes&#8212;or might prompt us to
                        change&#8212;the way we approach the teaching of texts of British
                        Romanticism in particular, and literature in general, within a planetary
                        context” (1). Although readings of translations, as Lesa Scholl notes, can
                        help students understand how British romantic literature “incorporates
                        foreignness” into its very structures of meaning, I find myself consistently
                        returning to Simpson’s notion of “translation not as the fantasy of
                        dialogism but as the impasse of blocked communication” (Scholl 17; Simpson
                        151). The key to the pedagogical strategy I have adopted for this course is
                        finding ways to demonstrate how seemingly straightforward romantic concepts
                        like the imagination, nature, liberty, and the rights of man not only
                        acquire new meanings when interpreted and read from one context to the next,
                        but also how the concepts themselves take shape in response to intentional
                        misreadings, unauthorized interpolations, contextual obfuscation, and other
                        forms of textual distortions.</p>
                    <p>One of the most compelling texts to advance the case for romantic translation
                        as a pedagogical strategy is Simon Bolívar’s <title level="a">Carta de
                            Jamaica</title> (1815), a letter written originally in Spanish but
                        immediately translated and published in English.<note place="foot"
                            resp="author">All English translations of <title level="a">Carta de
                                Jamaica</title> are from Frederick H. Fornoff in Bolívar. For
                            instructors considering teaching other Bolívar texts in English, David
                            Bushnell’s edited collection of Bolívar’s writings is the most
                            accessible to students.</note> Composed during his exile in the British
                        colony of Jamaica and addressed to the British resident Henry Cullen in an
                        effort to solicit British support for independence from Spain, Bolívar’s
                            <title level="a">Letter from Jamaica</title> finds itself at the center
                        of a transatlantic textual network triangulating between Britain, Spain, and
                        Spanish America during the early nineteenth century. Students who read this
                        letter expecting to find a revolutionary document worthy of Bolívar’s
                        reputation as <foreign xml:lang="sp">El Libertador</foreign> are surprised
                        by what appears to be clear anti-democratic statements. In addition to
                        supporting the rise of dictatorships throughout South America, Bolívar
                        mounts a powerful argument against the adoption of a “democratic and
                        federalist model” of government based on pragmatic considerations, arguing
                        that “institutions which are wholly representative are not suited to our
                        character, customs, and present knowledge” (23). Although Bolívar cites a
                        number of Enlightenment <foreign xml:lang="fr">philosophes</foreign>
                        throughout his political writings, it was Montesquieu not Rousseau that
                        Bolívar preferred to rewrite when imagining the future of Latin America.
                        Within a colonial context in which the colonized are excluded from “the
                        science of government and administration of the state,” a process Bolívar
                        argues has “left us in a kind of permanent infancy with respect to public
                        affairs,” the right to self-determination, Bolívar argues, trumps the right
                        of individuals to political equality (20; 19).</p>
                    <p>Burke, I remind students, advances a similar pragmatic argument when he
                        suggests that “all men have equal rights; but not to equal things,”
                        particularly with respect to “the share of power, authority, and . . . the
                        management of the state” (218). Like Bolívar, Burke also endorsed the idea
                        that the form of government of a nation ought to “emanate” from its
                        “national character” (249). Burke, after all, supported the American
                        Revolution, a fact that his opponents interpreted as hypocritical but Burke
                        defended by citing the differences of the American situation. If the share
                        of power, authority, and management of the state is at the crux of the
                        Revolution debate, what are we to make of Bolívar’s wholesale dismissal of
                        such an idea? What are we also to make of Bolívar’s class- and race-based
                        skepticism of the masses, particularly the “African hordes” who “rarely
                        manage to appreciate the wholesome condition of freedom”? (qtd. in Bolívar
                        xl; 27). If time allows for the inclusion of other writings of Bolívar, this
                        line of inquiry can be sharpened by questions concerning Bolívar’s
                        denunciation of the “ideal of tolerance” and “exaggerated notion of the
                        rights of man” in <title level="m">The Cartagena Manifesto</title> (1812),
                        his preference for “correct” elections over “popular elections” in the same
                        document, and his inclusion of provisions for a lifetime presidency in the
                        1826 Bolivian Constitution (3; 7). A brief survey of the rise of <foreign
                            xml:lang="sp">caudillos</foreign>&#8212;local strongmen among whom
                        historians include nineteenth-century figures like Juan Manuel de Rosas and
                        Antonio López de Santa Anna, dictators of Argentina and Mexico respectively,
                        and modern dictators like Fidel Castro, Manuel Noriega, and Augusto
                        Pinochet&#8212;emphasizes the contemporary relevance of such questions by
                        alerting students to the long history of authoritarian violence in Latin
                        America that renowned historian John Lynch argues “was essentially a product
                        of the wars of independence” (5). Admittedly intended for dramatic effect,
                        one might ask how it is possible to get from life, liberty, and the pursuit
                        of happiness to death squads, dictators, and desaparecidos?</p>
                    <p>Bolívar’s political writings, especially the <title level="a">Carta de
                            Jamaica,</title> can also open up important questions about the nature of
                        translation, not only in the way in which it challenges traditional readings
                        of influence, but also in the way in which it defamiliarizes and estranges
                        concepts we think we know. By explicitly citing the works of Enlightenment
                        thinkers like Abbé Raynal, Baron von Humboldt, and Montesquieu, and
                        translating his letter into English, Bolívar suggests that he and his
                        interlocutor are speaking the same language. Ulterior motives aside, Bolívar
                        understands the importance of translating the Spanish American experience
                        within the perceived parameters of a shared discourse, a strategy of
                        “enforcing meaning” that is noticeably absent in texts like <title level="m"
                            >The Angostura Address</title>, despite the fact that it essentially
                        develops the same ideas as his <title level="a">Carta de Jamaica</title>
                        (151). Intertextuality, consequently, is essential to the construction of
                        its meaning, a fact that is problematized by Bolívar’s intentional
                        misreadings of many of the texts he cites in his letter, most notably José
                        María Blanco White’s <title level="m">El Español</title>, which Bolívar
                        refers to as evidence of broad support for the cause of independence in
                        Spanish America. Although he initially defended Latin American autonomy
                        while Spain itself fought for its own independence, Blanco White made it
                        clear that he did not intend for his arguments to be interpreted as support
                        of independence.<note place="foot" resp="author">In 1811 Blanco White wrote
                            in <title level="m">El Español</title>, “La América española no ha
                            pasado aun el noviciado de la libertad, y quererlo hacer todo de repente
                            y á la vez, paredes, techos, y cimientos es exponerse á no hacer mas que
                            un edificio de apariencia que se vendri abaxo al primer soplo. La
                            América Española por necesidad será independiente en algun tiempo (no
                            sabré decir qundo) . . . Pero si los americanos quieren no retardar este
                            período; no lo apresuren” (3:303).</note>Reading against Blanco White’s
                        ‘original’ intentions, Bolívar selectively reconstructs a transatlantic
                        discourse in order to fashion a political statement that is familiar in its
                        form but peculiar in its implications.</p>
                    <p>What would it mean to read Bolívar’s letter in Spanish? Would we find an
                        original text with clarified concepts and meanings or would we find new
                        problems of interpretation as we subject the text to the new distortions of
                        our own translations? Consider, for example, Bolívar’s discussion of the
                        reasons why Spanish Americans are unfit for a federal republic. First in
                        English: <quote> Slave states are identified as such by virtue of their
                            constitution or the abuse of it. People are slaves when the government,
                            by its essence or through its vices, tramples and usurps the rights of
                            the citizen or subject. Applying these principles, we will find that
                            America was not only deprived of its freedom but deprived as well of the
                            opportunity to practice its own active tyranny. (19) </quote> From this
                        translation, it is unclear what precisely Bolívar means by “slave states.”
                        The analogy of citizens as slaves under an oppressive government hardly
                        clarifies the issue. Unlike oppressed subjects, slave states enslave
                        themselves unless Bolívar means for the second statement to elaborate his
                        first, suggesting then that states in which the government tramples on the
                        rights of the people are the slave states alluded to in the previous
                        statement. Even if this latter meaning is granted, it is difficult to see
                        how these “principles” help us to understand the American situation.
                        Depriving one of rights does appear tantamount to depriving one of freedom,
                        but how is that the same as depriving one of the opportunity to practice
                        tyranny? This last question is of course resolved if we agree that Bolívar
                        is suggesting that citizens have the right to govern themselves and by
                        depriving them of rights in general, the slave state deprives them of this
                        right as well. But Bolívar does not believe citizens have the right to
                        govern, a point he repeatedly makes throughout his writing. We still have
                        yet to touch on the bizarre notion of participating in one’s own active
                        tyranny, an idea that returns us to the concept of slave states that enslave
                        themselves, which we were supposed to have already clarified. Add to this
                        the history of Bolívar’s relationship to the recently independent black
                        republic Haiti, where he travelled and received military support on the
                        promise he would incorporate abolition as part of his revolutionary program
                        (hitherto not a part), and Bolívar’s discussion of the slave state becomes
                        even more curious.</p>
                    <p>Let us now turn to the passage in Spanish to see if we can sort out some of
                        these issues: <quote> Los estados son esclavos por la naturaleza de su
                            constitución o por el abuso de ella; luego, un pueblo es esclavo cuando
                            el gobierno, por su esencia o por sus vicios, holla y usurpa los
                            derechos del ciudadano o subdito. Aplicando estos principios, hallaremos
                            que la América no solamente estaba privada de su libertad, sino también
                            de la tiranía activa y dominante. (<title level="a">Carta</title>)
                        </quote> Translating with the intent to clarify the questions I posed, I
                        might rewrite this passage in English in the following way: <quote> States
                            are subject to despotic rule when they are formed as subject states or
                            when those in power elsewhere act despotically toward it. Tyrannical
                            governments, however, enslave their own people when they reduce and
                            usurp the power of their citizens or subjects to participate in the
                            administration of the state, regardless of whether these governments
                            were formed to do so or not. Applying the principle of subject states,
                            we can see how America as a state has been deprived of its political
                            autonomy. Applying the principle of enslaving governments, however, we
                            can see how Americans have also been deprived of the possibility of
                            participating in the active and dominant tyrannical rule of the state.
                        </quote> In this interpretation, I seek to clarify the comparison between
                        states and governments by removing the reference to states as slaves in the
                        first statement, which to me creates confusion with regard to another
                        possible analogy between enslaved states and enslaved people. I then mark a
                        contrast between states as political entities sometimes subject to external
                        rule and the mechanisms of governments concerned with the administration of
                        the state in order to create two principles and two applications: the
                        principle of subject states explaining America’s loss of political autonomy
                        and the principle of tyrannical governments explaining the people’s
                        inability to rule themselves. In some ways, I have ironed out some of the
                        wrinkles of confusion; in other ways, I have created more than I began with
                        and have most certainly contained some of the dynamism of the passage. If we
                        reinsert the analogy between enslaved states and enslaved people, for
                        example, we recover Bolívar’s sublimated and far more disturbingly racist
                        view that although Spanish rule has enslaved America, some Americans, like
                        the constitution of subject states, are naturally formed for slavery.
                        Although we do not have time here to tease out the nuances of Bolívar’s view
                        of race in the Americas, it is enough to point out that the racial diversity
                        of the Americas created great anxiety for Bolívar who even in this letter
                        represents race as a stumbling block to unity in the Americas.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, in seeking to normalize the strange reference to the desire of the
                        people to tyrannize themselves, I, like the translator before me, invent a
                        phrase to prevent readers from interpreting this passage as an advocacy for
                        tyranny: in Fornoff’s translation, “opportunity to practice” and in mine,
                        “possibility of participating.” Yet, tyranny is precisely what this passage
                        is advocating. Since Americans have been kept “in a kind of permanent
                        infancy,” they have never learned how to use the mechanisms of power to
                        control entire populations, especially those as vast and diverse as those in
                        the Americas. Although the <title level="a">Carta de Jamaica</title> is at
                        its heart a solicitation for British aid, Bolívar understands its role as a
                        statement of his revolutionary agenda, which for him always involves
                        imagining post-colonial rule. Arguments against representative republics are
                        not simply enlightenment speculations on the best form of government; they
                        are in many ways an anticipation and justification of the authoritarian rule
                        that Bolívar believed must be established while the population is educated
                        and gains experience in managing a state. The letter’s disproportionate
                        attention to the process of decolonization and the post-colonial state makes
                        sense when viewed as an assurance to a potential ally concerned about the
                        implications of an independent America in light of anxieties occasioned by
                        nations like Haiti. Yet, as Bolívar’s letter made clear, revolution must be
                        translated into Spanish. In the sentence immediately following this passage,
                        Bolívar writes, “Me explicaré” [Let me explain what I mean]. Translation may
                        never be able to fulfill such a promise, but as a “core Romantic paradigm,”
                        Wharram might be correct in suggesting that “translation changes everything”
                        (Simpson 152; Wharram 1).</p>
