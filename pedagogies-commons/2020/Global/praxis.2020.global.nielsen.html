               “European Romanticism and Frankenstein: A Comparative Literature Course for English
               Majors”
               outlines a course that prepares future teachers of Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em> to acknowledge the novel’s French and German influences. Such influences include
               Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s <em>Confessions</em> and <em>The Sufferings of Young Werther</em> by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, one of the texts that the creature finds in the forest.
               The essay offers ways to introduce topics such as the French Revolution (the backdrop
               for the DeLacey family’s story) and argues for the importance of teaching Romantic
               irony as a way to approach literature of the period, particularly French and German
               Romantic poetry. The course invites students to explore European texts with similar
               themes as <em>Frankenstein</em>. E. T. A. Hoffmann’s novella <em>The Sandman</em> (published a year before <em>Frankenstein</em>) and Goethe’s <em>Faust</em> also feature doubles, death and rebirth, and scientists.</p>

               <p>Romanticism did not arise in isolation, even though many British writers remained
                  in their home countries during the Napoleonic Wars. As soon as the Congress of Vienna
                  brought peace, many writers left Britain, some never to return home. Mary Shelley
                  wrote <em>Frankenstein</em> (1818) in Switzerland, Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley died in Italy, and Bryon expired
                  in Greece. It was abroad, too, that the idea of Romanticism flourished in academic
                  circles. European writers like August Wilhelm Schlegel, Heinrich Heine, and Victor
                  Hugo recognized and celebrated the term <em>romantic</em> well before Victorian critics in Britain rediscovered it in the 1850s. The English
                  Department at my institution serves many future and current teachers. Thus, our curriculum
                  favors the British and American literature that forms the English canon at the secondary
                  level in the United States. With this in mind, I created a comparative literature
                  course that would prepare students to teach one of the major works of the British
                  canon: Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em>. For 14 weeks, we focus on some of the European texts that influenced this famous
                  novel. In addition, this course aims to foster in-depth critical understanding of
                  <em>romantic irony</em>, especially as it relates to the fiction and poetry in Britain, France, and Germany
                  circa 1780 to 1830; to engage students’ understanding of the ways in which writers
                  and artists influenced sociopolitical thinking about key issues of the day, such as
                  the French Revolution and human rights; and to teach an appreciation for the ways
                  in which literary movements transcend national and generic borders. Moreover, students
                  in this course gain a nuanced understanding of the historical and aesthetic discourse
                  that informed the reading and writing of British and European Romantic texts. An online
                  syllabus includes links to electronic texts and resources on this subject (<a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixB.html">Appendix B</a>).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Recent scholarship on <em>Frankenstein</em> engaging with the theme of globalism has focused on the novel’s frame narrative and

                     </div> I describe a course on European Romanticism for English majors that includes a global
                     reading history: the texts that Shelley read, those her monster reads, literature
                     from pre-Romantic movements, and other major authors of European Romanticism. For
                     example, Shelley read Rousseau’s <em>Confessions</em> (1770/71–1782) and other works by the Swiss author. So along with this autobiography,
                     we read the <em>Discourse on the Origin of Inequality</em> (<em><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">Discours sur l’origine et les fondements de l’inégalité parmi les hommes</span></em>, commonly referred to as the <em>Second Discourse</em>, 1755) and/or the <em>Social Contract</em> (<em><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">Du contrat social</span></em>, 1762). These texts and Goethe’s <em>The Sufferings of Young Werther</em> (<em><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">Die Leiden des jungen Werthers</span></em>, 1774) instruct students about the roles literature and nature play in what becomes
                     Romantic sensibility.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The goal of this approach is to provide critical terminology for reading <em>Frankenstein</em> as not just a piece of the British canon, but also as an international text. The
                  first unit covers Romantic movements in France and Germany. Poems by André Chénier,
                  Heinrich Heine, Alphonse de Lamartine, Alfred de Musset, and Annette von Droste-Hülshoff
                  introduce students to the major features of literature in the Romantic era. In the
                  second unit, we discuss <em>Frankenstein</em> and other European texts that feature scientists and doubles. Goethe’s two-part tragedy
                  <em>Faust</em> (1808/1832), E. T. A. Hoffmann’s novella <em>The Sandman</em> (<em><span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Der Sandmann</span></em>, 1817), and Shelley’s text were published within 10 years of each other and consequently
                  raise similar issues, such as the (traumatic) legacy of paternity and the ethics of
                  science and violence. The eponymous protagonist of Goethe’s <em>Faust</em> resembles Victor Frankenstein, and E. T. A. Hoffmann’s <em>The Sandman</em> aids students’ critical understanding of doubling and romantic irony in <em>Faust</em> and <em>Frankenstein</em>. These concepts give students tools with which to compare works of literature from
                  around the globe.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Unit I: Romantic Movements in France and Germany</span></h2>
               <p>French Romanticism is often left out of discussions of British Romanticism, for the
                  reason that it began later than Romantic movements in Britain and German-speaking
                  territories. Yet the manifesto of French Romanticism, Victor Hugo’s preface to his
                  drama <em>Cromwell</em> (1827), offers students a guide to some of the aesthetics of the period. Hugo announces
                  a new age for poetry, characterized by an interest in the grotesque and the fantastical.
                  Romanticism represented breaking with classical traditions for Hugo and his young
                  cohort, which included Théophile Gautier (1811–1872). Gautier narrated what he called
                  the battle over Hugo’s <em>Hernani</em> (1830) in his <em>History of Romanticism</em> (<em><span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Histoire du Romantisme</span></em>, 1870). This drama announced the beginning of Romanticism in France, because it contained
                  non-classical elements such as colloquial language that upset the audience.</p>
               <p>Beginning the course with Hugo’s <em>Preface to Cromwell</em> introduces students to the asynchronous nature of Romantic movements. Romanticism
                  arose in France so late, in part, owing to the Revolution. An online timeline can
                  clarify the events of the Revolution for students (
                  “<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.marxists.org/history/france/revolution/timeline.htm">Principal Dates</a>”
                  ). The leaders of the Revolution (1789–1799) curtailed authors’ freedom, and of course
                  their lives. The poetry of André Chénier (1762–1794) gives students a personal sense
                  of the historical impact of the French Revolution. Chénier composed one of his best-known
                  poems, 
                  “The Young Captive”
                  (
                  “<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La jeune captive</span>,”
                  1794) in prison. Aimée Franquetot de Coigny (1769–1820), the former Duchess of Fleury,
                  is likely the young captive in the poem (Ferber 165). It is difficult <em>not</em> to read another of Chénier’s poems, 
                  “When the Somber Slaughterhouse Opens Its Caverns of Death”
                  (
                  “<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Quand au mouton bêlant la sombre boucherie</span>”
                  ), through the lens of his death on the guillotine. Chénier remains important to the
                  history of Romanticism owing to his inspiration of young Romantics like Hugo (Ferber
                  165). Chénier remains popular today; Umberto Giordano’s opera about the life of author,
                  <em>Andrea Chénier</em> (1896), appears regularly onstage. This poem might also encourage discussions of
                  Shelley’s depiction of capital punishment in <em>Frankenstein</em> through the fate of Justine.</p>
               <p>Chénier’s poem also offers a lesson in romantic irony. John Fetzer reminds us that
                  romantic irony requires readers “to straddle a middle ground of ambivalence between
                  dichotomous or contrastive options” (Fetzer 22). 
                  “Somber Slaughterhouse”
                  offers contrasting views between the ironic perspective, symbolized by the slaughterhouse,
                  and the naïve view of “happier days” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">de plus heureux temps</span>, line 24). The “caverns of death” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">caverns de mort</span>, line 1), “this abyss” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cet abîme</span>, line 10), “frightful lair” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">affreux repaire</span>, line 13), “the bloody hooks of the people’s larder” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">crocs sanglants du charnier populaire</span>, line 15), “my withered soul” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon âme fléterie</span>, line 19), and “tears of misfortune” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pleurs de l’infortune</span>, line 25) comprise this ironic perspective. Yet Chénier contrasts these somber reflections
                  with memories of “shepherds, dogs, the other sheep, the whole farm” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pâtres chiens et moutons, toute la bergerie</span>, line 3), “children” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Les enfants</span>, line 5), “maidens with lovely complexions” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Les vierges aux belles couleurs</span>, line 6), and “knots of ribbons and flowers” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entrelaçaient rubans et fleurs</span>, line 8). In these examples, the specter of death stands in contrast to the images
                  of life. Yet neither view attains precedence over the other. Fetzer’s concept of the
                  “bifocal or double vision” provides a tool to understand such examples because the
                  ironic perspective does not necessarily undermine the naïve perspective (21). In this
                  way, romantic irony teaches students the important lesson that contradictory sentiments
                  can, and do, coexist together.</p>
               <p>Instruction in romantic irony paves the way for a better understanding of contradictions
                  and ambivalence in Romantic literature, such as Victor Frankenstein’s ethical vacillations.
                  Contradictions also exist in the ostensibly universal values that characterize Romanticism.
                  On the one hand, Romantic writers shared the values espoused by French Republicans:
                  universalism, democracy, and equality. On the other hand, these privileges did not
                  apply to all human beings. Jean Jacques Rousseau acknowledges and illustrates many
                  of these hypocrisies. His <em>Social Contract</em> begins with the famous admonishment that all men are in “chains” (1). Yet the “savage
                  man” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">homme sauvage</span>) of his second <em>Discourse</em>, or the many women who read his works, had little access to all the privileges of
                  citizenship. The monster resembles Rousseau’s description of savage man in his second
                  <em>Discourse</em>; the way that the monster eats berries, lives in the forest, discovers fire, and
                  acquires language “conforms both in general outline and specific details to the life
                  of Rousseau’s savage” (Marshall 183). The creature’s demands for equal privileges
                  also evoke Rousseau’s discourse on inequality, although he inserts “interesting problems
                  into it,” such as the demand for a community (Reese 49).</p>
               <p>These first few weeks on the French Revolution include reading the Declaration of
                  Independence (1776) alongside the French document it inspired, The Declaration of
                  the Rights of Man and Citizen (La déclaration des droits de l’homme et du citoyen,
                  1789). Doing so allows students to understand the international nature of the discourse
                  of human rights, and the exclusion of some members of the population from these privileges.
                  We read <em>The Rights of Woman and Female Citizen</em> (<em><span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La déclaration des droits de la femme et de la citoyenne</span></em>) by the protofeminist activist, writer, and dramatist Olympe de Gouges (1748–1793).
                  Gouges rewrites the <em>Rights of Man</em> for female citizens (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">citoyennes</span>). Another online text that could supplement this reading is the memoir of Toussaint
                  L’Ouverture, the leader of the revolution in Haiti 1791. These texts teach the universal
                  values that tie international Romantic movements together. These online texts also
                  give students the historical background to understand the plights of Safie and the
                  De Lacey family in Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em>. Safie’s father threatens Felix with a <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">lettre de cachet</span>, a secret warrant for arrest that could be wielded indiscriminately. Such abuses
                  of power made many thinkers sympathetic to the need for a revolution in France.</p>
               <p>The next few weeks of the course focus on the cult of sensibility in French and German
                  literature. On the surface, <em>Confessions</em> appears to present a travelogue of the author’s journey through Switzerland and France,
                  and such information contextualizes the geography of <em>Frankenstein</em> for students. However, Rousseau’s <em>Confessions</em> is also an important text for understanding the discourse of sensibility in <em>Frankenstein</em>. The monster’s appeal for sympathy from his creator resembles Rousseau’s narrative,
                  which likewise contains tales of theft and misdeeds committed with a tortured conscience.
                  There are more direct parallels between <em>Confessions</em> and <em>Frankenstein</em>, such as being locked out of the gates of Geneva and the abandonment of children.
                  Rousseau felt motivated to write <em>Confessions</em> after Voltaire revealed he abandoned his five children in orphanages (McAlpin 260).
                  According to Marshall, “Shelley had Rousseau in mind as she tells the story of a parent
                  who made his offspring a monster—precisely by abandoning him” (187). After all, Shelley
                  wrote about Rousseau’s abandoned children in her entry on the Swiss author for <em>Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of France</em> (Marshall 187).</p>
               <p>In Rousseau, students might identify the conflicting dualities that characterize Victor
                  Frankenstein, or what Rousseau calls his own “almost irreconcilable opposites” (110–11).
                  The author of <em>Confessions</em> is full of contradictions. On the one hand, this son of a watchmaker becomes a philosopher
                  and man of letters, and in his early life he works as a servant while also garnering
                  knowledge from those around him. He demonstrates other inconsistencies as well: he
                  converts to Catholicism and back to Calvinism, clings to people but becomes an incessant
                  wanderer, and steals but believes in honesty. In this way, Rousseau’s autobiography
                  functions as an introduction to the social mores of the period. When I taught this
                  class partially online, I randomly assigned aliases to students and invited them to
                  write their journals from the perspective of these fictional personae. I assigned
                  students professions from the period (banker, soldier, preacher, servant, musician,
                  writer, artist, aristocrat) and different genders (so some students were wives, daughters,
                  or sons of members of the aforementioned professions). Students chose their own names
                  and nationalities from a list. While reading <em>Confessions</em>, we discussed what contradictions their alter egos might have in their own lives.
                  This exercise helped students to better identify with Romantic-era readers and writers.</p>
               <p>Goethe’s novel, <em>The Sufferings of Young Werther</em>, resembles Rousseau’s <em>Confessions</em> in its narrative style and purpose. Werther’s letters seem to ask for readers’ sympathies
                  in a way that corresponds to the confessional structure of Rousseau’s autobiography.
                  And like Rousseau, Goethe’s protagonist finds solace in the beauty of nature, while
                  he suffers from the constraints of a society that censures him. He finds a world in
                  himself (Goethe 6). Literature, too, allows Rousseau and Goethe to escape from the
                  perceived evils of society. Werther experiences a moment of intimacy when he witnesses
                  a rainstorm with his unrequited love, Lotte, who exclaims, “Klopstock!” (Goethe 17–18).
                  They refer to Klopstock’s poem, 
                  “The Spring Festival”

                  1759/1764). This poem hallmarks the Storm and Stress Movement (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Sturm und Drang</span>), and Michael Ferber includes it in his anthology <em>European Romantic Poetry</em> (2005). At the same time, these themes allow students to appreciate the ways in which
                  Rousseau and Goethe suggest that nature itself can become a source of religious contemplation.</p>

                  <p>Goethe’s popular novel is the third book that Shelley’s creature finds in the woods.
                     Many critics have noted the importance of one of these books, <em>Paradise Lost</em>, to <em>Frankenstein</em>.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> The second book, Plutarch’s <em>Lives</em>, was of course popular reading across Europe, particularly during the second half
                     of the eighteenth century. Yet Goethe’s novel is important for understanding the monster’s <em>emotional</em> development. The monster responds to Werther’s “despondency and gloom” (Shelley 87).
                     Perhaps Werther’s obsession with a woman, Lotte, fuels the creature’s search for a
                     mate. In <em>Werther</em>, students can also reacquaint themselves with romantic irony, for <em>Werther</em> contains a bifocal perspective: that of Werther (in Book I), and that of the editor
                     (in Book II). Goethe came to regret both the book and his association with it, in
                     part owing to the copycat suicides it inspired (Sondrup 164). Shelley’s creature,
                     too, promises to embrace self-inflicted death. Students who have read <em>Werther</em> will recognize the Romantic sentiment of this gesture. <em>Werther</em> and <em>Frankenstein</em> thus share the characteristic of resembling <em>anti</em>-Bildungsromane. Instead of beginning a path of maturation into adulthood, the protagonists
                     of each novel come of age and then succumb to death.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Two weeks on nature and irony in French and German poetry follow these readings. The
                  class reads Gérard de Nerval’s (1808–1855) poem, 
                  “Delphica”
                  (
                  “<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Delfica</span>,”
                  1845). Nerval exemplifies the cross-fertilization of European writing. He translated
                  the first part of Goethe’s tragedy, <em>Faust</em>, in 1827, and he became part of Hugo’s <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cénacle</span> in 1830 (Ferber 248). 
                  “Delfica”
                  shows some affinity for Goethe’s religious viewpoint. The eponymous protagonist of
                  <em>Sufferings of Young Werther</em> searches for God in the secular world (nature, children), and 
                  “Delfica”
                  champions a type of <em>hybrid</em> religious sentiment as well. The first stanza evokes Daphne, the name of the girl
                  Apollo chases in Greek myth, heralding the return of the pagan spirit: “They will
                  come back, those gods you always mourn for” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ils reviendront, ces Dieux que tu pleures toujours</span>, line 9). In the final lines, however, the speaker refers to the first Christian
                  emperor of the Roman empire: “But the sibyl with the Roman countenance / Lies still
                  asleep under Constantine’s Arch: / —And nothing has disturbed the austere gate” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Cependant la sibylle au visage latin / Est endormie encore sous l’arc de Constantin
                     / —Et rien n’a dérangé le sévère portique</span>, lines 12–14). The hope for religious renewal is thus an intermingling of the pagan
                  and Christian ethos. This expansive view of religious sentiment resembles themes in
                  Rousseau’s writing, such as <em>Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar</em>, in the fourth book of <em>Emile</em>. Nerval even planned to write a play about the death of Rousseau, based on the mistaken
                  assumption that the Swiss writer had committed suicide (Kneller 159). The invocation
                  of Daphne and “That song of love” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Cette chanson d’amour</span>, line 4) in 
                  “Delphica”
                  would allow students to compare Rousseau’s and Nerval’s search for “a lost feminine
                  ideal” (Kneller 169).</p>
               <p>Reading French and German poetry after Rousseau and <em>Werther</em> would also allow students to reflect on the subject of the femme fatale. One interpretation
                  of Lotte might be of the siren who lures men to their deaths. Besides Werther, she
                  has already driven Heinrich mad, and encourages Werther even though she knows about
                  his obsessive passion. Comparing poems on the Lorelei myth allows students to understand
                  this recurring motif in Romantic literature. The most famous of the Lorelei poems
                  is Heinrich Heine’s, 
                  “Lorelei, or I Do Not Know What It Means . . .”
                  (
                  “<span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ich weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten</span>,”
                  1824). Lorelei is a siren figure from German legend who sits in the middle of the
                  Rhine river and lures sailors to their deaths: “The boatman listens, and o’er him
                  / Wild-aching passions roll; / He sees but the maiden before him, / He sees not reef
                  or shoal” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Den Schiffer, im kleinen Schiffe, / Ergreift es mit wildem Weh; / Er schaut nicht
                     die Felsenriffe, / Er schaut nur hinauf in die Höh</span>, lines 17–20). This poem fits in with discussions of romantic irony, for the speaker
                  is unsure of the conclusion of the legend: “I think, at last the wave swallows / The
                  boat and the boatman’s cry; / And this is the fate that follows / The song of the
                  Lorelei” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ich glaube, die Wellen verschlingen / Am Ende Schiffer und Kahn; / Und das hat mit
                     ihrem Singen / Die Lore-Ley getan</span>, lines 21–24). Online recordings of Heine’s poem could give the class a sense of
                  its musicality; Friedrich Silcher and Franz Liszt adapted the poem to music. Students
                  could also read Clemens Brentano’s poem 
                  “Lore Lay”
                  (1801) as a point of contrast, for the poem lacks a frame narrative.</p>
               <p>German and French Romantic poems allow students to contemplate the intersecting themes
                  of nature and death, themes that also occur in <em>Frankenstein</em>. Annette von Droste-Hülshoff’s (1797–1848) poem, 
                  “In the Moss”
                  (
                  “<span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Im Moose</span>,”
                  1844) begins with a frame narrative. The speaker envisions his or her own death in
                  the future, as seen through the refracting light of “the forest moss” (Waldes Moose,
                  line 3). Hülshoff offers readers a vision of the cycle of life. The speaker contemplates
                  the smallest creatures: “All round so still, that in the leaves I sensed / The caterpillar
                  chew, and like green dust / Felt gently whirling flakes of leafage fall” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ringsum so still, daß ich vernahm im Laub / Der Raupe Nagen, und wie grüner Staub
                     / Mich leise wirbelnd Blätterflöckchen trafen</span>, line 13–15). But in the penultimate stanza the speaker declares: “And then at last
                  I saw myself, like mist, / Drift quietly into the pores of earth” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Und noch zuletzt sah ich, gleich einem Rauch, / Mich leise in der Erde Poren ziehen</span>, lines 41–42). The irony of the poem rests in the speaker’s ambivalence about which
                  vision remains true.</p>
               <p>A French Romantic poem, 
                  “The Village (Church) Bell”
                  (
                  “<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La Cloche du village</span>,”
                  1839) by Alphonse de Lamartine (1790–1869), also treats the themes of nature and death.
                  The specter of “death” (la mort, line 6) contrasts with the naïve point of view in
                  this poem, the speaker’s “mind” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ma pensée</span>, line 1) that reflects on “that song which silences with envy / Its rivals attached
                  to the brambles of life, / And which is lost in the furthest reaches of heaven!” (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ce chant qui fait taire d’envie / Ses rivaux attachés aux ronces de la vie, / Et qui
                     se perd au fond des cieux</span>, lines 28–30). Students might contrast Lamartine’s Deist sentiments with those of
                  other Romantic writers, providing a way to discuss the role of religion in <em>Frankenstein</em>. Such scenes include the godlike role that Victor adopts when he creates the creature,
                  the clergy’s role in forcing false confessions of the condemned during Justine’s execution,
                  and the novel’s allusions to Milton’s <em>Paradise Lost</em>.</p>

            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.3">
               <h2><span class="head">Unit II: Frankenstein and his Doppelgänger</span></h2>
               <p>In the final unit, students read <em>Frankenstein</em>, <em>Faust</em>, and <em>The Sandman</em>. These texts feature scientists whose ambitions put human lives in danger, even while
                  they interact with artificial life. Like <em>Frankenstein</em>, <em>The Sandman</em> begins with an exchange of letters, and then shifts to an editorial perspective.
                  And like Shelley’s novel, <em>The Sandman</em> concludes with the death of the protagonist. Students should read Freud’s essay 
                  “The Uncanny”
                  (
                  “<span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Das Unheimliche</span>,”
                  1919) after reading Hoffmann’s text and before reading <em>Frankenstein</em> in order to learn the concept of Doppelgänger. If time permitted, students could
                  also read Otto Rank’s book, <em>The Double: A Psychoanalytic Study</em> (1914). The novel begins with characters that mirror each other, Walton and Frankenstein,
                  as Beth Newman points out, and one could argue that the creature is Victor Frankenstein’s
                  dark double.</p>
               <p>Goethe’s two-part tragedy, <em>Faust</em>, contains many similarities to <em>Frankenstein</em>. In both works, the protagonist is a scientist whose experiments endanger humanity,
                  yet he remains unrepentant for the suffering he causes others. Faust and Frankenstein
                  resemble each other in their scientific methods, for they both begin with the Medieval
                  occult before creating artificial life. Faust resembles Rousseau and Frankenstein
                  in that he possesses two sides. On the one hand, he might appear to be a victim of
                  a devil and an arbitrary Lord (line 315). On the other hand, he acts like a shrewd
                  client of the devil (line 1690). He made potions with his father that killed people
                  (lines 995–1005), but he also serves as doctor who masters the elements (lines 355–65).
                  While he presents himself as a lover (lines 3155–89), he acts like a seducer and a
                  libertine (line 3510).</p>
               <p>A common theme in <em>Faust</em> and <em>Frankenstein</em> is death and rebirth. Faust begins his journey of discovery when he despairs of ever
                  becoming godlike, and nearly commits suicide (line 735). The season of Easter symbolizes
                  his return to life. In fact, Goethe uses the rituals of spring as a backdrop for other
                  scenes of the play. Faust and Mephistopheles lose themselves in dancing and drinking
                  on Walpurgis Night, the eve of May Day, while Gretchen gives birth to her and Faust’s
                  illegitimate child. At the beginning of <em>Faust</em>, Part II, Faust lies in the Elysian fields, a spring-like setting announcing his
                  rebirth after the destruction of Gretchen and her family. These themes work well with
                  <em>Frankenstein</em> and the novel’s documented ties to birth, rebirth, and regeneration. Arguably, Mary
                  Shelley’s grief for her children and her wish to reanimate them finds a corollary
                  in Victor Frankenstein, who creates his monster in response to his mother’s death.
                  In her journal entry from March 19, 1815, Shelley records: “Dream that my little baby
                  came to life again—that it had only been cold &amp; that we rubbed it by the fire &amp; it
                  lived” (70). After <em>Frankenstein</em>, Shelley wrote short stories that also touched on reanimation: 
                  “Valerius”
                  (1819), 
                  “The Transformation”
                  (1824), and 
                  “The Reanimated Man”
                  (1826).</p>
               <p>In <em>Faust</em> II, students find a direct corollary to Frankenstein’s creation, another artificial
                  creation: Homunculus. Faust’s assistant Wagner brings Homunculus to life in an alembic.
                  Elsewhere Goethe refers to him as “a little chemical man” (
                  “Second”
                  525). Homunculus dies in a scene that symbolizes rebirth. He travels the ocean with
                  Proteus, who transforms into a dolphin, and then falls in love with the sea nymph
                  Galatea, who rides on Aphrodite’s shell. At the moment of their union, however, the
                  glass around Homunculus breaks, and he dies, mingled for eternity with Galatea. The
                  ultimate rebirth in <em>Faust</em> is his apotheosis at the end of the tragedy, when he ascends to Heaven and is reunited
                  with Gretchen.</p>
               <p>The assignments in the course assess students’ ability to close read these texts comparatively.
                  In the middle of the semester, students write a long essay comparing two works. This
                  assignment encourages students to start thinking about connections between the works
                  we read. The final paper in the semester asks students to compare characteristics
                  and traits of European Romantic literature to Mary Shelley’s novel and to speculate
                  in what ways <em>Frankenstein</em> might be read as a critique of Romantic-era values, considering some of the ethical
                  dilemmas Shelley raises about parental responsibility, the pursuit of genius, and
                  the rights of citizens. The reading journey for this course is ambitious and wide-ranging.
                  It aims to teach students, many of whom graduate with teaching credentials, to view
                  one of the most important novels in the English language as the product of Mary Shelley’s
                  interest in literature from beyond the shores of Britain, and to remind them of the
                  importance of global connections in creating great works of literature.</p>
