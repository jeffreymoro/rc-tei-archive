                    Shelley’s <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> to acknowledge the novel’s French and German 
                    influences. Such influences include Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s <title level="m">Confessions</title> 
                    and <title level="m">The Sufferings of Young Werther</title> by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, one 
                    of the texts that the creature finds in the forest. The essay offers ways to introduce topics 
                    such as the French Revolution (the backdrop for the DeLacey family’s story) and argues for the 
                    importance of teaching Romantic irony as a way to approach literature of the period, particularly 
                    French and German Romantic poetry. The course invites students to explore European texts with

            <p>Romanticism did not arise in isolation, even though many British writers remained in
                their home countries during the Napoleonic Wars. As soon as the Congress of Vienna
                brought peace, many writers left Britain, some never to return home. Mary Shelley
                wrote <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> (1818) in Switzerland, Keats and Percy
                Bysshe Shelley died in Italy, and Bryon expired in Greece. It was abroad, too, that
                the idea of Romanticism flourished in academic circles. European writers like August
                Wilhelm Schlegel, Heinrich Heine, and Victor Hugo recognized and celebrated the term
                    <emph>romantic</emph> well before Victorian critics in Britain
                rediscovered it in the 1850s. The English Department at my institution serves many
                future and current teachers. Thus, our curriculum favors the British and American
                literature that forms the English canon at the secondary level in the United States.
                With this in mind, I created a comparative literature course that would prepare
                students to teach one of the major works of the British canon: Mary Shelley’s 
                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. For 14 weeks, we focus on some of the European
                texts that influenced this famous novel. In addition, this course aims to foster
                in-depth critical understanding of <emph>romantic irony</emph>, especially
                as it relates to the fiction and poetry in Britain, France, and Germany circa 1780
                to 1830; to engage students’ understanding of the ways in which writers and artists
                influenced sociopolitical thinking about key issues of the day, such as the French
                Revolution and human rights; and to teach an appreciation for the ways in which
                literary movements transcend national and generic borders. Moreover, students in
                this course gain a nuanced understanding of the historical and aesthetic discourse
                that informed the reading and writing of British and European Romantic texts. An
                online syllabus includes links to electronic texts and resources on this subject
                (<ref target="/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixB.html">Appendix B</ref>).</p>
                <p>Recent scholarship on <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> engaging with the theme of
                globalism has focused on the novel’s frame narrative and depiction of travel through
                the polar region.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Miranda Burgess, <title level="a">Frankenstein’s 
                    Transport: Modernity, Mobility, and the Science of Feeling</title> (2015), and Siobhan
                    Carroll, <title level="a">Crusades Against Frost: <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>,

                describe a course on European Romanticism for English majors that includes a global
                reading history: the texts that Shelley read, those her monster reads, literature
                from pre-Romantic movements, and other major authors of European Romanticism. For
                example, Shelley read Rousseau’s <title level="m">Confessions</title> (1770/71–1782)
                and other works by the Swiss author. So along with this autobiography, we read the
                <title level="m">Discourse on the Origin of Inequality</title> 
                    (<title level="m"><foreign xml:lang="fr">Discours sur l’origine et les fondements de 
                        l’inégalité parmi les hommes</foreign></title>, commonly referred to as the 
                    <title level="m">Second Discourse</title>, 1755) and/or the <title level="m">Social Contract</title> 
                (<title level="m"><foreign xml:lang="fr">Du contrat social</foreign></title>, 1762). These 
                    texts and Goethe’s <title level="m">The Sufferings of Young Werther</title> 
                (<title level="m"><foreign xml:lang="fr">Die Leiden des jungen Werthers</foreign></title>, 1774) 
                instruct students about the roles literature and nature play in what becomes 
                Romantic sensibility.</p>
             <p>The goal of this approach is to provide critical terminology for reading 
                 <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> as not just a piece of the British canon, but
                also as an international text. The first unit covers Romantic movements in France
                and Germany. Poems by André Chénier, Heinrich Heine, Alphonse de Lamartine, Alfred
                de Musset, and Annette von Droste-Hülshoff introduce students to the major features
                of literature in the Romantic era. In the second unit, we discuss 
                 <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> and other European texts that feature scientists 
                 and doubles. Goethe’s two-part tragedy <title level="m">Faust</title> (1808/1832), E. T. A.
                 Hoffmann’s novella <title level="m">The Sandman</title> 
                 (<title level="m"><foreign xml:lang="de">Der Sandmann</foreign></title>, 1817), and Shelley’s 
                 text were published within 10 years of each other and consequently raise similar issues, such as the 
                (traumatic) legacy of paternity and the ethics of science and violence. The eponymous 
                protagonist of Goethe’s <title level="m">Faust</title> resembles Victor Frankenstein, and 
                E. T. A. Hoffmann’s <title level="m">The Sandman</title> aids students’ critical understanding
                of doubling and romantic irony in <title level="m">Faust</title> and 
                 <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. These concepts give students tools with which to 
                compare works of literature from around the globe.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section"><head>Unit I: Romantic Movements in France and Germany</head>
            <p>French Romanticism is often left out of discussions of British Romanticism, for the
                reason that it began later than Romantic movements in Britain and German-speaking
                territories. Yet the manifesto of French Romanticism, Victor Hugo’s preface to his
                drama <title level="m">Cromwell</title> (1827), offers students a guide to some of the
                aesthetics of the period. Hugo announces a new age for poetry, characterized by an
                interest in the grotesque and the fantastical. Romanticism represented breaking with
                classical traditions for Hugo and his young cohort, which included Théophile Gautier
                (1811–1872). Gautier narrated what he called the battle over Hugo’s <title level="m">
                    Hernani</title> (1830) in his <title level="m">History of Romanticism</title> 
                (<title level="m"><foreign xml:lang="fr">Histoire du Romantisme</foreign></title>, 1870). 
                This drama announced the beginning of Romanticism in France, because it contained
                non-classical elements such as colloquial language that upset the audience.</p>
            <p>Beginning the course with Hugo’s <title level="m">Preface to Cromwell</title>
                introduces students to the asynchronous nature of Romantic movements. Romanticism
                arose in France so late, in part, owing to the Revolution. An online timeline can
                clarify the events of the Revolution for students 
                (<title level="a"><ref target="http://www.marxists.org/history/france/revolution/timeline.htm">
                        Principal Dates</ref></title>). The leaders of the
                Revolution (1789–1799) curtailed authors’ freedom, and of course their lives. The
                poetry of André Chénier (1762–1794) gives students a personal sense of the
                historical impact of the French Revolution. Chénier composed one of his best-known
                poems, <title level="a">The Young Captive</title> 
                (<title level="a"><foreign xml:lang="fr">La jeune captive</foreign>,</title> 1794) in prison. 
                Aimée Franquetot de Coigny (1769–1820), the former Duchess of Fleury, is likely the young 
                captive in the poem (Ferber 165). It is difficult <emph>not</emph> to read another 
                of Chénier’s poems, <title level="a">When the Somber Slaughterhouse Opens Its Caverns of 
                    Death</title> (<title level="a"><foreign xml:lang="fr">Quand au mouton bêlant
                la sombre boucherie</foreign></title>), through the lens of his death on the guillotine. 
                Chénier remains important to the history of Romanticism owing to his inspiration of young
                Romantics like Hugo (Ferber 165). Chénier remains popular today; Umberto Giordano’s
                opera about the life of author, <title level="m">Andrea Chénier</title> (1896),
                appears regularly onstage. This poem might also encourage discussions of Shelley’s
                depiction of capital punishment in <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> through the
                fate of Justine.</p>
            <p>Chénier’s poem also offers a lesson in romantic irony. John Fetzer reminds us that
                romantic irony requires readers “to straddle a middle ground of ambivalence between
                dichotomous or contrastive options” (Fetzer 22). <title level="a">Somber 
                    Slaughterhouse</title> offers contrasting views between the ironic perspective, 
                symbolized by the slaughterhouse, and the naïve view of “happier days” 
                (<foreign xml:lang="fr">de plus heureux temps</foreign>, line 24). The “caverns
                of death” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">caverns de mort</foreign>, line 1), “this abyss” 
                (<foreign xml:lang="fr">cet abîme</foreign>, line 10), “frightful
                lair” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">affreux repaire</foreign>, line 13), “the bloody hooks 
                of the people’s larder” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">crocs sanglants du charnier 
                populaire</foreign>, line 15), “my withered soul” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">mon âme 
                fléterie</foreign>, line 19), and “tears of misfortune” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">pleurs de 
                l’infortune</foreign>, line 25) comprise this ironic perspective. Yet Chénier contrasts 
                these somber reflections with memories of “shepherds, dogs, the other sheep, the whole farm” 
                (<foreign xml:lang="fr">Pâtres chiens et moutons, toute
                la bergerie</foreign>, line 3), “children” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">Les enfants</foreign>, 
                line 5), “maidens with lovely complexions” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">Les vierges aux belles 
                couleurs</foreign>, line 6), and “knots of ribbons and flowers” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">
                Entrelaçaient rubans et fleurs</foreign>, line 8). In these examples, the specter of
                death stands in contrast to the images of life. Yet neither view attains precedence
                over the other. Fetzer’s concept of the “bifocal or double vision” provides a tool
                to understand such examples because the ironic perspective does not necessarily
                undermine the naïve perspective (21). In this way, romantic irony teaches students
                the important lesson that contradictory sentiments can, and do, coexist together.</p>
            <p>Instruction in romantic irony paves the way for a better understanding of
                contradictions and ambivalence in Romantic literature, such as Victor Frankenstein’s
                ethical vacillations. Contradictions also exist in the ostensibly universal values
                that characterize Romanticism. On the one hand, Romantic writers shared the values
                espoused by French Republicans: universalism, democracy, and equality. On the other
                hand, these privileges did not apply to all human beings. Jean Jacques Rousseau
                acknowledges and illustrates many of these hypocrisies. His <title level="m">Social
                    Contract</title> begins with the famous admonishment that all men are in “chains”
                (1). Yet the “savage man” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">homme sauvage</foreign>) of his
                second <title level="m">Discourse</title>, or the many women who
                read his works, had little access to all the privileges of citizenship. The monster
                resembles Rousseau’s description of savage man in his
                second <title level="m">Discourse</title>; the way that the
                monster eats berries, lives in the forest, discovers fire, and acquires language
                “conforms both in general outline and specific details to the life of Rousseau’s
                savage” (Marshall 183). The creature’s demands for equal privileges also evoke
                Rousseau’s discourse on inequality, although he inserts “interesting problems into
                it,” such as the demand for a community (Reese 49).</p>
            <p>These first few weeks on the French Revolution include reading the Declaration of
                Independence (1776) alongside the French document it inspired, The Declaration of
                the Rights of Man and Citizen (La déclaration des droits de l’homme et du citoyen,
                1789). Doing so allows students to understand the international nature of the
                discourse of human rights, and the exclusion of some members of the population from
                these privileges. We read <title level="m">The Rights of Woman and Female
                    Citizen</title> (<title level="m"><foreign xml:lang="fr">La déclaration 
                    des droits de la femme et de la citoyenne</foreign></title>) by the protofeminist 
                activist, writer, and dramatist Olympe de Gouges (1748–1793). Gouges rewrites 
                the <title level="m">Rights of Man</title> for female citizens 
                (<foreign xml:lang="fr">citoyennes</foreign>). Another online text that could 
                supplement this reading is the memoir of Toussaint L’Ouverture, the leader of the 
                revolution in Haiti 1791. These texts teach the universal values that tie international 
                Romantic movements together. These online texts also give students the historical 
                background to understand the plights of Safie and the De Lacey family in Shelley’s 
                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. Safie’s father threatens Felix with a 
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">lettre de cachet</foreign>, a secret warrant for arrest that 
                could be wielded indiscriminately. Such abuses of power made many thinkers sympathetic 
                to the need for a revolution in France. </p>
            <p>The next few weeks of the course focus on the cult of sensibility in French and
                German literature. On the surface, <title level="m">Confessions</title> appears to
                present a travelogue of the author’s journey through Switzerland and France, and
                such information contextualizes the geography of <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>
                for students. However, Rousseau’s <title level="m">Confessions</title> is also an
                important text for understanding the discourse of sensibility in 
                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. The monster’s appeal for sympathy from his 
                creator resembles Rousseau’s narrative, which likewise contains tales of theft and 
                misdeeds committed with a tortured conscience. There are more direct parallels between 
                <title level="m">Confessions</title> and <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, such as
                being locked out of the gates of Geneva and the abandonment of children. Rousseau
                felt motivated to write <title level="m">Confessions</title> after Voltaire revealed
                he abandoned his five children in orphanages (McAlpin 260). According to Marshall,
                “Shelley had Rousseau in mind as she tells the story of a parent who made his
                offspring a monster—precisely by abandoning him” (187). After all, Shelley wrote
                about Rousseau’s abandoned children in her entry on the Swiss author for 
                <title level="m">Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of France</title> (Marshall 187).</p>
            <p>In Rousseau, students might identify the conflicting dualities that characterize
                Victor Frankenstein, or what Rousseau calls his own “almost irreconcilable
                opposites” (110–11). The author of <title level="m">Confessions</title> is full of
                contradictions. On the one hand, this son of a watchmaker becomes a philosopher and
                man of letters, and in his early life he works as a servant while also garnering
                knowledge from those around him. He demonstrates other inconsistencies as well: he
                converts to Catholicism and back to Calvinism, clings to people but becomes an
                incessant wanderer, and steals but believes in honesty. In this way, Rousseau’s
                autobiography functions as an introduction to the social mores of the period. When I
                taught this class partially online, I randomly assigned aliases to students and
                invited them to write their journals from the perspective of these fictional
                personae. I assigned students professions from the period (banker, soldier,
                preacher, servant, musician, writer, artist, aristocrat) and different genders (so
                some students were wives, daughters, or sons of members of the aforementioned
                professions). Students chose their own names and nationalities from a list. While
                reading <title level="m">Confessions</title>, we discussed what contradictions their
                alter egos might have in their own lives. This exercise helped students to better
                identify with Romantic-era readers and writers.</p>
            <p>Goethe’s novel, <title level="m">The Sufferings of Young Werther</title>, resembles
                Rousseau’s <title level="m">Confessions</title> in its narrative style and purpose.
                Werther’s letters seem to ask for readers’ sympathies in a way that corresponds to
                the confessional structure of Rousseau’s autobiography. And like Rousseau, Goethe’s
                protagonist finds solace in the beauty of nature, while he suffers from the
                constraints of a society that censures him. He finds a world in himself (Goethe 6).
                Literature, too, allows Rousseau and Goethe to escape from the perceived evils of
                society. Werther experiences a moment of intimacy when he witnesses a rainstorm with
                his unrequited love, Lotte, who exclaims, “Klopstock!” (Goethe 17–18). They refer to
                Klopstock’s poem, <title level="a">The Spring Festival</title> 
                (<title level="a"><foreign xml:lang="de">Frühlingsfeier</foreign>,</title> 1759/1764). 
                This poem hallmarks the Storm and Stress Movement (<foreign xml:lang="de">Sturm und 
                    Drang</foreign>), and Michael Ferber includes it in his anthology 
                <title level="m">European Romantic Poetry</title> (2005). At the same time, these 
                themes allow students to appreciate the ways in which Rousseau and Goethe suggest 
                that nature itself can become a source of religious contemplation.</p>
            <p>Goethe’s popular novel is the third book that Shelley’s creature finds in the woods.
                Many critics have noted the importance of one of these books, <title level="m">Paradise 
                    Lost</title>, to <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>.<note place="foot" 
                        resp="editors">Johnson and Georgiana, Lamb, Ping, and Sanderson write about the 
                        influence of <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> on 
                        <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>.</note> The second book, Plutarch’s 
                <title level="m">Lives</title>, was of course popular reading across Europe,
                particularly during the second half of the eighteenth century. Yet Goethe’s novel is
                important for understanding the monster’s <emph>emotional</emph> development. The monster
                responds to Werther’s “despondency and gloom” (Shelley 87). Perhaps Werther’s
                obsession with a woman, Lotte, fuels the creature’s search for a mate. In 
                <title level="m">Werther</title>, students can also reacquaint themselves with
                romantic irony, for <title level="m">Werther</title> contains a bifocal perspective:
                that of Werther (in Book I), and that of the editor (in Book II). Goethe came to
                regret both the book and his association with it, in part owing to the copycat
                suicides it inspired (Sondrup 164). Shelley’s creature, too, promises to embrace
                self-inflicted death. Students who have read <title level="m">Werther</title> will
                recognize the Romantic sentiment of this gesture. <title level="m">Werther</title> and
                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> thus share the characteristic of resembling
                    <emph>anti</emph>-Bildungsromane. Instead of beginning a path of
                maturation into adulthood, the protagonists of each novel come of age and then
                succumb to death.</p>
            <p>Two weeks on nature and irony in French and German poetry follow these readings. The
                class reads Gérard de Nerval’s (1808–1855) poem, <title level="a">Delphica</title> 
                (<title level="a"><foreign xml:lang="fr">Delfica</foreign>,</title> 1845).
                Nerval exemplifies the cross-fertilization of European writing. He translated the
                first part of Goethe’s tragedy, <title level="m">Faust</title>, in 1827, and he became
                part of Hugo’s <foreign xml:lang="fr">cénacle</foreign> in 1830 (Ferber 248). 
                <title level="a">Delfica</title> shows some affinity for Goethe’s religious viewpoint. 
                The eponymous protagonist of <title level="m">Sufferings of Young Werther</title> searches 
                for God in the secular world (nature, children), and <title level="a">Delfica</title> 
                champions a type of <emph>hybrid</emph> religious sentiment as well. The first stanza 
                evokes Daphne, the name of the girl Apollo chases in Greek myth, heralding the return of 
                the pagan spirit: “They will come back, those gods you always mourn for” 
                (<foreign xml:lang="fr">Ils reviendront, ces Dieux que tu pleures toujours</foreign>, 
                line 9). In the final lines, however, the speaker
                refers to the first Christian emperor of the Roman empire: “But the sibyl with the
                Roman countenance / Lies still asleep under Constantine’s Arch: / —And nothing has
                disturbed the austere gate” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">Cependant la sibylle au visage latin 
                    / Est endormie encore sous l’arc de Constantin / —Et rien n’a dérangé le sévère 
                    portique</foreign>, lines 12–14). The hope for religious renewal is thus an 
                intermingling of the pagan and Christian ethos. This expansive view of religious sentiment 
                resembles themes in Rousseau’s writing, such as <title level="m">Profession of Faith of the 
                    Savoyard Vicar</title>, in the fourth book of <title level="m">Emile</title>. Nerval even
                planned to write a play about the death of Rousseau, based on the mistaken
                assumption that the Swiss writer had committed suicide (Kneller 159). The invocation
                of Daphne and “That song of love” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">Cette chanson d’amour</foreign>, 
                line 4) in <title level="a">Delphica</title> would allow students to compare Rousseau’s and 
                Nerval’s search for “a lost feminine ideal” (Kneller 169).</p>
            <p>Reading French and German poetry after Rousseau and <title level="m">Werther</title>
                would also allow students to reflect on the subject of the femme fatale. One
                interpretation of Lotte might be of the siren who lures men to their deaths. Besides
                Werther, she has already driven Heinrich mad, and encourages Werther even though she
                knows about his obsessive passion. Comparing poems on the Lorelei myth allows
                students to understand this recurring motif in Romantic literature. The most famous
                of the Lorelei poems is Heinrich Heine’s, <title level="a">Lorelei, or I Do Not Know What 
                    It Means . . .</title> (<title level="a"><foreign xml:lang="de">Ich weiss nicht was soll 
                    es bedeuten</foreign>,</title> 1824). Lorelei is a siren figure from
                German legend who sits in the middle of the Rhine river and lures sailors to their
                deaths: “The boatman listens, and o’er him / Wild-aching passions roll; / He sees
                but the maiden before him, / He sees not reef or shoal” (<foreign xml:lang="de">Den Schiffer, 
                im kleinen Schiffe, / Ergreift es mit wildem Weh; / Er schaut nicht die Felsenriffe, / Er
                schaut nur hinauf in die Höh</foreign>, lines 17–20). This poem fits in with discussions of
                romantic irony, for the speaker is unsure of the conclusion of the legend: “I think,
                at last the wave swallows / The boat and the boatman’s cry; / And this is the fate
                that follows / The song of the Lorelei” (<foreign xml:lang="de">Ich glaube, die Wellen 
                    verschlingen / Am Ende Schiffer und Kahn; / Und das hat mit ihrem Singen / Die Lore-Ley 
                    getan</foreign>, lines 21–24). Online recordings of Heine’s poem could give the class 
                a sense of its musicality; Friedrich Silcher and Franz Liszt adapted the poem to music. 
                Students could also read Clemens Brentano’s poem <title level="a">Lore Lay</title> (1801) as 
                a point of contrast, for the poem lacks a frame narrative.</p>
            <p>German and French Romantic poems allow students to contemplate the intersecting
                themes of nature and death, themes that also occur in <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. 
                Annette von Droste-Hülshoff’s (1797–1848) poem, <title level="a">In the
                Moss</title> (<title level="a"><foreign xml:lang="de">Im Moose</foreign>,</title> 1844) 
                begins with a frame narrative. The speaker envisions his or
                her own death in the future, as seen through the refracting light of “the forest
                moss” (Waldes Moose, line 3). Hülshoff offers readers a vision of the cycle of life.
                The speaker contemplates the smallest creatures: “All round so still, that in the
                leaves I sensed / The caterpillar chew, and like green dust / Felt gently whirling
                flakes of leafage fall” (<foreign xml:lang="de">Ringsum so still, daß ich vernahm im Laub 
                    / Der Raupe Nagen, und wie grüner Staub / Mich leise wirbelnd Blätterflöckchen 
                    trafen</foreign>, line 13–15). But in the penultimate stanza the speaker declares: 
                “And then at last I saw myself, like mist, / Drift quietly into the pores of earth” 
                (<foreign xml:lang="de">Und noch zuletzt sah ich, gleich einem Rauch, / Mich leise in der 
                    Erde Poren ziehen</foreign>, lines 41–42). The irony of the poem rests in the speaker’s 
                ambivalence about which vision remains true.</p>
            <p>A French Romantic poem, <title level="a">The Village (Church) Bell</title> 
                (<title level="a"><foreign xml:lang="fr">La Cloche du village</foreign>,</title> 1839) by
                Alphonse de Lamartine (1790–1869), also treats the themes of nature and death. The
                specter of “death” (la mort, line 6) contrasts with the naïve point of view in this
                poem, the speaker’s “mind” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">ma pensée</foreign>, line 1) that 
                reflects on “that song which silences with envy / Its rivals attached to the brambles of life, 
                / And which is lost in the furthest reaches of heaven!” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">ce chant qui 
                    fait taire d’envie / Ses rivaux attachés aux ronces de la vie, / Et qui se perd au fond 
                    des cieux</foreign>, lines 28–30). Students might contrast Lamartine’s Deist sentiments 
                with those of other Romantic writers, providing a way to discuss the role of religion in 
                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. Such scenes include the godlike role that
                Victor adopts when he creates the creature, the clergy’s role in forcing false
                confessions of the condemned during Justine’s execution, and the novel’s allusions
                to Milton’s <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title>.</p>

            <div type="section">
            <head>Unit II: Frankenstein and his Doppelgänger</head>
            <p>In the final unit, students read <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, 
                <title level="m">Faust</title>, and <title level="m">The Sandman</title>. These texts
                feature scientists whose ambitions put human lives in danger, even while they
                interact with artificial life. Like <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, 
                <title level="m">The Sandman</title> begins with an exchange of letters, and then
                shifts to an editorial perspective. And like Shelley’s novel, <title level="m">The
                    Sandman</title> concludes with the death of the protagonist. Students should read
                Freud’s essay <title level="a">The Uncanny</title> 
                (<title level="a"><foreign xml:lang="de">Das Unheimliche</foreign>,</title> 1919) after reading 
                Hoffmann’s text and before reading <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> in order to 
                learn the concept of Doppelgänger. If time permitted, students could also read Otto Rank’s 
                book, <title level="m">The Double: A Psychoanalytic Study</title> (1914). The novel begins
                with characters that mirror each other, Walton and Frankenstein, as Beth Newman
                points out, and one could argue that the creature is Victor Frankenstein’s dark
                double.</p>
            <p>Goethe’s two-part tragedy, <title level="m">Faust</title>, contains many similarities
                to <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. In both works, the protagonist is a
                scientist whose experiments endanger humanity, yet he remains unrepentant for the
                suffering he causes others. Faust and Frankenstein resemble each other in their
                scientific methods, for they both begin with the Medieval occult before creating
                artificial life. Faust resembles Rousseau and Frankenstein in that he possesses two
                sides. On the one hand, he might appear to be a victim of a devil and an arbitrary
                Lord (line 315). On the other hand, he acts like a shrewd client of the devil (line
                1690). He made potions with his father that killed people (lines 995–1005), but he
                also serves as doctor who masters the elements (lines 355–65). While he presents
                himself as a lover (lines 3155–89), he acts like a seducer and a libertine (line
                3510). </p>
            <p>A common theme in <title level="m">Faust</title> and <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> 
                is death and rebirth. Faust begins his journey of discovery
                when he despairs of ever becoming godlike, and nearly commits suicide (line 735).
                The season of Easter symbolizes his return to life. In fact, Goethe uses the rituals
                of spring as a backdrop for other scenes of the play. Faust and Mephistopheles lose
                themselves in dancing and drinking on Walpurgis Night, the eve of May Day, while
                Gretchen gives birth to her and Faust’s illegitimate child. At the beginning of 
                <title level="m">Faust</title>, Part II, Faust lies in the Elysian fields, a
                spring-like setting announcing his rebirth after the destruction of Gretchen and her
                family. These themes work well with <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> and the
                novel’s documented ties to birth, rebirth, and regeneration. Arguably, Mary
                Shelley’s grief for her children and her wish to reanimate them finds a corollary in
                Victor Frankenstein, who creates his monster in response to his mother’s death. In
                her journal entry from March 19, 1815, Shelley records: “Dream that my little baby
                came to life again—that it had only been cold &amp; that we rubbed it by the fire
                &amp; it lived” (70). After <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, Shelley wrote short
                stories that also touched on reanimation: <title level="a">Valerius</title> (1819), 
                <title level="a">The Transformation</title> (1824), and <title level="a">The Reanimated 
                    Man</title> (1826).</p>
            <p>In <title level="m">Faust</title> II, students find a direct corollary to
                Frankenstein’s creation, another artificial creation: Homunculus. Faust’s assistant
                Wagner brings Homunculus to life in an alembic. Elsewhere Goethe refers to him as “a
                little chemical man” (<title level="a">Second</title> 525). Homunculus dies in a scene 
                that symbolizes rebirth. He travels the ocean with Proteus, who transforms into a dolphin, 
                and then falls in love with the sea nymph Galatea, who rides on Aphrodite’s shell. At the
                moment of their union, however, the glass around Homunculus breaks, and he dies,
                mingled for eternity with Galatea. The ultimate rebirth in <title level="m">Faust</title> 
                is his apotheosis at the end of the tragedy, when he ascends to
                Heaven and is reunited with Gretchen.</p>
            <p>The assignments in the course assess students’ ability to close read these texts
                comparatively. In the middle of the semester, students write a long essay comparing
                two works. This assignment encourages students to start thinking about connections
                between the works we read. The final paper in the semester asks students to compare
                characteristics and traits of European Romantic literature to Mary Shelley’s novel
                and to speculate in what ways
                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> might be read as a critique
                of Romantic-era values, considering some of the ethical dilemmas Shelley raises
                about parental responsibility, the pursuit of genius, and the rights of citizens.
                The reading journey for this course is ambitious and wide-ranging. It aims to teach
                students, many of whom graduate with teaching credentials, to view one of the most
                important novels in the English language as the product of Mary Shelley’s interest
                in literature from beyond the shores of Britain, and to remind them of the
                importance of global connections in creating great works of literature.</p>
