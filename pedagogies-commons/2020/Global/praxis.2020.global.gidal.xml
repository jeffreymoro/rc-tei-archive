            <p>This paper describes a course that covers the Romantic period of European and
                American literature as the moment and site of the modern invention and institution
                of “culture”—both as an object of study and as a historical and ethical basis for
                the establishment of self and society. I last taught the course in 2012, and so this
                paper is something of a retrospective account. I maintain the present tense in my
                description, however, because this report has inspired me to take up the course
                again in the near future. It has also alerted me to the need to update its
                approaches to reflect the fine work in global Romanticism published in the interval
                and to reconsider how instructional approaches to Romanticism’s “logic of culture”
                might intersect with accounts of its “global imaginary.” This is a pedagogical
                report, not a scholarly intervention, and so I will simply acknowledge the
                compelling recent work of Samuel Baker, Evan Gottlieb, James Mulholland, Juliet
                Shields, Julie Carr, and Jeffrey Robinson among others whose varied meditations on
                the interplay between Romantic forms and mobile networks of global trade,
                communication, and empire must now inform any sustained reading of the authors I
                cover in this course. It is a confirmation of many of their varied but complementary
                models of Romanticism that a course focused primarily on the question of culture
                turns repeatedly in its concerns to the question of the global.</p>
            <p>During a 15-week semester, the students and I read, in English, aesthetic treatises
                by Blair, Herder, and Schiller, poetry by Macpherson and Byron, and novels by
                Rousseau, Goethe, Staël, and Cooper. These texts are supplemented by theoretical
                work on the logic of culture in the modern era and the condition of the modern
                university. Our primary concerns are to enjoy the rich complexities of these
                literary projects, to understand their role in establishing culture as a new model
                of authority and identity, and to perceive the centrality of Romanticism in shaping
                current cultural paradigms and dilemmas. </p>
            <p>Both the title of my course and our initial historical and theoretical parameters are
                taken from William Ray’s <title level="m">The Logic of Culture: Authority and
                    Identity in the Modern Age</title>, a rich and suggestive meditation on culture
                that draws upon the sociological models of Pierre Bourdieu and Jürgen Habermas with
                nods back to Matthew Arnold, Norbert Elias, F. R. Leavis, and Raymond Williams, and
                which contains extended engagements with Rousseau, Herder, Kant, and Schiller. Ray’s
                work is exceptionally productive in the advanced undergraduate classroom not only
                for his lucid prose and clear explications of social and aesthetic theories, but for
                the remarkably capacious extent of his argument. In just under 200 pages, Ray offers
                a) a theoretical model of culture and identity formation in the modern era; b) an
                intellectual history of European Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment critique; c) a
                survey of social and literary “institutions” (the museum, the novel) that are both
                determined by and determinative of cultural logic; and d) a telling and provocative
                consideration of recent debates over globalization and multiculturalism. Even
                limiting ourselves to his introduction and first chapter on the roots of cultural
                logic, paired with Raymond Williams’s treatment of the term <emph>culture</emph> 
                in <title level="m">Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and
                    Society</title> and the entry from the OED, we are able to begin interrogating an
                idea most students simply take for granted. </p>
            <p>I pair these theoretical writings with the opening passages from two primary texts
                (of sorts) which lay bare the modern ideology of culture, David Finn’s 
                <title level="m">How to Visit a Museum</title> and John Sutherland’s <title level="m">
                How to Read a Novel: A User’s Guide</title>. Each of these works offer accessible
                case studies in how regulatory norms are prescribed through idealizations of
                subjective responses under the aegis of culture. Finn promotes the cultural
                management of freedom most succinctly in his opening lines by telling his readers
                that “there is no right or wrong way to visit a museum. The most important rule you
                should keep in mind as you go through the front door is to follow your own
                instincts” (10). Sutherland offers an equally normative valorization of acculturated
                subjectivity through Tolstoy’s depiction of Anna Karenina’s “sublimely languorous”
                immersion in a Trollope novel on a train from Moscow to St. Petersburg (3). Both
                Finn and Sutherland insist on the individuality of aesthetic response in contrast to
                a perceived surfeit of objects and texts in the modern world, constructing aesthetic
                pleasure as a marker of human intelligence, a badge of honor for the cultured
                visitor/reader, a skill to be mastered, and a mechanism of social improvement.
                Through a humorous deconstruction of the rhetoric of these writings, students
                apprehend how culture and its institutions instantiate a dialectic between autonomy
                and law, identity and custom, which marks a paradoxical yet productive model of
                authority in the modern age.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Donald Preziosi 
                    performs a masterful critique of Finn’s rhetoric in <title level="a">Brain of 
                        the Earth’s Body: Museums and the Framing of Modernity.</title></note></p>
            <p>The class is thus prepared for Schiller’s <title level="m">On the Aesthetic
                    Education of Man</title>, which I suggest might just as well be entitled 
                <title level="m">How to Have an Aesthetic Experience . . . and Why</title>. After the
                unwitting examples of Finn and Sutherland, students can perceive in Schiller’s more
                demanding prose how the antinomies of law and nature opened up by the political and
                philosophical revolutions of the eighteenth century mandated new programs for
                cultural education. Alongside passages from the
                <title level="m">Declaration of Independence</title> and
                the <title level="m">Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen</title>
                (<ref target="http://www.romantic-circles.org/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixA.html">Appendix A</ref>), 
                we attend to what Schiller calls “the building up of true political
                freedom [as] the most perfect of all works of art” (25). By emphasizing the social,
                political, and hence moral motives for Schiller’s valorization of aesthetic culture,
                I help students to see his proliferating sequence of dichotomies (sense and form,
                feeling and reason, savagery and barbarism, etc.) as both epistemological and
                historical categories leading towards the mediating and transformative experiences
                of beauty, freedom, and culture. It is the aesthetic state alone for Schiller which
                “carries out the will of the whole through the nature of the individual,” and thus
                confers a “social character” upon humanity: “Taste alone brings harmony into
                society, because it establishes harmony in the individual” (137–38).</p>
            <p>These formulations are echoed by any number of Schiller’s contemporaries, of course, and 
                a glance at brief quotations from Schlegel, Hölderlin, Shelley, and Keats allows students 
                to appreciate Schiller’s letters as articulations of a dominant strain of Romantic thought 
                (<ref target="http://www.romantic-circles.org/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixA.html">Appendix A</ref>). 
                Helen Maria Williams’s oft reprinted celebration of
                the Fête de la Fédération from her <title level="m">Letters Written in France</title>
                makes clear the ideological dimensions of this program: “Half a million of people
                assembled at a spectacle, which furnished every image that can elevate the mind of
                man; which connected the enthusiasm of moral sentiment with the solemn pomp of
                religious ceremonies; which addressed itself at once to the imagination, the
                understanding, and the heart!” (64–65).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Two articles 
                    on Schiller which are both accessible to the advanced undergraduate and provocative 
                    meditations on his relevance in contemporary education and critique are Peter 
                    Howarth’s <title level="a">Creative Writing and Schiller’s Aesthetic Education</title> 
                    and Doris Sommer’s <title level="a">Schiller and Company, or How Habermas Incites Us 
                    to Play.</title></note></p>
            <p>This project is Kantian to the core, as Schiller freely announces, but he opens his
                work with an epigraph from Rousseau’s <title level="m">Julie</title> 
                (“<foreign xml:lang="fr">Si c’est la raison qui fait l’homme, c’est le sentiment qui le 
                    conduit</foreign>” [“if it is reason that makes man, it is sentiment 
                that guides him”]), and it is to that crucial novel of
                European Romanticism, in the excellent and affordable edition from Dartmouth
                University Press (translated and edited by Philip Stewart and Jean Vaché) that we
                next turn. Despite, or perhaps because of the increasingly surreal lunacy of
                Rousseau’s project, undergraduates thoroughly enjoy this novel’s odd and
                disorienting conflation of irony and sincerity, while its epistolary form appeals to
                a generation brought up on texting and instant messaging. Nicholas Paige has
                outlined an “aesthetics of renunciation” in Rousseau’s novel and its contemporary
                reception that reveals important affinities between the bifurcated reading
                experience of the sentimental novel and the modern logic of culture (Paige 131–54),
                and Ray himself argues that Rousseau seeks to instill in his readers a conscious
                division of acculturated reflections (<title level="m">Logic of Culture</title> 84–94;
                <title level="m">Story and History</title> 240–69). I likewise aim to underscore
                with my students how the novel solicits and regulates naturalized responses under
                the twin standards of freedom and law.</p>
            <p>Rousseau repeatedly valorizes authentic sentiments, honest communication, and
                virtuous self-regard, even as he emphasizes the necessity of education and
                cultivation to join such characteristics to moral duty. In its twin prefaces (which
                might be entitled <title level="m">How to Read a Novel . . . If You Must</title>) and
                its bizarre annotations (my favorite being his recommendation of fera, requested by
                Julie on her deathbed, as “an excellent fish particular to Lake Geneva, found only
                at certain times” [599]), the novel repudiates the received authority of cultural
                norms and expresses a conviction in the existence of natural values, even as it
                suggests that such values are insufficient without moral guidance and are, in any
                case, no longer available to the readers of this work. Rousseau’s prefatory fantasy
                of a virtuous farm couple reading his novel after their daily chores is
                counterbalanced by his satirical aside that it is only in “depraved ages” that
                people enjoy reading nostalgically about virtue (19).</p>
            <p>As the class encounters the rebellious romance and the methodical submission of Julie
                and St. Preux, the imaginative origins of Schiller’s aesthetic education become
                clear. In the movement of the two lovers from passion to duty, we encounter the
                proliferating dialectics of contingent desire and autonomous law, all mediated by
                love and portrayed as a poetics of virtue. Neither Julie’s rational submission to
                faith nor St. Preux’s flirtation with suicidal despair, which follow their failed
                affair and conclude the first half of the novel, suffice for the building of a moral
                society. Instead, it is in the utopia of Clarens under Monsieur de Wolmar’s
                direction, delineated throughout the novel’s second half, in which “innocence and
                peace” are programmatically produced through “the confidence of beautiful souls”
                (342, 346). In the domestic economy of Clarens, Wolmar and Julie represent the twin
                authorities of law and beauty, producing through custom and sentiment a pure
                morality which “follows and corrects” nature and a pure subordination which becomes
                the expression of individual will (375). The seduction and the horror of this
                totalitarian vision are perceptible within a twenty-first-century classroom, and the
                construction of absolute authority as the union of custom and nature allows students
                to apprehend both the dream and the nightmare of the Romantic project. </p>
            <p>Understanding Rousseau’s novel as both a representation and an enactment of moral
                sentiments to provide a new basis of reflexive cultural communion helps students
                perceive the relation of the novel genre more broadly as an institution of culture,
                aiding in “the transition from the state of nature to the civil state” theorized by
                Rousseau in <title level="m">The Social Contract</title> as a substitution of justice
                for instinct and celebrated by Schiller as “[carrying] out the will of the whole
                through the nature of the individual” 
                (<ref target="http://www.romantic-circles.org/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixA.html">Appendix A</ref>). 
                Hence they are well prepared to
                appreciate the dialogue between ancient poetry and modern taste staged in the pages
                of Macpherson’s <title level="m">Poems of Ossian</title>. As we read selections from
                the <title level="m">Fragments of Ancient Poetry</title>, <title level="m">Fingal</title>, 
                and <title level="m">Temora</title>, which Macpherson composed,
                compiled, and heavily annotated, alongside critical treatises by Blair and Herder,
                Staël and Chateaubriand, we encounter an archetypal instance of the invention of
                tradition within explicitly nationalized contexts. </p>
            <p>Published in over 40 discrete English editions from 1760 through 1830, and translated
                during this same time into French, Dutch, German, Swedish, Finnish, Italian,
                Russian, Danish, Hungarian, Spanish, Polish, Czech, Latin, and Classical Greek, the
                <title level="m">Poems of Ossian</title> form arguably the single most influential
                work of British poetry of the Romantic era (Gaskill). Yet, to my knowledge, these
                works are rarely taught and occupy only a marginal position, if they are included at
                all, in the standard anthologies of Romantic verse (Moore). Their reputation as
                forgeries certainly contribute to this neglect, as does the absence of any
                affordable edition for use in the classroom. Neither Howard Gaskill’s excellent but
                prohibitively priced University of Edinburgh edition nor the cheaper but less
                reliable nineteenth-century reprint from Dover Press provide a complete sense of the
                dynamic interface between poetry and annotation that Macpherson constructed in the
                early editions of his works. Some universities and colleges will have these editions
                in their special collections, and they are also available through ECCO for those
                with institutional subscriptions. The <title level="m">Ossian Online</title> project
                at the University of Galway, edited by Rebecca Barr and Justin Tonra, now offers a
                compelling and open access resource that reproduces the combination of translation,
                ethnography, and comparative literature at work in the pages of Macpherson’s texts
                (see <title level="m">Fingal</title> in 
                <ref target="http://www.romantic-circles.org/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixA.html">
                    Appendix A</ref>).</p>
            <p>What the students are able to perceive materially in the pages of these editions is
                the invention of culture as a dialogue between tradition and innovation, heritage
                and taste. Fiona Stafford argues that “Macpherson’s ‘translations’ involved acts of
                interpretation not only between Gaelic and English, but also between the oral
                culture of the depressed rural communities of the Scottish Highlands and the
                prosperous urban centers of Lowland Scotland, where the printed word was
                increasingly dominant,” and that therefore we should view his project as neither
                naïve nor deceptive but as “a sophisticated attempt to mediate between two
                apparently irreconcilable cultures” (viii). Whether or not they are willing to grant
                Macpherson this degree of latitude, students are able to witness the efficient
                transfer of cultural authority from the oral traditions Macpherson evokes to the
                aesthetic tastes of a modern print culture, which he paradoxically repudiates as
                degraded from the martial and sentimental purity of the ancient Gaels. The poems
                themselves thematize this anxiety of cultural transmission throughout, obsessed as
                they are with proleptic self-eulogy, poetic lament, and a general atmosphere of loss
                in which the value of any deed is only realized in the affective response of belated
                reflection. Akin to Julie and St. Preux’s tour to the locations of their former
                romance, the result is a highly reflexive bardic history which, in concert with the
                extensive annotations that occupy equal space in Macpherson’s pages, is more about
                its own reception as aesthetic tableau and archaeological record than about the
                deeds of its warriors.</p>
            <p>Hugh Blair’s <title level="a">Critical Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian,</title> 
                which was included in all later editions of the work, offers an extended argument for the 
                mutual implication of historical inquiry and aesthetic response as complementary modes 
                of cultural evaluation. Reading his dissertation, the class is able to explore the
                general contours of conjectural history, the valorization of poetry as moral
                imagination, and the celebration of the melancholic sublime (Ossian’s “joys of
                grief”) as superior to the beauties of classical antiquity—arguably the three
                primary ingredients of Romanticism as a self-conscious literary style. We turn from
                Blair to selections from Herder, who celebrates Ossian as an authentic voice of oral
                folk tradition and the vitality of primitive cultures. Mme de Staël comparably
                valorizes Ossian as the origin of a northern Romanticism in contest with a southern
                classicism, while François-René de Chateaubriand critiques her convictions by
                reasserting the necessity of Christianity and advanced society for the cultivation
                of beautiful morality. Chateaubriand views the sentimental effusions of Ossian’s
                warriors as evidence of their historical inaccuracy and makes Macpherson’s poetry a
                locus for his battle with atheistic philosophy and doctrines of perfectibility.
                Reading through these examples of Ossian’s critical reception enables students to
                perceive the tension between aestheticism and historicism in Romantic discourse
                (Leerssen), as well as the political and cultural agendas served by various positions 
                (<ref target="http://www.romantic-circles.org/praxis/global/praxis.2020.global.appendixA.html">Appendix A</ref>).</p>
                <p>Of all the documents of Ossian’s reception, it is Goethe’s <title level="m">Sorrows
                    of Young Werther</title> which had the greatest influence on European letters, and,
                indeed, helped to promote Macpherson’s work to a wider audience. Goethe’s novella
                replays both Rousseau’s sentimental education and Macpherson’s cultural archaeology
                in a tragic mode, presenting a paradigmatic instance of the Romantic turn towards
                interiority and despondency as a staged response to the tensions of social
                transformation. Like Rousseau, Goethe presents his fiction as an edited sequence of
                letters valuable as testimonials of sincerity and objects of sympathy. Werther is,
                in many ways, another St. Preux, skeptical of cultural mores and seeking beauty as
                an amelioration to a degenerate society. Such beauty is to be found in the natural
                world, in literature (especially Klopstock and Ossian), and, of course, in Lotte.
                The conclusion, in which the melancholic antihero extensively recites the Ossianic
                “Songs of Selma” to his idealized object of desire, stands as one of the almost
                literally seminal moments of European Romanticism. As both a last attempt at sexual
                consummation and a retrospective farewell to his beloved, Werther’s recitation,
                encompassing a disproportionate <emph>one-fifteenth</emph> of the entire
                narrative, deploys the sequential lamentations of Macpherson’s bardic performances
                towards a sentimental expression of heartsick regret (Lamport).</p>
            <p>Goethe famously disavowed this early melodramatic fantasia as a product of youthful
                self-indulgence and the morbid temperament of his generation, but the novella
                itself, along with Goethe’s later reflections, nicely included in the Signet
                Classics edition (translated by Catherine Hutter), enables the class to perceive the
                Romantic affinities between melancholic confession and cultural ennui. The
                significance of the work, Goethe argues, emerges precisely out of the social and
                historical disparities revealed between the heroic cadences of Ossianic lament and
                the performatively self-indulgent letters of a lovesick hero: “Defunct heroes and
                wan maidens hovered around us until, in the end, we really thought we could see the
                terrible shape of the spirit of Loda. In such an atmosphere, with fancies and
                studies of this nature, tortured by unsatisfied passion, with no external
                inspiration to do anything really important, our only prospect to succumb, in the
                end, to a dreary, uncultured, bourgeois existence—we began to think kindly of
                departing this life ” (146). Werther’s Ossianic recitation is at once an elegiac
                identification with a supposedly anterior poetry, itself a performance of elegy as a
                cultural rite, and an ironic revelation of the gulf separating the ideals informing
                his love for Lotte and the social realities that prevent its consummation.</p>
            <p>With this range of cultural and psychological maneuvers in mind, we approach two of
                the most paradigmatic literary works of the Napoleonic era, Mme de Staël’s novel 
                <title level="m">Corinne, or Italy</title> and Lord Byron’s <title level="m">Childe
                    Harold’s Pilgrimage</title>. Both share multiple generic affinities with Schiller’s
                aesthetic treatise, Rousseau’s sentimental novel, Macpherson’s bardic ethnography,
                and Goethe’s melancholic parable, all framed within travel narratives in which the
                conflicts between duty and sensibility are played out through a topography of
                historical rupture and cultural alienation.</p>
            <p>The entire plot of <title level="m">Corinne</title> can be read as a prolonged crisis
                of the absence of paternal authority contemporaneous with the French Revolution, an
                absence restored through the fraught logic of national culture. Oswald’s early
                residence in revolutionary France coincides with his father’s demise, a father whom
                he mourns to the brink of self-destruction, yet who himself was ambivalent about
                exercising his authority in deference to “the purity of affection, which depends on
                what is most free and involuntary in our nature” (214). His eventual return to
                Scotland marks a necessary submission to public and domestic dignity and hence a
                substitution of paternal authority by national spirit, “the prejudices, if you like,
                which unite us and our nation” as his father writes from beyond the grave: “we are a
                group, a community, which is free but indissoluble, and can perish only with the
                last one of us” (335). Between this liberation in France from the unexercised law of
                the father and the willful submission in Scotland to national duty, Oswald
                encounters Corinne and Italy through a cult of genius that is simultaneously a cult
                of the nation. Corinne distills the best of Italian climate, arts, and history while
                she surmounts the failings to which those very factors have condemned her people. In
                gazing upon her, both natives and foreigners perceive an idealized image of poetic
                self-determination even as they recognize the social and political contingencies
                that make such self-determination impossible. Corinne is not Italy, as the secret of
                her birth finally reveals and as the title of the novel, with its impossible
                imperative to choose between the individual and the nation, makes clear; but she
                does personify the tension between identity and authority with which Oswald must
                contend.</p>
            <p>The novel itself involves its readers in an analogous contention between nation and
                selfhood. Staël’s narrative rhetoric insists upon a normative perspective for the
                appreciation of landscape, the fine arts, and general scenes of cultural life,
                suggesting a universal aesthetic position by which culture may be apprehended and
                critiqued. Whether it is the picturesque beauty of Ancona or the sublime terror of
                Vesuvius, the sailors in the Adriatic or the citizens of Naples, the ruins of Rome
                or the buildings and galleries of Bologna, Italian culture is offered as a sequence
                of visual tableaux not only for the perceptions of the individual characters, whose
                responses inevitably serve to signify their national dispositions, but for an
                idealized reader whose sympathetic assent to a cosmopolitan taste is presupposed and
                thereby reaffirmed. Staël positions the reader as a cultivated and autonomous mind
                free of the confines of national customs and habits, though she repeatedly insists
                not only on the necessity of the conclusions they derive but also on the collective
                understandings and beliefs that shape all individuals, common and refined alike. We
                are repeatedly lectured on the aesthetic sensibilities of the Italians, the rational
                predilections of the Scots, and the careless sociability of the French through a
                narrative logic that explicitly conjoins character to national customs and those
                customs in turn to climate, religion, politics, and history as well as the
                individual endeavors of poets and artists—the very characters whose impulses
                allegedly are being explained.</p>
            <p>Explaining himself to Corinne by the tombs of Rome, Oswald speaks in the first-person
                plural as an emissary from the North: “We probably want sadness to surround death .
                . . and even before Christianity enlightened us, our ancient mythology, our Ossian,
                places only regrets and funeral chants beside the grave” (62–63). Later, as Corinne
                sings and plays Scottish laments besides George Wallis’s painting from Ossian’s 
                <title level="m">Temora</title> of Connal asleep on his father’s tomb, which she hangs
                in her private gallery as evidence of her own cultural patrimony, Oswald is overcome
                and begs her to “follow me to those retreats peopled by my memories” (162). Oswald
                and Lucille’s daughter Juliet assumes the same pose at the end of the novel, having
                learned the melody from Corinne at the cost of great suffering. This line of
                Ossianic references converts the bardic song from an already invented tradition of
                Scottish nationalism to a symptom of national character, a marker of aesthetic
                response, and an expression of personal sorrow, and in all cases a signifier of the
                tension between submission to cultural inheritance and assertion of individual
                desire.</p>
            <p>By the time we turn to <title level="m">Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</title>, students
                are getting used to the contours of the Romantic wanderer. St. Preux, Werther,
                Oswald, Harold—all appear variations of a single character. Alienated from the
                cultural mores of his own society, each takes at least temporary refuge in the road,
                traveling for distraction while acquiring a storehouse of social tableaux and
                natural vistas against which to formulate his own moral identity. That such journeys
                of discovery never fulfill their stated goals of liberation, but instead drive these
                figures either back to the comforts of duty and obligation or into a spiral of
                self-destruction, also seems to be a basic premise of the Romantic pilgrimage.
                Byron’s genius is not to concern himself with conclusions, but to use the template
                of cultural alienation as the medium for a range of aesthetic and historical
                reflections which exceed the limits of convention. As he notes, “a fictitious
                character is introduced for the sake of giving some connexion to the piece” (19),
                but this ironic device helps reveal Romantic character as primarily a conduit for
                binding sociological and historical reflection under the sign of culture.</p>
            <p>Reading <title level="m">Childe Harold</title> as a fusion of travelogue and memoir,
                the class perceives how culture becomes yet again an object of contemplation 
                <emph>and</emph> a vehicle of self-realization, with aesthetic meditation
                serving as a mode of political as well as historical commentary. Like Staël, whom he
                eulogizes in the fourth canto, Byron constructs poetic pilgrimage both as a response
                to the continental turmoil of the Napoleonic wars and as an alternative
                cosmopolitanism at once skeptical and sympathetic. Students are generally unfamiliar
                with the multitude of locations surveyed in Byron’s work, as well as the many
                political treaties, military battles, and other topical references, and, more than
                in any of the other works in this course, such references can place a barrier
                towards appreciation, particularly in the first two cantos. But they also
                underscore, in the form of Byron’s own copious annotations, how everything from
                ancient ruins to current events can be united within the imperatives of Romantic
                culture to replace content with judgment.</p>
            <p>The poem’s later set pieces of natural beauty in the third canto take us once again
                back to Vevey and Rousseauvian epiphanies, and I match Byron’s evocation of the Alps
                alongside not only the relevant passages from <title level="m">Julie</title> and the
                <title level="m">Confessions</title>, noted by Byron himself, but the renderings
                of the solitary sublime in Werther (“From the forbidding mountain range, across the
                barren plain untrodden by the foot of man, to the ends of the unknown seas, the
                spirit of the Eternal Creator can be felt rejoicing over every grain of dust that
                comprehends Him <emph>and lives</emph>!” [64]) and Ossian (“When the
                storms of the mountain come; when the north lifts the waves on high; I sit by the
                sounding shore, and look on the fatal rock. Often by the setting moon I see the
                ghosts of my children” [170]). Schiller once again helps us here, specifically his
                reflection in <title level="a">Naïve and Sentimental Poetry</title> on the experience 
                of loss so constitutive of the modern: “Our feeling for nature is like the sick person’s
                feeling for health” (195). Yet the fourth canto returns us to the aesthetic ideal in
                its celebration of “the beings of the mind” (4.5.37) amidst the “marble wilderness”
                (4.79.710) of Rome. We spend a day looking at the masterpieces of antiquity
                alongside Byron’s meditations and find ourselves back in the world of David Finn’s
                <title level="m">How to Visit a Museum</title>, only with a far more eloquent and
                skeptical guide (Siegel).</p>
            <p>The course could end here, the students having read and considered some of the most
                popular, influential, and archetypal literary expressions of European Romanticism.
                But I find it particularly instructive in an American classroom to jump the Atlantic
                and read James Fenimore Cooper’s first Leatherstocking Tale, <title level="m">The
                    Pioneers</title>, for its rendering of nature and character in perpetual
                transformation—the cultural ethos of the new American nation. Borrowing thematically
                and stylistically from Scott, whose novels would work equally well within the
                paradigms of this course, Cooper presents culture as a state of constant change.
                Culture marks the transition from wilderness to civilization, from the Native to the
                European, but also from the colonies to the states, the early settlements to the
                established cities. As with Staël and Byron, indeed as with Rousseau, Macpherson,
                and Goethe, Cooper marks his own narrative perspective on events as essential, here
                severed irretrievably from the America of his youth and a natural world that is
                itself subject to radical alteration.</p>
            <p>Throughout the novel, we as readers are made aware of our role in judging the various
                characters and their actions in relation to cultural and historical contingencies.
                Natty Bumpo and Indian John offer us highly mediated echoes of older ways of life
                and stand, like Ossianic heroes, as elegiac markers of historical change, figures
                for stages in a developmental history of the modern nation who must give way to the
                laws of Judge Temple, even as their rightful claims to the land are repeatedly
                recognized in the language of the narrative (Hayne). Also akin to Macpherson’s
                project—and those of Rousseau, Goethe, Staël, and Byron—Cooper’s extensive use of
                footnotes alerts his readers to their own mediated relationship to a cultural (and,
                in Cooper’s case, ecological) past, one to which they are indebted for the
                cultivation of the new world even as their reflective reading experience attests to
                the necessity of its eradication. Even in the optimistic setting of Cooper’s pioneer
                town, the culture of modernity assumes a constitutively elegiac mode: “This was the
                last that they ever saw of the Leather-stocking,” the novel ends, “whose rapid
                movements preceded the pursuit which Judge Temple both ordered and conducted. He had
                gone far towards the setting sun,—the foremost in that band of Pioneers, who are
                opening the way for the march of the nation across the continent” (456). Such a
                conclusion fulfills the transfer of cultural authority to the modern reader. The
                Romantic logic of Cooper’s novel—like every one of the works covered in this
                course—replaces tradition with judgment, offering its readers an aesthetic education
                by which nature and law are reconciled and sublated in the free play of art. As
                Byron notes at the conclusion of <title level="m">Childe Harold</title>, “Farewell!
                with <emph>him</emph> alone may rest the pain / If such there were—with
                    <emph>you</emph>, the moral of his strain!” (4.186.1673–74).</p>
            <p>This model of cultural identity informs most facets of our modern society, and while
                tracing its roots may be enlightening, it is also worth considering its demise under
                the pressures of globalization. By way of a coda, then, I turn with the students to
                Bill Readings’s <title level="m">The University in Ruins</title>, a critique of the
                culture wars in the modern university that extends the narrative of this course
                through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and suggests our current relation to
                the breakdown of national culture. Readings begins his history where Ray leaves off,
                moving from Schiller’s promotion of aesthetic culture through the German Idealists,
                the celebration of <foreign xml:lang="de">bildung</foreign>, and the Anglo-American promotion
                of the university as the site for the cultivation of the liberal arts within overtly
                national frameworks. With glances at the writings of Matthew Arnold, Cardinal
                Newman, F. R. Leavis, and Allan Bloom, the class is able to perceive the resiliency
                of the models of culture we have been tracing throughout the term. But in equally
                compelling glances at a variety of statements on culture taken from our university’s
                promotional literature (and duplicated, no doubt, at any current institution of
                higher learning), we are able to witness the evacuation of culture as a site of
                meaning under pressure from the corporate discourse of excellence which Readings so
                brilliantly critiques. Arguing that the logic of culture is inextricable from the
                rise and fall of the nation-state and the modern university, Readings helps situate
                the practice as well as the subject of the class within historical and institutional
                parameters.</p>
            <p>What are the advantages of this approach to the teaching of Romanticism over some of
                the more exclusively British models in which many of us have been trained and which
                this selection of essays aims to widen if not critique? Besides the very real
                problem of literary provincialism, a problem only partially and imperfectly
                addressed by the inclusion of French, German, and American works, I would argue that
                the sampling of Romantic literature I offer my students is more representative of
                the historical phenomenon itself, emphasizing as it does works whose influence
                spread throughout Europe and the wider world far more so than the writings of many
                other poets, essayists, and novelists typically included in anthologies of Romantic
                literature. From a European perspective, it is Rousseau, Goethe, and Byron who
                constitute fountainheads of Romantic expression. It is Schiller and Staël who
                articulate through literary and critical works the profound traumas of the
                revolution, and it is Ossian who offers a new aesthetic for poets, a tradition of
                “ethnopoetics” whose relation to the equally vibrant experimental strain of
                nineteenth-century poetries can be traced wonderfully through the use of Jerome
                Rothenberg and Jeffrey C. Robinson’s <title level="m">Poems for the Millennium,
                    Volume Three: The University of California Book of Romantic and Postromantic
                    Poetry</title>. Furthermore, by exploring Romanticism as imbricated within a modern
                logic of culture, students can appreciate it as an influential response to social
                and intellectual transformations still unfolding in the present day. Hard choices of
                selection are always necessary. What I have tried to outline in this essay is a
                combination of texts and approaches that I have found to work well in the advanced
                undergraduate classroom. They offer students a compelling survey of European
                Romanticism while offering instructors a provocative challenge to reimagine this
                exciting moment in literary history.</p>
