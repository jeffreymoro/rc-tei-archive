                <p rend="noCount">This essay distills the experience of teaching an upper-division
                    English course entitled <title level="a">An Introduction to Global Romanticisms.</title> This class
                    focused on one text over the course of the semester – Jerome Rothenberg and
                    Jeffrey Robinson’s experimental anthology <title level="m">Poems for the Millennium Volume 3: The
                    University of California Book of Romantic &amp; Postromantic Poetry</title>. This collection
                    attempts to construct a truly global Romantic tradition. In addition to the
                    standard writers of the European Romantic canon, North and South American,
                    Scandinavian, Eastern European, and Asian authors are included here as well. The
                    broad scope of the anthology presents exciting opportunities and challenges.
                    This essay assesses the potential of this volume to reform our teaching of and
                    scholarship about Romanticism, and it briefly articulates a thesis about the
                    “cosmic” dimension of literary texts, which can possibly provide an organizing
                    rubric for engaging with the expansive richness of global Romanticism once
                    conventional formalist and historicist methods are shown to be inadequate for
                    managing its complexity.</p>

                <p>In her book <title level="m">Death of a Discipline</title>, comprised of the
                    Wellek Library Lectures in Critical Theory, Gayatri Spivak implores scholars to
                    “take a step, learning to learn from below, toward imagining planetarity” (100).
                    These types of calls are common in the contemporary era of literary studies as
                    scholars discover how to navigate through a sea of new universalizing
                    terms&#8212;planetarity, planetary, globality, globalism, worldness, worlding,
                    deep time, and transcultural.<note place="foot" resp="author">For a few examples
                        of scholars who develop these terms in powerful ways, see Wai Chee Dimock,
                        R. Radhakrishnan, Pheng Cheah, Amy Elias, Mary Emery, Djelal Kadir,
                        Christian Moraru, and Masao Miyoshi.</note> The mission is clear&#8212;we
                    must create transformative curricula that refuse to mirror and support the
                    hierarchies and inequities of the social world and that engage with the
                    florescence of human creativity within the largest framework possible.</p>
                <p>Yet when it comes to the field of Romanticism, this is a large task indeed.
                    Teaching even a traditional class on European Romanticism would be difficult
                    enough, requiring as it would knowledge of at least the French, German, and
                    English traditions. Yet what would happen if one attempted to construct a truly
                    global Romanticism course, adding to the syllabus North and South American
                    elaborations of Romantic traditions, Scandinavian and Eastern European Romantic
                    episodes, or even a glimpse into various Asian literary developments? While one
                    might, with the best of intentions, want to pursue the laudable goal of
                    “planetarity,” implementing it threatens to push a solitary course past a basic
                    level of coherence and instructors past their areas of expertise and ability.
                    (My own particular areas of expertise are British Romanticism, African-American
                    literature, and nineteenth-century American literature.)</p>
                <p>With the publication in 2009 of volume three of the anthology series <title
                        level="m">Poems for the Millennium</title>, edited by Jerome Rothenberg and
                    Jeffrey Robinson, a new tool has arrived to help scholars and teachers think
                    about how to teach Romanticism from a global perspective. This anthology has a
                    capacious sweep, and it covers a wide range of poetry and poetic manifestos from
                    Europe, Asia, and the Americas. It moves chronologically from “pre-Romantic”
                    figures such as Erasmus Darwin and Christopher Smart down to early modernists
                    like Guillaume Apollinaire. The global reinterpretation of Romanticism on
                    display here is quite stunning, and it is rare to see East Indian, Japanese,
                    Hungarian, and Brazilian poets placed on the same stage. (Every area of the
                    world is represented here, except Australia and Africa.) In the spring of 2011,
                    I taught an upper-division English course at Marquette University entitled
                        <title level="a">An Introduction to Global Romanticisms,</title> which used
                    this collection as the main text of the class. In this essay, I will distill
                    this experience, assess the potential of this volume to reform our teaching of
                    and scholarship about Romanticism, and end with a discussion of how to maintain
                    a sense of the full global possibilities of Romanticism.</p>
                <p>I will begin by describing the larger <title level="m">Poems for the
                        Millennium</title> project. Edited by Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris,
                    the first two volumes are explorations of twentieth-century poetry from the
                    perspective of its many avant-gardes, including movements such as Futurism,
                    Dada, and Expressionism. The first volume moves from the fin-de-siècle to
                    negritude, exploring international modernism in the historical period stretching
                    from 1890 to 1945, while the second tackles poetry from the postwar moment to
                    the millennium. After the focus on Romanticism in the third volume, the fourth
                    volume, edited by Pierre Joris and Habib Tengour, provides a comprehensive
                    overview of the written and oral literatures of North Africa. The series
                    culminates with Rothenberg and John Bloomber-Rissman’s Volume Five, which is
                    subtitled <title level="m">Barbaric Vast &amp; Wild: A Gathering of Outside
                        &amp; Subterranean Poetry from Origins to Present</title>. These texts burst
                    at the seams with an anti-traditionalist and anti-mainstream energy, and they
                    delight in the paradox of attempting to canonize works that aim to be
                    anti-canonical, to conserve the poetic gestures of the self-proclaimed radical.
                    The volumes are boldly attentive to poetic activity happening around the globe,
                    including work from the Vienna Group, the Fluxus artists, the Arabic-language
                    Tammuzi poets, and the Chinese Misty Poets. As such, they emphasize the vitality
                    of global movements and propound an eclectic cosmopolitanism.</p>
                <p>Romanticism was important to the aims of the <title level="m">Poems for the
                        Millennium</title> project from the very beginning. The first volume, for
                    example, opens with a section entitled <title level="a">Prologue to
                        Forerunners,</title> which includes selections from William Blake, Friedrich
                    Hölderlin, and Walt Whitman. In the introduction, the editors take a line of
                    Blake’s&#8212;“poetry fetter’d, fetters the human race”&#8212;as a battle cry
                    and draw a genealogy that traces the emergence of vibrant twentieth-century
                    poetry “out of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment and…the seed-bed of a
                    radical romanticism” (1). In other words, Romanticism is viewed as a central
                    precursor for understanding the various avant-gardes and major poetic work of
                    contemporary times. Volume Three covers work written chronologically before the
                    two volumes that precede it and is therefore a homecoming of sorts, insofar as
                    it gives Rothenberg and Robinson a venue to explore nineteenth-century
                    precursors to poetry movements with which they feel immediate kinship.<note
                        place="foot" resp="author">Throughout the rest of this essay, I will focus
                        on Rothenberg as the major editorial presence behind the <title level="m"
                            >Poems for the Millennium</title> project because he participated in
                        constructing four out of the five anthologies. There is not enough space in
                        the context of this essay to give a full appreciation of the contributions
                        made by Pierre Joris, Jeffrey Robinson, and Habib Tengour to this
                        effort.</note></p>
                <p>The third volume of the <title level="m">Poems for the Millennium</title> opens
                    with a “Preludium” of eighteenth-century figures who set the stage for the
                    romantic movement proper&#8212;such as the Marquis de Sade, Emanuel Swedenborg,
                    Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Erasmus Darwin. According to the book’s introduction,
                    Rothenberg and Robinson were trying to emphasize figures who do not fit into
                    stereotypical visions of the period as one dominated by neo-classicism and
                    melancholy lyric sensibility. The text is then divided into sections called
                    “galleries,” “clusters,” and “books.” There are three galleries of poets
                    chronologically organized with brief biographical commentaries provided after
                    each poet. The first&#8212;featuring poets for the most part born before
                    1800&#8212;stretches from Goethe and Blake to Dionysios Solomos and Aleksander
                    Pushkin. The second contains figures from Victor Hugo and Elias Lonnrot to
                    Swinburne and Mallarmé. This gallery highlights Romanticism’s coming of age, in
                    which it becomes recognized as a coherent movement and begins to develop
                    generational splits and differences, while moving across the Atlantic and all
                    throughout Europe. The final gallery extends from Hopkins and Nietzsche to
                    Yosano Akiko and Apollinaire. This section tracks the movement into a
                    post-Romanticism, featuring early Modernists, pre-Raphaelites,
                    Transcendentalists, <foreign xml:lang="sp">modernistas</foreign>, <foreign
                        xml:lang="fr">poètes maudits</foreign>, and Symbolists.</p>
                <p>These sections follow the standard anthology format, and in truth, most figures
                    covered here could be found in mainstream anthologies such as <title level="m"
                        >The Norton Anthology of World Literature</title>. (There are only about ten
                    people included in <title level="m">Poems for the Millennium Vol. 3</title>
                    [henceforth <title level="m">PFM3</title>] that one
                    could not find in there.) The major difference is that some of the continental
                    lyricists featured in the <title level="m">Norton</title>&#8212;such as Anna
                    Bunina, Rosalía de Castro, and Gustavo Bécquer&#8212;are removed in favor of
                    nationalist icons&#8212;like the Polish Cyprian Norwid and Cuban José
                    Martí&#8212;and figures writing in local dialects difficult to
                    translate&#8212;such as the Italian Giuseppe Belli, which gives <title level="m">PFM3</title> a more overtly political and
                    anti-conventional slant.</p>
                <p>Inside of each of these three galleries, <title level="m"
                            >PFM3</title> includes a small cluster of poems organized around
                    a theme. The first, <title level="a">Some Asian Poets,</title> tracks the work
                    of a few groundbreaking poets writing from various Asian locations in the
                    nineteenth century&#8212;such as Kobayashi Issa (Japan), Ho Xuan Huong
                    (Vietnam), Bibi Hayati (Iran), and Wu Tsao (China). It is a quick survey of
                    figures working on a track parallel to the mainstream “Romantic” movement, but
                    not really in dialogue with it (except in the case of the Indian poet
                    Rabindranath Tagore).</p>
                <p>The next unit, <title level="a">Some Outsider Poets,</title> seeks to take
                    account of para-literary activity happening outside of the sanction of the
                    official literary purview, hegemonic literary institutions, or dominant means of
                    production/distribution. Featured in this section are figures such as Raifteiri
                    the Poet, a bard writing in Irish/Gaelic; James Reuben, author of an 1880
                    history of the Nez Percé nation; and the politically radical poet Thomas
                    Cooper.</p>
                <p><title level="a">Some Orientalisms,</title> the final cluster, corresponds quite
                    nicely with the first unit, and it works to explode the myth of a static “Asia”
                    untouched by cultural development and locked into a stultifying “tradition.”
                    This section highlights creative work influenced by the opening of the “East”
                    due to the machinations of nineteenth-century colonialism, work that is often at
                    odds with colonial premises. Selections from works like Goethe’s <title
                        level="m">Arabian Ballad</title>, Lord Byron’s <title level="m">The
                        Giaour</title>, Victor Segalen’s <title level="m">Stelae</title>, and Hugo’s
                        <title level="m">Les Orientales</title> are included.</p>
                <p><title level="m">PFM3</title> also includes two sections
                    called “books” that are placed in between the three galleries. Like the
                    clusters, the <title level="a">Book of Origins</title> and the <title level="a"
                        >Book of Extensions</title> forego chronological organization and exhibit a
                    collection of texts that transforms conventional opinion about Romanticism’s
                    relationship with the poetic past while demonstrating the projection of an
                    experimental poetic future. Jerome Rothenberg is most well-known for his work
                    with the concept of ethnopoetics, which describes the study of various types of
                    global folk poetry, oral literature, ceremonial and ritual speech, and mythic
                    tales and draws deeply from disciplines such as linguistics and
                        anthropology.<note place="foot" resp="author">See Jerome and Diane
                        Rothenberg.</note> The <title level="a">Book of Origins</title> allows
                    Rothenberg to emphasize this element of his poetic interests by taking into
                    account three categories of texts: texts rediscovered and/or translated by the
                    modern West in the nineteenth century (e.g., <title level="m">Pistis
                        Sophia</title>, <title level="m">The Egyptian Book of the Dead</title>,
                        <title level="m">The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</title>); examples of folk
                    poetry alive in the nineteenth century (e.g., Negro Spirituals); and
                    transcriptions of lengthy oral traditions prepared by nineteenth-century
                    folklore collectors and others (e.g., Daniel Brinton’s <title level="m">Rig Veda
                        Americanus</title>, the Navajo <title level="m">Night Chant</title>).</p>
                <p>Rothenberg is also a practicing poet, and in collections like <title level="m"
                        >White Sun Black Sun</title> he plays with syntax, image, and form in ways
                    that place him in line with what he would call a “radical and experimental
                    modernism,” or an “avant-garde” tradition (<title level="m">PFM3</title> 3). In
                    the <title level="a">Book of Extensions,</title> he and Robinson highlight a
                    range of visual, performative, and conceptual work not normally associated with
                    Romanticism but rather as an important starting point for twentieth-century
                    poetic practice. Particularly important in this section are poetic techniques
                    such as the interaction of image and text in Blake’s <title level="m"
                        >Laocoön</title>, the typographical play of Lewis Carroll’s <title level="m"
                        >Concrete Poem: A Mouse</title>, and the use of phonetic syllables in August
                    Strindberg’s sound poem <title level="m">Holy Trinity Night: The Nightingale’s
                        Song</title>.</p>
                <p>Finally, <title level="m">PFM3</title> closes with a section of manifestos and
                    statements of poetics, with excerpts taken from texts ranging from Schlegel’s
                        <title level="m">Athenaeum Fragment 116</title> to Goethe’s <title level="m"
                        >Toward a World Literature</title> and from Whitman’s <title level="m"
                        >Preface to Leaves of Grass</title> to Victor Hugo’s <title level="m"
                        >Preface to Cromwell</title>. The book closes with ambitious statements of
                    guiding principles and projects that still resonate in the present day.</p>
                <p>As one can see, the breadth of the project is astounding. Without a doubt, this
                    text helps one take quite a step toward imagining planetarity. Not only is there
                    a geographically expansive selection of writers presented here to make the case
                    for Romanticism as a worldwide movement, but there is also a recontextualization
                    of familiar “major” writers, an introduction of so-called “minor” writers, an
                    attempt to highlight working-class, women, and politically engaged writers, and
                    selections organized by theme (in addition to chronology) that force one to
                    expand one’s definition of Romanticism. Yet in solving one problem in
                    constructing courses in global Romanticism&#8212;the problem of actually
                    assembling readings from all over the world&#8212;<title level="m">PFM3</title>
                    raises another issue just as major: is there an ideal framework that can be used
                    (by either the editors or teachers using this anthology) to coherently present
                    and order the riches of the material given?</p>
                <p>In full disclosure, this is the first literature course I had taught after a
                    graduate-student career of teaching composition courses, so I was fresh with the
                    ambition (and possibly naiveté) of wanting to tackle “the globe” in the
                    classroom. The first thing I immediately realized when organizing a course
                    around this book is that I would not be able to cover the entire text. It
                    contains over 950 pages of poetry! Given the limitations of the semester, one
                    has to make selections and condense material into a palatable size. There were
                    only 14 full weeks of instruction, and in the three galleries alone, over 50
                    poets are presented, with more to be found in the other “clusters” and “books.”
                    I decided to make the course reading intensive, forgoing long essay assignments
                    for short reading quizzes (in addition to a midterm and final) in order to
                    expose the students to as much of this material as possible. This is why the
                    class was entitled an <title level="a">Introduction to Global
                        Romanticisms,</title> because I knew that even with providing glimpses of
                    approximately fifty writers, I could not do much more than scratch the surface.
                    My syllabus is attached to this article for those who would like to see on a
                    day-to-day basis how the class was organized (<ref
                        target="http://www.romantic-circles.org/pedagogies/commons/global/pedagogies.commons.2020.global.appendixC.html"
                        >Appendix C</ref>).</p>
                <p>The question of canonization&#8212;always a persistent one in English
                    departments&#8212;becomes even more acute in the struggle to construct a global
                    syllabus. Based on what criteria does one choose or exclude? Rothenberg and
                    Robinson never fully address this question, and they use the introduction to
                    take up a polemic against the work of Harold Bloom, the critic who is probably
                    most synonymous with the question of canonization and to whom Rothenberg has
                    devoted a much longer and nastier critique (involving the comparison of Bloom
                    and Joseph Mengele) elsewhere.<note place="foot" resp="author">See Rothenberg
                        2008.</note> Rothenberg and Robinson say, “It is our desire in fact to
                    embrace as much of the poetic past as we can and to repudiate in so doing that
                    ‘anxiety of influence’ (H. Bloom) that would separate us (against our finer
                    instincts) from our fellow poets” (8). However, I can imagine that Bloom would
                    respond, as he does in his book <title level="m">The Western Canon</title>, “The
                    overpopulation of books (and authors) brought about by the length and complexity
                    of the world’s recorded history is at the center of canonical dilemmas, now more
                    than ever” (491). When one strips away much of Bloom’s bombastic rhetoric, one
                    can see the value in his list of criteria for canonical stature&#8212;“mastery
                    of figurative language, originality, cognitive power, knowledge, exuberance of
                    diction” (<title level="m">Western Canon</title> 27–28)&#8212;which is elsewhere
                    shortened to “aesthetic splendor, intellectual power, wisdom” (<title level="m"
                        >Wisdom</title> 5). Rothenberg and Robinson’s criterion for selection, on
                    the other hand, revolves around drawing a “fundamental, systematic continuity”
                    between “the most vital strain of nineteenth-century poetry and the Modernism
                    and avant-gardism of the twentieth century” (3), or in other words emphasizing
                    connections between Romantic poetry and the contemporary poetry movements most
                    closely aligned to Rothenberg’s own mode of poetry writing. This, as I will
                    explain, has very peculiar consequences.</p>
                <p>In determining what elements of the book to not include at all, I decided to
                    remove whole sections that, while interesting, were sure to cause pedagogical
                    problems. Many students came into the class not knowing the difference between
                    even Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, and if they in general do not have a good
                    grasp on “insider poets,” if non-conformist figures like these can be called
                    that, what is the value of studying <title level="a">Some Outsider
                        Poets?</title> Admittedly, the institution of “literature” is a precarious
                    one, constructed by a variety of ideological factors, but it is bizarre to ask
                    students to challenge a category with which they have very little
                    familiarity.</p>
                <p>Along the same lines, the section <title level="a">Some Orientalisms</title>
                    seemed to lend itself to a too easy deployment of a term for which students have
                    not been fully prepared. It is extremely difficult to study Orientalism in any
                    real detail when one is given a quick sweep of poets from different nations,
                    language traditions, and political vantage points responding to the historically
                    shifting idea of “Asia” and more specific locales such as China, Arabia, and
                    India.</p>
                <p>Out of the three “clusters,” therefore, I only chose to keep <title level="a"
                        >Some Asian Poetics.</title> This was the section that made the most direct
                    intervention into the question of how to construct a global Romanticism by
                    reaching out to an area of the world rarely considered under this rubric. The
                    Asian poetics section is probably one of the most unique characteristics of the
                    book, yet of course it presented its own round of pedagogical difficulties, as
                    it almost stretches the term “Romanticism” to its breaking point. Rothenberg and
                    Robinson define the “romantic” as a concept referring “less to a historical
                    period and more to a quality of poetic intention&#8212;a visionary, expansive,
                    at times comic/ironic quickening of impulse and mind that can lead beyond poetry
                    to the larger world” (5–6). It refers to a set of “vital energies” that “counter
                    the perceived narrowness of vision and language imposed upon persons by
                    hegemonic and repressive societies then and now” (7).</p>
                <p>This definition, broad though it is, was the only thread joining the poets in
                    this section together. The figures featured here, from Japan, Vietnam, China,
                    India, and Persia, produced work stretching from the late eighteenth century
                    into the early twentieth. They wrote in completely different forms&#8212;from
                    haiku to lu-shih and tz’u&#8212;occupied different social positions, and
                    responded to varying cultural and historical situations. This section, as it is
                    probably not hard to imagine, frustrates standard pedagogical methodologies, be
                    they formalist or historicist. First of all, it is difficult to perform nuanced
                    formal readings of excerpts of texts, much less of texts translated from
                    languages drastically different from English. Furthermore, it is close to
                    impossible to reproduce the history of such as wide group of countries for the
                    purpose of contextualizing poets, as well as situating poems in the contexts of
                    a poet’s wider career.</p>
                <p>This move to the global, therefore, forces one to compensate for the loss of
                    these familiar tools. It does so by provoking the realization that literary
                    texts possess a dimension of meaning that could be called the “cosmic,” which
                    stretches beyond the formal and sociohistorical, although the latter dimensions
                    have garnered the greatest focus in literary studies. The word “cosmic” often
                    makes positivist and resolutely secular intellectuals sneer, but one can define
                    it simply as a trans-personal, trans-social ordering structure that cannot be
                    reduced to personal fantasy or projection on one hand, or the work of political
                    ideology on the other. It is the realm that exists, in Bibi Hayati’s words,
                    “before there was a hint of civilization,” and it is invoked in Rabindranath
                    Tagore’s phrase “heaven of freedom” (288, 291). Exploring the cosmic dimension
                    of literary texts&#8212;outside the realm of formal conventions, individual
                    psyches, and historical movements&#8212;helped add substance to Rothenberg and
                    Robinson’s definition of the “romantic” as a “visionary, expansive quickening of
                    impulse and mind that leads beyond poetry to the larger world,” where the larger
                    world comes to mean even the universe beyond the earth itself.</p>
                <p>Centralizing “the cosmic” as a guiding hermeneutic made it easy to incorporate
                    the <title level="a">Book of Origins</title> into the syllabus, as many of the
                    texts&#8212;such as <title level="m">The Night Chant</title> and <title
                        level="m">The Yarjurveda</title>&#8212;are overtly ritualistic in nature and
                    aim to access levels of reality transcending the mundane. Furthermore, my own
                    research focuses on the influence of ancient Egypt and various hermetic
                    traditions on the Romantic period, so this section provided an opportunity to
                    walk students through texts with which I was more familiar, such as <title
                        level="m">The Egyptian Book of the Dead</title> and the <title level="m"
                        >Pistis Sophia</title>. However, this section also brought up questions
                    about Rothenberg and Robinson’s construction of a Romantic tradition. For
                    example, Wallis Budge did not translate the <title level="m">Book of the
                        Dead</title> until 1895, the very end of the nineteenth century. In what
                    respect, then, can Rothenberg and Robinson position this work as a Romantic
                    achievement or source text, other than the fact that it falls between a
                    pre-given structure of dates? It did not start to wield a large influence until
                    the work of early modernists like Joyce, Pound, and later figures such as
                    Lawrence Durrell. Again, it seems that Rothenberg and Robinson are stretching
                    the term Romanticism to a point of incoherence, which is not helped by the fact
                    none of the texts in this section are accompanied by any commentary which would
                    situate them in any respect, leaving the instructor to puzzle alone over how to
                    create coherent conversations about Scottish ballads, Aztec hymns, Welsh
                    folktales, and Sanskrit translations. Marching through this plethora of texts
                    brought so much battle fatigue that by the end of the semester, I decided to
                    remove the <title level="a">Book of Extensions</title> section from the syllabus
                    altogether and drastically condense the <title level="a">Manifestos and
                        Poetics</title> in order to have a series of review sessions.</p>
                <p>The bulk of the class was spent reading through the galleries filled with poets
                    from Goethe to Apollinaire. In trying to winnow these down to a manageable size
                    (if reading over fifty poets in a semester can be called manageable), I tried to
                    keep Bloom’s criteria in mind&#8212;“aesthetic splendor, intellectual power,
                    wisdom”&#8212;but I did not have time to finish reading the entire anthology
                    before teaching with it, which will likely be the fate of most teachers of
                    global literature. Therefore, the goal became to include writers from as many
                    different countries as possible. Although I had never read or taught Sandor
                    Petofi before, he ended up on the syllabus as the representative of Hungary.
                    Rubén Darío (Nicaragua) and Sigbjørn Obstfelder (Norway) were other national
                    representatives. Often, I had to delete other authors for the same reason.
                    Because I wanted to focus on the French Symbolist line of Baudelaire, Mallarmé,
                    and Rimbaud, I felt comfortable removing Jules Laforgue and Joseph Joubert.
                    Great Britain was very well represented in this anthology, so I chose to cut
                    figures like John Clare, Thomas de Quincey, and Dorothy Wordsworth. As much as I
                    wanted to take out Lord Byron, as I am more interested in vatic than satiric
                    strains of Romanticism, it did not make sense to do so, especially given his
                    international influence. Removing him would have made discussions of others such
                    as Aleksandr Pushkin and Adam Mickiewicz quite difficult.</p>
                <p>Yet as an organizing principle, trying to cover a spread of nations was certainly
                    random, as the anthology frustrates these and many other types of ordering
                    moves. The writers are all presented in chronological order, so it is difficult
                    for students to get a sense of the development of national traditions in
                    relationship to the global. Even now the class is over, I am sure that the
                    majority of the students do not remember that Leopardi is Italian, Kierkegaard
                    is Danish, and so on. If Rothenberg and Robinson had provided a simple chart of
                    everyone’s nationality, or even a timeline of the publishing of major works,
                    that would have helped tremendously.</p>
                <p>While being attentive to the issue of representing voices from all over the
                    world, I also wanted to be sensitive to including the voices of women. Several
                    canonical Western women were included in this survey: de Staël, Dickinson,
                    Browning, Rossetti, Stein, Shelley, and Lady Guest. Mary Robinson, Dorothy
                    Wordsworth, and Adah Menken were the only women of European descent highlighted
                    in the anthology who were not in the syllabus. All of the Asian women excerpted
                    in <title level="m">PFM3</title> were added to the syllabus: Yosano Akiko, Bibi
                    Hayati, Wu Tsao, and Ho Xuan Huong.</p>
                <p>At the risk of sounding repetitive, Rothenberg and Robinson’s definition of
                    Romanticism becomes quite hazy as the galleries unfold. For example, the poet
                    Arno Holz is included, although he is typically known as the first important
                    German theorist of naturalism. The major innovation of his major poem <title
                        level="m">Phantasus</title> is that all of the lines are typographically
                    centered. Rothenberg and Robinson turn to Friedrich Kittler’s <title level="m"
                        >Discourse Networks</title>, 1800/1900 for commentary: “What the verses have
                    in view, then, are not readers and their understanding, but eyes and their
                    psychophysics, in other words…Holz’s <title level="m">Phantasus</title>, rather
                    than addressing fantasy as the surrogate of all senses in the finest romantic
                    manner, reckons with unconscious optokinetics” (835). If Holz moves away from
                    the “finest romantic manner,” in what respect can he be seen as an example of
                    Romanticism? It does not help that Rothenberg and Robinson add in the
                    introduction that “we wish to blur the distinctions of Romantic and Postromantic
                    as much as to insist on them” (7). Moves like this seem to make Romanticism
                    signify everything written in the extended nineteenth century, in contradiction
                    to the earlier definition provided of the romantic as a quality of poetic
                    intention.</p>
                <p>Taking into account all these considerations and creating a syllabus after making
                    a large number of cuts, I still ended up with about four new writers on the
                    syllabus for each class meeting. (Classes were held every Tuesday and Thursday
                    for an hour and 15 minutes). The problem with this kind of organization is
                    obvious. For one, you completely overwhelm students who do not have any sense at
                    all of literary history. The most ridiculous effort was trying to use one class
                    period to speak about the Frenchmen Victor Hugo and Gérard de Nerval, the
                    Brownings (Robert and Elizabeth), and Thomas L. Beddoes. Admittedly, some weeks
                    were just a complete blur.</p>
                <p>Attempting to survey the globe is demanding&#8212;for students and instructors. I
                    cannot say that I am an expert in Norwegian poetry, Finnish creation myth, and
                    haiku, yet I found myself in the strange position of having to mediate these
                    texts for students with no help. The major struggle of teaching a global
                    literature class is how to balance coverage with depth, and one has to be
                    prepared to spend hours figuring out how to achieve that balance. One of the
                    major disadvantages of <title level="m">PFM3</title> is that there is no
                    teaching apparatus analogous to what might be found in other anthologies such as
                    the Norton or Broadview&#8212;no annotations of unclear terms, no
                    bibliographies, no helpful charts or maps, no hints about classroom strategies
                    or topics for discussion and writing, etc. Furthermore, the presentation of
                    material is often distressing. In a section of excerpts from Blake’s <title
                        level="m">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</title>, for example, there
                    is no editorial note to tell the reader which poems are of “innocence” and which
                    are of “experience,” and they are mixed together. In the Rimbaud section, poems
                    from <title level="m">A Season in Hell</title> and <title level="m"
                        >Illuminations</title> were jumbled without hints for new readers.</p>
                <p>I attempted to turn this lack of an editorial apparatus into an opportunity for
                    teaching. For written work, I assigned biweekly assignments, where the students
                    were responsible for writing lists of discussion questions for each writer
                    covered and creating an annotated list of unfamiliar allusions and vocabulary.
                    And as I removed readings from the syllabus toward the end of the semester to
                    help us all maintain our sanity, I assigned presentations requiring students to
                    organize a discussion of three writers around a given theme.</p>
                <p>Yet in addition to this lack of an editorial apparatus, the major difficulty of
                    using this text for teaching is its very specific frame and agenda for
                    interpreting global Romanticism. Rothenberg and Robinson’s goal here is to
                    redefine Romanticism so that it becomes a precursor to a very partisan
                    definition of “experimental modernism,” and to turn to Bloomian terminology
                    again, this is a very creative misreading. Rothenberg and Robinson privilege
                    texts that rely heavily on stylistic fragmentation, collage/montage techniques,
                    engagement with nonsense, obscure uses of grammar and syntax, the deprivileging
                    of the lyric self, opaque textures, and discontinuous typography. In effect,
                    Romanticism is portrayed as an artistic movement that leads directly to the work
                    of Ezra Pound.</p>
                <p>This is not an exaggeration, and one can turn to any number of the commentaries
                    to see Pound as the spectral influence behind this collection, which is
                    especially odd given Pound’s many broadsides against the movement. One can
                    return to Rothenberg and Robinson’s commentary on Arno Holz for a first example:
                    “Increasingly experimental in his later writings (<title level="m"
                        >Phantasus</title> would expand to 60,000 lines by 1925 &amp; show a
                    Pound-like ambition to write a ‘<emph>Weltgedicht: a Nuova-Divinia</emph> after
                    Dante or <emph>Über-Odysee</emph> after Homer’), he reemerges today as a still
                    vital linking figure across the nineteenth- &amp; twentieth-century divide”
                    (835). And instead of focusing on the highly readable and teachable odes and
                    elegies of a figure like Friedrich Hölderlin, Rothenberg and Robinson choose to
                    emphasize severely fragmented works like the late palimpsestic <title level="m"
                        >Columbus</title>, from which I confess I could not draw any meaning,
                    especially given that the reader is only presented an excerpt from an already
                    incomplete piece. Rothenberg and Robinson quote the translator Richard Sieburth:
                    “The French phrases [in <title level="m">Columbus</title>] that punctuate the
                    text in Poundian fashion may be snippets overheard in the ports of Bordeaux
                    during Hölderlin’s residence in that city” (159). As a final (but not the last)
                    example, the Brazilian poet Sousandrade’s <title level="m">O Guesa
                        Errante</title>, which follows a legendary figure of the Colombian Muisca
                    Indians into the inferno of nineteenth-century Wall Street, is said to be “a
                    forerunner of EP’s Cantos and of many other modern poets” (663).</p>
                <p>Since Rothenberg and Robinson work with the dictum that “experiments in form
                    often equate to, or imply the possibility of, social and spiritual/mental
                    transformations” (17), centralizing Pound in this way allows Rothenberg and
                    Robinson to wage a mimic war between those “radicals” that experiment with form
                    and the “conservatives” who work in traditional boundaries, between innovators
                    who favor the “playful, proliferating” Fancy and reactionaries who turn toward
                    the “synthetic, disinterested” Imagination (8). It is never made clear how
                    formal radicalism is related to political radicalism, and this polemic is not
                    only distracting, but it muddles the presentation of the material, as I will
                    show.</p>
                <p>It is not a surprise that the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz was chosen for this
                    anthology. He almost fits a profile&#8212;he was directly involved in all sorts
                    of political intrigues and battles for independence and also the creator of a
                    nationalist epic (<title level="m">Pan Tadeusz</title>). An excerpt of that text
                    from Donald Davie’s “transcreation” is provided in <title level="m">PFM3</title>:

                        </lg>
                    </quote> From Kress’ translation, one can more clearly see that the poem is an
                    epic in the mode of Byron and Pushkin, not a work of (proto)modernist
                    fragmentation. If one is trying to give a quick overview of Mickiewicz in a
                    survey of global literature, the latter translation is demonstrably better for
                    giving a flavor of his style, tone, and rhetorical stance. If Davie’s
                    translation is “radical,” then “radicalism” is a project verging on willful
                    incoherence, one that does a great disservice in the classroom. How rewritings
                    of this sort hasten spiritual or social transformation is quite beyond me,
                    unless the transformation is alienating a potential audience for poetry even
                    more. These types of problematic translations are found throughout the book,
                    with the next most egregious example being Robin Blaser’s translations of Gérard
                    de Nerval.</p>
                <p>Rothenberg and Robinson’s fetishization of “radicalism” is also tied to an
                    ideology of collectivism that runs throughout this anthology and others that
                    Rothenberg has produced. In the introduction to his <title level="m">America a
                        Prophecy: A New Reading of American Poetry from Pre-Columbian Times to the
                        Present</title>, Rothenberg says: “our general intention has been to show
                    modes of poetry rather than individual poets, and any reader who takes what
                    follows as an attempt to draw up definitive lists of poets or to chart
                    chronologies of careers will have missed one of the fundamental premises of this
                    anthology” (xxxvi). (Even in this earlier project, the Romantic influence was
                    strong. The title comes from a William Blake poem.) Following this same goal in
                        <title level="m">Poems for the Millennium Volume Three</title>, Rothenberg
                    attempts to decenter the individual poet to think about Romanticism not only as
                    an international, but as a collective movement. There are many sophisticated
                    philosophical positions supporting this stance which I cannot explore here in
                    depth, and I do recognize the powerful tradition of critiques launched against
                    orthodox constructions of the modern bourgeois individual. However, I want to
                    point to the difficulty of teaching “modes of poetry” rather than “individual
                    poets.” Granted, this might simply be a sign of my lack of seasoned teaching,
                    but I found that I could not devise methods of teaching, creating assignments
                    on, and crafting assessments based on students’ grasp of modes of poetry, rather
                    than modes of poetry as concretized by specific figures in specific texts. In
                    reality, what this decentering of the individual seemed to amount to was having
                    a poet’s work spread throughout different sections. Poems by William Blake, for
                    example, were included in the <title level="a">Preludium,</title>
                    <title level="a">First Gallery,</title>
                    <title level="a">Book of Origins,</title>
                    <title level="a">Book of Extensions,</title>
                    <title level="a">Some Orientalisms,</title> and <title level="a">Manifestos
                        &amp; Poetics.</title> It seems that a more radical and consistent method of
                    imagining Romanticism as a collective project, one that allows the voice of
                    Poetry itself to speak, would have been to produce an anthology with no names of
                    poets (or editors) listed anywhere.</p>
                <p>All in all, however, this course was a grand “experiment” (to use a favorite
                    Rothenberg and Robinson term) in learning how to imagine planetarity and teach
                    global Romanticism. The class was exciting, but not as successful as I might
                    have hoped. The students were not always kind in their reaction to this
                    demanding and eclectic course. The majority opinion was articulated in the pithy
                    comment: “Intense amount of reading for this class for painfully uninteresting
                    material. Tests are hard.” Thankfully, in the midst of negative feedback, there
                    were a few counter-voices, such as the following: “Doctor Redd’s class was a
                    very challenging, but rewarding one. The material is difficult, but he presents
                    it with an interesting spin. After working a lot, I walk away with an
                    appreciation of the subject matter.”</p>
                <p>I surmise that elements of this course were deemed “intense,” “painfully
                    uninteresting,” “challenging,” and “difficult” for many reasons. Trying to
                    absorb the work of approximately fifty authors writing in vastly different
                    languages, styles, and forms over the course of a semester would be a challenge
                    even for a seasoned literary scholar, so it was unfair to expect that of
                    undergraduates without more of a structure to mediate this material for them.
                    Placing all of these writers on the syllabus seemed (before actually teaching
                    the course) to be an effective way to meet the challenge of presenting the full
                    global panoply of Romantic writing, but the sheer number of writers covered
                    meant that the course discussion could not dive deeply into any particular
                    figure or literary issue. The surface treatment of so many figures possibly
                    hindered the students from developing rich emotional connections to the
                    material, hence their rejection of it as “uninteresting.” This course went to an
                    extreme limit in its ambition to represent the global, and future courses on
                    global Romanticism will have to continue to think about how to balance broad and
                    deep coverage.</p>
                <p>In the last week of teaching this course, I came across David Damrosch’s book
                        <title level="m">What Is World Literature?</title> I was surprised to see
                    him articulate something of my experience with this class and point toward a new
                    direction: <quote> Anthologies have been growing larger and larger, as teachers
                        and publishers have sought to encompass our ever-expanding canon. When we
                        are presenting a single national tradition, there is still a logic to giving
                        some sense of most of the currently acknowledged major authors, particularly
                        as time and space generally allow the inclusion of a range of less-known
                        figures as well. The task becomes impossible with any truly global vision of
                        world literature, and other approaches are plainly needed. At minimum, it
                        takes three points to define a plane surface, and perhaps three works,
                        interestingly juxtaposed and studied with care, can define a literary field.
                        (10) </quote> Damrosch here moves to the opposite extreme from my course.
                    Instead of broadening the syllabus, he calls for a radical stripping down of it.
                    The ideal global romanticism course probably lies between the minimalist
                    approach for which Damrosch advocates and the maximalist approach I pursued.
                    However, working with Damrosch’s “definition of world literature: not a set
                    canon of texts but a mode of reading, a detached engagement with a world beyond
                    our own” (297) will provide a key for building the theoretical infrastructure
                    needed to make teaching global Romanticism a project more coherent than the
                    juxtaposition of wide-ranging texts. This mode of reading might usefully engage
                    with the idea hastily sketched above about a “cosmic” dimension of the literary
                    text&#8212;one that interacts with its formal and sociohistorical dimensions
                    while transcending and not being reducible to them. It is this cosmic dimension
                    that could potentially help us understand nonlocal and nonlinear influences that
                    link seemingly unrelated writers and texts; discover new spiritual, political,
                    and ethical imperatives in our reading of world literature; and proclaim our
                    deep connectedness as a human species, despite boundaries that often assert
                    cultural incommensurability.</p>
                <p>In the seven years since I taught this course in 2011, I have transitioned from a
                    faculty role to an administrative one. I no longer teach, so I write this
                    article to memorialize the thinking and effort that went into constructing this
                    course, an experiment that I hope other scholars of global Romanticism will take
                    up after me. I offer this course’s chaos and idiosyncrasies, yet also its
                    potential, daring, and boundary breaking.</p>
