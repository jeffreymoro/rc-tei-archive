                <p rend="noCount">This essay outlines a media adaptation exercise
                    instructors can use to investigate the role of the Romantic subject or the lyric
                    “I” in this latest phase of geological time, the Anthropocene. As a test case,
                    it focuses on the overlooked lyrical ballad, Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Written 
                        in Germany.</title> It explores terms for analyzing media 
                    and media adaptations in the classroom. It
                    investigates how media adaptations can lay bare the rhetoric of the first-person
                    perspective and the philosophical implications of the self’s relationship to
                    nature. Last, it situates the Romantic-era subject within a broader historical
                    and ecological context, and it considers the centered, first-person perspective
                    in relation to marginalized perspectives and the “view from nowhere.” The essay
                    concludes with the importance of allowing shifting perspectives to migrate
                    across multiple media.</p>

            <p>In a discussion of Alan Weisman’s <title level="m">The World Without Us</title> 
                (2007), Dipesh Chakrabarty writes that historians now
                    find themselves in a paradoxical moment where the tools used for reflecting on
                    the past may no longer aid us in thinking about the future. If the end of human
                    existence, or something close to it, is a future on the horizon, it requires
                    that “we [historians] insert ourselves into a future ‘without us’ in order to
                    visualize it” (197–98). By “visualizing” it, Chakrabarty may refer to the graphs
                    and figures that historians use to spatialize events occurring over time. A
                    history of the formal visualization of history would likely begin in the
                    eighteenth century with Joseph Priestley (1733–1804), who was, according to
                    Rosenberg and Grafton, “the first to lay out systematic principles for the
                    translation of historical data into a visual medium” (116). Indeed, Priestley’s
                    maps of time, and others like it, were dramatically changing the image of humans
                    in history.</p>
            <p>But visualizations of history may also refer to human
                    relations, if not in a world without us, then perhaps in a postapocalyptic world
                    where humans have been reduced to oral culture or no culture at all. In the
                    Anthropocene, a term coined by Paul J. Crutzen and Eugene F. Stoermer to
                    indicate the planetary stage from 1750 to the present, humans have become
                    geological agents, and with this agency it has become increasingly clear that
                    the relatively hospitable environment of the Holocene could be replaced by the
                    relatively inhospitable “desert of the real.” Indeed, <title level="m">The 
                        Matrix</title> (1999), from which the quote is taken, along with other 
                postapocalyptic films like Chris Marker’s <title level="m">La Jetée</title>
                (1962) and Christopher Nolan’s <title level="m">Interstellar</title> (2014), have 
                already provided images of human relations on the brink of total annihilation. Yet 
                the maturation of these more artistic visualizations and their rhetorical implications 
                can be traced back to the late eighteenth century and the postapocalyptic imagery of 
                Romanticism.</p>
            <p>The historical narrative of our mediated relationship to the planet is more significant 
                today in the age of global warming. It is important because the various media through 
                which humans can know the conditions of the earth might ultimately determine our species’ 
                place on it. Yet a pernicious skepticism with respect to climate science (second only to 
                capitalist greed) continues to impede global measures towards curbing the human 
                destruction of a habitable planet. Can the origin of this current skepticism also be 
                located in the Romantic period? While Romanticism can be characterized by what Kevis 
                Goodman refers to as an emerging “medium consciousness,” which shared an almost parallel 
                rise with what James McKusick calls the “[invention] of ‘human ecology,’” the same period 
                also emphasizes local and subjective beliefs that render scientific data about the 
                earth’s conditions too “calculating” and “instrumentalist” to be of concern for serious 
                humanistic inquiry.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Goodman traces the emerging medium 
                    consciousness to the seventeenth century, with the convergence of media theory, the 
                    scientific revolution, and a renewed attention to Virgil’s <title 
                        level="m">Georgics</title> (18–20). For McKusick, he points to Wordsworth as “one 
                    of the first” to give rise to human ecology, “if by that phrase we mean the study of 
                    the complex relationships between human communities and their dwelling places” 
                    (70).</note> Of course, the antiscientific understanding of Romanticism is no longer 
                tenable, as has been made clear by numerous studies, like Noel Jackson’s <title 
                    level="m">Science and Sensation in Romantic Poetry</title> (2008) and Theresa 
                Kelley’s <title level="m">Clandestine Marriage: Botany and Romantic Culture</title> (2012), 
                among others. But it is worth asking exactly how the synthesizers of media consciousness 
                and ecology (i.e., Romantic-era authors) parsed out and hierarchized different genres of 
                media and why; how these media shaped the way that that they related to the planet and 
                thereby produced a particular brand of ecology; and how their conclusions can aid 
                visualizations of human relations in the forthcoming age, if they can at all. My aim in 
                the present essay is to outline an exercise for eliciting such an inquiry in the 
                classroom. In short, this essay asks: How can we use media adaptations to teach and 
                reinforce the history of our mediated relationship to the earth in the Anthropocene?</p>
            <p>Numerous studies have recently drawn attention to media in the Romantic period, focusing 
                variously on the mediation of the past (Goodman), present human feelings (Chandler), 
                human relations at a distance (Favret), and the sheer excess of media and information 
                (Langan).<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Goodman’s <title level="m">Georgic 
                    Modernity and British Romanticism</title> (2004), James Chandler’s <title

                    a growing number of articles, collections, and monographs have emphasized the materiality 
                    of artworks and the discussions of media that take place within those texts more 
                    generally, including Miranda Burgess, Alexander Dick, and Michelle Levy’s special issue 
                    of <title level="j">European Romantic Review</title> (2011), Andrew Burkett’s <title 
                        level="m">Romantic Mediations: Media Theory and British Romanticism</title> (2016), 
                    as well as James Brooke-Smith and Andrew Burkett’s edited collection for <title 
                        level="j">Romantic Circles</title>, <title level="m">Multi-Media 
                            Romanticism</title> (2016).</note> Meanwhile, few studies have yet to address 
                the Romantic mediation of the planet as a thing with a particular history extending into 
                the present. Some might object to this warrant’s presentism, a position that has sparked 
                renewed debate.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In their introduction to a special collection 
                    for <title level="j">Victorian Studies</title>, David Coombs and Danielle Coriale make an 
                    appeal for a more “strategic presentism”: “To make presentism a strategy means asking how 
                    presentism might help us better understand and address the ways the past is at work in the 
                    exigencies of the present . . . from the economies of consciousness as a so-called global 
                    workspace to the anthropocene as an epoch whose hallmark, paradoxically, is the radical 
                    compression of the longue durée of geological change” (88). Strategic presentism is not a 
                    call to merely “act <emph>now</emph>.” It is a call to recognize that historical 
                    periods/events—including “the” present—cannot be viewed in a vacuum.</note> The problem is 
                that charges of presentism can be narrowly anthropocentric, and so it should be asked: 
                Presentism according to whom? From the perspective of the planet, the human geological 
                reengineering of its surface is a roughly 300-year-old problem “beginning” with the Industrial 
                Revolution (not counting the thousands of years it took to accumulate the necessary technical 
                know-how). If the present is a problem of perspective and metrics, and the Anthropocene has been 
                and will remain the geological period for some time, even after human existence, then our only 
                recourse to encountering this present is through a mediated—indeed, a very mediated—relationship.</p>
            <p>But it is also productive to revisit Romantic-era writers in discussions of the Anthropocene 
                because they were thinking about the instability of their position on earth, as David Collings 
                and others have demonstrated.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For Collings, eighteenth-century 
                    discourse tended to align “divine intentionality” and “natural design,” while forgetting about 
                    the “transcendental excess” of the biblical deluge, whereas Romanticism turned its attention 
                    to the latter (351).</note> While poems tend to maintain a centered, subjective, personal 
                outlook, there are also moments when the species’ position on the planet is called into question. 
                Accordingly, the first-person perspective might become subordinated to other views; it may become 
                of equal value; or it may be represented as the one and only one in a “last man” scenario. 
                Regardless of the outcome, it is appropriate and timely to reinforce the emphasis on media in 
                Romantic-era texts by introducing an adaptation project that fleshes out our mediated 
                relationship to the planet. And adaptations are important because they encourage students to 
                think critically and creatively about changes to human relationships that adapt with changes to 
                the earth.</p>
            <p>In what follows, I focus on a shorter exercise in which students adapt a lyric poem to a 
                hand-drawn illustration. Of course, other media might seem more obvious. Recently, Stephanie 
                Hershinow has written an instructive essay on selfies and Romantic-era novels in the classroom. 
                At bottom, Hershinow’s essay is a “defense of relatability.” No doubt, the ubiquity of the 
                digital image today helps students relate to the text. But it helps them relate to the text 
                according to today. The purpose of the illustrated adaptation may seem a bit backwards given 
                the emphasis on the current geological epoch. And yet, adapting the poem to an illustration 
                allows students to open a new point of access by transforming something unfamiliar into 
                something rudimentary (indeed, rude), the importance of which cannot be overstated. For if 
                humans are to survive in an age of recurring climate disasters, in barely habitable slums, 
                and with minimal access to resources, digital visualizations might help. More likely, under 
                such grim conditions, maintaining basic tools for thought and communication may become a key 
                feature of teaching/education at any level, because, in short, making pictures might be what 
                is available.</p>
            <p>The goal of the adaptation is to see the source text in a new way that can draw attention to the 
                poem’s details—especially those related to the medium itself—which may be less apparent by 
                reading the poem in its written form only. Through the same process, students will enhance their 
                media literacy; they will investigate a Romantic relationship between the self and nature; and 
                ultimately, they will situate this relationship in a larger history of ecocritical perspectives. 
                It is within this larger history that Romanticism becomes especially useful in the Anthropocene, 
                for it unabashedly raises questions regarding how to orient one’s self in a world without clear 
                markers for orientation, without an indication of one’s dominant (or subordinate) status, or a 
                path leading one beyond any foreseeable horizon. For readers primarily interested in an in-class 
                activity that they can add to their repertoire, I will focus in the first section exclusively on 
                an adaptation exercise with respect to Wordsworth’s “Written in Germany” from <title 
                    level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (1800). In the second section, I will present a vocabulary 
                for interpreting media and media representations in Wordsworth’s poem. The third section focuses 
                on the poem’s depiction of a typical Romantic-era ecocritical perspective: the centered point of 
                view. Last, by offering a brief outline of a class as a whole, I show how a course might locate 
                Wordsworth’s outlook in a broader historical context, bringing the Romantic outlook into contact 
                with views from the Anthropocene that cannot afford to be restricted to the margins.</p>

                <head>Illustrating Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Written in Germany</title></head>
            <p><title level="a">Written in Germany, on One of the Coldest Days of the Century</title> features 
                Wordsworth sitting alone in his cottage, warmed by a stove, and addressing a housefly that 
                mistakes the stove’s heat for the warm weather that has yet to arrive. What follows is a short 
                description of the fly’s predicament in relation to Wordsworth’s situation. It contains a promise 
                that Wordsworth will look after the fly until the coming spring, followed by an apostrophe to a 
                lover, and concludes with a reference to God as the witness guaranteeing the equilibrium of the 
                world (the return of spring). The poem thereby ends with a more optimistic and less ambiguous 
                version of Shelley’s question, “If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?” (70). Between the 
                address to a nonhuman thing and the emphasis on return or recuperation, <title level="a">Written 
                    in Germany</title> certainly belongs to the larger body of Wordsworth’s work on nature. But 
                given the obscurity of the poem and its almost utter absence from literary criticism, why focus 
                on this nature poem?</p>
            <p>While most classes on ecopoetry or ecocriticism are likely to study Wordsworth’s <title 
                    level="a">Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey</title> (1798), pairing it 
                with <title level="a">Written in Germany</title> more adequately demonstrates Wordsworth’s direct 
                engagement with the conditions of the planet:<note place="foot" resp="editors">According to John 
                    Shoptaw, it is the direct engagement with the earth that qualifies Wordsworth’s poem as an 
                    ecopoem. Counter to Shoptaw’s claim that an ecopoem must be “environmental” and 
                    “environmentalist,” Timothy Morton believes that, at bottom, all poetry is ecopoetry 
                    (<title level="m">Ecology Without Nature</title> 79).</note>

                Departing from his pantheistic stance in <title level="a">Tintern Abbey,</title> regarding nature 
                as a motion and a spirit, Wordsworth looks at the earth in <title level="a">Written in 
                    Germany</title> through a Lockean lens. The planet is a body with a lifespan—and it is 
                on a downward trajectory. A course on ecocriticism and textual studies would make much of the 
                fact that the second stanza was included in the poem from 1800–1815, and from this date on 
                it is absent from most collections. One could argue that the later editorial decision as well 
                as the poem’s current online presence overlooks an earlier, more ecocentric version of 
                Wordsworth.</p>
            <p>In the classroom, students can synthesize the many variables of Wordsworth’s poem by illustrating 
                it. When they arrive in class, the desks are clustered together with paper and markers, 
                crayons, and colored pencils. I withhold prefatory remarks, and instead, with the prompts 
                already distributed, I let students jump into the activity. Beginning with the activity is 
                an inductive approach to teaching. It allows students to go “into the field” to create a host 
                of examples, and from these samples their conclusions ensue. If the course is more focused on 
                environmental science (perhaps as part of a literature and science course), this approach can 
                reinforce the rise of inductive reasoning.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On the inductive 
                    method in Romantic-era literature see Smith’s <title level="m">Fact and 
                        Feeling</title> (45–91).</note></p>
            <p>After which, students select a quote from the poem that captures an important part or the 
                “whole” of the image. It is an especially useful step for demonstrating how images and the 
                written word are in conversation with each other. Through various combinations, students can 
                play with literal reinforcements, ironic twists, or juxtapositions. Finally, students share 
                their work, providing an account for why they chose to depict Wordsworth’s poem the way they 
                did, and why they selected this particular quote.</p>
            <p>Administering this exercise on five separate occasions, I have seen an impressive range of 
                variations on Wordsworth’s poem. A typical adaptation includes a poet/speaker figure by a 
                stove inside a cottage. Many of the illustrations place the speaker in the center of the 
                image. The other common variation removes the poet altogether, as if the student were 
                assuming the role of poet describing the cottage, objects, and atmosphere. There is also a 
                significant tendency among students to interpret the poem from an ecocentric 
                standpoint—centering the fly rather than the human narrator.</p>
            <p>The adaptation becomes an exercise in visual rhetoric. The transposition from one medium to 
                another requires students to ask a different set of questions regarding how the objects 
                depicted relate to one another:<note place="foot" resp="editors">By transposition, I mean 
                    transferring an artwork from one medium or genre to another, while maintaining some 
                    fidelity to the original. For a summary of three types of adaptation (transposition, 
                    commentary, and analogue), see Sanders (17–25).</note> Why are some things big and 
                some small, some centered and some marginalized, some outlined and some filled in, some 
                foregrounded and some backgrounded, and some included and some excluded? As students hear 
                the many explanations behind these myriad images, they realize that each iteration 
                convinces audiences of a different message. Some are anthropocentric, some ecocentric; 
                some are optimistic, some pessimistic. Finally, hanging the images together on the wall 
                demonstrates the incredible nuances of the source text and our reading of it. As I say, 
                it is just like in art class: we’re all painting the same bowl of fruit, but the variety 
                of outcomes is nearly infinite.</p>
            <p>The exercise also demonstrates that drawing can be part of the writing process. The 
                illustration provides a foothold allowing students to see the poem as a whole and from 
                multiple perspectives. Plus, drawing in a group setting demonstrates the collaborative 
                nature of reading and writing. Last, because students engage with the poem in a creative 
                register, they gain insight into how artworks are made—namely, by transposing an idea 
                from one medium to another. So, while it may seem like a gratuitous detour, students 
                ultimately arrive at a greater appreciation for the wide range of steps leading to a 
                final product and the individual value of those steps.</p>
            <p>Before entering an extended analysis of the exercise’s significance, I want to point out 
                what is obvious and also the easiest point to miss: if we want to visualize ourselves 
                in the Anthropocene, any picture of the self today already achieves this goal. 
                Twenty-five years ago, I doubt that anyone was drawing this particular Wordsworth 
                poem. And no one was posting images of this poem to Twitter. It is a truism of 
                phenomenology that it is difficult to notice an old medium, or one taken for granted, 
                like a hand-drawn illustration. But technically, once the picture is posted online, 
                that particular combination of media (a digitized illustration) is a relatively recent 
                outlet. The blending of older and newer media can obfuscate not just what we are seeing, 
                but when we are seeing. In other words, visualizing ourselves in a world without us is 
                still a challenge to be addressed, but it is important to bear in mind that we are 
                already visualizing ourselves in the Anthropocene. We could not use these media in this 
                combination without the Anthropocene, and the converse is also true. So, if hand-drawn 
                illustrations of Wordsworth’s poetry strike some as too cute to be taken seriously, 
                consider that their digitized existence on the internet is bound necessarily to the 
                geological reengineering of the planet.</p>

            <p>Conducting media adaptations in the classroom clarifies the content of the source text, 
                but it also draws attention to the media of the source text and its adaptation. To 
                understand the significance of the media involved, it is necessary to provide students 
                with a vocabulary for interpreting how we relate to media and how different mediums 
                relate to one another (“media” and “mediums” are both acceptable plural forms of 
                “medium”).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Also see Goodman on the etymology and 
                    meaning of “medium” (17–20).</note> The <title level="m">OED</title> defines a 
                medium variously as “something which is intermediate . . . a middle state”; an 
                “intermediate agency, instrument, or channel; a means”; a currency or “anything 
                commonly agreed as a token of value and used in transactions”; “any raw material or 
                mode of expression used in an artistic or creative activity”; a “channel of mass 
                communication” or a “physical material (as tape, disk, paper, etc.) used for 
                recording or reproducing data, images or sound”; and, in the natural world, any 
                “intervening substance through which a force acts on objects at a distance or through 
                which impressions are conveyed to the senses.” I tell students to think of the medium 
                as the vehicle for the content (which is really just another medium). Studying media 
                avoids hermeneutic questions like “What does the text mean?” Instead, media studies 
                can ask, “How fast is a text produced/circulated? How many copies are there? And 
                how many audience members can participate at a given time?” In short, media studies 
                describes how literature functions.</p>
            <p>Marshall McLuhan offers two useful terms for describing how media work: “hot” and 
                “cold.” A hot medium is one that provides lots of information that targets multiple 
                senses.<note place="foot" resp="editors">McLuhan actually writes that a hot medium 
                    extends a “single” sense in “high definition,” for instance, a photograph with 
                    many pixels targets sight in particular (36). This side of his definition must 
                    be weighed in the balance with his overall definition: warmer media are immersive 
                    because they enwrap the viewer, thus targeting multiple sense faculties 
                    simultaneously.</note> For instance, the theater of the eighteenth century 
                included moving bodies, spoken language, music, costumes, sets, props, and lights 
                (each one is, of course, a different medium under the sign of “theater”). In such an 
                immersive setting, a case could be made for affecting sound and vision, as well as 
                olfactory and haptic senses. On the other end of the spectrum, a book of poetry is a 
                relatively cold medium. It is ink and paper, read with the eyes and held with the 
                hands. The most important distinction between the two examples is the audience’s 
                level of participation. In the case of the theater, the viewer receives expressions 
                of characters’ faces, the inflections of actors’ voices, and the hues of lights, 
                costumes, and scenery. The theater’s details are determined external to the 
                audience’s subjective perceptions. A written text might describe faces, voices, 
                and environmental appearances, but the reader must mentally determine the output of 
                this information. I tell students, cold media require lots of imagination, while hot 
                media provide all the information “prepackaged.” One student, Dexter Blue, added the 
                compelling idea in a recent class that hotter media require less imagination but an 
                increase in attention: there are fewer blanks to fill in but more details to 
                follow.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For participating in this exercise and 
                    contributing their imaginative thoughts and questions, I would like to thank 
                    Dexter (who gave me permission to include his idea and name) and the rest of 
                    the students in English 200, <title level="a">Ecocritical Perspectives: Genres, 
                        Media, and Narratives,</title> at the University of Washington, Seattle, 
                    winter 2017, plus several sections of Composition 101 that focused on ecopoetry 
                    at Highline College (Des Moines, WA).</note> The more students parse out the 
                nuances of a medium (and its many media), the more complicated the conversation 
                becomes.</p>
            <p>Comparing the poem <title level="a">Written in Germany</title> to an illustration 
                requires a subtle analysis. Students might object: “If we’re only concerned with 
                the medium, then our drawings are no different than the poem.” Indeed, the two 
                artifacts belong to the same medial family: both are ink on paper. But typeface 
                and hand-drawn illustrations vary in terms of style and expression, including 
                texture, color, and movement. These conventions can all be measured in terms of 
                determination. In the majority of printed texts, the type tends to be relatively 
                uniform from copy to copy and even from book to book; when it is not uniform, the 
                typeface calls attention to the written word as a medium (consider the genre of 
                concrete poetry, for example). At which point, the word migrates from a linguistic 
                to a visual modality. So yes, the two media share a great deal. The challenge is 
                dividing them.</p>
            <p>At another level, McLuhan’s terms can also inform students’ understanding of media 
                as represented in the poem. In the last lines of the second stanza, Wordsworth 
                explains that in 1740 the weather was “cutting and rough,” but “<emph>now</emph>,” 
                according to the “glass” (or the thermometer), it is “four degrees lower.” It is 
                a happy coincidence that an exercise on the poem and the “temperature” of its medium 
                includes a thermometer among the poem’s many images. Likely a representative or 
                metonym for “science,” it seems like a cool medium at first: thermometers provide 
                very little information and target only a single sense faculty. Indeed, counter to 
                the theater, scientific instruments tend to belong to a strictly visual field. And 
                unlike the printed text, their strictly quantitative notation system diminishes 
                room for interpretation: 40 degrees is 40 degrees in all times and places (of 
                course, this absolute is a little less than absolute, given the competing scales, 
                Fahrenheit and Celsius, both eighteenth-century inventions). But when determining 
                the “temperature” of a medium (in this case, the thermometer), it is necessary to 
                consider the object in relation to other objects of its time (synchronically) as 
                well as its place within a wider history of media (diachronically).<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">McLuhan touches on the historicity of the media he discusses. 
                    Today, the scope of McLuhan’s study has been expanded to include Siegfried 
                    Zielinski’s concept of “deep time.” Jussi Parikka charts the Anthropocene’s 
                    development from a deep history, namely its “systematic relation to the 
                    carboniferous” (17), to its dystopian present and futurity, in which our 
                    everyday technical objects (laptops, mobile phones, and so forth) add to “a 
                    new future layer of zombie media” (114).</note> In this case, Wordsworth wants 
                the coolness of the technical object to stand in stark contrast to the “excellent 
                stuff” that makes up the planet. And the planet is of an ever-increasing age and 
                an ever-decreasing temperature. Accordingly, the thermometer is technically 
                “hotter” than the earth. The poem thus becomes a debate on scientific media 
                versus natural or ecomedia, where the former (instruments) are becoming 
                increasingly adept at “reading” the latter (planet). It is not the case that 
                Wordsworth’s scientific object actually provides more information or targets 
                more sense faculties than the earth (synchronically), but if he is evaluating them 
                on a scale according to age, then scientific inventions are on the newer, hotter 
                end of the spectrum (diachronically).</p>
            <p>Thus students learn that no medium operates in total isolation. Even the various 
                media in and outside of Wordsworth’s poem maintain a relationship: the planet does 
                feel cooler, which requires a thermometer to measure and a stove to keep warm; the 
                stove allows Wordsworth to remain awake, meditating with his mind and speaking 
                with his voice; we are holding the book documenting this scene; and through the 
                printed words on the page, we are giving voice to Wordsworth’s ideas, very likely 
                with the aid of a light bulb or a screen. McLuhan would say that media alter human 
                relationships—the stove brings humans around the fire, and the lightbulb allows 
                us to have night class. Today, we might say that we are entangled in an “ecology 
                of reading” and the terms “hot” and “cool” can help us measure these 
                relationships—if not precisely, at least in terms that students can readily apply 
                in and outside of the classroom.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For an overview

            <p>The end goal is to help students think about the value of the range of temperatures 
                among different media in the Anthropocene. As literary scholars concerned with the 
                conditions of the planet, there may be a tendency to downplay the value of hot 
                media. After all, they require less imagination, thus diminishing one’s ability to 
                enter another’s perspective. But the downside of a cooler medium may be that 
                visualizing one’s self leads to some pretty solipsistic interpretations of the 
                present or the future. So it is not enough to simply say that cool media are worth 
                more than hot media, for the perspective one embodies in the act of imagining a 
                world can quickly diminish the adequacy of the representation. It may become, in 
                John Keats’ terms, an instance of the egotistical sublime. Accordingly, in an 
                evaluation of media adaptations in the Anthropocene, an analysis of media at play 
                still requires additional modes of inquiry: perspective must also be considered.</p>

            <p>Adapting “Written in Germany” to a visual modality and different media also draws 
                out the poem’s implications for the self or the lyric “I” in relation to nature. 
                The history of the lyric “I” is already tied up with the development of this genre’s 
                medium. With the rise of print culture comes the parallel shift from a public to a 
                private lyric. The material history corresponds with a change internal to the genre, 
                the switch from external address to internal meditation. As Scott Brewster 
                introduces the topic, this turn within the genre represents the dominant form of 
                lyric poetry, and reaches maturity during the Romantic period, at the same time 
                that Wordsworth and his circle “elevate” the poet “who becomes synonymous with the 
                lyric ‘I’” (30, 73). In addition to the dialectic between public and private, 
                Brewster’s study explores additional dichotomies within the lyric: timelessness and 
                history, objectivity and subjectivity, and, what is most important for our purposes, 
                self and nature. Echoing Robert Langbaum, Brewster claims that the lyric “constitutes 
                a blurring of the inner and outer worlds: the self is projected onto external nature, 
                which in turn becomes a mirror that reflects back an image of the self” (84). While 
                it is a convenient way to model the self, in the last decade Timothy Morton has 
                promoted a critique of this binary relationship. For Morton, the ecocritic ought to 
                beware of the Romantic subject showcasing the natural landscape: “Instead of looking 
                at the trees, look at the person who looks at the trees” (125). Morton’s advice is 
                rhetorical; for him, the speaker determines the message. Thus, critics should ask, 
                Who is the figure at the center? How have they come to be determined as a speaking 
                self in the first place? And can the speaker be trusted? An examination of the 
                medium through which this figure is encountered can contribute to answering these 
                questions.</p>
            <p>Because Wordsworth is often depicted in student drawings as a singular individual resting 
                inside a cottage, his position stands in contradistinction to the freezing landscape, 
                which the students make visible by way of a lone window. It is an apt depiction of the 
                “theater of the mind.” This arrangement quickly establishes a division between self and 
                nature, inside and outside, or mind and world. At this stage, students might be 
                introduced to empirical and idealist tendencies in the long eighteenth century. For if 
                everything “outside” the cottage is determined by Wordsworth’s narrator “inside,” the 
                poem seems to maintain the so-called idealist views of George Berkeley, whose influence 
                can be felt in the period from Blake to Byron.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Berkeley 
                    only denies the reality of material substance. In its place, he espouses the 
                    existence of God or a spiritual mind independent of human thought. Accordingly, 
                    Berkeley’s theories can be regarded as idealist, but his idealism is not 
                    antirealist. As Paul Redding points out, it is rather a brand of “spiritual 
                    realism” (3–4).</note> An empirically based idealism calls into question any 
                certainty with respect to objects “outside” of one’s thoughts. The appeal of such a 
                philosophy is the stability it lends to the self. The problem is the instability it 
                lends to everything else. In addition to centering the narrator, the students’ images 
                continue to bolster the poem’s latent idealism by “flattening” the entire poem onto a 
                single page or domain, with only a window to indicate something beyond the medium.</p>
            <p>Yet the self-contained image of the lyric “I” is often disturbed in literature by a 
                nonhuman intervention. In Wordsworth’s case, a fly happens upon the scene and tiptoes 
                across the stove’s hot iron surface. In literature more generally, Morton explains, 
                the introduction of a nonhuman other destabilizes the illusion of a self-contained 
                “I,” separated from the nature “over there” (99–100). It is an object from the 
                outside which has broached the barrier separating the dreamer from the dream. 
                Furthermore, the fly is the very figure of the disorientation that comes with 
                significant, global, ecological changes. The fly in <title level="a">Written in 
                    Germany</title> has lost all sense of space and time. The fly is a “fool,” 
                “seduc’d” from its “winter retreat” by the heat of the stove, and now creeps across 
                the flat black iron surface, a postapocalyptic image wrought by human hands (11–15). 
                The parallel between the fly and Wordsworth is apparent enough: the poet is also a 
                fool in the wrong place at the wrong time, vacationing in Germany in the dead of 
                winter. Moreover, the postapocalyptic situation of the fly (the sun is gone; the 
                earth is flat, black, and hot) is just one of many possible outcomes also available 
                to Wordsworth. Thus this stranger thing calls into question the stability of the 
                presence that the lyric “I” presupposes, and encourages the suspicion that the fly, 
                Wordsworth, all of us really, are just aimless objects.</p>
            <p>Of course, Wordsworth attempts to reestablish the inside/outside barrier, but through 
                two very different means: generically and theologically. Consistent with Morton’s 
                formula for ecomimesis, first denying a separation between self and nature but then 
                reifying the difference in the process, the poet contains nature by naming 
                it.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For Morton, ecomimesis “aims to rupture the 
                    aesthetic distance, to break down the subject-object dualism, to convince us 
                    that we belong to this world. But the end result is to reinforce the aesthetic 
                    distance, the very dimension in which the subject-object dualism persists. 
                    Since de-distancing has been reified, distance returns even more strongly, in 
                    surround-sound, with panoramic intensity” (135).</note> Wordsworth identifies 
                nature according to a particular time and place, a common convention of Romantic 
                nature/lyric poetry (Brewster 76–77). In <title level="a">Tintern Abbey,</title> 
                Wordsworth points to a particular time and place in the title, <title level="a">Lines 
                    Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey, on Revisiting the Banks of the Wye 
                    During a Tour, July 13, 1798.</title> He thus transitions once and for all from 
                the timeless/divine plane to a historical/earthly one, creating a convenient heading 
                for the index at the end of the book of the world. The title, <title 
                    level="a">Written in Germany,</title> is a less obvious marker because it provides 
                no chronological date, but—and perhaps in a more adequate representation of a 
                particular aspect of reality—it names a specific “location” in the history of the 
                earth through temperature (“on One of the Coldest Days of the Century”). Date and 
                location become temperature and location. Or perhaps more accurate still, especially 
                in a discussion of the longue durée of the planet: time is temperature. Here, the 
                reality of Wordsworth’s situation gets the better of his ecomimesis: between the 
                poet’s relocation to Germany and the temperature’s low point, the central figure of 
                the poet is, in fact, just as disoriented as the fly—he just doesn’t know it yet.</p>
            <p>Wordsworth’s final attempt to secure the self and the planet can be linked to an 
                apostrophe, or an address to something or someone not present within the 
                poem.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For more on apostrophe, or lyric address, see 
                    Brewster (38–42), and Culler (186–211).</note> In this desolate plane, 
                Wordsworth’s final recourse is God. It is the same logical move Berkeley makes in 
                his philosophy. If essence is perception, things can exist independent of the 
                human mind—even without humans—because ultimately, everything is a perception of 
                God. Wordsworth also finds atonement in the divine testimony, “Yet, God is my 
                witness” (36). God sees all, and thus, even the tree falling in the forest without 
                a human nearby to hear it is real. The problem is that, if Wordsworth finds 
                recourse through an all perceiving and all preserving deity, he remains in good 
                standing even if he disavows scientific knowledge about the planet. Science charts 
                global temperatures and allows Wordsworth to know that, in fact (as far as the 
                information he had at the time could provide), the earth was cooling and becoming 
                less hospitable to life. The safety net God provides brings Wordsworth in the end 
                to the familiar conclusion of optimists, that all will return to a happy 
                equilibrium: “thou small helpless Thing, / Thy life I would gladly sustain / Till 
                summer comes up . . . and with crowds / Of thy brethren a march thou shoud’st sound 
                through the clouds, / And back to the forests again” (36–40). Certainly, if 
                Wordsworth restricts himself to “this” year, a “balance” between winter and spring, 
                nature and self, life and death seems to be had. But the scale with which he begins
                (“coldest day of the century”) haunts the local perspective: the conditions of the 
                earth must be measured according to hundreds of years (really, millions of years), 
                not what’s happening next month.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Timothy Morton 
                    points out that large time scales are far more difficult to process than 
                    infinity, and they severely complicate human relationships: “no one then [one 
                    hundred thousand years from now] will meaningfully be related to me; and my 
                    smallest action now will affect that time in profound ways. A Styrofoam cup 
                    will outlive me by over four hundred years” (<title 
                        level="m">Hyperobjects</title> 60).</note></p>
            <p>While students can see Wordsworth in relationship to (nonhuman) others, neither 
                poem nor visual adaptation satisfies the need to narrate social, political, and 
                economic changes over such a long period time. This conclusion conflicts with the 
                argument put forth by Nick Sousanis, who explains in <title 
                    level="m">Unflattening</title> that illustrations (especially, comics), “are 
                read sequentially like a text [and] the entire composition is also taken 
                in—viewed—allatonce” (62). As the pictures on the page and the final phrase’s 
                compression make clear, visual images can demonstrate change without movement, 
                which makes them powerful tools for describing a longer (a much, much longer) 
                narrative about the human position leading up to, within, and even after the 
                Anthropocene. The problem in class is that most students do not draw Wordsworth’s 
                story as a sequence. Instead, they depict Wordsworth and his relations in “a 
                moment,” as the lyric genre would seem to encourage. So the source of the 
                problem—visualizing the self in the Anthropocene with adequacy—can be located 
                in Wordsworth’s point of view, the lyric “I,” which dominates the poem. What is 
                needed then may be a different medium, but it also might be a different way of 
                collating the information from within the same medium.</p>

            <p>Placing Wordsworth’s poem and the Romantic subject in a broader historical 
                context can raise awareness regarding the larger consequences of the centered 
                view. The course can be divided into three sections. Opposite to the “center” is 
                the view from the “margin,” and all first-person perspectives are called into 
                question by the “view from nowhere.” The organization of the course allows 
                students to recognize the consequences of multiple perspectives, as well as how 
                these have developed over the centuries. Certainly, one could conduct an entire 
                class on ecocritical perspectives from the standpoint of Romanticism alone, 
                switching from anthropocentric to ecocentric views or, for instance, from 
                Wordsworth to Charlotte Dacre.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Dacre’s 
                    ecopoetry was first brought to my attention by Ashely Cross during her talk,

                    College.</note> But opening historical and generic boundaries is important 
                because we cannot afford to approach the Anthropocene synchronically. While it 
                will not be immediately apparent by focusing strictly on the centered or marginal 
                view, by combining these perspectives with the view from nowhere, it becomes 
                clear that what has happened is still happening and what will happen has happened

           <p>To account for the margins, Shakespeare’s <title level="m">The Tempest</title> (1611) 
               and Gloria Naylor’s <title level="m">Mama Day</title> (1988) provide a long arc, 
               obfuscating the “starting point” of the Anthropocene. Plus, turning from 
               Wordsworth’s printed word to Shakespeare’s theater allows students to adapt the 
               text to yet another medium: the stage. Performing the drama makes palpable the 
               connection between Enlightenment science, the human determination of the planet, 
               and the subordination of an indigenous people to European colonialists.<note place="foot"

                   white-patriarchal-naturalistic science and black-matriarchal-pantheistic magic, 
                   but she also provides an instructive application of adaptation theory, noting that

               city, whereas the latter (magic) endures on an island—on the margin of the

                   level="m">The Tempest</title> and the view from the margin in meaningful ways. 
               Unlike Caliban, Naylor’s characters are not explicitly oppressed by a single white 
               patriarch; instead, they grapple with the subtle ways in which they have internalized 
               white-American, rational-scientific values and beliefs with respect to people and 
               the planet. Students benefit from analyzing how Naylor adapts aspects of 
               Shakespeare’s play, while at the same time recognizing, as Donald J. Reilly points 
               out, how she embeds Gothic conventions dating to the eighteenth century for the sake 
               of creating “a space in which Naylor is able to write back against American hegemony” 
               (243). Within the medium of the text there is a parallel tension with respect to 
               “when” we are as well as “who” or “what” we are. Shakespeare and Naylor call into 
               question the stability of the power over nature that accompanies the centered 
               Romantic outlook even as they reckon with the difficulties that accompany 
               resistance to this power.</p>
            <p>
                If the ability to resist the capitalist, patriarchic, and techno-rationalist 
                destruction of the planet is compromised by one’s position within this system, then 
                the view from the margins demonstrates on another level that visualizing the 
                instability of the self and human relations within the Anthropocene may be a 
                problem of perspective after all. Of course, such a conclusion ought to raise 
                objections, as if I were suggesting that global warming—a sign of the 
                Anthropocene—is merely a matter of interpretation. While global warming may be an 
                adequate characterization of the planet’s current trajectory, human access to this 
                current and future state remains subject to one’s cultural position. Plenty of 
                information is available with respect to global warming and the Anthropocene, but 
                an understanding of the fuller implications of this information requires the 
                ability to visualize one’s self as subject to it, which requires the ability to 
                visualize one’s self in an unstable position. The earlier part of this essay 
                attempted to outline an exercise for precisely this purpose, visualizing one’s 
                self in an unfamiliar time, place, and climate. But if the information being 
                visualized is grounded in a centralized or marginalized perspective, the 
                information may not communicate the actual conditions and changes to the earth. 
                The information given and the changes depicted may become mere plot devices for 
                effectuating a narrative of blind hope (or a capitalist vision of productive 
                negativity).</p>
            <p>One solution to this potential pitfall is to subtract perspective altogether. In 
                a section on the “view from nowhere,” students investigate representations of a 
                view detached from its own situation.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In his 
                    eponymous book, Thomas Nagel links the view from nowhere to representation: 
                    “To represent an experience from outside by imagining it subjectively is the 
                    analogue of representing an objective spatial configuration by imagining it 
                    visually. . . . What is represented need not resemble the representation in 
                    all respects. It must be represented in terms of certain general features of 
                    subjective experience—subjective universals. . . . But the capacity to form 
                    universal concepts in any area enables one not only to represent the present 
                    situation from without but to think about other possibilities which one has 
                    not experienced and perhaps never will experience directly” (21).</note> Taking 
                the subject out of the landscape eliminates the phenomenological approach to 
                ecology, personal encounters with other objects and species, and perhaps most 
                importantly, local time and space. Instead of near becomes far and far becomes 
                near, here becomes nowhere and nowhere becomes everywhere. Such a view is 
                exemplified in digital databases, and a good one to accompany Wordsworth’s poem 
                is the <title level="a">World Meteorological Organization Global Weather &amp; 
                    Climate Extremes Archive,</title> hosted by Arizona State University. It is 
                a database containing extreme temperatures (similar to those found in <title 
                    level="a">Written in Germany</title>), according to geographical location 
                and date. As students gloss over the various names and numbers, I ask: Who is the 
                narrator in this database? Who is the protagonist? Where is the beginning of this 
                database, the climax, and the dénouement? Because databases do not include a 
                narrator, hero, or a clear beginning, middle, and end, it is difficult to 
                identify with the text or to follow it in relationship to one’s own position. 
                Unlike a Wordsworth poem, <title level="m">The Tempest</title>, or Gloria 
                Naylor’s novel, there is no sequence that mirrors a moment, a few days, or the 
                years of one’s life. Compared to the image, the database flattens time and 
                space by eliminating any centered or marginal “I,” as well as the step-by-step 
                sequence that inevitably leads to some action, discovery, or resolution. In 
                the database, all events are equal.</p>
            <p>A database does not eliminate bias, but it is an additional aid for exposing 
                “blind spots” in one’s reading.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In a recent 
                    edition of <title level="j">PMLA</title> (2017), a number of scholars 
                    debated the strengths and weaknesses of “distant reading.” I am writing 
                    about a scientific database and not a model of literary history, but 
                    models are relevant because they rely on datasets to produce predictions 
                    with accuracy. In her discussion of textual analysis, Johanna Drucker 
                    rightly points out that some scholars mistake computational methods for 
                    absolute objectivity. They forget that “automated methods are also fraught 
                    with cultural, historical, and other prejudices built into their design” 
                    (631). Indeed, all models are situated in a human, moral-aesthetic domain. 
                    But as Richard Jean So also points out, models are not intended to “[bring] 
                    forth intractable empirical truths that one must accept or reject, [rather] 
                    the reader is encouraged to reason with the model and its maker to better 
                    grasp the data” (671). So concludes that what models do well is expose 
                    error, and error should be thought of as a “constitutive part of 
                    science . . . something to be integrated formally into our research,” 
                    instead of something to be merely “tolerated or avoided” (672). While a 
                    view from nowhere may not be entirely possible, attempting to see from the 
                    perspective of an idealized nonlocation can expose errors reinforced by an 
                    all-to-comfortable faith in our subjective, first-person 
                    observations.</note> In the case of <title level="a">Written in 
                        Germany,</title> Wordsworth writes about a foreign country he visits at 
                a particular time, providing the English with a glimpse at the relative ways 
                humans live out their moral-aesthetic lives. By contrast, the database can 
                provide information on Germany in 1800 as well as the Philippines in 2017. 
                With all of this information combined, climate scientists can make predictions 
                about the planet hundreds of years into the future. Accordingly, the lack of a 
                personal view (and the concomitant absence of a narrative) allows any place at 
                any time on earth to have an equal value in relationship to any other place or 
                time on earth. While some might see this “flattening out” of time and space as 
                equivalent to an “emptying out” of personhood, the same mechanism also affords 
                a place, such as the Philippines, an equitable position in relationship to the 
                United States or the United Kingdom in its struggles with global warming. While 
                some in the United States may suffer from less anxiety over rising sea levels 
                and temperatures, these are exigent environmental issues for the archipelago 
                that makes up the Filipino nation, and it may only be through a database that 
                these two regions (and many more) can be regarded simultaneously and their 
                needs weighed in the balance.<note place="foot" resp="editors">According to 
                    Naomi Klein, even “good intentioned” Westerners that believe in global 
                    warming are guilty of not considering the impact of their “solutions” on 
                    regions remote from their own homes and are even comfortable with a slight 
                    increase of temperature because it will “improve” the weather “for them,” 
                    while encouraging major disasters for others.</note></p>
            <p>Of course, as N. Katherine Hayles claims, databases still require narratives 
                to “achieve dramatic impact and significance” (178). While the database is a 
                great equalizer, it leads back to the historical depictions of humans in time 
                of the kind Joseph Priestly was so adeptly renovating at the end of the 
                eighteenth century. They certainly attempt to achieve a degree of adequacy, 
                but these maps say little about how to relate to others. Nor can we find total 
                satisfaction with Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Written in Germany,</title> as 
                it reveals how one’s personal outlook can obscure the facts regarding 
                normative and nondiscursive registers. Really, what is needed is Wordsworth’s 
                narrative in relationship to a larger network of human and nonhuman relations 
                throughout time and space, and media adaptations can still help map such 
                interconnections. One can envision a larger project that asks students to 
                incorporate all or most of the materials from a class on environmental 
                literature into a final project, repurposing Wordsworth’s lyric in 
                combination with other poems, novels, dramas, even blogs, scholarly articles, 
                and databases. Based on the amalgamation of these modes, genres, and media, 
                students might make their own conjectures regarding human relations in the 
                last instant, at the end of the Anthropocene, or just prior to a world 
                without us.</p>
