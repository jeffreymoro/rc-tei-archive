            <p class="noCount">This essay reflects on the experience of teaching Romantic bird poetry through the
               lens of our current anthropogenic environmental crises. In particular, it considers
               how we can not only read but also <em>hear</em> Romantic poetry anew as an undulating constellation murmuring beneath the Anthropocene,
               particularly as birdsong is in the process of disappearing as climate change threatens
               mass avian extinction. It explores how we might attend to those bird sounds and silences
               in poetry by Smith, Coleridge, Keats, and Clare in light of this impending silence.
               I describe the lesson in detail, which begins with students giving an account of their
               lives among our wasted environments (on local and global levels) before moving into
               the Romantic past. I frame this backward pedagogical approach through the rhetorical
               figure of <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">hysteron proteron</span> (temporal inversion). The lesson chiefly aims to cultivate a sonic sensibility, one
               that makes students better listening subjects attuned to sonic changes in their environments.
               It accomplishes this by pairing select poems about the nightingale with a contemporary
               digital sound sculpture that makes bird sound audible and visible. Developing a method
               of “close listening,” a model of acoustic intimacy that requires becoming attentive
               to the layers of ubiquitous sounds, I frame listening as an act of turning us outward,
               one that makes us more perceptually aware citizens of the Anthropocene.</p>

               <p>“Where are we?” With this question, I begin my upper-level undergraduate Romantics
                  course at the University of New Brunswick (Canada). Class answers start with the classroom
                  and quickly slide through larger conceptual containers (next the university, then
                  city, province, country), culminating in the expanses of “planet Earth” and “the twenty-first
                  century.” At this point, I invite students to consider locating themselves geologically
                  within the Anthropocene, an era wherein humans have become a geological force responsible
                  for irreparably damaging the earth.</p>
               <p>The first week of the course is dedicated to establishing a foundational understanding
                  of the Anthropocene, the current “specter” that, as J. R. McNeill suggests, “is haunting
                  academia” (117). I assign students critical readings, including excerpts from the
                  work of Dipesh Chakrabarty, Paul Crutzen, Jeremy Davies, and J. R. McNeill, to help
                  frame the discursive parameters and give a sense of the texture of this emergent field
                  of scholarship. A preliminary definition of the Anthropocene comes from Crutzen’s
                  brief article, 
                  “Geology of Mankind”
                  :<span class="quote">‘For the past three centuries, the effects of humans on the global environment have
                     escalated. Because of these anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, global climate
                     may depart significantly from natural behaviour for many millennia to come. It seems
                     appropriate to assign the term “Anthropocene” to the present . . . human-dominated,
                     geological epoch. . . . The Anthropocene could be said to have started in the latter
                     part of the eighteenth century, when analyses of air trapped in polar ice showed the
                     beginning of growing global concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane. This date
                     also happens to coincide with James Watt’s design of the steam engine in 1784. (23)’</span></p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>I propose one way to think about our world, which is increasingly marked by anthropogenic
                     environmental crises, is that we inhabit a “wasted environment.” I mean to evoke both
                     senses of the term “waste.” First, our environment is saturated in waste (pollution,
                     detritus, and rejectamenta); second, it is an environment that itself has been wasted
                     (missed, lost, allowed to expire), in the sense of anthropogenic wasting. Wordsworth
                     evokes this second kind of waste in his poem “The world is too much with us”: “The
                     world is too much with us; late and soon, / Getting and spending, we lay waste our
                     powers” (1–2). Here, the Anthropocene is perhaps more appropriately thought of as
                     the “Anthrobscene” (to borrow Jussi Parikka’s phrase), where waste becomes inextricably
                     enmeshed with human legacy. A class discussion quickly generates numerous examples
                     of wasted environments on global and local levels. I ask students to push beyond what
                     Timothy Morton calls the “hyperobject” of climate change to instead identify regional
                     or provincial examples, of which there are no shortage. Some examples generated by
                     students include New Brunswick’s atmospheric and river contamination; destructive
                     forestry practices, including the use of herbicide glyphosate spraying, a chemical
                     used to kill hardwood growth around powerlines;

                              both cases, glyphosate spraying is a suspected factor.</span></div>
                     </div> Their enthusiastic contributions to this discussion, and their articulated feelings
                     of anger, grief, and betrayal over their wasted environments, make me hopeful that
                     classrooms can be solvents against such waste.</p>

                  <p>This pedagogical work of scaling up, bursting from the microbubble (the classroom)

                     movement is to pull the thin film of the present into contact with the Romantic past.
                     Yet turning backward, this <span xml:lang="la" lang="la" class="foreign">hysteron proteron</span>—the rhetorical figure of temporal inversion—is not a nostalgic or corrective move.

                              rhetoric, as Richard Rand notes, it is when “two terms are reversed according to the
                              sequence, the order, temporal, spatial, causal, in which you ordinarily find them”
                              (51).</span></div>

                     under celestial domes whose interiors would permit domestic feelings of order” (28).
                     Instead, the goal in going about things backward—the inversion of past and future—is
                     to revitalize a present relationship, to hear Romantic poetry, ideas, and problematics
                     as a frenetic, undulating constellation murmuring beneath the Anthropocene.

                              as an effect, an inversion that he calls “a small Hysteron-Proteron” as “the communication
                              of pleasure is the introductory means by which alone the poet must expect to moralize
                              his readers” (Biographia Literaria II, 131).</span></div>
                     </div> To proceed backward in this <span xml:lang="la" lang="la" class="foreign">hysteron proteron</span> is a strategy befitting the preposterous and the disorderly, one that complements

                  <p>In what follows, I describe one lesson that attempts to amplify the murmuring of what
                     we might call the Romantic Anthropocene. The lesson focuses on birdsong—a ubiquitous
                     sound that often disappears into the layers of our everyday sonic environment. Yet
                     more than that, birdsong is also a sound that is disappearing in a different way,
                     that is, as a result of anthropogenic environmental destruction. The “silent spring”
                     proposed by Rachel Carson in 1962 has given way to a more profound silence where,
                     in Keats’ words, “no birds sing,” as we face the most widespread loss of birdsong
                     human have ever experienced as a result of climate change. Indeed, climate change
                     is now the primary threat to mass avian extinction.

                              ethical questions (“What does it mean to care for a disappearing species? What obligations
                              do we have to hold open space in the world for other living beings?”) but does not

                     </div> According to Audubon’s <em>Bird and Climate Change Report</em>, published in 2014, rising temperatures threaten to reduce 314 species of North American
                     birds by over half their current ranges by 2080.

                     </div> As one of the world’s leading evolutionary biologists, Anders Pape Møller, reports,
                     climatic conditions affect bird vocalization; warmer temperatures and increased humidity
                     and precipitation alter the vegetation or “song posts” from which birds typically
                     sing. How do we respond to this? How do we hear this impending loss of sound if bird
                     sounds are already ubiquitous, if they have already, at least in some senses, disappeared—if
                     silence is already sprung?</p>
               </div>
               <p>Part of the challenge, I tell my students, is to make these sounds audible again,
                  to bring them back to the summer of their full-throated ease (to riff on Keats). This,
                  I believe, is the first step toward making these sounds meaningful. Indeed, my objective
                  in teaching these poems is twofold: first, to cultivate in students a sonic sensibility,
                  one that makes them better listening subjects attuned to sonic changes in their environments,
                  and second, to extend the vocalization range of Romantic bird poetry. The best-known
                  Romantic bird poems, such as Keats’s 
                  “Ode to a Nightingale”
                  and Shelley’s 
                  “To a Sky-lark,”
                  are often read as metaphors for the work of poetry itself, with the bird inevitably
                  becoming a figure for the poet, poetry, or other “flights” of imagination. To step
                  away from these rich yet well-worn readings and find new lines of flight requires
                  a “shock to thought,” to borrow a phrase by Brian Massumi.</p>
               <p>My students are slightly surprised when asked to briefly step away from the text,
                  comfortable as they are, as upper-level undergraduate students of literature, with
                  the business of close reading. But where does reading happen in the body? Where, beyond
                  the brain, is the “somatic locus,” as Garrett Stewart puts it, for this silent activity
                  of reading (238)? It is also “the organs of vocal production, from diaphragm up through
                  throat to tongue and palate” (1). This “silent reading,” as Stewart calls it, “locates
                  itself . . . in the conjoint cerebral activity and suppressed muscular action of a
                  simultaneously summoned and silenced enunciation” (1). After a discussion over the
                  complimentary nature of reading and listening—a discussion supplemented by Geoffrey
                  Hartman’s chapter in <em>Saving the Text</em>, where he challenges Derrida’s conflation of logocentrism and phonocentrism, and
                  Jean-Luc Nancy’s phenomenological reflection on the act of listening—we discuss the
                  stakes of this pedagogical experiment in what we might call “close listening.”</p>
               <p>Close listening means to be attentive to the various layers of sound—layers made visible
                  (as I will describe in detail below)—which, in turn, models an acoustic intimacy that
                  we can transpose to the poems in order to attend with greater perception to those
                  minimal sounds or other minor elements that might otherwise fade away. In a feedback
                  loop, this process also transforms readers into better listeners—that is, better listening
                  subjects that pay greater attention to those ubiquitous sounds, those metonyms for
                  the unsaid or silences within discourse.</p>
               <p>Why does listening matter, not only in terms of our engagement with Romantic poetry
                  but also with our lives within the Anthropocene? Ultimately, listening may cultivate
                  within us a heightened sonic sensibility, a better perception or attunement with the
                  world, which, one hopes, will translate into acting. The effect of a “sharpened sense
                  of perception,” as sound theorist Michel Chion writes, is world changing:<span class="quote">‘The information that we receive and which is the matter with which we fashion our
                     opinions and thoughts is richer and more diversified. Is what is at stake with a trained
                     perception to lift the veil of illusion and to see reality behind the appearances?
                     Not so much as that, but simply to become aware of our “perceiving body” and to restate
                     it, more vigilant and more active, in that ocean of messages in which it is tossed.

                  to sound, I suggest that poetry which directly engages with sound—that sounds sound,
                  as it were—invites us to hear again. But what are we listening to, and what are we
                  listening for?</p>

                  <p>This lesson brings together Romantic bird poetry—selections by Charlotte Smith, Samuel
                     Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, and John Clare—and contemporary digital sound art by
                     Australian multimedia artist Andy Thomas. For this particular lesson I select poems
                     that focus on the nightingale, poetry’s long-prized bird in a history that begins
                     with the ancient Greeks and Romans (Homer, Simon, and Ovid), extends through Milton,
                     and culminates in the Romantics. When we look at the etymology of the nightingale,
                     students are surprised to find the same word for nightingale in ancient Greek (αηδών)
                     already being used metaphorically for songstress, poet, and poetry.

                  <p>In 2013, as part of the Europeana Creative project, Thomas produced a digital sound
                     sculpture out of two bird sounds (see Figure 1). <em>Nightingale and Canary</em>, the video of the two audio lifeforms, was created using 3D software and sound recordings
                     of these titular birds from the archives of the Netherlands Institute for Sound and
                     Vision. The brief video—less than three minutes in length—is a mesmerizing, colorful
                     display of abstract forms that react to sound. As we listen to the first sound of
                     the nightingale, abstract audio lifeforms flicker and flash before our eyes. Variegated
                     textures of thick tendrils, tight folds, and loose cloudy vapors all pop and fade
                     in rich greens, purples, browns, and pinks. Sidestepping here a technical discussion

                  <p>We typically know it when we hear it, but what exactly is bird sound or birdsong?
                     A quick gloss and brief anatomical lesson serves my students and I well here: birdsong
                     consists of “brief vocalizations separated by pauses” called syllables; according
                     to a recent scientific study, “In many cases, a bird can produce these vocalizations
                     very rapidly, several per second. In these cases, the pauses are so brief that the
                     song appears to be a continuous succession of sounds” (Mindlin and Laje 13). Romantic
                     science was also interested in understanding birdsong. Surgeon and anatomist John
                     Hunter, who dissected many songbirds at the request of Daines Barrington, determined
                     strong larynx muscles to be linked to those birds with the loudest voice, and found
                     the strongest in the nightingale (Barrington 262).

                              in 1767, and was (along with Thomas Pennant) the real-life correspondent to Gilbert
                              White’s Natural History of Selborne (1789). Barrington’s essay on birdsong first appeared
                              in the Philosophical Transactionsand was included in the third volume of Pennant’s
                              British Zoology (Oxford Dictionary of National Biography). Barrington offers a more
                              lyrical definition of birdsong: “a succession of three or more different notes, which
                              are continued without interruption during the same interval with a musical bar of
                              four …</span></div>

               </div>
               <p>The abstract forms that we see in <em>Nightingale and Canary</em> illustrate the highly controlled syringeal muscles used for vocalization in birds,
                  each vocalization appearing as an emerging visualization. Simultaneously listening
                  and seeing this visualized sound enables us to better identify the different parts
                  and textures of the vocalization. Paradoxically, this digital sound sculpture enables
                  us to think about questions of legibility, of how we can “read” our animal others,
                  and hence merges ethology with sound art and poetry. To work from an ethological perspective,
                  as Parikka puts it in <em>Insect Media</em>, is to “evaluate bodies not according to their innate, morphological essences but
                  as expressions of certain movements, sensations, and interactions with their environments”
                  (xxv). Thomas’s dynamic audio lifeforms call our attention back to the voice, rendering
                  us more attentive listeners.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>There is good reason to be called back to sound, particularly when thinking about
                     the voice of the animal. As Tobias Menely compellingly argues in <em>The Animal Claim</em>, “To recover the face of the vocal imperative—its capacity to intervene or interpose,
                     its availability to redirection or remediation—is to understand community not as a
                     closed system of reciprocal entitlements, but as something constitutively open to
                     those whose voices lay claim to rights not yet recognized” (1). Following the long
                     association between the poet and the animal voice—recalling Virgil’s Orpheus who sings
                     for the animals—Menely offers that what is unique to the eighteenth-century poets
                     of sensibility (Pope, Thomson, Smart, and Cowper) is an amplified attentiveness to
                     the animal, of speaking for animals. Advocacy, he reminds us, is etymologically linked
                     to the Latin <span xml:lang="la" lang="la" class="foreign">vocare</span>, “to call” (1). While birdsong is not a voice heard in Menely’s text, we should consider
                     what this voice and advocacy means for thinking about entangled environments and shared
                     soundscapes with those that do not hold “companion species” status.

                  <p>I begin by having the class listen with their eyes closed as I play Thomas’s <em>Nightingale and Canary</em> with the projector screen turned off. We then have a brief discussion about what we
                     have heard. Students generally struggle to describe the bird sounds. This, I reassure
                     them, is to be expected. For while we know what close reading involves, what are the
                     tools of close listening? Next, I play the video of <em>Nightingale and Canary</em> with the screen on, and ask the class to both watch and listen. We have another lively
                     discussion after the video finishes about what they have heard and watched, and what
                     they find striking about the video. Some students note that the video gives the bird
                     sounds a language, and that they could hear the sound better, able to identify in
                     more detail because of the visualization. Of course, Thomas’s audio forms are not
                     the first visualization of bird sound, and we next look at earlier spectrogram images—images
                     that record sound intensity and variations over time—of these birdsongs.

                              of these sounds may download apps such as SpectrumView, a real-time spectrogram. A
                              future project might explore what reading a bird poem, such as Clare’s 
                              “The Progress of Ryhme,”
                              would look like on a spectrogram.</span></div>
                     </div> Another brief discussion ensues as we consider the formal and affective differences
                     between these two visualization models. Students are eager to explore and share their
                     personal responses to the models, and overwhelmingly prefer the dynamism of Thomas’s
                     audio lifeforms.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Next, I ask students to keep in mind this experience, this feeling they have had with
                  the bird sound becoming visible—and, as a result, heard with new ears—and ask them
                  to bring it with them as we approach our Romantic bird poems. For here, we are also
                  invited to experience bird sound with a similar feeling of acute fascination. Indeed,
                  the goal is to transport the affect of this audio-visual experience with the audio
                  lifeforms into one we have with the Romantic bird poem. This technique, another <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">hysteron proteron</span>, primes the class to be able to experience such affect in relation to the sound of
                  the animal, a figure that twit-twits and chew-chews in the background of their lives.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>After such audio-visual priming, I then prepare the class for reading the Romantic
                     bird poems (Smith, Coleridge, Keats, and Clare) by briefly recalling the Philomela
                     myth and the longer traditions of associating poets with birds, and birds with the
                     beautiful. Aristophanes, Ovid, Petrarch, Shakespeare, and Milton are all key figures
                     in this history. However, the greatest contextualizing comes by outlining how the
                     bird participates in the discourse of Romantic aesthetics, serving as a recurrent
                     figure for the beautiful in Edmund Burke’s <em>A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful</em> (1757)—a text we study earlier in the term. Burke’s text formatively shapes our contextualization
                     of the poems to come. A brief rehearsal with the class of the aesthetic concept of
                     the beautiful (as distinct from the sublime) is productive, as it helps to sharpen
                     the stakes of the beautiful: “There is a wide difference between admiration and love.
                     The sublime, which is the cause of the former, always dwells on great objects, and
                     terrible; the latter on small ones, and pleasing; we submit to what we admire, <em>but we love what submits to us</em>” (103, emphasis mine). The takeaway point of Burke’s aesthetics, I stress, is how
                     this constellation of fragility, beauty, love, and submission remains a problematic,
                     tangled cluster of ideas for us today living in wasted environments. Some questions
                     that we explore include: In what ways is aesthetics tangled with an ethics of ecological
                     care? What is the role of aesthetics, and specifically the beautiful, in shaping our
                     responses to our various eco-disasters? And what kind of space might that leave for
                     ugliness? Toggling back to Thomas’s <em>Nightingale and Canary</em>, how does Burke’s theory of the beautiful dovetail with what we might find affecting
                     and problematic in the abstract audio lifeforms? In <em>A Philosophical Enquiry</em>, Burke provides a lengthy analysis of the beauty of the dove, beautiful for the serpentine
                     line of beauty, smoothness, and pleasing variations in plumage: “it agrees very well
                     with most of the conditions of beauty. It is smooth and downy; its parts are (to use
                     that expression) melted into one another; you are presented with no sudden protuberance
                     through the whole, and yet the whole is continually changing” (104). Students are
                     quick to point out the ease with which Burke slides from the beautiful bird to the
                     beautiful woman, celebrating both on similar grounds, which serves as an effective
                     transition into poetry’s similar gendering of the nightingale. At this point, we discuss
                     the intersection of eighteenth-century aesthetics, natural history, gender, and poetic
                     representations of the nightingale as female (cf. Milton’s <em>Il Penseroso</em> and Thomson’s <em>Spring</em>).

                              who sings. See, for example, Daines Barrington’s 
                              “Experiments and Observations on the Singing of Birds”

                  <p>Subsequently, we turn to a close reading of the poems that treat in detail not only
                     the figure of the bird, but particularly its sound. Proceeding chronologically, we
                     begin with selections from Charlotte Smith’s <em>Elegiac Sonnets</em> (1784). Sonnet III (
                     “To a Nightingale”
                     ), gesturing to Petrarch, addresses the “poor melancholy bird” (1). This poem foregrounds
                     the speaker’s work as a poet, as one of “translating” the bird’s voice in her work.
                     In Sonnet VII (
                     “On the Departure of the Nightingale”
                     ), the speaker translates something of the poetic identity back to the bird, here
                     apostrophizing it as “Sweet poet of the woods,” and making numerous allusions to the
                     poetry of Shakespeare and Milton. We hear nothing of what the song actually sounds
                     like, as Smith’s sonnets immediately sublimate the sound into an abstraction, a metaphor
                     for “the soft voice of young and timid Love” and “Hope’s dear voice” (Sonnet LV, 
                     “The Return of the Nightingale,”
                      7, 14). In Smith’s sonnets the bird consistently functions as a figure for poetic
                     identity. This trope continues in Shelley’s <em>Defence of Poetry</em> (1821) that portrays the poet as “a nightingale, who sits in darkness and sings to
                     cheer its own solitude with sweet sounds” (<em>SPP</em> 486), and in Keats’s November 22, 1817, 
                     “Letter to Bailey,”
                      which offers a vision of becoming-sparrow—two texts that students will also encounter
                     in the course (when we discuss poetic identity).

               <p>We next turn to Coleridge, a poet enormously influenced by Smith. However, Coleridge,
                  contra Smith, directly challenges the poetic tradition of associating the bird with
                  melancholy in his conversational poem <em>The Nightingale,</em> published in <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (1798): “A melancholy bird! Oh! idle thought! / In nature there is nothing melancholy”
                  (14–15). Coleridge’s poem differs from Smith’s bird poems with its attention to the
                  estrangement between the material reality of the bird—a reality that impresses itself
                  through its joyful sound—and its poeticized identity. Coleridge chastises the listener
                  who projects his own negative memories or feelings onto the bird, he who fills “all
                  things with himself, / And made all gentle sounds tell back the tale / Of his own
                  sorrow” (19–21). Poets, Coleridge charges, reify this association, echoing the emotional
                  projections of some first sullen human rather than the bird’s actual sounds. Thus
                  the central problem in this poetic economy is a hearing loss, as it were, a restricted
                  economy of sound that operates without carefully listening to the bird itself. The
                  solution, as the poem offers, is a model of close listening. Far better for the poet
                  would be an attentiveness to “the influxes / Of shapes and sounds and shifting elements
                  / Surrendering his whole spirit, of his song” (27–29).</p>
               <p>The voice of Coleridge’s nightingale “crowds, and hurries, and precipitates / With
                  fast thick warble his delicious notes” (44–45). Shifting from the individual vocalization
                  in the second stanza, the poem’s third stanza offers us a dense acoustic ecology of
                  what a wild grove teeming with nightingales sounds like:</p>

               <p> Sampling the nightingales’ bioacoustics—the sounds birds make to communicate with
                  one another—the poem finds avian answers and provocations without pressing for a human
                  understanding, without speculating on what they are saying. Nevertheless, despite
                  this not-knowing, the collective power of their voices is illuminating (night becomes
                  day), again part of Coleridge’s efforts here to redirect the sound of the nightingale
                  away from its entrenched melancholic association. When asked what the stakes are of
                  this poem, and why Coleridge might want to shift these melancholic associations away
                  from the bird, some students provocatively suggested it could be an ethical move.
                  One student explained how attributing certain qualities, like “dangerous,” to animals
                  can lead to their demise, such as in the case of sharks. We first decide that an animal
                  is dangerous, and then we act as if we naturally find this animal dangerous; humans
                  conveniently forget their own role in shaping how we see the world. So, I asked my
                  class, is Coleridge trying to save the nightingale? In some senses, yes, they answered.
                  Another student insightfully suggested that it was an effort to see past entrenched
                  stereotypes, a comment on the importance of being able to see or hear something in
                  a new light.</p>
               <p>Next, students nestle Keats’s 
                  “Ode to a Nightingale”
                  between the tradition of associating the bird with melancholy (Smith) and those inclined
                  toward ornithological observation (Coleridge). Keats’s ode positions the nightingale’s
                  voice as a <span class="foreign" xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">pharmakon</span>, as both poison and cure. The speaker, “being too happy in thine [the bird’s] happiness”
                  (6), describes in the first stanza the feeling of a “drowsy numbness” that “pains
                  / My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk” (1–2). This pleasure that is also a
                  pain comes from listening to the bird’s song that “Singest of summer in full-throated
                  ease” (10). If the birdsong is not initially melancholic, and here Keats is like Coleridge,
                  its song gradually comes to be framed in these terms as the poem unfolds, later described
                  as a “high requiem” and “plaintive anthem” (60, 75). We consider this shift throughout
                  the poem as a formal indicator of the way that human pressures, especially emotional
                  and psychological ones, redress this sound. One student noted that it was as if Keats
                  (like Coleridge) knew he shouldn’t associate the nightingale with melancholy, but
                  then ultimately gives in and does. What might contribute to this melancholic indulgence,
                  to this “giving in”? I direct students to stanza six, which ruminates on the openness
                  of the birdsong throughout human history. Here, the speaker imagines the birdsong
                  he hears to be the same one that “found a path / Through the sad heart of Ruth” (65–66)
                  and “The same that oft-times hath / Charm’d magic casements, opening on the foam /
                  Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn” (68–70). The sound, students suggest, is
                  a way of establishing a connection back to the beginning of time; the speaker is motivated
                  to treat the sound this way perhaps because he is lonely. After all, they note, we
                  don’t encounter any other sounds (of, say, human companions) in the poem. Like the
                  illuminating power that Coleridge ascribes to the nightingale’s sound, Keats’s poem
                  imagines this sound’s affective power, unlocking hearts and casements alike. Like
                  the dynamic sound of the nightingale that was championed in Coleridge’s poem and richly
                  visualized and heard in Thomas’s audio lifeforms, Keats’s poem cannot fix the sound
                  to one melody or concept (contra Smith).</p>
               <p>The final poet we study in this lesson is John Clare, beginning with 
                  “The Nightingales Nest,”
                  a poem that immediately calls for quiet: “lets softly rove / And list the nightingale—she
                  dwelleth here / Hush let the wood gate softly clap” (1–3). With the invitation to
                  listen and to follow, readers travel “through matted thorns” (13) to nestle down and
                  watch the nightingale as it sings:</p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">Her wings would tremble in her extacy</div>
                     <div class="l">And feathers stand on end as twere with joy</div>
                     <div class="l">And mouth wide open to release her heart</div>

                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> Students admitted to being the least interested in this poem. Clare’s language was
                  estranging to some, and unnerving to at least one student who felt the poem strangely
                  sexualized the bird through its descriptions, pointing out key words: the singing
                  bird as “trembling” in “ecstasy” with a wide-open mouth. Is this, I asked, a bird
                  orgasm? Students laughed and blushed. (Things you never thought you’d say in the classroom).
                  Inviting serious discussion on this latter point, I asked students to think about
                  the rhetorical strategy of this representation. It makes Clare, lurking in the bush,
                  look “super creepy” (their words), but if we apply this thinking more broadly to humanity,
                  it becomes a critique of the act of looking. Is looking a kind of touching? Is there
                  not a kind of voyeurism operating in this poem? And what ways does this looking become
                  a kind of bad touching? I asked students to pause in answering that last question,
                  as we moved past Clare’s unique attention to the physiological features of the singing
                  bird, and turned to the poem’s next object choice: the nest itself, an object overlooked
                  in the other studied poems. I invited students to describe the nest. They were underwhelmed
                  by its description, almost disappointed to find that the nest appears to be haphazardly
                  constructed with loose materials, dead leaves, and scraps of grass. The flowers surrounding
                  the nest itself, one student noted, are prettier than the nest. Another student remarked
                  that one doesn’t typically find an ugly or mediocre object as the focus of a poem.
                  Another student called attention to the way that the nest itself doesn’t seem to be
                  special, but Clare transforms it by including it in the poem, and thus makes it special.
                  <em>What kind of nest are you looking for?</em> I handed out scrap paper and asked my students to draw me a nest. What became apparent
                  is how the students envision the Ideal Nest, a round, tightly woven structure, some
                  with perfectly shaped eggs nestled at the bottom. We circulated the drawings while
                  talking about what it means, then, to encounter a nest that doesn’t fit with their
                  idealizations. Suddenly, students found the poem to be asking us to attend to differences
                  and to that which defies our expectations. Suddenly, Clare isn’t such a dirty bird.</p>
               <p>Having moved from the bird’s physiology to its nest, I next draw my students’ attention
                  to the changes in bird sound as humans approach the nest:</p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="indent5">now near</div>

                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> Between the close attention to the bird’s shift in vocalization and the nest itself,
                  Clare’s poem now offers us a glimpse into human interference, that is, the silences
                  that are the result of the human listening subject. I stress <em>human</em> listening subject here because the poem also frames the bird’s environment itself
                  (“a wilderness of listening leaves” [32]) as a listening subject. The poem explores
                  the idea that while humans are not the only listening subjects, they are the only
                  ones that are disruptive: the “rude boys” and the speaker himself are the only ones
                  in the poem that make the bird mute.</p>
               <p>In the poem’s final stanza, the speaker promises the bird that “We will not plunder
                  music of its dower / Nor turn this spot of happiness to thrall” (69–70). Here, we
                  pause over the promises humanity makes to animals and the environment. How are such
                  promises to “leave them still unknown to wrong” (92) perhaps compromised by the speaker’s
                  desire to see what he hears, to pursue the nightingale to her hiding places? While
                  we might recognize the speaker’s desire for minimal interference, in what ways might
                  we be skeptical of this possibility? In short: do we believe our speaker? This question
                  made for a lively discussion. Some students insisted that we should not believe the
                  speaker because he has already tracked and followed her down this far, and has already
                  crossed a line he shouldn’t have. Others cautiously offered a more optimistic reading:
                  that we should trust him precisely because he has come this far and then turns away,
                  and has caused no real harm to the bird. Other students responded, in turn, by noting
                  that the speaker has caused distress to the bird just by coming close to the nest,
                  evident in her being described as “choking fear.” What if human looking always brings
                  with it some kind of violence? What if looking is a kind of fetishizing or sexualizing
                  that becomes a plundering? I leave these questions unanswered as a way to segue into
                  our final poem.</p>
               <p>While the human-caused silence of birds is a repeated concern throughout Clare’s poetry,
                  I conclude the lesson with one last poem, the short “Birds in Alarm,” which consists
                  of ornithological observations of the different threat responses of birds. The poem
                  catalogues the silence of the yellow hammer, nightingale, and pewet when their nests
                  are found alongside the wrens’ “chitter loud” and the robins’ “hollow tut” (13, 14).
                  The poem extends similar concerns as “The Nightingales Nest” and helps build an additional
                  dimension into Clare’s sensibility, his interest in bird sound and the conditions
                  of silence. This, I offer, textures Clare’s sensibility, his self-described approach
                  in his natural history letters to “looking” with a “poetic feeling” at the environment:<span class="quote">‘I love to look on nature with a poetic feeling which magnifys the pleasure I love
                     to see the nightingale in its hazel retreat &amp; the cuckoo hiding in its solitudes of
                     oaken foliage &amp; not to examine their carcasses in glass cases yet naturalists &amp; botanists
                     seem to have no taste for this poetical feeling they merely make collections of dryd
                     specimens classing them after Leanius into tribes &amp; familys. (<em>The Natural History Prose Writings</em> 38)’</span> We discuss what Clare means by looking with a poetic feeling. To look with a poetic
                  feeling, as Clare puts it, is not to imagine nature as pristine or untouched. It is
                  to take pleasure in animals alive and in their habitats, to put them under the magnifying
                  power of poetry rather than look at them as classified “carcasses in glass cases.”
                  Students suggested that it is a way of capturing the life or vitality of the animal,
                  as opposed to the lifeless, stuffed specimen that one could encounter in a museum.
                  What Clare is talking about, another student noted, is a different experience: of
                  engaging with an animal alive versus dead. One of the experiential differences between
                  the animal alive or dead is a dimension we often overlook: its sound. For Clare, sound
                  and our attention to it by listening is key to being able to look with a poetic feeling.
                  As Stephanie Kuduk Weiner notes, Clare celebrates “listening as a means of making
                  sense of the world” (382). In considering the activity of listening as a way of engaging
                  with and making sense of the world around us, my students and I come away from our
                  reading of Clare with a heightened sense for the benefits (the magnified pleasures)
                  of listening to the world around us. Could listening be a solution to the trouble
                  with looking? This is a bigger question, one that kicks us out of the cozy nest that
                  we’ve created for ourselves with these Romantic bird poems, and back out into the
                  hot, carbon-filled atmosphere of the Anthropocene.</p>
               <p>To approach Romantic bird poetry with such a poetic feeling, as I understand Clare’s
                  phrase to mean, demands our participation in the soundscape; this is what my overlaying
                  of these poems by Smith, Coleridge, Keats, and Clare with Andy Thomas’s digital sound
                  sculpture attempts. Attending to the “dust of the lark that Shelley heard” means more
                  than searching for a “little ball of feather and bone,” to borrow the words of Thomas
                  Hardy (
                  “Shelley’s Skylark”
                  ). It is to think and listen for that which otherwise wastes away. For these poems
                  call us to be attuned, to be listening, which, as Jean-Luc Nancy puts it, means “to
                  be straining toward a possible meaning, and consequently one that is not immediately
                  accessible” (6). Listening is different from hearing, as hearing “is to understand
                  the sense . . . to understand at least the rough outline of a situation” (6). To hear
                  something is to recognize already and thus partially understand the source or message.
                  To listen is rather the act of being open to the unknown, to be unsure of the source
                  or message. As part of our closing discussion and reflection on the week spent on
                  these poems, I confess that while I hope my students have heard me and one another
                  and that they have at least roughly understood our discussions, I would be happiest
                  if what they took from our discussions was an enhanced commitment to listening in
                  their lives beyond the classroom.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The pedagogical payoff of learning to listen in the Anthropocene is substantial and
                     undoubtedly exceeds the parameters of the Romantic classroom. It is a defiant gesture
                     against the anthropocentric work of letting go in the way it actively opens up subjects
                     to the more than human.

                              permanence, and stability. Learning to let go of salvation. Learning to let go of
                              hope. Learning to let go of death” (92).</span></div>
                     </div> What might have happened if Orpheus had only listened to Eurydice’s footsteps instead
                     of turning around to see her? Listening turns us outward, an act worth taking—especially
                     when it is toward a wasted environment.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note15" id="Note15_return"><sup class="super">

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Listening is also one of the “arts of noticing” that Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing identifies
                              as a tool for survival in the Anthropocene. See chapter 1 in The Mushroom at the End
                              of the World.</span></div>
                     </div> As I tell my students, to be listening is “a straining toward”; it opens us to the
                     unknown, the sonorous, an act that places us “on the edge of meaning” rather than
                     within understanding or meaning itself (Nancy 9, 7). This heightened sense of perception,
                     in turn, makes us more aware of perceptual bodies, both our own and of nonhuman others.
                     Listening is not only a way of “looking” with a “poetic feeling” in Clare’s sense,
                     but is also one strategy in the cultivation of an ethics of care for all that will
                     be wasted.</p>
               </div>
               <p>To listen is to be attentive to that which is elusive and unfamiliar. Moreover, when
                  listening is also synesthetic, as in the case of the sound sculptures used in class,
                  these bring the additional benefit of exposing “us to stimuli that may stress and
                  strain the ‘structures’ of sensory apprehension we have developed to organize sound,
                  sight, and touch into meaning” (Heard 58). To break us out of the habitual ways of
                  making sense of the world is one way to rethink our ways of being in the Anthropocene.</p>
               <p>Listening, as Salomé Voegelin notes, “produces me as a dynamic subjectivity intertwined
                  with the dynamic things . . . The sonic self finds the collective from his solitary
                  agency of listening through his body rather than through language” (94). As I try
                  to stress to my students, listening is a form of acting. To actively cultivate listening
                  students is to prepare them for greater civic and public engagement with the world,
                  waste and all. In sharpening their perceptions by calling attention to sound, and
                  particularly sounds that are wasting away, we create a new relation to the world by
                  inviting them to become more self-aware of the ways they are perceptible bodies, not
                  just reading and writing machines (which they often feel like in the thick of the
                  semester). If students learn to become, in the words of Chion, “more vigilant and
                  more active” (241) in the space of the classroom through lessons like this one, the
                  hope is that they will become more creative thinkers and problem solvers, more active,
                  perceptually aware citizens out in the community who will be committed to, in Donna
                  Haraway’s words, “staying with the trouble,” or working with and through the waste.</p>

               Rand notes, it is when “two terms are reversed according to the sequence, the order,

               an inversion that he calls “a small <span xml:lang="la" lang="la" class="foreign">Hysteron-Proteron</span>” as “the communication of pleasure is the introductory means by which alone the poet

               White’s <em>Natural History of Selborne</em> (1789). Barrington’s essay on birdsong first appeared in the <em>Philosophical Transactions</em>and was included in the third volume of Pennant’s <em>British Zoology</em> (Oxford Dictionary of National Biography). Barrington offers a more lyrical definition
               of birdsong: “a succession of three or more different notes, which are continued without
               interruption during the same interval with a musical bar of four crotchets in an adagio
               movement, or whilst a pendulum swings four seconds” (252).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               of natural history at this juncture, as eighteenth-century ornithological knowledge,
               contra a certain poetic tradition, comes to identify the male nightingale as the one
               who sings. See, for example, Daines Barrington’s 
               “Experiments and Observations on the Singing of Birds”
               (1773) and Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon’s <em>The Natural History of Birds</em> (1770–83). For an overview of this see Bethan Roberts’s

               software. Thomas discusses his process and the software used: “I start by listening
               to the sound carefully, going for a walk, and concentrating on the sound, then I do
               some sketches, and search the Internet for inspiration, nature related inspiration,
               such as flowers and insects, whatever I feel suits the sound vision that I see in
               my imagination. Then I experiment with forms in my 3D software to try to emulate these
               visions. I take the waveform of the sound, run it into 3Ds Max and activate simple
               geometry with the audio float controller then use the geometry as either an emitter
               or a surface constraint. Then I use a variety of different particle effects: FumeFX,
               KRAKATOA, RealFlow, Phoenix FD, and I especially like the XSI ICE system. Finally,
               I render with Vray” (qtd. in Komen).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
