            <p class="noCount">This essay explores how the feeling of living in the Anthropocene and its strange
               temporality affects how we teach, and specifically how we teach Romanticism. Teaching
               without a solid sense of futurity—the reigning affective state of our current moment—cuts
               at the core of pedagogical practice. Drawing on a recent experience of teaching an
               undergraduate-level course in Romanticism with a focus on “The Failures of Romanticism,”
               I suggest that Romantic-era texts can offer models of feeling appropriate to the affective
               experience of living amidst global ecological catastrophe, and maybe help us fail
               together better. When teaching without a future we must combine our melancholic embrace
               of vulnerability with other affective modes; in this essay I propose we imbue our
               Anthropocenic pedagogy with love, acceptance, and humor.

                     “4 Degrees,”
                     Anohni</a></p>
               <p>Two summers ago I was lucky enough to get married in Estes Park, Colorado, amidst
                  the grandeur and geologic variety of the Rocky Mountains. The day before the ceremony,
                  some friends and I visited Rocky Mountain National Park, driving along its famed Trail
                  Ridge Road, eventually stopping at a parking area located more than 12,000 feet above
                  sea level, where we gawked at a herd of grazing bighorn sheep. After getting our fill
                  of the sheep, we proceeded to walk up the gentle slope of the Tundra Communities Trail.
                  It brought us to a group of several mushroom rocks, so named for their mushroom-like
                  appearance, and which, a small plaque informed us, were composed of some of the oldest
                  rocks in the park. The granite base and schist cap date back approximately 1.7 billion
                  years, having been formed through volcanic and metamorphic processes respectively,
                  then covered for millions of years by a sea and the many layers of sediment it deposited
                  on top of them, sediment that would later erode away through several periods of glaciation.
                  So it happens that the mountain range’s ancestral rocks come to reemerge in our present.

               <p>The deep time of geologic processes was not the only thing on my mind over the course
                  of the nuptial weekend. Getting married, it turns out, tends to focus one rather intensely
                  on the present. In addition to basking in the love flowing between all those gathered
                  in celebration, there are pressing issues like ensuring that one’s eyebrows look good
                  (failure), figuring out how to lower the room temperature at the reception (mostly
                  failure), or getting the background music to the perfect volume level for all parts
                  of the room (success!). Even so, I had geologic time in the back of my mind. Living
                  in the Anthropocene has this effect: we can’t help but think of the unimaginably vast
                  stretches of time and space that brought the world to the state we find it in, while
                  also recognizing that we inhabit a present in which we are responsible for the anthropogenic
                  destruction rendering the future so tenuous. As the editors of <em>Arts of Living on a Damaged Planet</em> pose it, “living arrangements that took millions of years to put into place are being
                  undone in the blink of an eye” (Tsing et al. G1). The shock and sadness that accompany
                  this strange temporal situation came to mind during the reception, when I was at once
                  deeply touched by a family member’s remark that he and his wife would be celebrating
                  their fortieth anniversary next year, and deeply troubled by the thought that 40 years
                  from now my spouse and I might not have much of a world in which to celebrate that
                  milestone for ourselves. I recognize that talk of “the end of the world” or other
                  dire speculations on the fallout from climate change may seem alarmist, exaggerated,
                  or overly dramatic. But the reality of what we will have wrought by 2057, or whatever
                  arbitrary future target we set for ourselves, doesn’t matter as much as the feeling
                  that such calamitous things may come to pass. As David Collings writes in <em>Stolen Future, Broken Present</em>: “We are now caught in a surpassingly strange, horrific moment—a moment when we cannot
                  help but think, is it too late? Do we still have a future?” (11). We don’t and can’t
                  know for certain the answers to those questions, but that we exist in a moment when
                  asking them is not ridiculous enhances the urgency of responding to them. The affective
                  experience of living in the Anthropocene matters crucially when we consider, as Collings
                  writes, that “<em>the future is never just for the people of the future; without that future, what we
                     do now loses its force</em>. Without a future, there is no present and not much of a past” (19).
               </p>
               <p>I focus in this essay on how the feeling of living in the Anthropocene and its strange
                  temporality affects how we teach, and specifically how we teach Romanticism. Teaching
                  without a solid sense of futurity cuts at the core of the practice. In <em>Learning to Die in the Anthropocene</em>, Roy Scranton suggests that “the greatest challenge the Anthropocene poses . . .
                  is a philosophical one: understanding that this civilization is already dead” (23).
                  How does one teach—a profession predicated on the future and on stable structures
                  of civilization—with that realization? In the spring of 2016 I taught a course in
                  which that question was always present in my mind; through that experience I sought
                  to understand the intersections between Romanticism, ecological collapse, and the
                  role of affect in the space of the classroom. The course was a 200-level undergraduate
                  class on Romanticism I titled “The Failures of Romanticism,” and the conceptual premise
                  was that as much as Romantic writers exude optimism, in other ways the recognition
                  of Romanticism’s own failures is built into the project. With this focus, I asked
                  students to recognize one way we continue the legacy of Romanticism, given that we
                  now reckon with so many systems (economic, political, social, and of course, ecological)
                  falling apart. The experience of consistently bumming out my students about the fate
                  of the world, however, led me to think deeply about the pedagogical effectiveness
                  of such affective work. The neoliberal university in its terrifying ideal form would
                  turn faculty members into little more than customer service workers emitting mandated
                  positive affect like any other laborer in the precarious gig economy. Such a fate
                  in no way appeals to me, nor does it make much sense when contemplating ecological
                  catastrophe. Even so, I continued to wrestle with the nagging sense that melancholy
                  and anxiety might not be the best affects for pedagogically engaging with the Anthropocene.
               </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>So what to do, then? I would suggest that teaching in the Anthropocene calls for a
                     shared embrace of vulnerability, which ought to begin with the teacher’s own displays
                     of (often melancholic) feeling, but must not end there.

                              melancholy is the privileged affect of the Anthropocene. While he does note that the
                              “ecological thought . . . is realistic, depressing, intimate, alive and ironic all
                              at the same time,” I suggest that irony—and particularly playful, joyful irony—ought
                              to receive more attention and emphasis (Ecological Thought 16). I share with both
                              Chris Washington and Morton the sense that we can do without the irony of “postmodern
                              hipster posturing” and its “T-shirt sloganeering” (Washington 454; Morton, Hyperobjects
                              173).…</span></div>
                     </div> After the fall, we still exist, and we require other sensations. Collapse is, etymologically,
                     a <em>falling together</em>.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>From the Latin col- (together) labi (to fall). The OED notes that the participial
                              adjective “collapsed” appears to have emerged (from the Latin form, collapsus) before
                              the verb and noun usages.</span></div>
                     </div> Teaching Romanticism with this focus on failure and collapse reinforced for me my
                     sense that Romantic-era texts can offer models of feeling appropriate to the affective
                     experience of living amidst global ecological catastrophe, and maybe help us fall
                     together better. The poetics of sensibility in Charlotte Smith’s <em>The Emigrants</em> and <em>Beachy Head</em>, the extension of sympathy to the downtrodden in Mary Robinson’s <em>Lyrical Tales</em>, John Keats’s experiments with the core being of sensation and affect, and Mary Shelley’s
                     temporally layered contemplations of human finitude in <em>The Last Man</em>—all these textual encounters become newly inflected as we teach in a time when we
                     cannot choose but feel in radically different ways thanks to what we have wrought.
                     By the time we reached the end of the semester and read <em>The Last Man</em>, I (and, I think, my students) felt an affinity with its narrator and titular figure,
                     Lionel Verney, who writes to no one save “<span class="smcap">the illustrious dead,</span>” whom he bids “<span class="smcap">arise, and read your fall!</span>” (466). Like Verney, we now experience the deep temporal disruption wrought by the
                     Anthropocene. As Verney’s beloved Idris exclaims early in <em>The Last Man</em>, we too feel as if “already the to-morrow is come” (85).
                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>But even if we are “Too, too late for the fond believing lyre” and its forward-looking
                  messages of hope, teaching this class reinforced my sense that we cannot rely on despair
                  or sadness alone for our affective pedagogical modes. Unlike Verney, my students and
                  I did not have the option of responding to the recognition of global catastrophe by
                  embarking on a solitary voyage around the world’s oceans. We are here. We are alive.
                  As we find ourselves surrounded by the “haunted landscapes” characteristic of the
                  Anthropocene, the persistent pasts we’ve attempted to raze nevertheless remain, and
                  because of their ghostly presences, these pasts “relentlessly trouble the narratives
                  of Progress, and urge us to radically imagine worlds that are possible because they
                  are already here” (Tsing et al. G12). Or as Austra poses it in the opening track of
                  her poignantly Anthropocenic album <em>Future Politics</em>, “<a class="new" href="https://austramusic.bandcamp.com/track/we-were-alive">It’s like we were alive</a>.” After the fall, after the revelation that is apocalypse, we move forward with the
                  recognition that the vitality of humans and nonhumans always has been there, even
                  when we were too dull to sense it, and always will be there, even when we recklessly
                  pursue our own destruction. In the span of geologic time, the earth will be just fine,
                  even as climate change in our shorter-term span will render unimaginable suffering
                  for human and nonhuman beings. We need to act as if we were alive, even if it is already
                  too late for us. In the classroom, when teaching without a future, we must combine
                  our melancholic embrace of vulnerability with other affective modes; at the risk of
                  sounding like some sort of New Age self-help book, I propose we imbue our pedagogy
                  with love, acceptance, and humor.

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>When we teach, we put our loves on display. We embody and perform our loves not necessarily
                     of other people, but of the things that we teach, the things we attempt to commune
                     with and communicate to our students. This assertion likely calls to mind any number
                     of teaching narratives in which teachers profess their abiding passion for their subjects,
                     for their students, for teaching itself. Indeed, one might say that passion for one’s
                     subject material is an essential component of good teaching; we’ve all, at one point
                     or another, been either praised or shamed for the degree to which we express enthusiasm
                     for our subject material in the classroom. The unstated assumption is that the more
                     visible the passion, the better the teaching, and the better the teaching, the better
                     the learning. I hope to expand on our commonplace understanding of the relationship
                     between passion and learning by drawing attention to an affect intimately related
                     to love: namely interest, which Silvan Tomkins in his influential model refers to
                     as the “most seriously neglected” of the affects (337). A pedagogy of love requires
                     attunement to the transformations and rearticulations of interest (and perchance love)
                     by students. This is not to say that we should love our students and that they should
                     (nay, <em>must</em>) love us in return. Of course there are affective bonds between teacher and student,
                     but for a variety of reasons including the inappropriate forms of teacher-student
                     love that manifest at various levels of education, I call for something quite different.
                     The love that transpires moves through objects, not subjects. We love the objects
                     of interest; students themselves become interested in those objects; in the aftermath,
                     both teacher and student come to love (or not) an object of interest that is and is
                     not the object with which they began. That is to say, a pedagogy of love operates
                     iteratively. We iterate our love and students translate that love into a new iteration,
                     which we take up, transform, and reiterate.

                     eyes should kindle at once and mix and melt into our own; that lips of motionless
                     ice should not reply to lips quivering and burning with the heart’s best blood:—this
                     is Love. This is the bond and the sanction which connects not only man with man, but
                     with every thing which exists. (503–4)’</span> I draw on Shelley’s notion of love since it’s as much a theory of communication as
                  it is a contemplation of love. It figures love as a communicative process of tuning
                  or harmonizing signals. Love begins in what Roman Jakobson calls the phatic register
                  of communication, when an utterance exists primarily to test the status of the channel
                  (e.g., “Can you hear me now? Is this thing on?”). In a manner similar to how Maurice
                  Blanchot poses the communicative content of a work of literature, “What it says is
                  exclusively this: that it is—and nothing more” (22), love likewise references itself.
                  Love, however, operates in the interrogative. What love says is exclusively this:
                  <em>is it that</em>? Promising something ever more about to be, love requires response. As Shelley puts
                  it, love demands that “another’s nerves should vibrate to our own.” We approach love
                  with trepidation because the answer to “is it that?” may return as a resounding, Prufrockian
                  “That is not it, at all.” Phatic communication likewise risks never receiving a reliable
                  response indicating an open channel. When I speak to a silent classroom, it might
                  as well be engulfed in a wall of noise that my meek voice could never hope to rise
                  above. This pedagogy of love, then, is not some magical answer to the ambiguity of
                  transfer. Instead, I propose that we table the question altogether. Much is to be
                  gained from the acceptance of noise, darkness, obscurity, and the anxiety such obstacles
                  provoke.

                  <p>In testing our love for the objects we teach, students potentially become the signal-boosters
                     of the message. With no future, though, what kind of signal can we ever hope to hear
                     echoing back to us? First we must simply accept that communication moves through “enfeebl[ing]
                     . . . mediums,” as Shelley puts it in <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> (513). But a related strategy is to shift the agency of love to the side of those
                     objects that interest us (for me, always my first love, Keats). Embracing a Latour-inspired
                     distributed agency, one that posits the crucial role of nonhuman objects, ought to
                     come easily, given the language we use to discuss interest in loved objects. When
                     something <em>piques our interest</em>, it stabs us, leaving an imprint of itself in the shape of a wound, a remnant of
                     its liveliness. When interest wanes, the object <em>does nothing</em> for us. When we say <em>that interests me</em>, the causal emphasis ought to fall on the same side as the grammatical subject of
                     the sentence. When interest begins, we say <em>I’m into that right now</em>, emphasizing the spatial and temporal aspects of affective interest. Objects are
                     mediums for interest to navigate between the different things existing in the spaces
                     those objects occupy and coproduce. Such spaces emerge, evolve, and dissipate over
                     time. Using the intransitive valence, we can say that objects are always <span style="font-style:italic">interest</span>ing, always doing the activity of interest, whether or not some other object (like
                     a teacher or a student) comes along to respond to its vibratory activity.

                     </div> Here we can point again to Shelley’s model of love as a communicative process involving
                     requests for other lively objects to act in concert with us, to share interest and
                     thereby “kindle,” “mix,” and “melt” with one another. The bonds of this kind of love
                     connect not only humans to humans, and not only sentient beings to other sentient
                     beings, but “every thing which exists.”
                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>What are the payoffs then? For one, this approach to love in the realm of pedagogy,
                  when articulated via the kinds of vocabulary I’ve adopted throughout, counters some
                  of the reigning assumptions about the role of passion in teaching. Love in the sense
                  I invoke it operates not as something that one willfully adopts, but rather as an
                  affect acting through us and our interactions with others (humans and nonhumans).
                  One benefit of such a theoretical alignment is the possibility of novelty. Because
                  our interests choose us as much as we choose them, new things emerge without our conscious
                  designs necessarily implementing their arising. This other-oriented love, this haunted
                  and haunting love for dark objects, is also ethical and political in nature. It demands
                  that we reckon with the being of all things in the altered ecology of the Anthropocene.
                  Objects of interest speak to us. Sometimes we know not what they say until their voices
                  resound through our students’ taking up of those same objects, and thus we commune
                  with our students. We share that which is common, that which means. We correspond
                  by co-responding, responding together, to things that are not us. Thus a pedagogy
                  of love—not a selfish, but an <em>other</em>ish love; in Blakean terms, the love of a clod, not of a pebble—offers a means of
                  resisting a key ideological assumption of neoliberalism: the notion that we are all
                  autonomous, divided selves fully responsible for our own successes and failures, both
                  of which can only ever be adjudicated by the dictates of the market. Shelley argues
                  that “the great secret of morals is Love; or a going out of our own nature” (<em>Defence</em> 517). Poetry and imagination operate on us by strengthening our ability to go out
                  of our natures, and now that the Anthropocene urgently forces us to reimagine our
                  natures and the imbrication of our natures with our altered environments, we need
                  to exercise those faculties as much as possible. The classroom may be one of our last
                  discursive places in which such exercises are not only possible, but actively encouraged
                  and cultivated. This expansive notion of love and the forms it circulates in will
                  not prevent Anthropocenic despair, but attempting a pedagogy rooted in love may at
                  least help us and our students better attend to the world in which we find ourselves,
                  tenuous and temporary as it is. And attending to reality is the first step toward
                  imagining another one.

               <p>We hear a lot about climate denial in the United States, although perhaps less than
                  we used to, now that alternative strategies to the complete rejection of facts and
                  science have surfaced (“I’m no scientist!” “Sure, CO<sub>2</sub> plays a part, but we can’t know what other factors are involved,” or the utterly
                  inane, childish, nonsensical Pittsburgh-not-Paris excuse). Just as grieving individuals
                  work their way through denial and eventually proceed to acceptance, we as a species
                  (and especially the U.S. as a country) need to work toward that point. The difference
                  in this situation is that we need to accept not only the reality of anthropogenic
                  climate change and all that it has already and will continue to do; we need also to
                  accept that we are to blame. If a murderer were to pass through the five stages of
                  grief for his victim, I suppose that’s what humanity now faces. In this case, though,
                  the murder occurred through billions and trillions of tiny cuts, with all of us joining
                  in the slaying like so many Caesarian conspirators, albeit with many more stabs coming
                  from some peoples and places (i.e., the citizens, myself included, of the one country
                  that continues to deny the existence of climate change most vociferously, despite
                  having across history accounted for the greatest proportion of <a class="new" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/01/climate/us-biggest-carbon-polluter-in-history-will-it-walk-away-from-the-paris-climate-deal.html?">cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</a> of any one country).

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>If we treat the objects of our inquiry with love, honor, and care, we will ideally
                     be led to respect their full reality, even if we cannot fully apprehend it. When we
                     apply that thinking to the reality of climate change and global ecological catastrophe,
                     a corollary affective response will be acceptance, as long as we can find ways to
                     move through denial, anger, and other understandable responses to the recognition
                     of inhabiting a planet that may already be locked into a future in which human life
                     will more or less become impossible. For this reason, acceptance of our complicity
                     in creating the Anthropocene ought to become the emblematic affect of our new epoch.
                     The challenge is to prevent ourselves from moving immediately after acceptance into
                     quiescent despair. But first I should explain why I even conceive of acceptance as
                     an affect, given that it may more readily be understood as a logically reasoned position
                     one consciously adopts. True acceptance emerges precisely from <em>not knowing</em>. While I can certainly affirm that I am complicit in anthropogenic climate change,
                     I can never know exactly how I am folded into it (to gesture toward the etymology
                     of <em>complicit</em>, which comes from the Latin <span xml:lang="la" lang="la" class="foreign">plicare</span>, meaning to fold or to weave). The folds of causality and responsibility are aesthetic
                     in nature, meaning that we cannot know them, but we can feel their effects and affects.

                     </div> As Keats attempts with the Grecian urn and the mysterious “leaf-fring’d legend” which
                     “haunts about [its] shape,” the contours of my part in affecting the global climate
                     can only ever be probed by questioning contemplation, by being teased out of thought
                     and into embodied response by encounters with the ghostly objects moving about us.
                     When I type this sentence on my computer, I play a part in introducing more carbon
                     dioxide into the atmosphere. Yet it’s a part for which I do not know the lines, even
                     though I’m so obviously already standing on the stage. To accept is to feel one’s
                     presence in the drama that is the Anthropocene even while remaining in the dark about
                     how the play began and how it will end. The classroom becomes a recursive, iterative
                     performance of this pageant, one in which my embodiment of acceptance helps to guide
                     students into recognizing that they too share the stage with us all.
                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>Acceptance is thus a particularly performative affect. As is the case with Sara Ahmed’s
                  discussion of the stickiness of affect, my notion of acceptance involves how we orient
                  ourselves toward, and how we are oriented by, other subjects and objects. What is
                  the point of acceptance if we do not embody it forth for others? Here we arrive at
                  the strategy to make other outcomes than despair issue from acceptance. For an illustration
                  of this strategy, I turn to Jeff VanderMeer’s novel <em>Acceptance</em> (aptly titled for my purposes). <em>Acceptance </em>is the last volume in VanderMeer’s <em>Southern Reach</em> trilogy, a series that revolves around an unexplainable ecological catastrophe in
                  an unknown location described simply as Area X. Across the three novels we learn some
                  things about the past of Area X and its present situation, as well as characters’
                  attempts to make sense of the fundamentally altered world they find themselves in.
                  Toward the trilogy’s conclusion, one of the main characters provides this gloss on
                  acceptance specifically with respect to the new reality of Area X, but which can be
                  readily translated into a reflection on living in the Anthropocene: “The world we
                  are a part of now is difficult to accept, unimaginably difficult. I don’t know if
                  I accept everything even now. I don’t know how I can. But acceptance moves past denial,
                  and maybe there’s defiance in that, too” (338). To accept that we have no future,
                  to accept that we are to blame, is perhaps the best means we have for defiance today.
                  Acceptance marks a refusal to fight against things as they are, but it does not mean
                  that we refuse to work toward how things might otherwise be. The defiant force of
                  acceptance comes from the affectively embodied recognition of what we’ve done, even
                  while not fully knowing how or why we did it, or even precisely what it was. We thus
                  open a space for the future, even if it’s an already doomed one. A doomed future is
                  nonetheless a future, and it’s ours if we accept it.
               </p>
               <p>We might even venture beyond defiance and into what Jean Baudrillard, in a much different
                  context, calls “refusal by overacceptance” (219). I know that my love for Keats (or
                  any other writers/texts from Romanticism) will remain always devoid of any clear,
                  unambiguous vibratory response, but I accept and love nonetheless. And I know that
                  what I do now as a teacher might not matter if we have no future as a species, but
                  I accept and love nonetheless. Thence proceeds melancholy, but also joy, which is
                  what I find on every track of Anohni’s recent album, <em>Hopelessness</em>, and in particular on the track 
                  “4 Degrees,”
                  which provides the soundtrack to this essay’s opening. Encountered as quotations in
                  an essay, the song’s lyrics (such as “I want to see this world / I want to see it
                  boil,” or “I want to hear the dogs crying for water”) probably seem anything but joyful.
                  Indeed, they are disturbing, and deeply sardonic. But if something can be simultaneously
                  sardonic and sincere, this song accomplishes it. Anohni performs radical acceptance.
                  She sings with glee of her desire to “burn the sky” and “burn the breeze,” of reveling
                  in seeing “the animals die in the trees.” A purely sardonic reading of the song would
                  perhaps imagine Anohni performing the role of some crazed fossil fuel baron, cheering
                  on the destruction of the globe as we pursue four degrees of warming as if it were
                  a quarterly earning target (here, and throughout her album, she is not unlike Wordsworth
                  taking on different voices in <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, or Robinson making similar moves in <em>Lyrical Tales</em>). While that reading is certainly a valid one, we might also read in the affective
                  sincerity of her voice an admission and acceptance of her own complicity. Sure, those
                  in the extractive industries who actively work against the interests of reducing emissions
                  are easy to caricature as monstrous villains devoted to global destruction, but the
                  brilliance of Anohni’s song is its insistence that we are all monstrous. We are all
                  folded into this complicated mess, even if we try to get off the grid. The problem
                  is there is no off-grid. As Anohni sings in the final lines of the album, “We are
                  all Americans now.” No one escapes blame, even as different levels of blame are surely
                  warranted. While sorting out and apportioning blame in just ways is crucial for the
                  politico-economic realm, the more fitting affective and aesthetic answer is to belt
                  out an electro-pop number proclaiming just how mired in it we all are: “Let’s Go!
                  Let’s Go!” The song won’t do anything to stop rising CO<sub>2</sub> levels (and how could it?), but it does teach us something about the irony of acceptance
                  and the complexity of how it feels.

               <p>It may be a stretch to claim that 
                  “4 Degrees”
                  is funny, but it certainly has a kind of gallows humor beneath its macabre surface.
                  Does gallows humor become unfunny when the entire globe is approaching the scaffold?
                  In any case, the path from love to acceptance next takes me to humor, or at least
                  irony and the possibility of joyful laughter always residing in irony, even in its
                  darkest forms. In this final affective register I find the greatest value in what
                  I regularly do in my Romanticism classrooms, which I’ve modeled throughout this essay:
                  putting contemporary materials into relation with Romantic ones. As D. B. Ruderman
                  and Rachel Feder point out in their introduction to <em>Teaching Romanticism with the Contemporary</em>, this method may seem to risk “potential anti-historicist implications,” but they
                  counter that “sometimes one must think trans-historically in order to produce a historicist
                  understanding.” They continue, “it is possible to wield the contemporary to peel back
                  the cloak of canonicity that sometimes obscures Romantic literary experiments, all
                  the while making students better readers—indeed, Romanticist readers—of their own
                  literary, cultural, and historical moments.” One element of the current historical
                  moment that the Romantic and neo-Romantic pairings can illuminate is the set of geologic,
                  political, cultural, and ecological forces and effects that we have come to denominate
                  with the term Anthropocene.

               <p>In loving, honoring, caring for, and accepting our past histories and texts, and in
                  seeking to understand them in relation to our present and future in the Anthropocene,
                  contemporary materials help with the crucial task of privileging and supporting the
                  voices of nonnormative, oppressed, disadvantaged, or otherwise unjustly treated peoples.
                  In the political arena we need to align climate advocacy with broader social justice
                  issues; as Naomi Klein points out in <em>This Changes Everything</em>, those on the front lines of the climate fight, those inhabiting what she calls “Blockadia,”
                  are often indigenous peoples who’ve been systematically oppressed and abused while
                  not experiencing the benefits that the extractive industries have afforded to those
                  of us removed from the front lines. We need to do the same in the cultural realm.
                  With respect to pedagogy and living in the Anthropocene, queer and trans theory in
                  particular offer poignant perspectives (that Anohni released <em>Hopelessness</em> as her first album publicly announcing her trans identity while also engaging deeply
                  with issues around climate change strikes me as a fitting congruence). The knowledges
                  afforded by queer and trans perspectives teach us, among other things, what it means
                  to inhabit realities, environments, and embodiments that do not conform to normative
                  scripts of various kinds.

                  <p>In her book <em>Strange Natures</em>, Nicole Seymour offers a compelling union of queer theory and environmental criticism,
                     using the former’s means for resisting “the natural” to help us see more clearly the
                     world around us in all its nonnormative brilliance. Significantly, Seymour departs
                     from strains of queer theory that reject futurity outright.

                              that “a queer ecological focus on futurity can highlight the fact that lack of concern
                              for the future more accurately characterizes regimes such as heteronormativity and
                              global capitalism” (183).</span></div>
                     </div> She insists that queer ecology must make room for thinking the future, but instead
                     of a triumphalist, masculinist approach to environmentalism, she advocates for “a
                     specifically queer ecological ethic of care: a care not rooted in stable or essentialized
                     identity categories, a care that is not just a means of solving human-specific problems,
                     a care that does not operate out of expectation for recompense” (184). In both <em>Strange Natures</em> (particularly in her chapter on Shelley Jackson’s <em>Half Life</em>) and in her more recent work, Seymour insists on the value of adopting ironic, irreverent,
                     and humorous forms of engagement with ecological issues.

                     </div> Jack Halberstam writes at the end of <em>The Queer Art of Failure</em> that “to live is to fail, to bungle, to disappoint, and ultimately to die; rather
                     than searching for ways around death and disappointment, the queer art of failure
                     involves the acceptance of the finite, the embrace of the absurd, the silly, and the
                     hopelessly goofy” (187). Seymour works with a similar insight and ports it into the
                     realm of ecological thinking, feeling, and action. Writing about ecocinema, she argues
                     that “unserious affective modes can do serious work, sometimes even more successfully
                     than serious ones” (
                     “Irony and Contemporary Ecocinema”
                      73). That does not mean that serious affects have no place in discourses concerning
                     ecology, nor does it mean that we ought to stop seriously searching for ways to prevent
                     ecological catastrophe from getting worse. But it does mean that we ought to accept
                     that it’s already happened, that we’ve made it happen, and that as we fight against
                     the forces that brought us here, we ought to do so precisely by continuing to fail,
                     by reveling in our own absurdity, and by examining ourselves with irony, humor, and
                     care. To do so is a collective endeavor (“Failure loves company,” writes Halberstam),
                     and if we fail together, if we <em>co</em>-llapse, then “all our failures combined might just be enough, if we practice them
                     well, to bring down the winner” (121, 120).

                  <p>Romanticism is arguably a failed project, but it’s one that continues. We hear it

                     in <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>. We see it when gazing at the lush <a class="new" href="https://jackshainman.com/artists/el_anatsui">trash-pesties of El Anatsui</a>, who takes the detritus of global capitalism and converts it to sensuous excess,
                     not dissimilar to Keats’s translations of the materials of his belated literary inheritance
                     into something entirely richer, fairer, brighter than what came before him (all the
                     while failing more spectacularly than he ever could have succeeded). We sense and
                     feel it in the system-creating work of saxophonist <a class="new" href="https://colinstetson.bandcamp.com/">Colin Stetson</a> (after seeing him perform in between two days of reading Blake with my students, I
                     enthusiastically related to them that I had an epiphany: at a particularly intense
                     moment of his consistently visceral performance, a massive glob of spit fell from
                     his mouth to the floor; meanwhile his alien soundscapes continued to flow throughout
                     the room, and I realized that the saliva was a latter day “corroding fire,” stripping
                     away the surface of things to reveal the substance of his art as material all the
                     way down, but infinite nevertheless). And we think through it when we attempt to contemplate
                     the spatiotemporal vastness of climate change.

                     always to remind ourselves, shares an abode with joy): 
                     <blockquote class="quote">Future ages will celebrate, with grateful commemoration, the fourteenth of July; and

                        they have heard it recorded, that the National Assembly were seated! I think of these
                        things, and then repeat to myself with transport, “<span style="font-style:italic">I</span> was a spectator of the Federation!”

                        </p>
                     </blockquote> It is difficult, but we do get back again to present times, where we recall our failures,
                     as Williams would do in her later volumes of the <em>Letters Written in France</em>, as her enthusiasm about the revolution waned, even as she ultimately remained optimistic.
                     Perhaps now that our own ruin is so apparent to us, optimism is the wrong affect.
                     Let us adopt instead, modifying Lauren Berlant’s “cruel optimism,” a <em>kind pessimism</em>. Optimistic triumphalism in the realm of the Anthropocene would merely reinscribe
                     the same ideologies that got us here. “<a class="new" href="https://store.other-people.net/release/76126-nicolas-jaar-sirens">History Lesson</a>,” the closing track on Nicholas Jaar’s album <span style="font-style:italic">Sirens</span>, sums up the Anthropocene well: “Chapter one: we fucked up. / Chapter two: we did
                     it again, and again, and again, and again.” Let’s accept it, admit it, and do what
                     we can with love and care to move into a future that we cannot possibly know.
                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>Contemporary fiction, music, and art are crucial for helping us to imagine new worlds
                  with the kindness needed to accompany our pessimism. That means empathy, love, and
                  humor in the place of the nihilistic despair we find in popular postapocalyptic fictions
                  like <em>The Walking Dead</em>, which compulsively repeats hypermasculinist fantasies of pure capitalist competition
                  wherein the currency is life and success means taking someone else’s before they take
                  yours. Instead we need works like Kim Stanley Robinson’s <em>New York 2140</em>, in which most of Manhattan is underwater, but where new social and political forms
                  nevertheless take shape, and where the possibilities for the future are not simply
                  echoes of past moribund systems. We need music like Austra’s <em>Future Politics</em>, which refuses to accede to the stagnant politics of despair, hypocrisy, and moral
                  decrepitude embodied so horrifyingly by the current American president, and instead
                  creates a musical and lyrical vocabulary for sincerely envisioning a future of love,
                  empathy, and radical alterity. We need novels like Margaret Atwood’s <em>MaddAddam</em>, the final entry in the trilogy of the same name, in which we find humans, pigoons
                  (genetically engineered pigs designed to have their organs harvested), and Crakers
                  (a new species of human abandoned by their creator) forging solidarity across species
                  lines in the aftermath of ecological disaster and the death of most of the Earth’s
                  human population. Atwood’s novel manages uproariously funny moments throughout, even
                  as it also consistently reminds readers of the unimaginable suffering humans have
                  visited upon one another in its world.
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, then, where might we find humor in Romanticism? And more importantly,
                  where do we find the right kind of humor, one appropriate to confronting the Anthropocene?
                  As I so often do, I find answers to these questions through John Keats. Although he
                  might often be seen as an emblematically serious poet of High Romanticism, Keats is
                  also ridiculously funny, even in his darkest moments of despair. My friend and colleague
                  Michael Theune has pointed out (in many conversations with me over the years, and
                  recently in print) that when Keats writes of feeling like he is “leading a posthumous
                  existence” (<em>Letters</em> 359)—a phrase that becomes deeply entwined with narratives about Keats’s deathly
                  seriousness—he is making a pun! When he comes up with that phrase, Keats has arrived
                  in Italy, separated from his love and increasingly resigned to his imminent death.
                  As if dying from tuberculosis apart from all his loved ones weren’t bad enough, he
                  also had to endure a vicious journey by ship, and upon finally arriving in Naples,
                  he still could not go ashore for another 10 days, needing first to survive a quarantine
                  period. Writing from Rome a month later, Keats tells his friend Charles Brown about
                  using punning as a response to his horrific circumstances: “at my worst, even in Quarantine,
                  [I] summoned up more puns, in a sort of desperation, in one week than in any year
                  of my life” (<em>Letters</em> 360). It’s in this same letter that Keats reflects on the feeling of “leading a posthumous
                  existence.” Now, Keats loves to pun; we know this. Keats loves Shakespeare; we know
                  this as well. What we tend to miss with “posthumous existence” is that it combines
                  these two loves. As Theune explains, “Keats, exiled to Italy, away from his beloved
                  Fanny Brawne, is leading a life like that of Posthumus, the character from Shakespeare’s
                  <em>Cymbeline</em>, who is exiled to Italy and so separated from his beloved Imogen” (48). If Keats
                  can find space for humor in his grim personal circumstances, then surely we can do
                  so in the face of collective global doom.
               </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>But there remain more ways to learn humor from Keats. If humor and irony (and maybe
                     even acceptance) emerge out of failure, then Keats ought to be able to teach us a
                     thing or two. The critical discourse around Keats from his day to our own rests on
                     the idea that he begins his career with (mostly) embarrassing failures which he manages
                     to transform into affirmative successes a few years later. While this narrative certainly
                     has merit, I suggest that one under-regarded area of <em>late</em> failure, and <em>late</em> humor, is Keats’s final, long but unfinished poem, <em>The Cap and Bells; or The Jealousies</em>, or as Keats himself referred to it, 
                     “Lucy Vaughan Lloyd,”
                      so named for the moniker under which he planned to publish it. One imagines that as
                     Keats was travelling to Rome with the knowledge that he was surely to die there, perhaps
                     still feeling, as he had in February 1820, that he had “left no immortal work behind”
                     (<em>Letters</em> 263), he might have thought to himself, with a bit of gallows laughter, “And 'Lucy
                     Vaughan Lloyd' was the last thing I worked on?!” I don’t have the space here to develop
                     a full reading of the poem, but for the purposes of putting its humor into the context
                     of affective response to the Anthropocene, consider two things: the poem narrates
                     a civilization of fairies who seem to have a better understanding of the vast spaces
                     of the globe and their interrelations than do humans, even as the main fairy characters
                     desire to flee to the human realm and be with their human lovers; and at the same
                     time, the poem subtly gestures toward the defining global climate catastrophe of the
                     Romantic period, the eruption of Mount Tambora.

                              across the world, in which he recalls the following sight:Beheld afar off, in the

                     </div> The fairies understand the global environment, but they desire to inhabit an insouciant
                     and unknowing human perspective in which erotic desire is all that matters. At the
                     same time, during their journey the fairies Crafticant and Bellanaine conquer space
                     and time with more mastery than humans, given that they travel through the Gobi desert
                     to Afghanistan and arrive in western India, even though their journey began in Nepal.
                     Perhaps the imprecise or impossible aerial navigation results from Keats’s lack of
                     knowledge or interest in such matters. But if that is the case, it only supports the
                     poem’s broader satire, which demonstrates that the fairies who know too much simply
                     want to be silly like us and not worry about the broader world. The Anthropocene shows
                     us that we can’t afford to not know, but if we are to survive it, we also need to
                     laugh at, critique, and ironize the bases upon which our knowledges rest, particularly
                     now that the reigning political discourse in the United States treats knowledge with
                     such disdain. To do so is an affective challenge that will permeate all aspects of
                     cultural life; the classroom enables the possibility that such affective poses could
                     radiate outward, gathering strength and spreading to other people and spaces as we
                     all move into the future.

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">In both <em>Ecology without Nature</em> and <em>The Ecological Thought</em>, Timothy Morton argues that melancholy is the privileged affect of the Anthropocene.
               While he does note that the “ecological thought . . . is realistic, depressing, intimate,
               alive and ironic all at the same time,” I suggest that irony—and particularly playful,
               joyful irony—ought to receive more attention and emphasis (<em>Ecological Thought</em> 16). I share with both Chris Washington and Morton the sense that we can do without
               the irony of “postmodern hipster posturing” and its “T-shirt sloganeering” (Washington
               454; Morton, <em>Hyperobjects</em> 173). Washington suggests that Romantic irony, particularly in its tragic register,
               can help us “be relocated into the tragedy of the present rather than the farce of
               the future” (454). But the tragedy of the present needs the irony of the fool as well—an
               irony of joy as well as of sorrow, and utterly, embarrassingly sincere with respect
               to both.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               and future-thinking as heteronormative and pro-capitalist,” she maintains instead
               that “a queer ecological focus on futurity can highlight the fact that <em>lack</em> of concern for the future more accurately characterizes regimes such as heteronormativity
               and global capitalism” (183).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
