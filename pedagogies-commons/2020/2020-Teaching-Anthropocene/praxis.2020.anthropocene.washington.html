            <p class="noCount">This essay takes two experimental forms, both of which are meant to exemplify what
               I call “hyper-jump pedagogy.” The first form tracks backward, reading sex and gender
               in the work of Lucy Corin’s <em>One Hundred Apocalypses</em>, <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>, and Cormac McCarthy’s <em>The Road</em> to where the course began, the works of Mary Wollstonecraft and Jean-Jacques Rousseau,
               before lurching forward to <em>Wall-E</em>, where the course ended. The second essay form uses the <em>Romantic Circles Pedagogy Commons</em> Drupal platform to generate a random version of the essay with paragraphs disarranged.
               Both forms demonstrate how temporality in the Anthropocene disorients and defamiliarizes
               our beliefs about our place in relation to time. This disorientation and defamiliarization
               leads to a reconsideration of reproduction as it relates to sex, gender, and the family.</p>

                     </div> As we have seen, postapocalyptic Romanticism makes claims on us about human reproduction
                     and species extinction, the former often the forbearer of the latter, oddly, since
                     repeopling leads to warfare that extinguishes humanity in Byron’s poem and other texts
                     in this genre. Wollstonecraft, meanwhile, wants us to erase gender inequality in order
                     to achieve social equality but to do so in ways that proliferate ever-novel iterations
                     of sexual and moral love, both harbingers and enablers of more humans. In the end,
                     we postulated that perhaps the only way for such perpetuation to occur is by thinking
                     crosswise about extinction: human extinction necessarily precedes human reproduction.
                     Only once we accept that we have no future might there be a future, one worth fighting
                     for rather than against, one worth us all being post-Apocalyptasauri about. Perhaps
                     the present must be a barren blooming of the future if the future keeps demanding
                     more time to have less sex, less pleasure, and instead more pleasureless reproduction.
                     Perhaps Wall-E and EVE (the name not for nothing a call-back to the biblical paradise’s
                     Eve) are right in needing sexual and moral love to “raise” a plant not of their own
                     robotic nonreproducing loins, exampling a jointure whose sexual tumescence is undescribable,
                     a weird type of reproduction that is not human but a model for post-Apocalyptasauri
                     reproduction. Perhaps the Apocalyptasauri-that-is-us—our unbending belief in a future
                     paradise-to-come and like-minded climate-changing determination to prevent that future—means
                     that we should start fucking so that we may enjoy our sex before it is the last because
                     it will occur before whatever unannounced beginning, unheralded repeopling, may come,
                     which is too late to enjoy since by then “us” is erased (if we are not already under
                     erasure). Perhaps within that aporia exists the future inexistence of the existence
                     of the future human “species,” the post-Apocalyptasauri? These are odd, strange thoughts,
                     perhaps, but they are the thoughts we thought in this thought experiment of a class.</p>
               </div>
               <p>We generated only speculative answers to these questions in writing and discussion.
                  For one, we could sketch out a different reproductive futurity from the patrilineal
                  manscapes of <em>The Road</em> and <em>Mad Max</em>, as well as a <em>jouissance</em>, perhaps, that defies Rousseau’s notion of a last sex on earth in favor of Wollstonecraft’s
                  celebratory sexual energy. We thought that, maybe, the Apocalyptasaurus’s “last sex
                  on earth” introduced the possibility of new types of sex post-sex and with it re-people,
                  “people” who are people but not people as we currently conceptualize people, but rather
                  something radically different that we cannot yet know. It is a vision of futurity
                  that perhaps extends in ecological directions wherein humans and the world become
                  more entangled (perhaps in Karen Barad’s sense of “quantum entanglement,” wherein
                  the subject and object mutually create the other as well as new spacetimes through
                  intra-action) than we currently understand, leading us into the maze of a territory
                  for which we do not as yet have a map. It is as if we have hyper-jumped into a future
                  and find our bearings completely unbalanced. Such a scenario traverses both Edelman’s
                  “no future” and Sheldon’s “child-to-come” since both are predicated on current notions
                  of reproduction that are steadfastly human, although Sheldon does want to think beyond
                  such categories. Perhaps the future will not be a future in human terms? Or perhaps
                  Corin’s work affords us space for thinking beyond white heteronormative patriarchy,
                  beyond the social contract(s) as we know it/them.</p>
               <p>Although such reading was beyond the scope of this course, both Edelman and Sheldon
                  touch on aspects of our analysis of Corin’s flash fiction and help delineate the final
                  conclusions, such as they are, of the course. On our last day of reading, we considered
                  the last flash fiction piece in her book, “What is was like was,” to think about the
                  Apocalyptasaurus fucking in the field. <span class="quote">‘Stars fell in unison, and in a mossy grove on the hill, the Apocalyptasaurus was
                     having the last sex on earth. I headed to the mobile unit. I hadn’t brought any animals
                     because that’s how shortsighted I am. <em>Something will provide</em>, I seemed to be thinking, but who knows anymore, I haven’t had to think in so long
                     I don’t know when I’m doing it or not. I drifted away. Unpeopling, repeopling, all
                     in the past with the automatic sprinklers, and soon the cries of leftover apocalypses
                     were all that remained. Some of the things we knew were true. I’d only wanted to keep
                     the bells ringing. (182–83)’</span>Throughout the course we established a distinction between apocalypse and postapocalypse.
                  Apocalypse derives from the Greek <em>apocalypsis</em> and means “revelation,” as in a revelation of a renewed paradise on earth. In works
                  like the ones in this course, this definition clearly does not apply. Postapocalypse
                  means what comes after any renewed paradise is possible, when one lives with what
                  remains of the human species in the ruins of societal structures. Corin’s fiction,
                  in general, confounded us, but we excavated from this piece by-now familiar course
                  themes. Stars falling imply disaster since “disaster” stems from the Latin <em>dis-aster</em>, or, as <em>dis-</em> means “apart,” the sense becomes a star apart from the sky, literally a falling,
                  or in some cases, a dis-eased star. At once we are in postapocalyptic time even as
                  the Apocalyptasaurus, seemingly a representative of paradise, engages in “the last
                  sex on earth.” What could this possibly mean, we asked? Is it heralding a new form
                  of sex, post-Apocalyptasaurus sex? What would that mean? And what does “unpeopling,
                  repeopling” mean? Is the Apocalyptasaurus’s sex unpeopling the earth, removing all
                  traces of humanity and, thereby, somehow, repeopling it with new people? Why does
                  the speaker wish she has “brought . . . animals?” To carnivorously continue the human
                  species? Or are animals necessary somehow for whatever the Apocalyptasaurus’s sexual
                  ritual performs and produces? Is the Apocalyptasaurus a metaphor for capitalism and,
                  like capitalism, needs to put animals to death for food? In the biblical paradise
                  of the Garden of Eden, humans did not eat animals, so is this an indication of paradise’s
                  contortion into nightmarish postapocalypse? If “leftover apocalypses were all that
                  remained,” is that an indication that only remnants of paradise survive? Does “leftovers”
                  fulfill this capitalist eating metaphor? If so, is that postapocalypse? Is that connected
                  to the repeopling, the “re-people” being those leftovers? That the bells no longer
                  seem to be ringing appears to be a metaphor for erstwhile society, but why a campanological
                  metaphor that seems specifically to reference churches? What “things” and why were
                  “some” (and why only some?) of them “true”?</p>
               <p>The second text is Rebekah Sheldon’s <em>The Child to Come</em> (2016), which stakes out different ground in relation to the figure of the child
                  and reproductive futurity: <span class="quote">‘The child binds the realization of nonhuman vitality back into the charmed circle
                     of the human, encircling the future in the promise of generationality. For it is not
                     just the case that the child retro-reproductively forecloses the future but also the
                     figuration of the child as the self-similar issue of the present, the safe space of
                     human prosperity and a return to a manageable nature, forecloses the mutational in
                     the reproductive. And yet this grafting of the culture of life over the <em>culturing</em> of life generates a queer child-figure whose humanity is always suspiciously intimate
                     with other-than-human forms-of-life. (6)’</span>On Sheldon’s reading of the figure of the child—which for her is not tied to the symbolic
                  order necessarily, as Edelman thinks, but to a historical post-1960s world that sees
                  this figure as its future in the atomic age—it is, nonetheless, like the critical
                  views Edelman’s polemic rails against, linked to reproductive futurity and the survival
                  of the species. More children must be produced for the species to continue. Yet Sheldon
                  also finds in the figure a double bind: on one hand, “the reproductive” that bars
                  any mutational genealogical deviation from species homogeneity and, on the other,
                  a grafting of the child onto life in so unnatural a way that it ensures such mutation
                  and enwraps the figure with nonhuman possibility. Like the plant raised by those nonhumans,
                  Wall-E and EVE, Sheldon theorizes a queer child-figure whose nonhuman entanglement
                  evades the no-futurism of Edelman’s queer non-child-figure at the heart of the death
                  drive of the species. Contra Edelman, Sheldon allows for a future, but one that avoids
                  the manacles of heteronormative cultures of life Edelman fears and that instead prevents
                  heterogeneity in whatever-is-to-come.</p>
               <p>Corin’s <em>One Hundred Apocalypses and Other Apocalypses</em> proved at once to be the most illuminating and infuriating text (or set of texts)
                  for interpretation. In my courses, I place emphasis on our own thoughts and interpretations
                  that emerge from collective class discussion, making close reading and what follows
                  from it the prime directive steering the ship. To this end, I rarely introduce outside
                  secondary theories, and did not in this course, but it would pay, perhaps, to briefly
                  mention two that relate to the class’s thinking. The first is Lee Edleman’s <em>No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive</em> (2004). He writes, regarding the notion that the figure of the child underwrites
                  any plausible notion of futurity: <span class="quote">‘For the social order exists for this universalized subject, this fantasmatic Child,
                     a notional freedom more highly valued than the actuality of freedom itself, which
                     might, after all, put at risk the Child to whom such a freedom falls due. Hence, whatever
                     refuses this mandate by which our political institutions compel the collective reproduction
                     of the Child must appear as a threat not only to the organization of a given social
                     order but also, and far more ominously, to social order as such, insofar as it threatens
                     the logic of futurism on which meaning always depends. (11)’</span>For Edelman, queerness threatens the social order because the social order orders
                  itself on what Edelman calls “reproductive futurism,” the need to replicate ourselves
                  and our present through our children in the imagined future that recursively structures
                  our present. Spawning generationally equals not only our genetic perpetuity but humanistic
                  species vitality in general. Edelman argues, though, that “no future” is preferable
                  to this type of future since this future requires a heteropatriarchal normativity
                  that shuts down any queerness. In that sense, Edelman’s no future constitutes a to-be-hoped-for
                  future-to-come in its negatively worked inclusivity. To put Edelman’s work in the
                  context of the Anthropocene: we think our future will somehow be apocalyptic, a miraculous
                  return to the past in a paradisiacal future, wherein even if we do not survive, our
                  offspring will. As Edelman writes, we always seek to protect against that very future’s
                  arrival with an endless <em>replication of the present</em> in the form of more children who are our replicants. However, to press Edelman’s
                  thinking further into the postapocalyptic Anthropocene mud, since climate change projects
                  against just such a future that features generations of children, we enter Edelman’s
                  notion of queer no-futurity by force, as it were. For everybody. “No future,” in this
                  postapocalyptic scenario, queers its own queerness and refuses the idea that we should
                  not continue to reproduce. Instead, perversely, for there to be “no future” in the
                  Anthropocene, we must reproduce precisely to preserve the human species in the present,
                  to stave off a future with no people. If <em>reproducing the present</em> occurs through this endless replication of it in hetero-children, then it can also
                  occur through an endless replication of queer, trans, or nonbinary children since
                  what is really being produced are not children but time, the present. Queerness, on
                  my reading of Edelman, then, is a paradoxically positively negative force in that
                  it prevents such reproduction and thereby undoes heteronormative meaning-making, the
                  social structures that cage queerness within these same limiting, confining frameworks
                  of meaning, even as it also allows for new possibilities of nonheteronormative reproduction
                  in the context of the Anthropocene’s strange temporality.</p>
               <p>Roughly around this time we came to the end of our (re)reading of Rousseau and Wollstonecraft
                  and made the hyperdrive jump to McCarthy’s <em>The Road</em>.</p>
               <p>The more recent <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>, celebrated for its feminist take on the road movie, evinces a Christological fixation
                  at odds with the version of human mortality <em>The Road </em>manifests. Mad Max is initially depicted as crucified, his arms splayed out, lashed
                  upright to the front of a vehicle. Later, this metaphor is made explicit as he, Christlike,
                  gives his blood to save the too-weak Imperator Furiosa, the purported heroine of the
                  film that lends it a feminist voice. As many students pointed out in their essays,
                  Immorten Joe, the “bad guy” leader of the society we see in the film, is purposefully
                  associated with a god figure. Again and again, in discussion and essays, we recurred
                  to Joe’s promise to Nux, one of his “war boys”: “I myself will carry you to the gates
                  of Valhalla. You shall ride eternal, shiny and chrome.” Religious discourse, students
                  argued, ultimately held out only illusory hope for a future, just as Joe’s promise
                  turns out to be bunk, a claim meant to con his followers into doing his bidding. In
                  our close reading of the last paragraph of <em>The Road</em> we had discovered something similar in postapocalyptic fiction: the future is constantly
                  theorized in relation not to the hope of a future—since there is no future on earth
                  for humans in a religious, or any, sense—but to procreation, the biopolitical production
                  of new bodies. The unvoiced theme of postapocalyptic literature, then, according to
                  this reading, is sex, literally the sexual act understood as a procreative act that
                  leads to children. In <em>The Road</em>, the boy finds a family with other children to carry on once his father passes, whereas
                  others in the novel seek to cannibalize children. Immorten Joe, on the other hand,
                  keeps a stable of women as his consorts, not for reasons of love, but because he uses
                  them as birthing vessels for him to breed new war boys. War, again, which was for
                  a moment no more, is given birth again to glut—the war boys take marauders like Max
                  and use them as blood donors to help themselves survive although they do not have
                  what Captain McCrea of the Axiom would call “life.” Indeed, they have only a “half-life,”
                  as it is termed in the film.</p>
               <p>These final lines provided much room for discussion and despair. In a classroom close
                  reading exercise, students spent ten minutes writing on these sentences. Subsequent
                  discussion resulted in, initially, an either-or situation: either the natural world,
                  “older than man,” preexists humanity and will perhaps continue postperishing of the
                  species; or, for other students, humans’ capacity for wholesale destruction will tow
                  the world in its wake to inexistence. But neither solution solves the problem of what
                  the “mystery” is. Is it simply that the world is completely alien from humans and
                  hence a thing of mystery that we cannot understand? Or is the mystery that humans
                  will get no answers since the world is indifferent to their plight? Is this why the
                  trout are inscribed with “maps and mazes,” at once signifying being able to find the
                  right path and to find oneself, for however long, maybe five minutes or forever, lost
                  without a map to the maze’s just-around-the corner exit? One requires a road to somewhere,
                  the other a road to nowhere. Eventually, our reading decided, the humanless glens
                  hum with mystery because no answers are possible; we cannot know prehumen existence
                  fully, nor can we glimpse the future, even if that future includes humans. We are
                  lost even though we think we are moving forward along a temporal axis mapped out for
                  us—and this is one more reason to experiment with hyper-jump pedagogy. Our belief
                  in a future may be not only impossible but also irrelevant: we are mapless in time’s
                  nonhuman maze. At the same time, since this “thing . . . cannot be made right again,”
                  we wondered whether the novel finally argues that these glens older than man have
                  been irrevocably destroyed by humans. Perhaps, according to the novel, humans should
                  cease to exist, some students suggested. Perhaps the man’s wife, an apparently cold-hearted,
                  faithless villainess, who leaves him and their son in order to enter the darkness
                  and die, had the right suicidal idea about human reproduction and extinction in that
                  the former should cease and the latter increase? (This suggestion, we would later
                  see, was incorrect because it is just another form of the novel’s misogyny.)</p>
               <p>Over several weeks our close readings of fictional texts provided us an overview of
                  how postapocalyptic literature configures sex and gender. In these narratives, women
                  are reduced to little more than historically heteronormative pieces on patriarchy’s
                  chessboard (patriarchy being the player whose king always checkmates). Sex disappears
                  in these texts but reproduction, however weird in form, remains. The nihilism of Byron’s
                  
                  “Darkness,”
                  for instance, recurs to Plato’s <em>khora</em>, the womb or breadbasket of the world preceding the world itself, personified in
                  his poem as a “darkness” at the end of the world: “Darkness . . . she was the universe”
                  (81–82). As dark womb, mother to a dead race and world, khoratic darkness becomes
                  cyclical abortive genesis, birthing nothing since its offspring has expired. It is
                  perhaps a kind of barren nonflowering, like those Wollstonecraft says characterized
                  women: “one cause of this barren blooming I attribute to a false system of education,
                  gathered from the books written on this subject by men who, considering females rather
                  as women than human creatures” (10). Perhaps the most famous postapocalyptic contemporary
                  work, besides the necrophiliac navel-gazing of <em>The Walking Dead</em>, is McCarthy’s dreary neoliberalism-championing mansplainer that takes as its <em>raison d’etre</em> the continuance of the patrilineal in the form of a father and son who, when they
                  find the world’s last lonely can of Coca-Cola, remind us, like that other mainstream
                  mansplainer, <em>Mad Men</em>, that such lineages always want to “buy the world a Coke.” Patrilinealism is a hungry,
                  hungry hippo for capitalism, and thus goes hand-in-hand, as we’ve seen, with the state.
                  In the novel, before the man’s wife leaves him to take death for a lover, comparing
                  herself, to make sure we get the misogynistic point in neon red-district lights, to
                  a “faithless slut” whose faithlessness breaks the social contract, they reenact the
                  Rousseau-Wollstonecraft encounter (as we will see below): “there was no argument.
                  The hundred nights they’d sat up debating the pros and cons of self destruction with
                  the earnestness of philosophers chained to a madhouse wall” (59). They are not “survivors,”
                  she declares, but “the walking dead in a horror film,” a similar distinction <em>Wall-E</em> makes (59). Meanwhile, the misogynistic portrayal of the mother figure who appears
                  at novel’s end, “adopting” the orphaned boy, depicts her as the bad kind of looney
                  tune, not at all like Bugs Bunny: a religious zealot who worships at the feet of a
                  hope the final lines of the novel melancholically dispel even as its heteronormativity
                  equates the human species with its masculine noun: “Once there were brook trout in
                  the streams in the mountains. You could see them standing in the amber current where
                  the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in
                  your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns
                  that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could
                  not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things
                  were older than man and they hummed of mystery” (286–87).</p>
               <p>One theoretical underpinning of the course was that postapocalyptic literature, though
                  ostensibly about the end of humanity, carries us back to the future, to the fundamental
                  debate of Enlightenment politics that reappears in allegorical form in postapocalyptic
                  literature. In postapocalyptic worlds, the disappearance of governmental and social
                  institutions forces humans into a familiar (strangely, it is because these options
                  are what disappeared) choice: libertarian anarchism—everyone in it for themselves—versus
                  a new form of social-contract democratization for living together in a world where
                  humans appear intent on killing each other off. This distinction is, at base, the
                  difference between the thought of Thomas Hobbes and Rousseau. Both writers had their
                  own theories about how to create self-governing societies that could avert the “war
                  of all against all” we see depicted in our return to “the state of nature”—that imagined
                  theoretical space of the Enlightenment—in postapocalyptic literature (Hobbes 76).
                  This theoretical space structured Enlightenment debates over the proper role of government
                  in citizens’ lives, leading to, through legal codification, covenants structuring
                  the state’s politics. State-of-nature debates anticipate postapocalyptic literature,
                  then, a genre that originated in 1816’s “the year without a summer” when Romantic-period
                  authors began writing “last man” and “end-of-the-world” poems and novels. In poems
                  such as Byron’s 
                  “Darkness”
                  —which we read, annotated, and discussed on the first day of class as a kind of hors
                  d'oeuvre, just as humanity is for “War” in the poem—humans must start over in forming
                  governmental structures, building societies, or, as is so often the case in postapocalyptic
                  literature, engaging in species-wide warfare that hastens their ultimate demise. “War,”
                  the speaker of the poem tells us, “which for a moment was no more / did glut himself
                  again” (38–39). Hobbes’ prediction—that war will proliferate without a social contract
                  headed by a strong monarch who can restrain people—turns out, for Byron’s field-defining
                  vision of postapocalyptic worlds, to best Rousseau’s claim that people in this savage
                  state of nature will live contentedly alone or make common cause to survive (and here
                  we can hear echoes of the <em>Wall-E</em> choice between stupefied survival or satisfied living as well).</p>
               <p>Wollstonecraft of course also disagrees with Rousseau that women are dominant in society
                  and argues consistently against this idea in her book, and our class found her deconstruction
                  of Rousseau’s pathology to be a forceful corrective to Enlightenment debates about
                  sex and gender. In short, by claiming sexual love gets banished in society in favor
                  of moral love, Rousseau banished it from his own thinking, according to Wollstonecraft,
                  thereby neutering his vision of society of any but reproductive purposes (as a psychobiographical
                  note, Rousseau supposedly had five children and sent them to orphanages). <em>Jouissance</em>, then, finds no place in Rousseau’s society. Wollstonecraft, on the other hand, does
                  not see sex solely as a matter of reproduction—it is a means of <em>jouissance</em>, of pleasure, of coming to the other. While many critics debate the status of sex
                  in Wollstonecraft’s work, she actually unleashes sexual energy into Enlightenment
                  and Romantic discourse as a positive force, one that is natural whereas sex-as-species-reproduction
                  alone is, for her, as we saw in her reading of Rousseau, unnatural. Neither the prude
                  some find nor the slut others fashion, Wollstonecraft in her feminism avows both sexual
                  liberation and true love as progressive politics between individuals.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As scholars of the Enlightenment and Romanticism will recognize, many of these questions
                     require historical and theoretical contexts to flesh out the terminology, concepts,
                     and ideas. As the nature of the course was more broadly interdisciplinary and contemporary
                     than would permit a full exploration of, say, “sensibility,” we made do with concise,
                     though hopefully lucid, explanations. We glossed sensibility as an emotive attribute
                     ascribed to women at the time, aligning them with emotional ontological states in
                     contrast to men’s ostensibly more rational ontology. Some of this we returned to in
                     earlier chapters of Wollstonecraft’s book to see, now, the impact of comments that
                     had proved recalcitrant to our understanding the first time through.

                              a kind of subordinate beings, and not as a part of the human species, when improveable
                              reason is allowed to be the dignified distinction which raises men above the brute

                              elegancy of mind, exquisite sensibility, and sweet docility of manners, supposed to

                     </div> Doing so helped us realize how Wollstonecraft turns the tables on Rousseau, accusing
                     him of being the one overwhelmed and controlled by emotion to the extent that it distorts
                     his reason. Therefore, we realized, Wollstonecraft is proposing a solution to Rousseau’s
                     delusive impassioned nature: he needs either to masturbate and alleviate his unstoppable
                     desire for real sex, or to have real sex and put the brakes on his full-throttle masturbation.
                     Given that Wollstonecraft proscribes masturbation subsequently in her text, it would
                     seem odd, then, to prescribe it here; this must mean that she urges the latter. With
                     the phrase, “had he given way to these desires,” she advocates that he enter the world
                     and expend his lasciviousness in carnal pleasure with other humans. Here, a student
                     pointed out the word “natural” as the opposite of Rousseau’s claim that “moral love”
                     is “unnatural.” In fact, what we discovered is that Wollstonecraft reverses Rousseau’s
                     argument entirely: in society, sexual love is necessary to preserve the imagination
                     lest one give in to self-denial (again, we can see Rousseau’s sexual anxiety play
                     out in the castration fantasy of <em>Julie</em>’s rewriting of the story of Abelard and Heloise), which debauches the purity of the
                     imagination. Sex, for Wollstonecraft, despite her proclamations elsewhere in this <em>Vindication</em>, is natural and necessary. Nor, as for Rousseau, is sex merely reproductive in nature
                     but rather vital to mental preservation. Men are ruled by their passions so strongly
                     that it leads them into the error of becoming passionless, of fantasizing about sex
                     rather than engaging in it, thereby distorting their reason. Men are not, as Rousseau
                     thinks, enchained by women’s love but rather by their own mental enslavement to their
                     own unfulfilled desires. To put it differently, as I have written elsewhere, if for
                     Rousseau the state of nature requires a social contract and the social contract requires
                     the state of nature—a seeming impossibility given his demarcation of the two spaces,
                     yet one that his work nonetheless forwards—then, on Wollstonecraft’s reading of Rousseau,
                     the state of nature in the social contract requires sex, and the social contract in
                     the state of nature needs moral love (Washington).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Derrida famously reads masturbation in Rousseau as but another figure for supplementarity
                  (or what Derrida otherwise calls “the trace” or <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">différance</span>) in Rousseau’s deconstruction of speech and writing, and students likewise zeroed
                  in on a passage in Wollstonecraft on sexual gratification and the denial of one’s
                  passions that we developed into a critique of Rousseau (Derrida, <em>Grammatology</em> 165–71). As Derrida notes, in <em>The Confessions</em> Rousseau has, in society, abjured sex for masturbation because the supplement of
                  non-sex fills the lack of a sexual situation with his beloved adopted <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maman</span> that was, unconsummated, itself sex as non-sex. Masturbation supplements the lack
                  of real sex that, precisely because it needs to be supplemented, is not “real” enough
                  in its realness, or even real at all, and not more real than the fantasy with which
                  it must supplement itself. Masturbation, the lack of real sex, is therefore realer
                  sex for Rousseau than real sex. Wollstonecraft’s critique/rebuke appears in chapter
                  V on male authors who have made women objects of pity: <span class="quote">‘But all Rousseau’s errors in reasoning arose from sensibility, and sensibility to
                     their charms women are very ready to forgive! When he should have reasoned he became
                     impassioned, and reflection inflamed his imagination instead of enlightening his understanding.
                     Even his virtues also led him farther astray; for, born with a warm constitution and
                     lively fancy, nature carried him toward the other sex with such eager fondness, that
                     he soon became lascivious. Had he given way to these desires, the fire would have
                     extinguished itself in a natural manner; but virtue, and a romantic kind of delicacy,
                     made him practise self-denial; yet, when fear, delicacy, or virtue, restrained him,
                     he debauched his imagination, and reflecting on the sensations to which fancy gave
                     force, he traced them in the most glowing colours, and sunk them deep into his soul.
                     (95)’</span>In order to explicate Wollstonecraft’s somewhat densely stated estimation of Rousseau,
                  we asked some word-level questions. What does “sensibility” mean in this context and
                  why would it be something that leads one into “errors”? How does “impassioned” work
                  in opposition to “reasoned”? Or how does “imagination” work against “understanding”?
                  How can virtue, which should provide a moral compass for a life of noble rectitude,
                  lead one “farther astray”? Wollstonecraft seems to be implying that Rousseau “should
                  have given way to these desires” of his for the other sex. But why? Usually we link
                  debauchery to a physical act in accord with “lascivious,” so why does Wollstonecraft
                  claim it was his imagination, as if his imagination itself were some eighteenth-century
                  libertine, that did all this debauching? What, moreover, does “self-denial” mean in
                  this context? Is she recommending that he should masturbate—perform “auto-affection”
                  rather than “self-denial”—to relieve his lasciviousness rather than have sex? Or have
                  sex rather than fantasize about it?</p>
               <p>Both of these comments, the students noted, deplore the role of women in the state
                  of nature and in society. In the second instance, they pointed out, Rousseau, perhaps
                  unintentionally, lapses into a weird paradox, since he positions women as kings ruling
                  over society. In the first passage, students noted that women are explicitly associated
                  with objects for men in the state of nature: <span class="quote">‘The savage, lacking any sort of enlightenment, experiences passions only of the latter
                     kind; his desires do not go beyond his physical needs; the only goods in the world
                     he knows are food, a female, and repose, and the only evils he fears are pain and
                     hunger. I say pain and not death, for an animal will never know what it is to die,
                     and a knowledge of death and its terrors is one of man’s first acquisitions upon leaving
                     the animal condition. (34–35)’</span> Rousseau’s idea that females are goods to be possessed led the class to question
                  whether or not Rousseau’s other ideas were made in good faith and could be taken at
                  face value (indeed, one question we would inconclusively pose later in the semester,
                  borrowing the parlance of <em>The Road</em>: is Rousseau a “bad guy”?). The second passage on gender in the <em>Discourse</em> that students repeatedly returned to appears less bold-facedly retrograde in its
                  gender assumptions but more complicated for the genuine aporia it opens in Rousseau’s
                  state-of-nature politics. Rousseau distinguishes two types of love, the sexual and
                  the emotional, which he calls “the moral side of love”: <span class="quote">‘The physical is the universal desire that leads one sex to unite with the other;
                     the moral is what shapes desire and focuses it on a single object, or at least makes
                     the desire for the chosen object more forceful. It is easily seen that the moral side
                     of love is an unnatural sentiment, born of social custom and honoured by women with
                     much care and skill in order to establish their power over men and so make dominant
                     the sex that ought to obey. (49)’</span>If, for Rousseau, the creation of society leads to inequality, then it appears that
                  this inequality manifests, not by means of the enclosure of land and subsequent capitalistic
                  divisions this introduces (“the true founder of civil society was the first man who,
                  having enclosed a piece of land, thought of saying, ‘this is mine,’ and came across
                  people simple enough to believe him” [55]), but through power machinations performed
                  by gender involutions. It seems, students suggested, that for Rousseau inequality
                  in society occurs via a script-flip: women, submissives who obey in the state of nature,
                  become dominatrices using “moral love” to entrain men to obey them in society. Sexual
                  love, for Rousseau, is natural to humans, whereas deeper attachment and sentiment
                  is a perversion of the true state of things (perhaps this is the real key to Rousseau’s
                  <em>Julie, or the New Heloise</em> [1761] in that the lovers are prevented from being together and, according to Rousseau’s
                  views here, as well they should be). Following Rousseau’s logic, physical or sexual
                  love in the state of nature is acceptable because it produces no attachment between
                  the solitary individuals living in that state—sex is just an urge to be sated—whereas
                  in society women form attachments to men not through physical seduction but by enticing
                  them to <em>feel</em>, to have real feelings, moral love, for women. The great enemy of the human condition
                  for Rousseau, then, is love but not sex, which flourished in the state of nature,
                  but ceases in society when confronted and shackled by love. This, we said, puts a
                  new spin on his famous opening line that “man was born free, and everywhere he is
                  in chains” because women have men in chains by their love (<em>Social</em> 45)! The last sex on earth, for Rousseau, it turns out, occurred in the state of
                  nature and human contact in society is therefore no more than mere facility to reproduction
                  of the species. Moral love erases sexual pleasure in society.</p>
               <p>Although I lack the space to cover every aspect of our discussions on Rousseau and
                  Wollstonecraft, I want to highlight some of the passages that students fixed on since
                  these passages, in our recyclical journey through them, bespeak the dilemma we had
                  begun to sketch: should humans accede to extinction or somehow find a way to reproduce,
                  to live in ways that are more than mere survival? Beyond reading these thinkers and
                  discussing the thought experiment of the state of nature, we had not set an agenda
                  when we initially read these two difficult texts. Very slowly, as our understanding
                  of the two authors increased, we circled in on key moments in the texts that seemed
                  to encapsulate not only larger points about the ideas the authors were developing
                  but also, more crucially for us, evasions of certain other ideas. Regarding these
                  evasions, students, for instance, both in our class discussions and in their short
                  essays (our first paper was an exploratory one on Rousseau), found Rousseau to be
                  an intriguing thinker but one who had little to say about gender (we could of course
                  have looked at <em>Emile</em> [1762], which would have bolded his gender concerns, but since that work is not explicitly
                  focused on the state of nature, we refrained). Part of this stemmed from the difficulty
                  in coming to grips with what he meant by a state of nature. We eventually crystallized
                  this, for discussion, as a time and place prior to human society in which humans lived
                  individually alone and were perfectly content in that solitude. Having established
                  a working definition of Rousseau’s concept, backtracking through the text helped us
                  identify a few misogynist comments in Rousseau’s discursus that threatened to upend
                  his larger argument about the state of nature’s placidity.</p>
               <p>Although we did not know it to begin with, <em>The Road</em> and <em>Mad Max</em> set the agenda for the class in terms of sex and gender: both texts concern themselves
                  primarily with reproduction—the boy in <em>The Road</em> and the war boys in <em>Mad Max</em>—but both also evince no joy or pleasure in the act of reproduction. To put it in
                  <em>Wall-E</em>’s terms, the human species survives but does not live, auguring different futures
                  of automation, bodies deprived of all but the basic needs: oxygen, water, food, shelter,
                  and the trudge toward them in a depressing world with dwindling resources. In both
                  texts, the characters have returned to a state of nature. Is this the paradise Rousseau
                  imagined with his state of nature thought experiment?</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>When Paul de Man had his infamous deconstructive <em>agon</em> with Jacques Derrida, the crossroads of their rapprochement ran through the work of
                     Jean-Jacques Rousseau and dissension over exactly whose blind spot was blinder when
                     it came to Rousseau (de Man; Derrida, 
                     “Typewriter”
                     ). This <em>agon</em> serves as yet another reminder of the way logocentricism blinds even the best of critics
                     to Rousseau’s prime interrogator of the Enlightenment: Mary Wollstonecraft. Wollstonecraft,
                     whose critique of the patriarchal and capitalistic assumptions informing the work
                     of both Edmund Burke and Rousseau gifted us radical critical tools for thinking about,
                     and theorizing, sex and gender in democratic societies, also recalls us to the blind
                     spot of postapocalyptic literature, namely . . . sex and gender.

                              “Darkness.”
                              This novel does deal with sex and gender, as several critics have argued.</span></div>
                     </div> Our class, after a close-reading warm-up walk-through of Byron’s <em>Darkness</em> (1816), began reading and contrasting Rousseau’s <em>A Discourse on Inequality</em> (1755) with Wollstonecraft’s <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Women</em> (1792) before making a 200-year leap forward to McCarthy’s <em>The Road</em> (2006) and the film <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> (2015). We finished the course by reading Corin and conducting the above-mentioned
                     group presentations (this essay began, then, where the class ended). If Wollstonecraft,
                     in alerting us to the importance of sex and gender for establishing equality in societies,
                     disrupts the genderless democratic debates of the Enlightenment, and given that the
                     same debates recur in postapocalyptic fiction, then the past, at least from the perspective
                     of the Enlightenment, is the future in that it still remains our present. But how
                     do we get there, wherever <em>there</em> is?</p>
               </div>
               <p>What time is it then? And what time is it for the future of humanity, for our species
                  reproduction, or, as Edelman calls it, our “reproductive futurity”? As Rebekah Sheldon
                  remarks, “genealogical succession, the ‘so on’ of reproduction, derives its meaning-making
                  force from conceiving of time as unfolding in a straight line running out to meet
                  the horizon. Space travel is already a perversion of this conception of time” (67).
                  Hyper-jump pedagogy reckons with this space travel temporal perversion—which we can
                  see develop in our reading of <em>Wall-E</em>—by continuing to pervert how we conceive of reproduction in terms of <span class="foreign" xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">chronos</span> or <span class="foreign" xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">telos</span>, a straight line or a purpose-driven end. In short, what this class taught me is
                  that to rethink survival, to rethink reproduction like those in <em>Wall-E</em>, the faceless, indiscernible children and the listless, indiscernible adults, surviving
                  enough to survive but not to live, we have to rethink pedagogies that experiment with
                  different futures; but since reproductivity is itself temporally based, we also have
                  to think about what reproduction and sex might mean in these different temporalities
                  and what nonnormative, radical temporalities mean for sex and reproduction.</p>
               <p>And this is where what I want to call “hyper-jump pedagogy” can help us rethink teaching
                  the Anthropocene in relation to Romanticism. Hyper-jump pedagogy reflects the scrambled
                  futural temporality the Anthropocene places us in. We discussed this temporality in
                  Derridean terms in class, although we did not frame it via his philosophy of time
                  but through a discussion of Lucy Corin’s flash fiction, <em>One Hundred Apocalypses and Other Apocalypses</em> (2013). Corin’s work exemplifies an atemporal logic wherein the short pieces of fiction
                  seem to arise in random order, as if a shuffling of cards, with no setting, location,
                  or time announced. This atemporal dislocation rendered it impossible for us to discern
                  fixed spacetime points for any one piece. In these fictions, the past could well take
                  place before the present and the future before the past—but not in a flashback or
                  flash-forward narrative chronological strategy; rather, each short fiction seemed
                  radically unbound from the other, as if set in its own spacetime, some time always
                  temporally to-come from the piece that preceded or anteceded it. Through this achronology
                  we can better understand how the Derridean “to-come” signals more than a simple futurity;
                  it marks how the future is always hyper-jumping away from us even as the future constantly
                  arrives in each moment that becomes the present, which, in turn, becomes the past,
                  which is, it follows, perpetually becoming the present which becomes the future. And
                  yet, the future is always disappearing, which means that the future is also always
                  still out there. Far ahead of us, if it exists, the future exists in the future (to
                  put it paradoxically but accurately), always a hyper-jump away, a space-ial movement
                  that traverses the erasure of time by leaping over the present-become-the-future to
                  the future. Hyper-jump pedagogy takes this temporal challenge seriously by attempting
                  to elide the limitations of typical class structures and chronological historicism—the
                  time(s) that no longer inhere(s) in the logic of the Anthropocene—hyper-jumping from
                  epoch to epoch, genre to genre, text to text without necessary linkages. In the Anthropocene,
                  according to some predictions, humankind can no longer survive or live, and so our
                  notion of time as a measurement of human lifespans linked to a future is (always)
                  already under erasure. Hyper-jump pedagogy seeks to be a pedagogy for the Anthropocene,
                  to discover linkages that do not yet exist, to go from the past and present into a
                  future unknown, what might even be, in both the grammatical and temporal sense, a
                  future imperfect or a present past participle.</p>
               <p>By design we had no predetermined answers in this class because I purposefully wanted
                  the course to operate as a semester-long thought experiment that explored, in the
                  most wide-ranging sense of that term, the issues of sex and gender in the Anthropocene
                  through a Romantic frame. We tend to think of the Anthropocene as a version of environmental
                  or ecological crisis that results from climate change, worldwide deep-down damage
                  that might kill the planet and the human species along with every other life form.
                  But the focus on species and futurity tends to belie the gender and sexual politics
                  that the former entails when interlocked with the latter: for the species to have
                  a future, we must reproduce, must have sex. But, as Rosi Braidotti puts it when noting
                  that we need to “rethink sexuality without genders,” “sexuality may be caught in the
                  sex-gender binary but is not reducible to it” (36). Teaching the Anthropocene in the
                  Romantic period, in this respect, is also a consideration of why and how we have sex
                  and what sexuality is.</p>
               <p>The above reading, at any rate, is an expanded version of the collective extemporaneous
                  explication of the film we worked out in the honors course I taught, 
                  “Gender and Postapocalyptic Literature,”
                  in the spring of 2017 at Francis Marion University. Students screened clips from the
                  film during a group presentation in the final weeks of the class. During these group
                  presentations, students chose to present on whatever text they wanted—whether that
                  was film clips, short stories, novel snippets, poems, or television shows—as long
                  as it spoke to the overall class theme of gender and postapocalypse. Our <em>Wall-E</em> reading stages a recurrent topic throughout the semester: should humans continue
                  with the reproduction of their species if they are nothing more than destructive annihilators?
                  Should, to borrow the title of Lee Edelman’s book, humans have “no future?” Or, perhaps,
                  as we asked, humans simply do not have a future regardless of the fact that one way
                  we conceptualize life is in relation to the idea of a future, that life will continue,
                  individually and collectively, in a time-to-come? What if, though, there is no future?
                  What if, having disrupted the parameters for life on earth, like the humans in <em>Wall-E</em>, the future, unbeknownst to us, has already been erased, time travel–like, by the
                  past and our present? What if there is no future because we will be dead given that
                  climate change makes the planet unlivable for humans? What if we have already, to
                  borrow from <em>Spaceballs</em> (1987), “gone to plaid” in a hyperdrive jump that outdistances the possibility of
                  our own future, of our own existence?</p>
               <p>This capitalist critique also speaks to climate change in our present because it questions
                  the fundamental assumption of the Anthropocene: humans may not be necessary for the
                  earth’s survival but the earth is necessary for humans to have a life that is more
                  than meaningless consumption. According to the film, if humans do continue unheedingly
                  devouring everything in their path, they will become mere automatons controlled by
                  capitalism’s invisible hands (indeed, the onboard computer system is named “AUTO,”
                  a harbinger of what humans are becoming), just like we see on the Axiom where they
                  are whisked away to different appointments with no real investment or volition manifest.
                  They can’t get no satisfaction unless from stupefaction. Amidst humans’ stupefaction,
                  the film deals a crushing blow to our anthropocentric perspective that humans are
                  the center of the world, and, indeed, the universe. Wall-E, we see, has discovered
                  a lone plant growing on the literal dumpster dive that is the earth (the film’s original
                  working title was <em>Trash Planet</em>), and when he shows it to EVE, a search droid sent back to Earth to record its current
                  vital status, her operational protocols kick in and she delivers the plant to the
                  Axiom. This leads to a tense scene where the ship’s captain, McCrea, inspired by this
                  fresh sprig of plant life, declares to the ship’s resisting onboard computer system,
                  AUTO, that he wishes to return to Earth, to home. AUTO assures him that it is far
                  better to remain in space where the humans can all survive since they continue to
                  reproduce in a mechanical fashion, maintaining their species even though, stupefied,
                  they derive no pleasure from the sexual act: AUTOmated sex. To AUTO’s assurance, McCrea
                  loudly retorts, “I don’t want to survive, I want to LIVE!” This declaration captures
                  the film’s overall thesis, which offers a genuine theorization of what life is and
                  what living means, a theory that claims that humans need more than AUTOmated replication,
                  they need <em>jouissance</em>, pleasure in sex, if they are more than to survive, as they are doing on the Axiom,
                  if they are to live. As Wall-E and EVE, “parents” of the plant, demonstrate, though,
                  the offspring of such sex might be more than simply an extension of the human species.
                  Wall-E and EVE save the plant, raise it in a sense, while carrying out their love
                  affair, creating a queer family. Perhaps, then, the film—beyond its capitalistic critique
                  and climate change warning—wants us to rethink how and why we have sex and reproduce,
                  as well as what we are reproducing and what constitutes a family-to-come in the “future.”</p>
               <p>At the beginning of the film <em>Wall-E</em> (2008), we hover in space, gazing not on the image of the familiar pale blue dot
                  of Earth but instead on a brown mud-ball blot before zooming in further on this dusky
                  orb to witness the last vestiges of the havoc capitalism has wrought on the formerly
                  populated planet. Here, a trash-compacting service droid—the titular Wall-E—continues
                  his lonely work, picking up, breaking down, and stacking up garbage, marking the film
                  as an environmental text on how capitalism’s commodity fetish piles rubbish we clamor
                  for higher and higher. That hedonist humans and the capitalist system they adore have
                  driven their abandonment of Earth is made clear once we travel with Wall-E to one
                  of the ships that the humans fled the planet on, the Axiom. Here we find out that
                  the purpose of Wall-E units is restorative; they are “Working to Dig you Out,” a tagline
                  the BNL corporation has come up with that unintentionally captures how an environmental
                  cleanup effort gets tangled within the “Workings” of capitalism. This project has
                  failed, unsurprisingly, and humans remain islanded in a sea of stars while the earth,
                  apparently, slowly dies. Meanwhile, the film is even more incisively cutting in its
                  critique of human fallibility and folly. Aboard the Axiom, humans have achieved the
                  ultimate supposed utopian <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">terminus ad quem</span> of capitalism—no longer able to stand up due to obesity and attendant atrophied muscles,
                  they are hoovered about on floating beds to sample the goods available at a dazzling
                  display of neon-fronted food shops and boutique beauty salons. They are no longer
                  working but buying, as the slogan for BNL, “Buy N Large,” perfectly articulates in
                  its witty pun: buy and become enlarged, exactly what has happened to these super-sized
                  humans.</p>
               <p>Perhaps this future is already the present—as perhaps the reading experience of this
                  essay demonstrates as we arrive at the end, which is the beginning of the course,
                  the past that has become the future. Hyper-jump pedagogy takes us back to the future,
                  our past, to examine our present, the imperfect future.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">My thanks to the Francis Marion University Honors Program and its director, Dr. Jon
               Tuttle, for green-lighting this class. I also wish to think the 12 students who made
               the course a joy to teach with their vibrant, boundless curiosity and intelligence.
               This essay, in so many ways, would not exist without them.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">These two passages, for instance: “it is asserted, in direct terms, that the minds
               of women are enfeebled by false refinement . . . and that . . . they are treated as
               a kind of subordinate beings, and not as a part of the human species, when improveable
               reason is allowed to be the dignified distinction which raises men above the brute
               creation” (Wollstonecraft 10); “Dismissing then those pretty feminine phrases, which
               the men condescendingly use to soften our slavish dependence, and despising that weak
               elegancy of mind, exquisite sensibility, and sweet docility of manners, supposed to
               be the sexual characteristics of the weaker vessel” (Wollstonecraft 12).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Wollstonecraft’s daughter, Mary Shelley, wrote <em>The Last Man</em> (1826), indebted, as she said, to Byron’s 
               “Darkness.”
               This novel does deal with sex and gender, as several critics have argued.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
