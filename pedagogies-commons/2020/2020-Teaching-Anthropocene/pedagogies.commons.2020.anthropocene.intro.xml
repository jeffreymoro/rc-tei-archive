                    pedagogy of resistance to human-made climate change in the Anthropocene. Such a pedagogy 
                    rejects ideas about “humans as one unified species” and seeks instead a dialogue between

            <p>The problem of the Anthropocene is the problem of, and
                    for, Romanticism. Ever since biologist Eugene F. Stoermer coined, and
                    atmospheric scientist Paul Crutzen then popularized, the term “Anthropocene,”
                    the humanities as a whole has gradually undertaken a reevaluation of its role in
                    the creation of this new geological era. Romanticism is perhaps different than
                    other literary periods, though. For if, as some scientists (like Crutzen) argue,
                    humans gained the capabilities in the late eighteenth century’s industrial age
                    to disastrously alter the earth’s climate, then the Romantic period begins to
                    take on catastrophic resonances and implications. “Catastrophe” literally means
                    a “down turning,” a turn we can witness Romanticism as a period and a profession
                    experiencing. What once looked like a literary revolution marked by a turn
                    toward the imaginative abilities of human achievement and a renewed
                    environmental appreciation of nature now shuttles along a remarkably wilder
                    course toward the potential, some would even say probable, end of the human
                    species if not the end of the world, or at least (at best?) the end of the world
                    on the anthropocentric assumption that it exists for humans.</p>
            <p>Gillen D’Arcy Wood shows us that the climate disaster of
                    1816, “the year without a summer,” although not a human-induced event—its cause
                    was the eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia—models possibilities humans will
                    have to look forward to in the future of the Anthropocene. So not only can we
                    understand that the period perhaps coincides with the birth of catastrophic
                    climate change, it also provides a preview of what such future change will bring
                    if we fail (and perhaps we already have) to mitigate it. Another twist in this
                    turn therefore is that the period’s long-celebrated intimate, imaginative,
                    liberal subject takes on different contours since it is this powerful
                    subjectivity that makes capable the institutional and systemic economic and
                    cultural climate drivers that initiate the Anthropocene. As D. B. Ruderman puts
                    it in this volume, it is “arguably” Romanticism’s “privileging of a liberal, 
                    democratic subject—autonomous, free, appetitive, propertied, universal, and
                    self-willed—that provides the ‘natural’ grounds for global capitalism,” and, we could
                    add, the Anthropocene. In this sense, Romanticism finds itself looking more like
                    a coconspirator in climate change’s devastation rather than a poetics of
                    transcendent individualism precisely because of its adulated emancipatory
                    liberalism. Yet another turn, another catastrophe, is the turning of the human
                    trope of Romantic irony around on itself, as the only thing the Anthropocene
                    might wipe out is the “anthropos,” the human, which means in this Romantic
                    progressive fantasy that if in becoming more imaginative humans have become more
                    human, then they have done so at the risk of their own extinction. The
                    Anthropocene, it seems, has a fierce sense of irony; perhaps it gets it from
                    Romanticism, another indication that they are in latent conspiratorial
                    cahoots.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Claire Colebrook comes at this from 
                        the other direction, writing: “what we now call climate change is the 
                        reemergence of what made climate possible. Climate was manufactured from 
                        climate change” (19).</note></p>
            <p>That having been said, nothing in
                    this volume is meant to link the Anthropocene exclusively to capitalism, let
                    alone argue for a renaming of it, as some do, as the “Capitalocene,” although it
                    is certainly true that predominantly white, heteronormative, Western,
                    patriarchal culture has largely been responsible for the changes in the Earth’s
                    atmosphere.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Jason W. Moore, for instance, 
                        argues for this terminological switch as do others in his related edited 
                        volume, <title level="m">Anthropocene or Capitalocene?</title></note> This 
                connection points to the problem of the blame-game in general. As Tom Cohen and 
                Claire Colebrook observe in <title level="m">Twilight of the Anthropocene
                    Idols</title>, “one of the features of what has come to be known as the Anthropocene 
                is that very few want to own up to being the guilty party: as soon as the Anthropocene 
                was declared as a way of uniting humans once again, objections started pouring in” (7). 
                One can see this, as Stacy Alaimo argues, in a foundational critical text for thinking 
                the Anthropocene in literary studies, Dipesh Chakrabarty’s <title level="a">The Climate 
                    of History: Four Theses,</title> which, she writes, homogenizes humanity as a 
                species rather than embraces its multiplicity and quite different levels of 
                responsibility (94–103). The United States and Western empires, for example, pollute 
                more than Non-Western countries whose carbon emission output, due to lack of large-scale 
                industrialism, is minimal. To lump all humans together as a species, as Chakrabarty does, 
                repeats the “anthropos” thinking of the Anthropocene and erases key factors about who 
                is responsible for climate change. In these terms, as teachers and scholars of 
                Romanticism, it seems we should pause to ask: is Romanticism, too, somehow culpable in 
                this “anthopos”ing? Historically, the period’s big-six white male coalition, alongside 
                two comparatively well-off white women novelists, has formed the Romantic canon, 
                although the work of scholars like Frances Botkin, Manu Chander, Patricia A. Matthew, 
                Joel Pace, Deanne Koretsky, and Paul Youngquist dispenses with this
                    hagiography.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Works Cited for their specific 
                        works.</note> But as a kind of thought experiment, let us hypothesize for the 
                moment that Romanticism is, indeed, somehow partially responsible for the Anthropocene 
                and the dangers and challenges it poses.</p>
            <p>The larger questions this collection
                    asks stem from this hypothesis. What are Romanticism’s responsibilities if this
                    indictment stands? Secondly, the collection asks whether Romanticism possesses
                    the energies needed to survive its potential demise at its own hands or,
                    relatedly, to provide means and method to combat the climate-changing disasters
                    it has helped loose on the world with the Anthropocene. In other words, perhaps
                    we might begin to think of Romanticism as we currently teach it as not simply
                    historically congruent with the Anthropocene but instead as a thought or writing
                    whose contemporary pedagogical charge stems from its ability to counter the
                    Anthropocene’s violence precisely because of its unique historical and
                    dialectical interinvolvement with it.</p>
            <p>And perhaps we will find that the Anthropocene sparks Romanticism’s imagination insofar 
                as it reminds Romanticism that one of its distinguishing features is its self-reflexivity, 
                its ability to distance itself ironically from its own Romantic ideology ever since the 
                work of Paul de Man, Jerome McGann, and Anne Mellor (to name only a few) demonstrated 
                this critical trait. Perhaps in its reaction to the Anthropocene, Romanticism will 
                remember, or learn, that it has to be radically Romantic, that it has to self-reflect 
                on its own responsibilities and liabilities in a fashion it has not been forced to do 
                previously without getting tied down in a self-imposed guilt it does not deserve. 
                However, this is not to argue for a version of a “good Anthropocene,” as some do, as 
                if it is a particularly disliked vegetable like kale that we are told is good for us 
                anyway, since the volume assuredly does not see the Anthropocene in such crunchable, 
                delectable lights. Instead, the writers here rightly view the Anthropocene as a 
                period with horribly damaging consequences for all life, and nonlife, on Earth. But 
                this is another reason to investigate Romanticism’s culpability. To this end, as 
                writers in this volume show, the Anthropocene makes us question, in our classrooms 
                and scholarship, what Romanticism can and will be in the time of our present global 
                crisis, which continues to spool out in expected and unexpected ways.</p>
            <p>This collection, for instance, began as a panel, <title level="a">Living through Human 
                Trumpery: Teaching Romanticism in the Anthropocene,</title> arranged and moderated 
                by the brilliant bricoleur Kate Singer
                    at the International Conference for Romanticism at Colorado College in 2016.
                    During the Q and A for the panel, one intrepid graduate student asked a question
                    that proved crucially formative to this volume: “What about race in Romanticism
                    and the Anthropocene?” While the panel took up many topics, race was, indeed is,
                    an overlooked topic in Romanticism, certainly in relation to the Anthropocene.
                    Several scholars do study race in the period, of course, with burgeoning work
                    amongst graduate students, but the field, and canon, remains largely
                    white—although the recent transatlantic and global explosion of the Romantic
                    canon sketched above offers an alternative. The panel, it turned out, driven to
                    self-reflection at this moment, showcased Romanticism’s possibilities as well as
                    its limitations since no one on the panel had any real answer to this
                    question.</p>
            <p>In undertaking the editorship of this volume, I sought, therefore, to incorporate as 
                diverse a set of voices concerning as wide a range of topical concerns as feasible, 
                not the least of which was to offer some kind of answer to the lacunae the above 
                question highlighted. Despite everyone's best intention, circumstances intervened 
                and a planned essay on race and the Anthropocene does not appear in this volume. 
                Nonetheless, the collection hopefully succeeds in addressing 
                some long-standing historical as well as contemporary concerns on 
                issues of cultural and societal justice in Romanticism: David Ruderman on social 
                class, poetics, and war; Elizabeth Effinger on animal studies and a mobilizing 
                nonhuman politics; Brian Rejack on the current politics of pessimism that can 
                lead to an affirmative affect of care; Colin Carman on a queer ecology that 
                gives us tools to realize and transcend our normative practices in the classroom; 
                Aaron Ottinger on ecocriticism and media studies and the salutary dissolution of 
                the solitary Romantic “I”; and Chris Washington on gender, sex, and queer families.</p>
            <p>Specifically, these essays trace how the Anthropocene
                    forces us to rethink our pedagogical and methodological practices in the
                    classroom and beyond, as well as the values and beliefs that underscore said
                    methodologies and practices. In the process, a kind of accretive vision of a
                    transformed and transformational Romanticism that hails us from a burning down
                    of our beliefs about the period begins to signal through the smoke and fire of
                    the Anthropocene.</p>
            <p>If the volume can be said to have an argument abstracted from the varied topics and 
                inquiries the scholars in this volume undertake, then it is that Romanticism, as a 
                scholarship based around a historical period and its culture, as a set of writers, 
                and as a pedagogy and pedagogical set of practices, should strive for a radical 
                intersectionality. Much like the essays in <title level="m">Anthropocene 
                    Feminism</title>, which collectively clamor for an intersectional
                    new-wave feminism equally attentive to matters of human social justice and
                    nonhuman materialism, Anthropocene Romanticism, if we can put it that way for
                    now (as Effinger does), displays a cross-spectrum of interests and ideas. The
                    Anthropocene, this volume demonstrates, cannot be allowed to subsume the social
                    and ontological differences that exist between humans and nonhumans in the name
                    of “species.” As Rosi Braidotti, in that volume, writes, “Earth-related issues
                    are not immune to social relations of class, race, age, disability, sexual
                    preference and should not be renaturalized” (40). These interests and ideas
                    exceed the narrow focus on the human that has long dominated and defined
                    Romanticism, a picture this volume rejects in favor of an intersectional vision
                    that connects class, race, gender, age, disability, sexual preference, nonhuman
                    materialism, and feminist materialism into a vital politics.</p>
            <p>But even as it foregrounds intersectionality, the volume
                    queries what we mean by the term “human.” Much like Jacques Derrida once
                    cautioned about “the animal” when he wrote that there is no animal only animals
                    (“<foreign xml:lang="fr">animaux</foreign>” is his proposed nomenclature), these 
                essays refuse a categorical humanness, or even, as Alaimo warns against above, the 
                homogeneity of a “human species” (Derrida 32–41). Instead, the Romanticism that 
                appears here draws lines of connection even as it is also fractured, disparate, and 
                shattered, with each author offering myriad views of how to pick up the pieces.</p>
            <p>We can observe this in Rejack’s and Carman’s different readings of Keats, Ruderman 
                and Ottinger exploring dramatically divergent but complementary Wordsworths, and in 
                Rejack’s, Effinger’s, and Washington’s rethinking of Romantic time.</p>
            <p>Rejack’s essay, both personal and polemical, begins in melancholy as he ponders 
                memories of his wedding, the day before which he found himself gazing up at ancient 
                mushroom rocks in the Rocky Mountains. To him the mushroom rocks, part of a formation 
                that dates back 1.7 billion years, recall us to deep time, the fact that the earth 
                existed long before us and will likely persist well after us. For Rejack, a true Keatsian, 
                a melancholy fit falls as “the shock and sadness that accompany this strange 
                temporal situation came to mind” during what should have been a happy event. What, 
                he wonders, will be left of the world in the future? To this end, he turns, in what 
                could serve as an overarching explanation of not only his own but all of the essays 
                in this volume, to “focus in this essay on how the feeling of living in the 
                Anthropocene and its strange temporality affects how we teach, and specifically 
                how we teach Romanticism.” The course he designed, <title level="a">The Failures of 
                    Romanticism,</title> captures something of the complicity concerns that began 
                this introduction. But if Rejack’s essay begins in melancholy and failure, it quickly 
                becomes something else. Winding together contemporary song lyrics, Mary 
                Shelley’s <title level="m">The Last Man</title>, Percy Shelley’s <title level="m">A 
                    Defence of Poetry</title>, Jeff Vandermeer’s <title level="m">Southern 
                        Reach</title> trilogy, and finally Keats’s last on-earth pun (“I am leading 
                a posthumous existence”) and weird fairyland trip <title level="m">The Cap and 
                    Bells</title>, Rejack serves up a pedagogical polemic for how to laugh together 
                in the classroom rather than cower in fear and despair. In this sense, the essay 
                skillfully draws an affective Romanticism between teacher, student, text, and 
                scholar. It is a touching and forceful invocation, “a defence of Romanticism” 
                that is thoroughly Romantic, a reminder of the pedagogical power the period still 
                holds to teach us all something we didn’t know we didn’t know.</p>
            <p>Carman’s essay serves as a kind of <foreign xml:lang="la">vade mecum</foreign> for 
                how to teach queer ecology in the Anthropocene, which he develops through a careful, 
                in-depth, startlingly brilliant reading of Keats’s “I stood tip-toe upon a little 
                hill” and <title level="m">Endymion</title>. As Carman remarks, thinking queer 
                    ecology makes sense because both “nature” and
                    “queer sexuality” share “a lack of a rigid outline.” Think of the example of
                    LGBTQ, he suggests, which for now is end-stopped by Q but which looks “as
                    intersectional as it is infinite.” For Carman, Keats draws together the queer
                    and the ecological in these poems because they unleash an eroticized desire that
                    comports with queerness even as it is a desire that advises us how to steward
                    the earth by walking tenderly on tip-toe rather than mashing the ground beneath
                    our feet. In this powerful reading that gives us a much more ecologically minded
                    Keats than we have previously encountered, Carman reminds us that even if the
                    Anthropocene is the “Age of Man,” it does not necessarily follow that it is the
                    “Age of the Straight Man” since “<emph>LGBTQ people . . . are no less dedicated 
                        to preserving</emph>” the Earth even if they do not, as he says, procreate 
                    like straight people do. Carman’s essay gives us a Romanticism that finds 
                    <foreign xml:lang="fr">jouissance</foreign> in sexuality and eroticism, a theme 
                    that Washington likewise explores in his own essay later in this volume, evoking 
                    a Romanticism hopeful about the future.</p>
            <p>And yet, Romanticism is often characterized as skeptical in nature, which speaks to 
                the discourse and industry of climate denial. But “can this current skepticism be 
                traced to the Romantic period?” Ottinger asks of climate-change deniers. While 
                Ottinger notes that a spate of new studies on Romantic science render accounts of 
                it as “anti-science . . . untenable,” worries about the period’s skeptical nature 
                nonetheless require an exploration of how “the hierarchized different genres of 
                media” Romantic authors created “shaped the way that that they related to the planet and 
                thereby produced a particular brand of ecology.” An exploration of Romantic media 
                lends itself to experiments with media in the classroom, specifically, an 
                exercise where students draw lyrics on paper. Ottinger traces the results of one 
                such experiment when he asks students to sketch what Wordsworth describes in a 
                lyric from <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, <title level="a">Written in 
                    Germany, on One of the Coldest Days of the Century.</title> In visualizing 
                the poem through art, students gain an increased
                    awareness of the perspective of the Romantic lyric “I” since they have to think
                    through Wordsworth’s position in the cottage as well as what subsists outside
                    the cottage, namely nature, the weather, and the earth, all of which are
                    steadily getting colder. For Ottinger, the exercise literally mitigates our
                    strange subject position vis-à-vis climate and the Anthropocene by staging
                    “one’s self in an alien time, place, and climate,” the very thing the
                    Anthropocene threatens to force us to do whether we wish to or not. In this
                    sense, Ottinger invents a pedagogy that enacts a divestment of ourselves as we
                    see, through the media of ink on paper, the eco-mimetic separation of the
                    Romantic “I” from the world around it. We become disoriented from ourselves,
                    unsure where the world ends and we begin, which places us in a
                    certain time and space even while dislocating us from time and space.</p>
            <p>D. B. Ruderman’s pedagogical experiments join nicely with
                    Ottinger’s, and Effinger’s below, to help students query their own subject
                    position re the larger world around them. Like Rejack, Ruderman takes a personal
                    turn as he notes that his students in south central Ohio experience the
                    Anthropocene in the form of the trickle-down effects of a capitalist economy
                    that has long crushed them in its invisible hands. To grasp the full impact of
                    these effects, though, requires listening to the ambient silence of the world.
                    Ruderman looks to silence as theorized in the work of Wordsworth and John Cage
                    to investigate “whether silence as a romantic concept cuts into and 
                    denatures . . . subjectivity, offering us another defamiliarized subject in its 
                    place, or whether silence merely resounds as yet another form of acquiescence.” 
                    For Ruderman, silence—which is not the absence of sound, he writes—is what allows 
                    for the outside to enter in, a formulation reminiscent of Ottinger’s pedagogical 
                    artwork illustrations of the lyric. In this fashion, Ruderman gives us an 
                    auditory pedagogy for the Anthropocene parallel to Ottinger’s visual one. In 
                    Wordsworth and Cage, on Ruderman’s and his class’s interpretation, silence “is 
                    something like a container that provides the conditions and the imaginative 
                    space for political action.” Having read Wordsworth’s <title level="a">There Was 
                        A Boy</title> as well as listened to and read Cage’s reflections on silence, 
                Ruderman’s students then did field work: they recorded ambient noise which Ruderman 
                created a sound mix of in order to listen to the silence between the odd sounds 
                found in their outside environment. To the students, this type of keying into the 
                environment amounted to a weak type of politics, one that, they argued, while 
                aesthetically interesting, required theorizing specific action. His students, 
                aware that they are at the mercy of a neoliberal war aimed at the poor and the 
                lower middle class, wanted a viable politics with which to fight back. And yet, 
                as Ruderman writes, only by listening to the unheard, undeclared kinds of violence 
                being directed at us, subjects of the Anthropocene, can we begin to hear “what 
                man has made of man,” as Wordsworth puts it.</p>
            <p>Effinger’s class engaged in a complimentary experiment with sound as well as a study 
                of disruptive Anthropocene temporalities. In classical rhetoric, as Effinger 
                notes, <foreign xml:lang="la">hysteron proteron</foreign> means the temporal 
                inversion of speech, but Effinger uses it as one basis for rethinking pedagogy 
                in the Anthropocene. As she writes, “the goal in going about things backward—the 
                inversion of past and future—is to revitalize a present relationship, to hear 
                Romantic poetry, ideas, and problematics as a frenetic, undulating constellation 
                murmuring beneath the Anthropocene.” Romantic birdsong poetry, so often obsessed 
                with its own failure to capture the purer poetry of the bird mimetically, and 
                thus claiming the poet and the poem as a failure, in Effinger’s lesson finally 
                may have achieved its goal. She points out that in the Anthropocene, “climate 
                change is now the primary threat to avian extinction,” which means that returning 
                to Romantic birdsong can, after a fashion, return us to a time before avian 
                extinction. It allows Effinger to locate in the birdsong of the past the full 
                murmur of what we can no longer hear—perhaps because, as Effinger says, in the 
                Anthropocene we are drowned by silent wars in the every day. Effinger institutes 
                a practice she calls “close listening,” an exercise that we can hear murmuring 
                gently in the ear of Ruderman’s silence, to help students tune into the “ubiquitous 
                sounds, those metonyms for the unsaid or silences within discourse.” Through 
                close listening to bird poems by Charlotte Smith, Samuel Taylor Coleridge (from 
                whose <title level="m">Biographia Literaria</title> Effinger takes and reimagines 
                the use of <foreign xml:lang="la">hysteron proteron</foreign>), John Keats, and 
                John Clare, Effinger and her students work their way toward a political call to 
                action in the Anthropocene that “opens up the subject to the more than human.” 
                Politically this serves as a form of resistance to our very humanness, a 
                to-be-called by the other in a Levinasian sense that strikes back at the heart 
                of the Anthropocene: us.</p>
            <p>Like Effinger, Washington is interested in temporally scrambled pedagogies that 
                also invoke the nonhuman as central to any Anthropocene politics Romanticism 
                develops. But for him, both the human and nonhuman remain categorically elusive 
                in the Anthropocene to the extent that new hybrid formations will necessarily 
                continue to develop. Washington invokes what he terms “hyper-jump pedagogy,” 
                something of a counterpart to Effinger’s <foreign xml:lang="la">hysteron 
                    proteron</foreign> pedagogy, to attempt to literally model how time works 
                in the Anthropocene: we are not necessarily going back to the future so much 
                as the future always slips away, slip-sliding us back into a past and present 
                we have no temporal control over. His contribution presents a 
                choose-your-own-adventure scenario with two versions of his “essay.” In the 
                first, you can read a version that tracks backward, from the end of the essay 
                to the beginning, an upside-down schema via a kind of chiasmus. It begins with 
                a reading of Wollstonecraft and Rousseau—the past, in other words—but tracks 
                forward to a reading that ranges over Cormac McCarthy’s <title level="m">The 
                    Road</title>, <title level="m">Mad Max: Fury Road</title>, Lucy Corin’s 
                flash fiction, and <title level="m">Wall-E</title>. Yet it does so by taking 
                flight with the readings of Wollstonecraft and Rousseau that only the later 
                readings make possible. The second version of the essay tries to institute a 
                nice derangement of paragraphs by allowing readers to click a button that 
                generates a random presentation of the essay. Paragraph 21 might open this 
                version followed by paragraph 1 or paragraph 10, a higgedly-piggedly 
                chronology meant to mimic the erasure of <emph>telos</emph> in the Anthropocene 
                and our own (non)experience of time’s
                    futural pastness. In the interstices of this chiasmatic and/or contingent
                    disorientation, we see how sex and gender might play out in the Anthropocene’s
                    postapocalypse when who we have sex with and how we have it can stymie or
                    unleash an energy that is not merely biopolitical in a human sense but queer in
                    ways that crosshatch Carman’s reading of Keats’s digit(al), and Rejack’s and
                    Ottinger’s digital, environmental protection agency.</p>
            <p>With its roots in political revolution and individual imaginative expression, 
                Romanticism has always been relevant to today, whenever that is. Yet we have faced 
                the same so-called humanities crisis since the 1960s. To wit, academe in general 
                does not matter, so the charge goes, not least Romanticism with its thorny 
                questions of what exactly a modern politics might constitute, what an individual 
                might be, what the world and our relation to it consists of, and even what it 
                means to think the human and/or the nonhuman. No one, it seems, cares about an 
                academe that tries to transgress the safe spaces of discourse that accounts for 
                all viewpoints. In many ways, Romanticism of course represents the purest ideal 
                and commitment to free, unadulterated speech, a democratic laissez faire of the 
                individual that many libertarians look to in order to justify their desired 
                dismantlement of the social contract (Godwin’s anarchist theory, for instance). 
                If this volume demonstrates anything, though, then it reminds us that 
                Romanticism can, or should, never be about injustice, to our fellow human beings 
                or our non-fellow nonhumans, or to the idea, in general, of difference.</p>
            <p>The pedagogies grouped here recollect us to Romanticism as a fight, a battle cry, 
                a rally, a movement against injustice, against prejudice, against pride in our 
                own perceived humanity, a battle constantly waged in our classrooms and beyond. 
                Romanticism, Evan Gottlieb recalls, is not one thing (8). But it is, as these 
                essays demonstrate, certainly not certain things. It is resistance in its 
                multihued forms; it is resistance against class warfare from the 1%; it is 
                resistance to ethnocentricism; it is resistance to heteronormativity; it is 
                resistance to human pride, selfishness, and greed; it is resistance to 
                inhibitions of expression; it is resistance to sexual shaming; it is 
                resistance to misogyny; it is resistance to politics as usual; it is resistance 
                to “sit down and shut up”; it is resistance to homophobia; it is resistance to 
                racism; it is resistance to the Anthropocene “feel good”; it is resistance to 
                any form of discrimination or oppression; it is resistance to the human trumpery 
                we in the United States have subjected ourselves to. This volume is—or wants to 
                be—a pedagogical politics of resistance. How successful its Romanticism is, is 
                up to you, dear reader.</p>
            <p>This collection reminds us that Percy Shelley’s notion of
                    poets as the unacknowledged legislators of the world takes new charge in the
                    Anthropocene, a time that tests teaching with its evanescence, to augur
                    Romanticism as more important than ever in our vanishing classrooms. To remind
                    us that we, as teachers, are unacknowledged legislators too. It reminds us that
                    if human life begins to end in the Anthropocene, then perhaps humans and
                    nonhumans may yet be able to live through, with, and by Romanticism.</p>
