                  <p>The problem of the Anthropocene is the problem of, and
                    for, Romanticism. Ever since biologist Eugene F. Stoermer coined, and
                    atmospheric scientist Paul Crutzen then popularized, the term “Anthropocene,”
                    the humanities as a whole has gradually undertaken a reevaluation of its role in
                    the creation of this new geological era. Romanticism is perhaps different than
                    other literary periods, though. For if, as some scientists (like Crutzen) argue,
                    humans gained the capabilities in the late eighteenth century’s industrial age
                    to disastrously alter the earth’s climate, then the Romantic period begins to
                    take on catastrophic resonances and implications. “Catastrophe” literally means
                    a “down turning,” a turn we can witness Romanticism as a period and a profession
                    experiencing. What once looked like a literary revolution marked by a turn
                    toward the imaginative abilities of human achievement and a renewed
                    environmental appreciation of nature now shuttles along a remarkably wilder
                    course toward the potential, some would even say probable, end of the human
                    species if not the end of the world, or at least (at best?) the end of the world
                    on the anthropocentric assumption that it exists for humans.</p>
                  <p>Gillen D’Arcy Wood shows us that the climate disaster of
                    1816, “the year without a summer,” although not a human-induced event—its cause
                    was the eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia—models possibilities humans will
                    have to look forward to in the future of the Anthropocene. So not only can we
                    understand that the period perhaps coincides with the birth of catastrophic
                    climate change, it also provides a preview of what such future change will bring
                    if we fail (and perhaps we already have) to mitigate it. Another twist in this
                    turn therefore is that the period’s long-celebrated intimate, imaginative,
                    liberal subject takes on different contours since it is this powerful
                    subjectivity that makes capable the institutional and systemic economic and
                    cultural climate drivers that initiate the Anthropocene. As D. B. Ruderman puts
                    it in this volume, it is “arguably” Romanticism’s “privileging of a liberal, 
                    democratic subject—autonomous, free, appetitive, propertied, universal, and
                    self-willed—that provides the ‘natural’ grounds for global capitalism,” and, we could
                    add, the Anthropocene. In this sense, Romanticism finds itself looking more like
                    a coconspirator in climate change’s devastation rather than a poetics of
                    transcendent individualism precisely because of its adulated emancipatory
                    liberalism. Yet another turn, another catastrophe, is the turning of the human
                    trope of Romantic irony around on itself, as the only thing the Anthropocene
                    might wipe out is the “anthropos,” the human, which means in this Romantic
                    progressive fantasy that if in becoming more imaginative humans have become more
                    human, then they have done so at the risk of their own extinction. The
                    Anthropocene, it seems, has a fierce sense of irony; perhaps it gets it from
                    Romanticism, another indication that they are in latent conspiratorial
                    cahoots.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Claire Colebrook comes at this from 
                        the other direction, writing: “what we now call climate change is the 
                        reemergence of what made climate possible. Climate was manufactured from 
                        climate change” (19).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That having been said, nothing in
                    this volume is meant to link the Anthropocene exclusively to capitalism, let
                    alone argue for a renaming of it, as some do, as the “Capitalocene,” although it
                    is certainly true that predominantly white, heteronormative, Western,
                    patriarchal culture has largely been responsible for the changes in the Earth’s
                    atmosphere.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Jason W. Moore, for instance, 
                        argues for this terminological switch as do others in his related edited 
                        volume, <title level="m">Anthropocene or Capitalocene?</title>
                     </note> This 
                connection points to the problem of the blame-game in general. As Tom Cohen and 
                Claire Colebrook observe in <title level="m">Twilight of the Anthropocene
                    Idols</title>, “one of the features of what has come to be known as the Anthropocene 
                is that very few want to own up to being the guilty party: as soon as the Anthropocene 
                was declared as a way of uniting humans once again, objections started pouring in” (7). 
                One can see this, as Stacy Alaimo argues, in a foundational critical text for thinking 
                the Anthropocene in literary studies, Dipesh Chakrabarty’s <title level="a">The Climate 
                    of History: Four Theses,</title> which, she writes, homogenizes humanity as a 
                species rather than embraces its multiplicity and quite different levels of 
                responsibility (94–103). The United States and Western empires, for example, pollute 
                more than Non-Western countries whose carbon emission output, due to lack of large-scale 
                industrialism, is minimal. To lump all humans together as a species, as Chakrabarty does, 
                repeats the “anthropos” thinking of the Anthropocene and erases key factors about who 
                is responsible for climate change. In these terms, as teachers and scholars of 
                Romanticism, it seems we should pause to ask: is Romanticism, too, somehow culpable in 
                this “anthopos”ing? Historically, the period’s big-six white male coalition, alongside 
                two comparatively well-off white women novelists, has formed the Romantic canon, 
                although the work of scholars like Frances Botkin, Manu Chander, Patricia A. Matthew, 
                Joel Pace, Deanne Koretsky, and Paul Youngquist dispenses with this
                    hagiography.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Works Cited for their specific 
                        works.</note> But as a kind of thought experiment, let us hypothesize for the 
                moment that Romanticism is, indeed, somehow partially responsible for the Anthropocene 
                and the dangers and challenges it poses.</p>
                  <p>The larger questions this collection
                    asks stem from this hypothesis. What are Romanticism’s responsibilities if this
                    indictment stands? Secondly, the collection asks whether Romanticism possesses
                    the energies needed to survive its potential demise at its own hands or,
                    relatedly, to provide means and method to combat the climate-changing disasters
                    it has helped loose on the world with the Anthropocene. In other words, perhaps
                    we might begin to think of Romanticism as we currently teach it as not simply
                    historically congruent with the Anthropocene but instead as a thought or writing
                    whose contemporary pedagogical charge stems from its ability to counter the
                    Anthropocene’s violence precisely because of its unique historical and
                    dialectical interinvolvement with it.</p>
                  <p>And perhaps we will find that the Anthropocene sparks Romanticism’s imagination insofar 
                as it reminds Romanticism that one of its distinguishing features is its self-reflexivity, 
                its ability to distance itself ironically from its own Romantic ideology ever since the 
                work of Paul de Man, Jerome McGann, and Anne Mellor (to name only a few) demonstrated 
                this critical trait. Perhaps in its reaction to the Anthropocene, Romanticism will 
                remember, or learn, that it has to be radically Romantic, that it has to self-reflect 
                on its own responsibilities and liabilities in a fashion it has not been forced to do 
                previously without getting tied down in a self-imposed guilt it does not deserve. 
                However, this is not to argue for a version of a “good Anthropocene,” as some do, as 
                if it is a particularly disliked vegetable like kale that we are told is good for us 
                anyway, since the volume assuredly does not see the Anthropocene in such crunchable, 
                delectable lights. Instead, the writers here rightly view the Anthropocene as a 
                period with horribly damaging consequences for all life, and nonlife, on Earth. But 
                this is another reason to investigate Romanticism’s culpability. To this end, as 
                writers in this volume show, the Anthropocene makes us question, in our classrooms 
                and scholarship, what Romanticism can and will be in the time of our present global 
                crisis, which continues to spool out in expected and unexpected ways.</p>
                  <p>This collection, for instance, began as a panel, <title level="a">Living through Human 
                Trumpery: Teaching Romanticism in the Anthropocene,</title> arranged and moderated 
                by the brilliant bricoleur Kate Singer
                    at the International Conference for Romanticism at Colorado College in 2016.
                    During the Q and A for the panel, one intrepid graduate student asked a question
                    that proved crucially formative to this volume: “What about race in Romanticism
                    and the Anthropocene?” While the panel took up many topics, race was, indeed is,
                    an overlooked topic in Romanticism, certainly in relation to the Anthropocene.
                    Several scholars do study race in the period, of course, with burgeoning work
                    amongst graduate students, but the field, and canon, remains largely
                    white—although the recent transatlantic and global explosion of the Romantic
                    canon sketched above offers an alternative. The panel, it turned out, driven to
                    self-reflection at this moment, showcased Romanticism’s possibilities as well as
                    its limitations since no one on the panel had any real answer to this
                    question.</p>
                  <p>In undertaking the editorship of this volume, I sought, therefore, to incorporate as 
                diverse a set of voices concerning as wide a range of topical concerns as feasible, 
                not the least of which was to offer some kind of answer to the lacunae the above 
                question highlighted. Despite everyone's best intention, circumstances intervened 
                and a planned essay on race and the Anthropocene does not appear in this volume. 
                Nonetheless, the collection hopefully succeeds in addressing 
                some long-standing historical as well as contemporary concerns on 
                issues of cultural and societal justice in Romanticism: David Ruderman on social 
                class, poetics, and war; Elizabeth Effinger on animal studies and a mobilizing 
                nonhuman politics; Brian Rejack on the current politics of pessimism that can 
                lead to an affirmative affect of care; Colin Carman on a queer ecology that 
                gives us tools to realize and transcend our normative practices in the classroom; 
                Aaron Ottinger on ecocriticism and media studies and the salutary dissolution of 
                the solitary Romantic “I”; and Chris Washington on gender, sex, and queer families.</p>
                  <p>Specifically, these essays trace how the Anthropocene
                    forces us to rethink our pedagogical and methodological practices in the
                    classroom and beyond, as well as the values and beliefs that underscore said
                    methodologies and practices. In the process, a kind of accretive vision of a
                    transformed and transformational Romanticism that hails us from a burning down
                    of our beliefs about the period begins to signal through the smoke and fire of
                    the Anthropocene.</p>
                  <p>If the volume can be said to have an argument abstracted from the varied topics and 
                inquiries the scholars in this volume undertake, then it is that Romanticism, as a 
                scholarship based around a historical period and its culture, as a set of writers, 
                and as a pedagogy and pedagogical set of practices, should strive for a radical 
                intersectionality. Much like the essays in <title level="m">Anthropocene 
                    Feminism</title>, which collectively clamor for an intersectional
                    new-wave feminism equally attentive to matters of human social justice and
                    nonhuman materialism, Anthropocene Romanticism, if we can put it that way for
                    now (as Effinger does), displays a cross-spectrum of interests and ideas. The
                    Anthropocene, this volume demonstrates, cannot be allowed to subsume the social
                    and ontological differences that exist between humans and nonhumans in the name
                    of “species.” As Rosi Braidotti, in that volume, writes, “Earth-related issues
                    are not immune to social relations of class, race, age, disability, sexual
                    preference and should not be renaturalized” (40). These interests and ideas
                    exceed the narrow focus on the human that has long dominated and defined
                    Romanticism, a picture this volume rejects in favor of an intersectional vision
                    that connects class, race, gender, age, disability, sexual preference, nonhuman
                    materialism, and feminist materialism into a vital politics.</p>
                  <p>But even as it foregrounds intersectionality, the volume
                    queries what we mean by the term “human.” Much like Jacques Derrida once
                    cautioned about “the animal” when he wrote that there is no animal only animals
                    (“<foreign xml:lang="fr">animaux</foreign>” is his proposed nomenclature), these 
                essays refuse a categorical humanness, or even, as Alaimo warns against above, the 
                homogeneity of a “human species” (Derrida 32–41). Instead, the Romanticism that 
                appears here draws lines of connection even as it is also fractured, disparate, and 
                shattered, with each author offering myriad views of how to pick up the pieces.</p>
                  <p>We can observe this in Rejack’s and Carman’s different readings of Keats, Ruderman 
                and Ottinger exploring dramatically divergent but complementary Wordsworths, and in 
                Rejack’s, Effinger’s, and Washington’s rethinking of Romantic time.</p>
                  <p>Rejack’s essay, both personal and polemical, begins in melancholy as he ponders 
                memories of his wedding, the day before which he found himself gazing up at ancient 
                mushroom rocks in the Rocky Mountains. To him the mushroom rocks, part of a formation 
                that dates back 1.7 billion years, recall us to deep time, the fact that the earth 
                existed long before us and will likely persist well after us. For Rejack, a true Keatsian, 
                a melancholy fit falls as “the shock and sadness that accompany this strange 
                temporal situation came to mind” during what should have been a happy event. What, 
                he wonders, will be left of the world in the future? To this end, he turns, in what 
                could serve as an overarching explanation of not only his own but all of the essays 
                in this volume, to “focus in this essay on how the feeling of living in the 
                Anthropocene and its strange temporality affects how we teach, and specifically 
                how we teach Romanticism.” The course he designed, <title level="a">The Failures of 
                    Romanticism,</title> captures something of the complicity concerns that began 
                this introduction. But if Rejack’s essay begins in melancholy and failure, it quickly 
                becomes something else. Winding together contemporary song lyrics, Mary 
                Shelley’s <title level="m">The Last Man</title>, Percy Shelley’s <title level="m">A 
                    Defence of Poetry</title>, Jeff Vandermeer’s <title level="m">Southern 
                        Reach</title> trilogy, and finally Keats’s last on-earth pun (“I am leading 
                a posthumous existence”) and weird fairyland trip <title level="m">The Cap and 
                    Bells</title>, Rejack serves up a pedagogical polemic for how to laugh together 
                in the classroom rather than cower in fear and despair. In this sense, the essay 
                skillfully draws an affective Romanticism between teacher, student, text, and 
                scholar. It is a touching and forceful invocation, “a defence of Romanticism” 
                that is thoroughly Romantic, a reminder of the pedagogical power the period still 
                holds to teach us all something we didn’t know we didn’t know.</p>
                  <p>Carman’s essay serves as a kind of <foreign xml:lang="la">vade mecum</foreign> for 
                how to teach queer ecology in the Anthropocene, which he develops through a careful, 
                in-depth, startlingly brilliant reading of Keats’s “I stood tip-toe upon a little 
                hill” and <title level="m">Endymion</title>. As Carman remarks, thinking queer 
                    ecology makes sense because both “nature” and
                    “queer sexuality” share “a lack of a rigid outline.” Think of the example of
                    LGBTQ, he suggests, which for now is end-stopped by Q but which looks “as
                    intersectional as it is infinite.” For Carman, Keats draws together the queer
                    and the ecological in these poems because they unleash an eroticized desire that
                    comports with queerness even as it is a desire that advises us how to steward
                    the earth by walking tenderly on tip-toe rather than mashing the ground beneath
                    our feet. In this powerful reading that gives us a much more ecologically minded
                    Keats than we have previously encountered, Carman reminds us that even if the
                    Anthropocene is the “Age of Man,” it does not necessarily follow that it is the
                    “Age of the Straight Man” since “<emph>LGBTQ people . . . are no less dedicated 
                        to preserving</emph>” the Earth even if they do not, as he says, procreate 
                    like straight people do. Carman’s essay gives us a Romanticism that finds 
                    <foreign xml:lang="fr">jouissance</foreign> in sexuality and eroticism, a theme 
                    that Washington likewise explores in his own essay later in this volume, evoking 
                    a Romanticism hopeful about the future.</p>
                  <p>And yet, Romanticism is often characterized as skeptical in nature, which speaks to 
                the discourse and industry of climate denial. But “can this current skepticism be 
                traced to the Romantic period?” Ottinger asks of climate-change deniers. While 
                Ottinger notes that a spate of new studies on Romantic science render accounts of 
                it as “anti-science . . . untenable,” worries about the period’s skeptical nature 
                nonetheless require an exploration of how “the hierarchized different genres of 
                media” Romantic authors created “shaped the way that that they related to the planet and 
                thereby produced a particular brand of ecology.” An exploration of Romantic media 
                lends itself to experiments with media in the classroom, specifically, an 
                exercise where students draw lyrics on paper. Ottinger traces the results of one 
                such experiment when he asks students to sketch what Wordsworth describes in a 
                lyric from <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, <title level="a">Written in 
                    Germany, on One of the Coldest Days of the Century.</title> In visualizing 
                the poem through art, students gain an increased
                    awareness of the perspective of the Romantic lyric “I” since they have to think
                    through Wordsworth’s position in the cottage as well as what subsists outside
                    the cottage, namely nature, the weather, and the earth, all of which are
                    steadily getting colder. For Ottinger, the exercise literally mitigates our
                    strange subject position vis-à-vis climate and the Anthropocene by staging
                    “one’s self in an alien time, place, and climate,” the very thing the
                    Anthropocene threatens to force us to do whether we wish to or not. In this
                    sense, Ottinger invents a pedagogy that enacts a divestment of ourselves as we
                    see, through the media of ink on paper, the eco-mimetic separation of the
                    Romantic “I” from the world around it. We become disoriented from ourselves,
                    unsure where the world ends and we begin, which places us in a
                    certain time and space even while dislocating us from time and space.</p>
                  <p>D. B. Ruderman’s pedagogical experiments join nicely with
                    Ottinger’s, and Effinger’s below, to help students query their own subject
                    position re the larger world around them. Like Rejack, Ruderman takes a personal
                    turn as he notes that his students in south central Ohio experience the
                    Anthropocene in the form of the trickle-down effects of a capitalist economy
                    that has long crushed them in its invisible hands. To grasp the full impact of
                    these effects, though, requires listening to the ambient silence of the world.
                    Ruderman looks to silence as theorized in the work of Wordsworth and John Cage
                    to investigate “whether silence as a romantic concept cuts into and 
                    denatures . . . subjectivity, offering us another defamiliarized subject in its 
                    place, or whether silence merely resounds as yet another form of acquiescence.” 
                    For Ruderman, silence—which is not the absence of sound, he writes—is what allows 
                    for the outside to enter in, a formulation reminiscent of Ottinger’s pedagogical 
                    artwork illustrations of the lyric. In this fashion, Ruderman gives us an 
                    auditory pedagogy for the Anthropocene parallel to Ottinger’s visual one. In 
                    Wordsworth and Cage, on Ruderman’s and his class’s interpretation, silence “is 
                    something like a container that provides the conditions and the imaginative 
                    space for political action.” Having read Wordsworth’s <title level="a">There Was 
                        A Boy</title> as well as listened to and read Cage’s reflections on silence, 
                Ruderman’s students then did field work: they recorded ambient noise which Ruderman 
                created a sound mix of in order to listen to the silence between the odd sounds 
                found in their outside environment. To the students, this type of keying into the 
                environment amounted to a weak type of politics, one that, they argued, while 
                aesthetically interesting, required theorizing specific action. His students, 
                aware that they are at the mercy of a neoliberal war aimed at the poor and the 
                lower middle class, wanted a viable politics with which to fight back. And yet, 
                as Ruderman writes, only by listening to the unheard, undeclared kinds of violence 
                being directed at us, subjects of the Anthropocene, can we begin to hear “what 
                man has made of man,” as Wordsworth puts it.</p>
                  <p>Effinger’s class engaged in a complimentary experiment with sound as well as a study 
                of disruptive Anthropocene temporalities. In classical rhetoric, as Effinger 
                notes, <foreign xml:lang="la">hysteron proteron</foreign> means the temporal 
                inversion of speech, but Effinger uses it as one basis for rethinking pedagogy 
                in the Anthropocene. As she writes, “the goal in going about things backward—the 
                inversion of past and future—is to revitalize a present relationship, to hear 
                Romantic poetry, ideas, and problematics as a frenetic, undulating constellation 
                murmuring beneath the Anthropocene.” Romantic birdsong poetry, so often obsessed 
                with its own failure to capture the purer poetry of the bird mimetically, and 
                thus claiming the poet and the poem as a failure, in Effinger’s lesson finally 
                may have achieved its goal. She points out that in the Anthropocene, “climate 
                change is now the primary threat to avian extinction,” which means that returning 
                to Romantic birdsong can, after a fashion, return us to a time before avian 
                extinction. It allows Effinger to locate in the birdsong of the past the full 
                murmur of what we can no longer hear—perhaps because, as Effinger says, in the 
                Anthropocene we are drowned by silent wars in the every day. Effinger institutes 
                a practice she calls “close listening,” an exercise that we can hear murmuring 
                gently in the ear of Ruderman’s silence, to help students tune into the “ubiquitous 
                sounds, those metonyms for the unsaid or silences within discourse.” Through 
                close listening to bird poems by Charlotte Smith, Samuel Taylor Coleridge (from 
                whose <title level="m">Biographia Literaria</title> Effinger takes and reimagines 
                the use of <foreign xml:lang="la">hysteron proteron</foreign>), John Keats, and 
                John Clare, Effinger and her students work their way toward a political call to 
                action in the Anthropocene that “opens up the subject to the more than human.” 
                Politically this serves as a form of resistance to our very humanness, a 
                to-be-called by the other in a Levinasian sense that strikes back at the heart 
                of the Anthropocene: us.</p>
                  <p>Like Effinger, Washington is interested in temporally scrambled pedagogies that 
                also invoke the nonhuman as central to any Anthropocene politics Romanticism 
                develops. But for him, both the human and nonhuman remain categorically elusive 
                in the Anthropocene to the extent that new hybrid formations will necessarily 
                continue to develop. Washington invokes what he terms “hyper-jump pedagogy,” 
                something of a counterpart to Effinger’s <foreign xml:lang="la">hysteron 
                    proteron</foreign> pedagogy, to attempt to literally model how time works 
                in the Anthropocene: we are not necessarily going back to the future so much 
                as the future always slips away, slip-sliding us back into a past and present 
                we have no temporal control over. His contribution presents a 
                choose-your-own-adventure scenario with two versions of his “essay.” In the 
                first, you can read a version that tracks backward, from the end of the essay 
                to the beginning, an upside-down schema via a kind of chiasmus. It begins with 
                a reading of Wollstonecraft and Rousseau—the past, in other words—but tracks 
                forward to a reading that ranges over Cormac McCarthy’s <title level="m">The 
                    Road</title>, <title level="m">Mad Max: Fury Road</title>, Lucy Corin’s 
                flash fiction, and <title level="m">Wall-E</title>. Yet it does so by taking 
                flight with the readings of Wollstonecraft and Rousseau that only the later 
                readings make possible. The second version of the essay tries to institute a 
                nice derangement of paragraphs by allowing readers to click a button that 
                generates a random presentation of the essay. Paragraph 21 might open this 
                version followed by paragraph 1 or paragraph 10, a higgedly-piggedly 
                chronology meant to mimic the erasure of <emph>telos</emph> in the Anthropocene 
                and our own (non)experience of time’s
                    futural pastness. In the interstices of this chiasmatic and/or contingent
                    disorientation, we see how sex and gender might play out in the Anthropocene’s
                    postapocalypse when who we have sex with and how we have it can stymie or
                    unleash an energy that is not merely biopolitical in a human sense but queer in
                    ways that crosshatch Carman’s reading of Keats’s digit(al), and Rejack’s and
                    Ottinger’s digital, environmental protection agency.</p>
                  <p>With its roots in political revolution and individual imaginative expression, 
                Romanticism has always been relevant to today, whenever that is. Yet we have faced 
                the same so-called humanities crisis since the 1960s. To wit, academe in general 
                does not matter, so the charge goes, not least Romanticism with its thorny 
                questions of what exactly a modern politics might constitute, what an individual 
                might be, what the world and our relation to it consists of, and even what it 
                means to think the human and/or the nonhuman. No one, it seems, cares about an 
                academe that tries to transgress the safe spaces of discourse that accounts for 
                all viewpoints. In many ways, Romanticism of course represents the purest ideal 
                and commitment to free, unadulterated speech, a democratic laissez faire of the 
                individual that many libertarians look to in order to justify their desired 
                dismantlement of the social contract (Godwin’s anarchist theory, for instance). 
                If this volume demonstrates anything, though, then it reminds us that 
                Romanticism can, or should, never be about injustice, to our fellow human beings 
                or our non-fellow nonhumans, or to the idea, in general, of difference.</p>
                  <p>The pedagogies grouped here recollect us to Romanticism as a fight, a battle cry, 
                a rally, a movement against injustice, against prejudice, against pride in our 
                own perceived humanity, a battle constantly waged in our classrooms and beyond. 
                Romanticism, Evan Gottlieb recalls, is not one thing (8). But it is, as these 
                essays demonstrate, certainly not certain things. It is resistance in its 
                multihued forms; it is resistance against class warfare from the 1%; it is 
                resistance to ethnocentricism; it is resistance to heteronormativity; it is 
                resistance to human pride, selfishness, and greed; it is resistance to 
                inhibitions of expression; it is resistance to sexual shaming; it is 
                resistance to misogyny; it is resistance to politics as usual; it is resistance 
                to “sit down and shut up”; it is resistance to homophobia; it is resistance to 
                racism; it is resistance to the Anthropocene “feel good”; it is resistance to 
                any form of discrimination or oppression; it is resistance to the human trumpery 
                we in the United States have subjected ourselves to. This volume is—or wants to 
                be—a pedagogical politics of resistance. How successful its Romanticism is, is 
                up to you, dear reader.</p>
                  <p>This collection reminds us that Percy Shelley’s notion of
                    poets as the unacknowledged legislators of the world takes new charge in the
                    Anthropocene, a time that tests teaching with its evanescence, to augur
                    Romanticism as more important than ever in our vanishing classrooms. To remind
                    us that we, as teachers, are unacknowledged legislators too. It reminds us that
                    if human life begins to end in the Anthropocene, then perhaps humans and
                    nonhumans may yet be able to live through, with, and by Romanticism.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay explores how the feeling of living in the
                    Anthropocene and its strange temporality affects how we teach, and specifically how
                    we teach Romanticism. Teaching without a solid sense of futurity—the reigning
                    affective state of our current moment—cuts at the core of pedagogical practice.
                    Drawing on a recent experience of teaching an undergraduate-level course in
                    Romanticism with a focus on “The Failures of Romanticism,” I suggest that
                    Romantic-era texts can offer models of feeling appropriate to the affective
                    experience of living amidst global ecological catastrophe, and maybe help us fail
                    together better. When teaching without a future we must combine our melancholic
                    embrace of vulnerability with other affective modes; in this essay I propose we
                    imbue our Anthropocenic pedagogy with love, acceptance, and humor.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Two summers ago I was lucky enough to get married in Estes Park, Colorado, amidst the
                grandeur and geologic variety of the Rocky Mountains. The day before the ceremony,
                some friends and I visited Rocky Mountain National Park, driving along its famed
                Trail Ridge Road, eventually stopping at a parking area located more than 12,000
                feet above sea level, where we gawked at a herd of grazing bighorn sheep. After
                getting our fill of the sheep, we proceeded to walk up the gentle slope of the
                Tundra Communities Trail. It brought us to a group of several mushroom rocks, so
                named for their mushroom-like appearance, and which, a small plaque informed us,
                were composed of some of the oldest rocks in the park. The granite base and schist
                cap date back approximately 1.7 billion years, having been formed through volcanic
                and metamorphic processes respectively, then covered for millions of years by a sea
                and the many layers of sediment it deposited on top of them, sediment that would
                later erode away through several periods of glaciation. So it happens that the
                mountain range’s ancestral rocks come to reemerge in our present. </p>

                  <p>The deep time of geologic processes was not the only thing on my mind over the course
                of the nuptial weekend. Getting married, it turns out, tends to focus one rather
                intensely on the present. In addition to basking in the love flowing between all
                those gathered in celebration, there are pressing issues like ensuring that one’s
                eyebrows look good (failure), figuring out how to lower the room temperature at the
                reception (mostly failure), or getting the background music to the perfect volume
                level for all parts of the room (success!). Even so, I had geologic time in the back
                of my mind. Living in the Anthropocene has this effect: we can’t help but think of
                the unimaginably vast stretches of time and space that brought the world to the
                state we find it in, while also recognizing that we inhabit a present in which we
                are responsible for the anthropogenic destruction rendering the future so tenuous.
                As the editors of <title level="m">Arts of Living on a Damaged Planet</title> pose it,
                “living arrangements that took millions of years to put into place are being undone
                in the blink of an eye” (Tsing et al. G1). The shock and sadness that accompany this
                strange temporal situation came to mind during the reception, when I was at once
                deeply touched by a family member’s remark that he and his wife would be celebrating
                their fortieth anniversary next year, and deeply troubled by the thought that 40
                years from now my spouse and I might not have much of a world in which to celebrate
                that milestone for ourselves. I recognize that talk of “the end of the world” or
                other dire speculations on the fallout from climate change may seem alarmist,
                exaggerated, or overly dramatic. But the reality of what we will have wrought by
                2057, or whatever arbitrary future target we set for ourselves, doesn’t matter as
                much as the feeling that such calamitous things may come to pass. As David Collings
                writes in <title level="m">Stolen Future, Broken Present</title>: “We are now caught
                in a surpassingly strange, horrific moment—a moment when we cannot help but think,
                is it too late? Do we still have a future?” (11). We don’t and can’t know for
                certain the answers to those questions, but that we exist in a moment when asking
                them is not ridiculous enhances the urgency of responding to them. The affective
                experience of living in the Anthropocene matters crucially when we consider, as
                Collings writes, that “<emph>the future is never just for the people of
                    the future; without that future, what we do now loses its force</emph>. Without a
                future, there is no present and not much of a past” (19).</p>
                  <p>I focus in this essay on how the feeling of living in the Anthropocene and its
                strange temporality affects how we teach, and specifically how we teach Romanticism.
                Teaching without a solid sense of futurity cuts at the core of the practice. 
                In <title level="m">Learning to Die in the Anthropocene</title>, Roy Scranton suggests
                that “the greatest challenge the Anthropocene poses . . . is a philosophical one:
                understanding that this civilization is already dead” (23). How does one teach—a
                profession predicated on the future and on stable structures of civilization—with
                that realization? In the spring of 2016 I taught a course in which that question was
                always present in my mind; through that experience I sought to understand the
                intersections between Romanticism, ecological collapse, and the role of affect in
                the space of the classroom. The course was a 200-level undergraduate class on
                Romanticism I titled “The Failures of Romanticism,” and the conceptual premise was
                that as much as Romantic writers exude optimism, in other ways the recognition of
                Romanticism’s own failures is built into the project. With this focus, I asked
                students to recognize one way we continue the legacy of Romanticism, given that we
                now reckon with so many systems (economic, political, social, and of course,
                ecological) falling apart. The experience of consistently bumming out my students
                about the fate of the world, however, led me to think deeply about the pedagogical
                effectiveness of such affective work. The neoliberal university in its terrifying
                ideal form would turn faculty members into little more than customer service workers
                emitting mandated positive affect like any other laborer in the precarious gig
                economy. Such a fate in no way appeals to me, nor does it make much sense when
                contemplating ecological catastrophe. Even so, I continued to wrestle with the
                nagging sense that melancholy and anxiety might not be the best affects for
                pedagogically engaging with the Anthropocene.</p>
                  <p>So what to do, then? I would suggest that teaching in the Anthropocene calls for a
                shared embrace of vulnerability, which ought to begin with the teacher’s own
                displays of (often melancholic) feeling, but must not end there.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In both <title level="m">Ecology without Nature</title> and
                    <title level="m">The Ecological Thought</title>, Timothy Morton argues
                            that melancholy is the privileged affect of the Anthropocene. While he
                            does note that the “ecological thought . . . is realistic, depressing,
                            intimate, alive and ironic all at the same time,” I suggest that
                            irony—and particularly playful, joyful irony—ought to receive more
                            attention and emphasis (<title level="m">Ecological Thought</title> 16). I
                            share with both Chris Washington and Morton the sense that we can do
                            without the irony of “postmodern hipster posturing” and its “T-shirt
                            sloganeering” (Washington 454; Morton, 
                    <title level="m">Hyperobjects</title> 173). Washington suggests that Romantic irony,
                            particularly in its tragic register, can help us “be relocated into the
                            tragedy of the present rather than the farce of the future” (454). But
                            the tragedy of the present needs the irony of the fool as well—an irony
                            of joy as well as of sorrow, and utterly, embarrassingly sincere with
                            respect to both.</note> After the fall, we still exist, and we
                require other sensations. Collapse is, etymologically, a 
                <emph>falling together</emph>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">From the Latin
                    <emph>col-</emph> (together) <emph>labi</emph> (to fall). The <title level="m">OED</title>
                            notes that the participial adjective “collapsed” appears to have emerged
                            (from the Latin form, <hi rend="italic">collapsus</hi>) before the verb
                            and noun usages.</note> Teaching Romanticism with this focus on
                failure and collapse reinforced for me my sense that Romantic-era texts can offer
                models of feeling appropriate to the affective experience of living amidst global
                ecological catastrophe, and maybe help us fall together better. The poetics of
                sensibility in Charlotte Smith’s <title level="m">The Emigrants</title> and 
                <title level="m">Beachy Head</title>, the extension of sympathy to the downtrodden in
                Mary Robinson’s <title level="m">Lyrical Tales</title>, John Keats’s experiments with
                the core being of sensation and affect, and Mary Shelley’s temporally layered
                contemplations of human finitude in <title level="m">The Last Man</title>—all these
                textual encounters become newly inflected as we teach in a time when we cannot
                choose but feel in radically different ways thanks to what we have wrought. By the
                time we reached the end of the semester and read <title level="m">The Last
                Man</title>, I (and, I think, my students) felt an affinity with its narrator and
                titular figure, Lionel Verney, who writes to no one save “<hi rendition="#smcap">the
                    illustrious dead,</hi>” whom he bids “<hi rendition="#smcap">arise, and read your
                    fall!</hi>” (466). Like Verney, we now experience the deep temporal disruption
                wrought by the Anthropocene. As Verney’s beloved Idris exclaims early in 
                <title level="m">The Last Man</title>, we too feel as if “already the to-morrow is
                come” (85).</p>
                  <p>But even if we are “Too, too late for the fond believing lyre” and its
                forward-looking messages of hope, teaching this class reinforced my sense that we
                cannot rely on despair or sadness alone for our affective pedagogical modes. Unlike
                Verney, my students and I did not have the option of responding to the recognition
                of global catastrophe by embarking on a solitary voyage around the world’s oceans.
                We are here. We are alive. As we find ourselves surrounded by the “haunted
                landscapes” characteristic of the Anthropocene, the persistent pasts we’ve attempted
                to raze nevertheless remain, and because of their ghostly presences, these pasts
                “relentlessly trouble the narratives of Progress, and urge us to radically imagine
                worlds that are possible because they are already here” (Tsing et al. G12). Or as
                Austra poses it in the opening track of her poignantly Anthropocenic album 
                <title level="m">Future Politics</title>, “<ref rend="new"
                          target="https://austramusic.bandcamp.com/track/we-were-alive">It’s like we were
                    alive</ref>.” After the fall, after the revelation that is apocalypse, we move
                forward with the recognition that the vitality of humans and nonhumans always has
                been there, even when we were too dull to sense it, and always will be there, even
                when we recklessly pursue our own destruction. In the span of geologic time, the
                earth will be just fine, even as climate change in our shorter-term span will render
                unimaginable suffering for human and nonhuman beings. We need to act as if we were
                alive, even if it is already too late for us. In the classroom, when teaching
                without a future, we must combine our melancholic embrace of vulnerability with
                other affective modes; at the risk of sounding like some sort of New Age self-help
                book, I propose we imbue our pedagogy with love, acceptance, and humor.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>When we teach, we put our loves on display. We embody and perform our loves not 
                necessarily of other people, but of the things that we teach, the things we attempt 
                to commune with and communicate to our students. This assertion likely calls to 
                mind any number of teaching narratives in which teachers profess their abiding 
                passion for their subjects, for their students, for teaching itself. Indeed, 
                one might say that passion for one’s subject material is an essential component of 
                good teaching; we’ve all, at one point or another, been either praised or shamed 
                for the degree to which we express enthusiasm for our subject material in the 
                classroom. The unstated assumption is that the more visible the passion, the better 
                the teaching, and the better the teaching, the better the learning. I hope to expand 
                on our commonplace understanding of the relationship between passion and learning by 
                drawing attention to an affect intimately related to love: namely interest, which 
                Silvan Tomkins in his influential model refers to as the “most seriously neglected” 
                of the affects (337). A pedagogy of love requires attunement to the transformations 
                and rearticulations of interest (and perchance love) by students. This is not to say 
                that we should love our students and that they should (nay, <emph>must</emph>) love 
                us in return. Of course there are affective bonds between teacher and student, but 
                for a variety of reasons including the inappropriate forms of teacher-student love 
                that manifest at various levels of education, I call for something quite different. 
                The love that transpires moves through objects, not subjects. We love the objects of 
                interest; students themselves become interested in those objects; in the aftermath, 
                both teacher and student come to love (or not) an object of interest that is and is 
                not the object with which they began. That is to say, a pedagogy of love operates 
                iteratively. We iterate our love and students translate that love into a new 
                iteration, which we take up, transform, and reiterate.<note place="foot" resp="editors">While here I pose this cycle with specific beginning and ending 
                    points, of course in practice people enter into or exit the circle at different 
                    points and in different ways.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>A similar model of love exists in Percy Bysshe Shelley’s short essay 
                <title level="a">On Love.</title> His attempt at a definition begins:<quote>
                        <emph>Thou</emph> demandest what is Love. It is that powerful attraction
                    towards all we conceive, or fear, or hope beyond ourselves, when we find within
                    our own thoughts the chasm of an insufficient void, and seek to awaken in all
                    things that are, a community with what we experience within ourselves. If we
                    reason we would be understood; if we imagine we would that the airy children of
                    our brain were born anew within another’s; if we feel we would that another’s
                    nerves should vibrate to our own, that the beams of their eyes should kindle at
                    once and mix and melt into our own; that lips of motionless ice should not reply
                    to lips quivering and burning with the heart’s best blood:—this is Love. This is
                    the bond and the sanction which connects not only man with man, but with every
                    thing which exists. (503–4)</quote>
                I draw on Shelley’s notion of love since it’s as much a theory of communication as it 
                is a contemplation of love. It figures love as a communicative process of tuning or 
                harmonizing signals. Love begins in what Roman Jakobson calls the phatic register of 
                communication, when an utterance exists primarily to test the status of the channel 
                (e.g., “Can you hear me now? Is this thing on?”). In a manner similar to how Maurice 
                Blanchot poses the communicative content of a work of literature, “What it says is 
                exclusively this: that it is—and nothing more” (22), love likewise references itself. 
                Love, however, operates in the interrogative. What love says is exclusively this: 
                <emph>is it that</emph>? Promising something ever more about to be, love requires 
                response. As Shelley puts it, love demands that “another’s nerves should vibrate to 
                our own.” We approach love with trepidation because the answer to “is it that?” may 
                return as a resounding, Prufrockian “That is not it, at all.” Phatic communication 
                likewise risks never receiving a reliable response indicating an open channel. When 
                I speak to a silent classroom, it might as well be engulfed in a wall of noise that 
                my meek voice could never hope to rise above. This pedagogy of love, then, is not 
                some magical answer to the ambiguity of transfer. Instead, I propose that we table 
                the question altogether. Much is to be gained from the acceptance of noise, darkness, 
                obscurity, and the anxiety such obstacles provoke.</p>
                  <p>In testing our love for the objects we teach, students potentially become the
                signal-boosters of the message. With no future, though, what kind of signal can we
                ever hope to hear echoing back to us? First we must simply accept that communication
                moves through “enfeebl[ing] . . . mediums,” as Shelley puts it in <title level="m">A 
                    Defence of Poetry</title> (513). But a related strategy is to shift the agency
                of love to the side of those objects that interest us (for me, always my first love,
                Keats). Embracing a Latour-inspired distributed agency, one that posits the crucial
                role of nonhuman objects, ought to come easily, given the language we use to discuss
                interest in loved objects. When something <emph>piques our
                interest</emph>, it stabs us, leaving an imprint of itself in the shape of a wound, a
                remnant of its liveliness. When interest wanes, the object <emph>does
                    nothing</emph> for us. When we say <emph>that interests me</emph>, the
                causal emphasis ought to fall on the same side as the grammatical subject of the
                sentence. When interest begins, we say <emph>I’m into that right
                    now</emph>, emphasizing the spatial and temporal aspects of affective interest.
                Objects are mediums for interest to navigate between the different things existing
                in the spaces those objects occupy and coproduce. Such spaces emerge, evolve, and
                dissipate over time. Using the intransitive valence, we can say that objects are
                always <hi rend="italic">interest</hi>ing, always doing the activity of interest,
                whether or not some other object (like a teacher or a student) comes along to
                respond to its vibratory activity.<note place="foot" resp="editors">My account 
                    of the vibrancy and vitality of objects in this paragraph is indebted 
                    to Jane Bennett’s model of agency in <title level="m">Vibrant Matter</title>.</note> Here we can point
                again to Shelley’s model of love as a communicative process involving requests for
                other lively objects to act in concert with us, to share interest and thereby
                “kindle,” “mix,” and “melt” with one another. The bonds of this kind of love connect
                not only humans to humans, and not only sentient beings to other sentient beings,
                but “every thing which exists.”</p>
                  <p>What are the payoffs then? For one, this approach to love in the realm of pedagogy,
                when articulated via the kinds of vocabulary I’ve adopted throughout, counters some
                of the reigning assumptions about the role of passion in teaching. Love in the sense
                I invoke it operates not as something that one willfully adopts, but rather as an
                affect acting through us and our interactions with others (humans and nonhumans).
                One benefit of such a theoretical alignment is the possibility of novelty. Because
                our interests choose us as much as we choose them, new things emerge without our
                conscious designs necessarily implementing their arising. This other-oriented love,
                this haunted and haunting love for dark objects, is also ethical and political in
                nature. It demands that we reckon with the being of all things in the altered
                ecology of the Anthropocene. Objects of interest speak to us. Sometimes we know not
                what they say until their voices resound through our students’ taking up of those
                same objects, and thus we commune with our students. We share that which is common,
                that which means. We correspond by co-responding, responding together, to things
                that are not us. Thus a pedagogy of love—not a selfish, but an 
                <emph>other</emph>ish love; in Blakean terms, the love of a clod, not of a
                pebble—offers a means of resisting a key ideological assumption of neoliberalism:
                the notion that we are all autonomous, divided selves fully responsible for our own
                successes and failures, both of which can only ever be adjudicated by the dictates
                of the market. Shelley argues that “the great secret of morals is Love; or a going
                out of our own nature” (<title level="m">Defence</title> 517). Poetry and imagination
                operate on us by strengthening our ability to go out of our natures, and now that
                the Anthropocene urgently forces us to reimagine our natures and the imbrication of
                our natures with our altered environments, we need to exercise those faculties as
                much as possible. The classroom may be one of our last discursive places in which
                such exercises are not only possible, but actively encouraged and cultivated. This
                expansive notion of love and the forms it circulates in will not prevent
                Anthropocenic despair, but attempting a pedagogy rooted in love may at least help us
                and our students better attend to the world in which we find ourselves, tenuous and
                temporary as it is. And attending to reality is the first step toward imagining
                another one.</p>

                  <p>We hear a lot about climate denial in the United States, although perhaps less than
                we used to, now that alternative strategies to the complete rejection of facts and
                science have surfaced (“I’m no scientist!” “Sure,
                CO<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> plays a part, but we can’t know
                what other factors are involved,” or the utterly inane, childish, nonsensical
                Pittsburgh-not-Paris excuse). Just as grieving individuals work their way through
                denial and eventually proceed to acceptance, we as a species (and especially the
                U.S. as a country) need to work toward that point. The difference in this situation
                is that we need to accept not only the reality of anthropogenic climate change and
                all that it has already and will continue to do; we need also to accept that we are
                to blame. If a murderer were to pass through the five stages of grief for his
                victim, I suppose that’s what humanity now faces. In this case, though, the murder
                occurred through billions and trillions of tiny cuts, with all of us joining in the
                slaying like so many Caesarian conspirators, albeit with many more stabs coming from
                some peoples and places (i.e., the citizens, myself included, of the one country
                that continues to deny the existence of climate change most vociferously, despite
                having across history accounted for the greatest proportion of <ref rend="new"

                  <p>If we treat the objects of our inquiry with love, honor, and care, we will ideally be
                led to respect their full reality, even if we cannot fully apprehend it. When we
                apply that thinking to the reality of climate change and global ecological
                catastrophe, a corollary affective response will be acceptance, as long as we can
                find ways to move through denial, anger, and other understandable responses to the
                recognition of inhabiting a planet that may already be locked into a future in which
                human life will more or less become impossible. For this reason, acceptance of our
                complicity in creating the Anthropocene ought to become the emblematic affect of our
                new epoch. The challenge is to prevent ourselves from moving immediately after
                acceptance into quiescent despair. But first I should explain why I even conceive of
                acceptance as an affect, given that it may more readily be understood as a logically
                reasoned position one consciously adopts. True acceptance emerges precisely from 
                <emph>not knowing</emph>. While I can certainly affirm that I am complicit
                in anthropogenic climate change, I can never know exactly how I am folded into it
                (to gesture toward the etymology of <emph>complicit</emph>, which comes
                from the Latin <foreign xml:lang="la">plicare</foreign>, meaning to fold or to weave). The
                folds of causality and responsibility are aesthetic in nature, meaning that we
                cannot know them, but we can feel their effects and affects.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In <title level="m">Hyperobjects</title> Tim Morton argues as much 
                    to explain the impossibility of fully cognizing a massively distributed (across
                            time and space) object like global warming.</note> As Keats
                attempts with the Grecian urn and the mysterious “leaf-fring’d legend” which “haunts
                about [its] shape,” the contours of my part in affecting the global climate can only
                ever be probed by questioning contemplation, by being teased out of thought and into
                embodied response by encounters with the ghostly objects moving about us. When I
                type this sentence on my computer, I play a part in introducing more carbon dioxide
                into the atmosphere. Yet it’s a part for which I do not know the lines, even though
                I’m so obviously already standing on the stage. To accept is to feel one’s presence
                in the drama that is the Anthropocene even while remaining in the dark about how the
                play began and how it will end. The classroom becomes a recursive, iterative
                performance of this pageant, one in which my embodiment of acceptance helps to guide
                students into recognizing that they too share the stage with us all.</p>
                  <p>Acceptance is thus a particularly performative affect. As is the case with Sara
                Ahmed’s discussion of the stickiness of affect, my notion of acceptance involves how
                we orient ourselves toward, and how we are oriented by, other subjects and objects.
                What is the point of acceptance if we do not embody it forth for others? Here we
                arrive at the strategy to make other outcomes than despair issue from acceptance.
                For an illustration of this strategy, I turn to Jeff VanderMeer’s novel 
                <title level="m">Acceptance</title> (aptly titled for my purposes).
                <title level="m">Acceptance </title>is the last volume in
                VanderMeer’s <title level="m">Southern Reach</title> trilogy, a series that revolves
                around an unexplainable ecological catastrophe in an unknown location described
                simply as Area X. Across the three novels we learn some things about the past of
                Area X and its present situation, as well as characters’ attempts to make sense of
                the fundamentally altered world they find themselves in. Toward the trilogy’s
                conclusion, one of the main characters provides this gloss on acceptance
                specifically with respect to the new reality of Area X, but which can be readily
                translated into a reflection on living in the Anthropocene: “The world we are a part
                of now is difficult to accept, unimaginably difficult. I don’t know if I accept
                everything even now. I don’t know how I can. But acceptance moves past denial, and
                maybe there’s defiance in that, too” (338). To accept that we have no future, to
                accept that we are to blame, is perhaps the best means we have for defiance today.
                Acceptance marks a refusal to fight against things as they are, but it does not mean
                that we refuse to work toward how things might otherwise be. The defiant force of
                acceptance comes from the affectively embodied recognition of what we’ve done, even
                while not fully knowing how or why we did it, or even precisely what it was. We thus
                open a space for the future, even if it’s an already doomed one. A doomed future is
                nonetheless a future, and it’s ours if we accept it.</p>
                  <p>We might even venture beyond defiance and into what Jean Baudrillard, in a much
                different context, calls “refusal by overacceptance” (219). I know that my love for
                Keats (or any other writers/texts from Romanticism) will remain always devoid of any
                clear, unambiguous vibratory response, but I accept and love nonetheless. And I know
                that what I do now as a teacher might not matter if we have no future as a species,
                but I accept and love nonetheless. Thence proceeds melancholy, but also joy, which
                is what I find on every track of Anohni’s recent album, <title level="m">Hopelessness</title>, 
                and in particular on the track <title level="a">4 Degrees,</title> which provides
                the soundtrack to this essay’s opening. Encountered as quotations in an essay, the
                song’s lyrics (such as “I want to see this world / I want to see it boil,” or “I
                want to hear the dogs crying for water”) probably seem anything but joyful. Indeed,
                they are disturbing, and deeply sardonic. But if something can be simultaneously
                sardonic and sincere, this song accomplishes it. Anohni performs radical acceptance.
                She sings with glee of her desire to “burn the sky” and “burn the breeze,” of
                reveling in seeing “the animals die in the trees.” A purely sardonic reading of the
                song would perhaps imagine Anohni performing the role of some crazed fossil fuel
                baron, cheering on the destruction of the globe as we pursue four degrees of warming
                as if it were a quarterly earning target (here, and throughout her album, she is not
                unlike Wordsworth taking on different voices in <title level="m">Lyrical
                    Ballads</title>, or Robinson making similar moves in <title level="m">Lyrical
                    Tales</title>). While that reading is certainly a valid one, we might also read in
                the affective sincerity of her voice an admission and acceptance of her own
                complicity. Sure, those in the extractive industries who actively work against the
                interests of reducing emissions are easy to caricature as monstrous villains devoted
                to global destruction, but the brilliance of Anohni’s song is its insistence that we
                are all monstrous. We are all folded into this complicated mess, even if we try to
                get off the grid. The problem is there is no off-grid. As Anohni sings in the final
                lines of the album, “We are all Americans now.” No one escapes blame, even as
                different levels of blame are surely warranted. While sorting out and apportioning
                blame in just ways is crucial for the politico-economic realm, the more fitting
                affective and aesthetic answer is to belt out an electro-pop number proclaiming just
                how mired in it we all are: “Let’s Go! Let’s Go!” The song won’t do anything to stop
                rising CO<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> levels (and how could it?), but it does teach
                us something about the irony of acceptance and the complexity of how it feels.

                  <p>It may be a stretch to claim that <title level="a">4 Degrees</title> is funny, but it 
                certainly has a kind of gallows humor beneath its macabre surface. Does gallows humor 
                become unfunny when the entire globe is approaching the scaffold? In any case, the path 
                from love to acceptance next takes me to humor, or at least irony and the possibility of 
                joyful laughter always residing in irony, even in its darkest forms. In this final
                affective register I find the greatest value in what I regularly do in my
                Romanticism classrooms, which I’ve modeled throughout this essay: putting
                contemporary materials into relation with Romantic ones. As D. B. Ruderman and
                Rachel Feder point out in their introduction to <title level="m">Teaching
                    Romanticism with the Contemporary</title>, this method may seem to risk “potential
                anti-historicist implications,” but they counter that “sometimes one must think
                trans-historically in order to produce a historicist understanding.” They continue,
                “it is possible to wield the contemporary to peel back the cloak of canonicity that
                sometimes obscures Romantic literary experiments, all the while making students
                better readers—indeed, Romanticist readers—of their own literary, cultural, and
                historical moments.” One element of the current historical moment that the Romantic
                and neo-Romantic pairings can illuminate is the set of geologic, political,
                cultural, and ecological forces and effects that we have come to denominate with the
                term Anthropocene.</p>
                  <p>In loving, honoring, caring for, and accepting our past histories and texts, and in
                seeking to understand them in relation to our present and future in the
                Anthropocene, contemporary materials help with the crucial task of privileging and
                supporting the voices of nonnormative, oppressed, disadvantaged, or otherwise
                unjustly treated peoples. In the political arena we need to align climate advocacy
                with broader social justice issues; as Naomi Klein points out in <title level="m">This 
                    Changes Everything</title>, those on the front lines of the climate fight,
                those inhabiting what she calls “Blockadia,” are often indigenous peoples who’ve
                been systematically oppressed and abused while not experiencing the benefits that
                the extractive industries have afforded to those of us removed from the front lines.
                We need to do the same in the cultural realm. With respect to pedagogy and living in
                the Anthropocene, queer and trans theory in particular offer poignant perspectives
                (that Anohni released <title level="m">Hopelessness</title> as her first album
                publicly announcing her trans identity while also engaging deeply with issues around
                climate change strikes me as a fitting congruence). The knowledges afforded by queer
                and trans perspectives teach us, among other things, what it means to inhabit
                realities, environments, and embodiments that do not conform to normative scripts of
                various kinds.</p>
                  <p>In her book <title level="m">Strange Natures</title>, Nicole Seymour offers a
                compelling union of queer theory and environmental criticism, using the former’s
                means for resisting “the natural” to help us see more clearly the world around us in
                all its nonnormative brilliance. Significantly, Seymour departs from strains of
                queer theory that reject futurity outright.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Seymour 
                    writes that while “queer theoretical work has tended to characterize futurity and 
                    future-thinking as heteronormative and pro-capitalist,” she maintains instead that 
                    “a queer ecological focus on futurity can highlight the fact that <emph>lack</emph> 
                    of concern for the future more accurately characterizes regimes such as 
                    heteronormativity and global capitalism” (183).</note> She insists that queer ecology 
                must make room for thinking the future, but instead of a triumphalist, masculinist approach 
                to environmentalism, she advocates for “a specifically queer ecological ethic of care:
                a care not rooted in stable or essentialized identity categories, a care that is not
                just a means of solving human-specific problems, a care that does not operate out of
                expectation for recompense” (184). In both <title level="m">Strange Natures</title>
                (particularly in her chapter on Shelley Jackson’s <title level="m">Half Life</title>)
                and in her more recent work, Seymour insists on the value of adopting ironic,
                irreverent, and humorous forms of engagement with ecological issues.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Seymour explores more fully a wide range of irreverent takes on 
                    environmentalism in her recent book <title level="m">Bad Environmentalism</title> (U of
                            Minnesota P, 2018).</note> Jack Halberstam writes at the end of
                <title level="m">The Queer Art of Failure</title> that “to live is to fail, to
                bungle, to disappoint, and ultimately to die; rather than searching for ways around
                death and disappointment, the queer art of failure involves the acceptance of the
                finite, the embrace of the absurd, the silly, and the hopelessly goofy” (187).
                Seymour works with a similar insight and ports it into the realm of ecological
                thinking, feeling, and action. Writing about ecocinema, she argues that “unserious
                affective modes can do serious work, sometimes even more successfully than serious
                ones” (<title level="a">Irony and Contemporary Ecocinema</title> 73). That does not mean 
                that serious affects have no place in discourses concerning ecology, nor does it mean 
                that we ought to stop seriously searching for ways to prevent ecological catastrophe from
                getting worse. But it does mean that we ought to accept that it’s already happened,
                that we’ve made it happen, and that as we fight against the forces that brought us
                here, we ought to do so precisely by continuing to fail, by reveling in our own
                absurdity, and by examining ourselves with irony, humor, and care. To do so is a
                collective endeavor (“Failure loves company,” writes Halberstam), and if we fail
                together, if we <emph>co</emph>-llapse, then “all our failures combined
                might just be enough, if we practice them well, to bring down the winner” (121,
                120).</p>
                  <p>Romanticism is arguably a failed project, but it’s one that continues. We hear it
                when listening to the minimalist techno of <ref rend="new" target="https://kompakt-gas.bandcamp.com/album/narkopop">Gas</ref> or <ref rend="new" target="https://thefield.bandcamp.com/album/the-follower">The Field</ref> and
                pairing their relentless looping patterns with Wordsworth’s poetics of repetition in
                <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>. We see it when gazing at the lush <ref rend="new" target="https://jackshainman.com/artists/el_anatsui">trash-pesties of El
                    Anatsui</ref>, who takes the detritus of global capitalism and converts it to
                sensuous excess, not dissimilar to Keats’s translations of the materials of his
                belated literary inheritance into something entirely richer, fairer, brighter than
                what came before him (all the while failing more spectacularly than he ever could
                have succeeded). We sense and feel it in the system-creating work of saxophonist
                    <ref rend="new" target="https://colinstetson.bandcamp.com/">Colin Stetson</ref> (after
                seeing him perform in between two days of reading Blake with my students, I
                enthusiastically related to them that I had an epiphany: at a particularly intense
                moment of his consistently visceral performance, a massive glob of spit fell from
                his mouth to the floor; meanwhile his alien soundscapes continued to flow throughout
                the room, and I realized that the saliva was a latter day “corroding fire,”
                stripping away the surface of things to reveal the substance of his art as material
                all the way down, but infinite nevertheless). And we think through it when we

                Maria Williams’s mental time-travel reflections on the French Revolution anticipates
                the structures of thought we must adopt when contemplating the future of humanity,
                though we might replace Williams’s enthusiasm with our melancholy (which, we need
                always to remind ourselves, shares an abode with joy):
            <quote>Future ages will celebrate, with grateful commemoration, the fourteenth of July; and
                strangers, when they visit France, will hasten with impatience to the Champ de Mars.
                . . . I think I hear them exclaim, “Here the Federation was held! here an assembled
                nation devoted themselves to freedom!” I fancy I see them pointing out the spot on
                which the altar of the country stood. I see them eagerly searching for the place
                where they have heard it recorded, that the National Assembly were seated! I think
                of these things, and then repeat to myself with transport, “<hi rend="italic">I</hi>
                was a spectator of the Federation!”
            <p rend="noCount">But these meditations have led me to travel through the space of so many centuries,
                that it is really difficult to get back again to the present times. (107–8)</p>
                     </quote>
            It is difficult, but we do get back again to present times, where we recall our
                failures, as Williams would do in her later volumes of the <title level="m">Letters
                    Written in France</title>, as her enthusiasm about the revolution waned, even as
                she ultimately remained optimistic. Perhaps now that our own ruin is so apparent to
                us, optimism is the wrong affect. Let us adopt instead, modifying Lauren Berlant’s
                “cruel optimism,” a <emph>kind pessimism</emph>. Optimistic triumphalism
                in the realm of the Anthropocene would merely reinscribe the same ideologies that
                got us here. “<ref rend="new"
                          target="https://store.other-people.net/release/76126-nicolas-jaar-sirens">History Lesson</ref>,” the closing track on Nicholas Jaar’s album <hi rend="italic">Sirens</hi>, sums up the Anthropocene well: “Chapter one: we
                fucked up. / Chapter two: we did it again, and again, and again, and again.” Let’s
                accept it, admit it, and do what we can with love and care to move into a future
                that we cannot possibly know.</p>
                  <p>Contemporary fiction, music, and art are crucial for helping us to imagine new worlds
                with the kindness needed to accompany our pessimism. That means empathy, love, and
                humor in the place of the nihilistic despair we find in popular postapocalyptic
                fictions like <title level="m">The Walking Dead</title>, which compulsively repeats
                hypermasculinist fantasies of pure capitalist competition wherein the currency is
                life and success means taking someone else’s before they take yours. Instead we need
                works like Kim Stanley Robinson’s <title level="m">New York 2140</title>, in which
                most of Manhattan is underwater, but where new social and political forms
                nevertheless take shape, and where the possibilities for the future are not simply
                echoes of past moribund systems. We need music like Austra’s 
                <title level="m">Future Politics</title>, which refuses to accede to the stagnant politics 
                of despair, hypocrisy, and moral decrepitude embodied so horrifyingly by the current
                American president, and instead creates a musical and lyrical vocabulary for
                sincerely envisioning a future of love, empathy, and radical alterity. We need
                novels like Margaret Atwood’s <title level="m">MaddAddam</title>, the final entry in
                the trilogy of the same name, in which we find humans, pigoons (genetically
                engineered pigs designed to have their organs harvested), and Crakers (a new species
                of human abandoned by their creator) forging solidarity across species lines in the
                aftermath of ecological disaster and the death of most of the Earth’s human
                population. Atwood’s novel manages uproariously funny moments throughout, even as it
                also consistently reminds readers of the unimaginable suffering humans have visited
                upon one another in its world.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, then, where might we find humor in Romanticism? And more importantly,
                where do we find the right kind of humor, one appropriate to confronting the
                Anthropocene? As I so often do, I find answers to these questions through John
                Keats. Although he might often be seen as an emblematically serious poet of High
                Romanticism, Keats is also ridiculously funny, even in his darkest moments of
                despair. My friend and colleague Michael Theune has pointed out (in many
                conversations with me over the years, and recently in print) that when Keats writes
                of feeling like he is “leading a posthumous existence”
                (<title level="m">Letters</title> 359)—a phrase that becomes
                deeply entwined with narratives about Keats’s deathly seriousness—he is making a
                pun! When he comes up with that phrase, Keats has arrived in Italy, separated from
                his love and increasingly resigned to his imminent death. As if dying from
                tuberculosis apart from all his loved ones weren’t bad enough, he also had to endure
                a vicious journey by ship, and upon finally arriving in Naples, he still could not
                go ashore for another 10 days, needing first to survive a quarantine period. Writing
                from Rome a month later, Keats tells his friend Charles Brown about using punning as
                a response to his horrific circumstances: “at my worst, even in Quarantine, [I]
                summoned up more puns, in a sort of desperation, in one week than in any year of my
                life” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 360). It’s in this same
                letter that Keats reflects on the feeling of “leading a posthumous existence.” Now,
                Keats loves to pun; we know this. Keats loves Shakespeare; we know this as well.
                What we tend to miss with “posthumous existence” is that it combines these two
                loves. As Theune explains, “Keats, exiled to Italy, away from his beloved Fanny
                Brawne, is leading a life like that of Posthumus, the character from Shakespeare’s
                <title level="m">Cymbeline</title>, who is exiled to Italy and so separated from
                his beloved Imogen” (48). If Keats can find space for humor in his grim personal
                circumstances, then surely we can do so in the face of collective global doom.</p>
                  <p>But there remain more ways to learn humor from Keats. If humor and irony (and maybe
                even acceptance) emerge out of failure, then Keats ought to be able to teach us a
                thing or two. The critical discourse around Keats from his day to our own rests on
                the idea that he begins his career with (mostly) embarrassing failures which he
                manages to transform into affirmative successes a few years later. While this
                narrative certainly has merit, I suggest that one under-regarded area of 
                <emph>late</emph> failure, and <emph>late</emph> humor, is
                Keats’s final, long but unfinished poem, <title level="m">The Cap and Bells; or The
                    Jealousies</title>, or as Keats himself referred to it, <title level="a">Lucy 
                        Vaughan Lloyd,</title> so
                named for the moniker under which he planned to publish it. One imagines that as
                Keats was travelling to Rome with the knowledge that he was surely to die there,
                perhaps still feeling, as he had in February 1820, that he had “left no immortal
                work behind” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 263), he might
                have thought to himself, with a bit of gallows laughter, “And 
                'Lucy Vaughan Lloyd' was the last thing I worked on?!” 
                I don’t have the space here to develop a full reading of the poem, but for 
                the purposes of putting its humor into the context of affective response to 
                the Anthropocene, consider two things: the poem narrates a
                civilization of fairies who seem to have a better understanding of the vast spaces
                of the globe and their interrelations than do humans, even as the main fairy
                characters desire to flee to the human realm and be with their human lovers; and at
                the same time, the poem subtly gestures toward the defining global climate
                catastrophe of the Romantic period, the eruption of Mount Tambora.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The poem includes Crafticant’s diary recollections from traveling 
                    with Bellanaine across the world, in which he recalls the following sight:<quote>
                           <lg type="stanza">
                              <l>Beheld afar off, in the hooded shade</l>
                              <l>Of darkness, a great mountain (strange to speak),</l>
                              <l>Spitting, from forth its sulphur-baken peak,</l>
                              <l>A fan-shaped burst of blood-red, arrowy fire,</l>
                              <l>Turban’d with smoke, which still away did reek,</l>
                              <l>Solid and black from that eternal pyre,</l>
                              <l>Upon the laden winds that scantly could respire. (660–66)</l>
                           </lg>
                        </quote>
                     </note> The fairies understand the global environment, 
                but they desire to inhabit an insouciant and unknowing human perspective 
                in which erotic desire is all that matters. At the same time, during their 
                journey the fairies Crafticant and Bellanaine conquer space and time with more
                mastery than humans, given that they travel through the Gobi desert to Afghanistan
                and arrive in western India, even though their journey began in Nepal. Perhaps the
                imprecise or impossible aerial navigation results from Keats’s lack of knowledge or
                interest in such matters. But if that is the case, it only supports the poem’s
                broader satire, which demonstrates that the fairies who know too much simply want to
                be silly like us and not worry about the broader world. The Anthropocene shows us
                that we can’t afford to not know, but if we are to survive it, we also need to laugh
                at, critique, and ironize the bases upon which our knowledges rest, particularly now
                that the reigning political discourse in the United States treats knowledge with
                such disdain. To do so is an affective challenge that will permeate all aspects of
                cultural life; the classroom enables the possibility that such affective poses could
                radiate outward, gathering strength and spreading to other people and spaces as we
                all move into the future.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">In this article, I present a way of teaching John
                    Keats’s <title level="a">I stood tip-toe upon a little hill</title> and 
                    <title level="m">Endymion</title> (amongst other Romantic-era poetical and prose works) 
                    as queerly ecological and as useful components of a pedagogical paradigm serviceable 
                    to those wishing to discuss environmental issues in the Anthropocene. The article shows 
                    the interdependencies of earthiness and eroticism in two short poems by Keats who was,
                    as I argue, not simply a sensualist but a subversive nature poet that imbued the
                    environment with erotic energy and promoted the conservationist practice of
                    tiptoeing as the best way of feeling the earth beneath one’s feet. It then examines
                    how <title level="m">Endymion</title>, with its well-known “Pleasure Thermometer”
                    passage, enacts a queer ecology that resonates in instructive ways vis-à-vis Timothy
                    Morton’s theorization of “the mesh.” The texts discussed here provide an instruction
                    manual for scholars and teachers investigating nineteenth-century depictions of
                    interdependencies in the natural world and human sexuality in a current Anthropocene
                    that threatens the futures of both of these phenomena.</p>

                  <p>Close attention to the poetical works of John Keats and the dually queer and
                ecological dependencies evident in these works can facilitate ways of interrogating
                nature (and the end of nature) in the college classroom. For instance, students and
                I might ask, what commonalities do queer people and the natural world share beyond
                their innate diversity—or what Burke called the “infinite variety of forms”
                locatable in the beauty of flowers—and the fact that their rights are continually
                under siege (86)? Provided your students have already read Blake, and Burke, my
                epigraph is a strong starting point because it propounds a view of nature that is
                blurry at best. Without an outline, “nature” exists in a state of
                <emph>a priori</emph> indeterminacy, awaiting the
                ordering instincts of the human. Any classroom discussion of a queer ecological
                perspective—its origins, its outlines, its objectives in the ecocidal and homophobic
                world we inhabit in the Anthropocene—should start precisely there, with nature’s
                lack of a rigid outline because nature and sexuality, especially queer sexuality and
                identity, have a certain open-endedness in common. The “Q” in LGBTQ politics (and
                studies) has, for now, put a provisional period after the four-part acronym that
                precedes it, but who really knows where it will find its terminus? The etymology of
                “queer,” after all, can be traced to the word “<emph>-twerkw</emph>,” or
                “across,” in its Indo-European root, so, in terms of queerness (where it starts and
                where it stops), it’s unrestricted. BLTGQ—it’s amusing to rearrange the letters as
                one might turn a Rubik’s Cube—slips out of our hands every time, and like the old
                word “nature,” the new word “LGBTQ” (as a critical discourse <emph>and</emph> as 
                way of identifying oneself and others) is as intersectional as it is infinite.</p>
                  <p>Whenever I encounter a wiggly word like “nature,” one that wears a thick patina of
                    <emph>strange familiarity</emph>, I ask students to assist me in
                better breaking down that word and its various meanings for the Romantics and their
                predecessors. You might invite your students to list, or even cluster-diagram, its
                multiple meanings or ask whether a univocal “nature” is even necessary. In 2006,
                Scott Hess began his invaluable handbook for teaching Romanticism vis-à-vis ecology
                in <title level="j">Romantic Circles</title> with Raymond Williams’ definition of
                nature as an entry point though his purview was confined to Clare and to the
                Wordsworths. A lot has changed in 11 years, and living in the new geological epoch
                known as the Anthropocene (coined, in 2000, by the atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen)
                means that the human impact on the earth is already a deep and damaging one. The
                environmental and evolutionary impacts of mass extinction are unknowable. As a newsy
                neologism, “Anthropocene” has belatedly gone mainstream, appearing in
                <title level="j">The New York Times Magazine</title> in February of 2017 under the 
                bold-print heading, “Only Human,” and in the <title level="j">London Review 
                    of Books</title> the term was described as having a “luscious
                mouth-feel” and as seeming “just the thing to bring new urgency and direction to all
                the tired old arguments about climate change, resource depletion, the future of the
                planet” (Turner 23). Tired? Old? Never has the future of Planet Earth been treated
                so dismissively. It’s useful, then, to present your class with other instances of
                the Anthropocene in the headlines. Citing what he calls the “ephemera” of the daily
                news—permafrost melting, the Exxon Mobil chairman appointed as Secretary of State,
                America’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord—Wesley Yang, in the <title level="j">Times</title>, writes: “Our inability to connect the day’s ephemera
                with the geological time scale has summoned a striking neologism,” namely “the
                Anthropocene, or the ‘Age of Man’” (9).</p>
                  <p>Ecological approaches to Romantic-age literature have never been more urgent, but how
                do you teach the Age of Man and its congruence with the Age of the Straight Man in
                relation to English Romantic literature, or, put another way, how do you teach queer
                ecological practices in the classroom when time is running out? Presenting your
                students with the aforesaid articles, culled from the popular press, can potentially
                open a dialogue about living in and, more importantly, <emph>surviving</emph> the 
                Anthropocene. One more way into this pressing question can be found in
                <title level="m">Half-Earth: Our Planet’s Fight for Life</title> (2016)
                by Edward O. Wilson in which he postulates the following thought experiment:<quote>
                    Suppose that in the far-distant future geologists were to dig through Earth’s 
                    crusted deposits to the strata spanning the past thousand years of our time. 
                    There they would encounter sharply defined layers of chemically altered soil. 
                    They would recognize the physical and chemical signatures of rapid climate 
                    changes. They would uncover abundant fossil remains of domesticated plants and 
                    animals that had replaced, suddenly and globally, most of Earth’s prehuman 
                    fauna and flora. They would excavate fragments of machines, and a veritable 
                    museum of deadly weapons. (9)</quote>
                This is a probing passage, not the least because it stridently asserts that the earth
                is not ours and that <foreign xml:lang="la">Homo sapiens</foreign> is a
                guest here with an unknown check-out time. Is it already too late to employ
                questions of the environment, and its potential end, to the critical learning
                environment that is the college classroom? An article by Ron Wagler in
                <title level="m">The American Biology Teacher</title> appears to
                have beaten us “nonscience” humanities folks to the punch; Wagler explains the major
                effects of diminishing global biodiversity, including habitat destruction,
                pollution, and climate change, but reminds us that education, while not exactly the
                silver bullet, is an important start. He claims: “one component of possibly reducing
                the rising anthropogenic affects [<emph>sic</emph>] associated with the
                current Anthropocene mass extinction is education” (80). To that end, one way to
                connect the Epoch of Man with the Epoch of the Straight Man is to ask students to
                “dig through” the deposits leading to the sedimentation of heterosexuality as
                “natural.” How, for example, does Foucault imply a depth model when he famously
                claims that the homosexual was invented in fin-de-siècle Anglo-American culture? Ken
                Bain, in <title level="m">What the Best College Teachers Do</title>, contends that
                queries like “What’s the next question?” and “What can we ask now?” propel any
                discussion forward (103). The next questions, in this context, seem to be: <emph>How 
                    can we queer the Anthropocene? How does the threat of mass
                    extinction assume that humanity is uniformly reproductive and leave out the role
                    of LGBTQ people in preserving a natural world that they have not necessarily
                    replenished with new life-forms but are no less dedicated to preserving?</emph> 
                The readiness of Romanticism is all; woven into the poetical works of Keats,
                discussed below, is the embeddedness of erotic life in our natural world. How does
                the interconnectedness (a hallmark of ecological science) of straight and queer
                life-forms affect our conceptions of a monolithic “Man” that may or may not be
                reaching its finitude? With the advent of more socially liberal-minded approaches to
                human health and sexuality, we are beginning to see the permeability of the borders
                between different sexual orientations and practices.</p>
                  <p>Before answering that crucial question and providing what I have found to be a few
                successful approaches, I want to return one more time to the lexical locale where
                Hess began back in 2006—that is, with Raymond Williams’s 1976 outline of nature’s
                various meanings, which has endured for good reason. Calling nature “perhaps the
                most complex word in the language,” Williams added the following on the word’s
                etymology: “The relevant L[atin] phrase for the developed meanings is <foreign xml:lang="la">natura rerum</foreign>—the nature of things, which already in some
                L[atin] uses was shortened to <foreign xml:lang="la">natura</foreign>—the constitution 
                of the world” (219). Its first two meanings can denote (1) an external nonhuman entity
                (e.g. “wild nature” or “nature-lover”) but also (2) a directional force with agentic
                power, as in “Let nature run its course,” a “law of nature,” or, closer to home, the
                Wordsworthian injunction, “Let Nature be your teacher” (whereby the poet operates as
                a substitute teacher). Students will more readily recall the caveat of Dr. Ian
                Malcom in Spielberg’s <title level="m">Jurassic Park</title> (1993) who challenges 
                the park’s creator by refuting the idea that bringing condors back from the brink of
                extinction is different than resurrecting the thoroughly extinct Tyrannosaurus rex:
                “Dinosaurs had their shot and nature selected them for extinction . . . what you
                call discovery, I call the rape of the natural world.” Unlike the T-Rex, <foreign xml:lang="la">Homo sapiens</foreign> may become the only species in history who
                consciously willed its own extinction.</p>
                  <p>A third but by no means final meaning of “nature” refers to someone or something’s
                    essence.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Often the meanings of “nature” are 
                        interassimilated in themselves. A clear proof of this lies in the queerest 
                        of Shakespeare’s sonnets, Sonnet 20, which begins “A woman’s face, with 
                        Nature’s own hand painted, / Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion” 
                        (1–2). Here nature possesses the agency of a painter, but the line’s meaning 
                        is also blurry, for it’s this pretty face’s lack of cosmetic that makes it 
                        “naturally” beautiful.</note> A clear proof of this can be
                found in the spirited debate between Anne Elliot and Captain Harville over the
                “nature” of a man’s affection (versus a woman’s) in Jane Austen’s <title level="m">Persuasion</title> (1817); Harville asserts that “if the change be not from
                outward circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature, man’s nature,” to
                which Elliot replies: “No, no, it is not man’s nature” (242). But those are only its
                pedestrian and depoliticized usages; once the binarism of “natural” versus
                “unnatural” makes its discursive entry, “nature” becomes a polarizing term.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For Romantic-era judgment premised on the binarism of natural 
                    versus unnatural, see Austen’s <title level="m">Persuasion</title> and her subtle
                            abjuration of her heroine Anne Elliot’s development: “She had been
                            forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew
                            older—the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning” (69).</note> Surely 
                we can all agree that Wordsworth died of <emph>natural</emph> causes at the ripe old 
                age of 80, while the same cannot be said about Austen (aged 41), Wollstonecraft (38), 
                Shelley (29), or Polidori and Keats (both 25). Within a few weeks of teaching Romanticism, 
                you should have enough references to “nature” to point out these multifarious meanings 
                to spur a spirited discussion. Even thornier is the painfully reductive and false dilemma
                known as “nature versus nurture,” as it relates to sexuality, which, more than a
                century ago, Freud claimed was not complex enough to “cover all the issues” involved
                in sexual matters, especially the cause of “inversion” and all “its varieties” of
                sexual behavior (6–7). More recently Timothy Morton has observed that disability
                studies and queer theory have a vested interest in contesting the “idea of natural
                and unnatural altogether” (700).</p>
                  <p>What are the benefits of a queer ecological standpoint in the Age of Man, and how, as
                a discussion leader, can you ascertain how the Romantics wade into this double
                threat to political justice and futurity? First, queer ecology rejects any
                conception of a transcendental and ahistorical nature and insists we fully feel the
                earth and our proximity to other living things. Following Morton, Christopher
                Schmidt (2012) comments that by dispensing with the nature/culture division, which
                only facilitates the othering of nature as “over there” and thereby easier to
                exploit, “queer nature is thus one possible avenue for looking at . . .
                environmental problems differently” and for rejecting the fantasy of a “transcendent
                nature” (73–74). Queer ecology forces teachers and students alike to confront the
                queerness within; nonbinary identities and practices are, after all, only natural.
                Consider the fact that, in 2017, a female zebra shark in an Australian aquarium gave
                birth three years after she had last seen her sexual mate. Biologists say this is
                evidence of a vertebrate swapping its sexuality from sexual to asexual reproduction
                (known as parthenogenesis) due to captivity. The shark, whose name is Leonie, lived
                with its partner for six years but only after it was moved to a separate tank did it
                lay eggs. This unusual fact prompted one reporter to query: “Are the guys really
                obsolete” (Cummins)? Such a question cannot be answered here but it does support
                what Morton, the unofficial father of queer ecology, wrote in the
                <title level="j">PMLA</title> in 2010 when he first outlined the
                concept of queer ecology: “Biodiversity and gender diversity are deeply intertwined
                . . . cells reproduce asexually, like their single-celled ancestors and the
                blastocyst attached to the uterus wall at the start of pregnancy” (276). If you wish
                to teach queer ecology, Morton’s inaugural essay is another useful starting point,
                and in Morton’s wide-ranging style, it includes Carolyn Merchant’s
                <title level="m">The Death of Nature</title> and Jon Krakauer’s
                    <title level="m">Into the Wild</title>. So, too, is Stacy
                Alaimo’s <title level="a">Eluding Capture: The Science, Culture, and Pleasure of 
                    ‘Queer Animals,’</title> which considers the infamous kink of bonobos, the 
                all-male families of the flightless bird known as the Greater Rhea, the more than 
                28,000 sexes of mushrooms, and identifies what Alaimo calls the “queer, green, place, 
                in which pleasure, desire, and the proliferation of differing lifeworlds provoke intense, 
                ethical, reactions” (67). I will try to deploy the Mortonesque style here as well, 
                which, at the risk of seeming scattershot, casts the critical net wide in the hopes of
                providing my colleagues with a myriad of texts with which they can cultivate their
                own pedagogic gardens.</p>
                  <p>In the meantime, I promise not to wander but to patiently stay in one place, and to
                focus on the practice of tiptoeing in Keats’s poetical works with the aim of
                revealing the queerly ecological implications of treading lightly across the earth.
                Whoever or <emph>whatever</emph> she is, Keats’s
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">femme fatale</foreign> Lamia is a tiptoer: “She
                rose / Tiptoe with white arms spread” (l.287). Rose-like, Lamia opens her arms and
                embraces an earth of which she is and is <emph>not</emph> a natural part.
                Regardless, her human lover Lycius sees Lamia’s ability to tiptoe, arms spread, as
                an “amorous promise” and, in what follows, the act of tiptoeing as an affective
                embrace, of nature and of queerness, will become increasingly clear (287–90).
                Centering on one lyric in particular, “I stood tip-toe upon a little hill” (1816), I
                will demonstrate how Keatsian tiptoeing can direct a classroom discussion about
                nature, nonnormative sexuality, and what their important overlap means to teaching
                Romanticism in the Anthropocene. The act of tiptoeing in the works of Keats is a
                green <emph>and</emph> pink practice insofar as it effaces man’s footsteps altogether. 
                Both “footstep” and “animal track” are derived from the Latin <foreign xml:lang="la">vestigium</foreign> (from which we derive “vestige”). In
                what follows, I will outline not nature, which invariably wiggles out of a very
                human effort to objectify it as a “thing”—pinned and wriggling on the wall, in the
                parlance of T. S. Eliot—but will instead outline the ways in which queer ecology can
                be articulated in the classroom.</p>

                  <p>Biographical approaches to the Romantic poets never fails to hold students’
                attention, and the fact that Keats’s letters both clarify <emph>and</emph> obfuscate 
                his poetical works is scarcely in doubt. A mixture of Keats’s letters and a few clips 
                of your choosing from Jane Campion’s 2009 biopic, <title level="m">Bright Star</title>, 
                help to bring the author to life. From a queer point of view, his letter to his younger 
                brother George and sister-in-law Georgiana, written in the fall of 1819, is a jaw-dropper. 
                Presented to students as a window into Keats’s conceptions of gender, his letter is 
                not as intensely gynophobic as his anxious outpouring to Benjamin Bailey (penned the
                previous summer) in which he decries the great gulf between the sexual fantasies he
                had as a schoolboy and the “reality” of being in a “Lady’s Company” as a grown man
                (264). This is the letter (frequently anthologized) wherein Keats confesses that,
                amongst men, he harbors “no evil thoughts, no malice, no spleen,” whereas, in the
                company of women, he feels those very emotions and is in a “hurry to be gone” (265).
                Keats was at his most prodigious during the summer of 1818 when, in a long line of
                close male friendships, his friendship with John Hamilton Reynolds was as close as
                could be, and the poets walked on Hampstead Heath and recited poetry to each other.
                Prompted by his brother’s recent marriage and impending emigration to America, Keats
                shows enough self-awareness in his letter to Bailey that he apologizes for giving
                voice to such “perversity” (265). By no means gone for good, such perverse feelings
                resurfaced in the fall of 1819 when he addressed George directly in letter form and
                again praised the positive effects of living in homosocial confines wherein men can
                “interassimulate” with each other (265). Here Keats confesses to feeling lonely and
                “altered” due to his brother’s absence and credits the act of letter writing as a
                way of assuaging that pain:<quote>
                    This is the reason why men who had been bosom friends, on being separate for any 
                    number of years, afterwards meet coldly, neither of them knowing why—The fact is 
                    they are both altered—Men who live together have a silent moulding and influencing 
                    power over each other—They interassimulate. ‘T is an uneasy thought. (369)</quote>
                Keats’s conception of masculine interassimilation is a radical development of
                Wordsworth’s word choice in <title level="a">Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern
                Abbey</title>—“interfused” (l.97)—and with a cheeky pun on intercourse <foreign xml:lang="la">per anum</foreign>—it’s self-consciously queer in its embrace of 
                same-sex domesticity and the “moulding” influence, or persuasiveness, men exert over 
                each other when they cohabitate. As for their not “knowing why,” there is a clear
                self-deception at work, resulting in the coldness Keats attributes to masculine
                friendships. In <title level="m">The Keats Brothers</title>, biographer Denise Gigante
                comments that, in the context of the sonnet <title level="a">To My Brother 
                    George,</title> John’s writings for George register the “deep need for human 
                connection that the fraternal bond fulfilled,” and that whenever George was far from 
                John, the poet “discovered thoughts and feelings inside himself that he might not 
                otherwise have known” (14). Rachel Schulkins, in <title level="m">Keats, Modesty and 
                    Masturbation</title>, goes further by identifying the poet’s “outbursts against 
                the opposite sex” as proof not just of his “conflicted feelings towards women” but 
                of his “misogynistic tendencies” (9). Perhaps this accounts for why his admission that 
                he prefers the company of men over that of women to George ends in the very same way 
                his outpouring to Bailey does, that is, with anxiety (i.e., “uneasy thought” and 
                disappointment in himself as a man). Albeit essentializing, I sometimes ask my 
                classes: <emph>Women in the room, how does this text make you uneasy? And, for the men, 
                    what strikes you as out of the ordinary here, and why?</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have had success in the classroom by using three poems, of increasing length, by
                Keats to demonstrate his queer kind of interassimilating with other humans and with
                nature. The first is his sonnet <title level="a">On the Grasshopper and Cricket</title> 
                (1816), which is hardly queer, unless you admit the presence of animal jouissance in 
                the insatiate grasshopper—“never done / With his delights” (l.6–7)—though it is ecologically
                minded inasmuch as it depicts a zombified earth that is “never dead” (1). What the
                Shelleyist William A. Ulmer once identified as the “hydrogen cycle” at work in <title level="m">Adonais</title> (1821) can also be located in Keats’s first quatrain:
                to avoid a “hot sun,” birds hide in “cooling trees,” which implies a leafy sort of
                shade but the potential aftereffects of rain, now a mist (216). Either way, the
                birds are, in the parlance of <title level="a">To Autumn,</title> the “close bosom-friend[s] 
                    of the maturing sun” (l.2), and the union of the eponymous season with the sun, as 
                    Helen Vendler has recently noted, is a procreative one, since it “makes her bear fruit”
                (259). The bosom-friends in this earlier sonnet are the eponymous insect organisms
                and, implicitly, the poet himself who translates their unintelligible voices into a
                single discrete poetic form: the sonnet. The “new-mown mead,” wherein the poem takes
                place, features a variety of vegetation (trees, hedges, weeds, and grass upon the
                hillside) and the salient seasonality at work in the poem (moving from “summer
                luxury” to “winter evening”) reinforces the living cycle and Keats’s idea of the
                sonneteer as nature’s spokesman (4–10). Working in a self-interested mode, then, the
                poem serves two masters: nature <emph>and</emph> an Elysium (or paradisiacal afterlife) 
                    reserved for England’s finest poets, that “abode,” as Shelley calls it in the final 
                    line of <title level="m">Adonais</title>, “where the Eternal are” (l.495). In short, 
                    poets are a force for environmental good. Thus the poet cherishes the earth as 
                    a living community in the ecological sense,
                that is, not merely as a gathering of organisms in one place but as the adaptations
                that diverse species make for each other and for themselves. John Curtis conceived,
                for example, of any plant community as a “web of species connected by rubber bands”
                because “if you move the status of one species, it changes the tension of all the
                other species” (qtd. in Allen and Hoekstra 156–57).</p>
                  <p>The second of the poems applicable to a queer ecological paradigm is <title level="a">I Stood Tip-Toe</title> (completed at the end of 1816 as a precursor to <title level="m">Endymion</title>, which was the title Keats originally assigned to it but later
                abandoned). Here Keats resists stratification and represents <foreign xml:lang="la">Homo
                    sapiens</foreign> and nonhuman Nature as inextricably interassimilated. Brimming with
                bugs (bees and moths), birds (ring-doves and goldfinches), and flower buds (laburnum
                and marigolds), <title level="a">I Stood Tip-Toe</title> includes detailed descriptions 
                of nature’s processes, or what Keats calls “Nature’s gentle doings” (l.63). Building on 
                Alan Bewell’s reading of flowers at the poem’s opening as surrogate women—replete with
                sensuous curves and diadems—Schulkins has called <title level="a">I Stood Tip-Toe</title> 
                a “celebration of nature’s eroticism and its symbiotic relationship, where each natural 
                object benefits from its association with another” (45). The mutually beneficial effects of
                those associations are integral to Keatsian interassimilation though he uses the
                word “interchange” in line 85 to mean essentially the same thing but with a queerish
                twist: nature is imbued with anthropoid feeling, as in “the ripples seem glad right
                glad to reach those cresses, / And cool themselves among the em’rald tresses” (81–82). 
                What Keats calls “variety” (l.16), ecologists now call <emph>biodiversity</emph>, 
                and in keeping with the poems outlined here, human eroticism is naturalized as part 
                of a wider erotic force at work in the biosphere. This is
                especially salient in <title level="m">Endymion</title>, a discussion of which will
                end this essay and highlight the queerest and most ecologically alert components of
                Keats’s oeuvre.</p>
                  <p>Keats’s use of the first-person pronoun to commence his poem—“I stood tip-toe upon a
                little hill”—effectively establishes the sovereignty of the outward eye throughout
                the poem (l.1). The human eye is the organ that reigns supreme, which Keats
                reinforces with scopophilic lines such as “I gazed awhile” and “many pleasures to my
                vision started” (23–26), and through the imperative: “But turn your eye” (80).
                Still, if the primary sensory organ that makes <title level="a">On the 
                    Grasshopper</title> cohere is the human ear, <title level="a">I Stood 
                        Tip-Toe</title> is organized around the theme of vision and seeing
                nature not as a lazy onlooker but—to borrow from Seamus Heaney—as an “artful voyeur”
                (113). “Linger awhile,” writes Keats, “And watch intently Nature’s gentle doings”
                (l.61–63). Tiptoeing also establishes the human observer’s elevation over the
                landscape, which is, after all, artificial. Standing on “tippy-toes” is a way,
                evidenced by the aforementioned line from <title level="m">Lamia</title>, to rise,
                stretch, and elongate the body. The physicality of standing tippy-toes is erotically
                charged: in <title level="m">Romeo and Juliet</title>, a frisky Romeo entices his
                beloved with the line: “Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day / Stands
                tiptoe on the misty mountain tops” (III.iv.9–10).</p>
                  <p>Assuming the poem’s speaker is Keats himself, why is the act of tiptoeing
                significant? Famously diminutive in stature, the author may have stood on tiptoe to
                either appear taller or to see further. Hunt reported that the poem was inspired by
                a summer afternoon in which Keats stood by a gate that ran from Battery Hill on
                Hampstead Heath into the ancient woodland known as Caen Wood; whether Keats was
                tiptoeing at the time is unknown but he did craft a poem in which the human observer
                derives “pleasure” from this unique way of standing and seeing. Tiptoeing has three
                additional meanings, however: first, to tiptoe is to stand tall with pride, as in
                Henry V’s Saint Crispin’s Day speech—“He that outlives this day, and comes safe
                home, / Will stand a’ tiptoe when this day is named” (IV.iii.41–2). Second,
                tiptoeing can signify a form of avoidance, as in the idiomatic “walking on
                eggshells.” Lastly, tiptoeing is synonymous with pussyfooting, that is, to tread
                lightly or stealthily. For instance, in Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb
                    Williams</title>, a villainous character named Grimes “advanced on tiptoe with 
                his finger to his lip” (66).</p>
                  <p>In the second part of the opening couplet, one can hear an echo of “the cooling
                trees” in <title level="a">On the Grasshopper,</title> as in “the air was cooling,” 
                which renders the speaker’s entire body, skin and all, as one giant receiver of nature’s 
                doings (2). It also continues to operationalize the hydrogen cycle insofar as morning 
                dew is personified as the “early sobbing of the morn” (7). It’s worth pointing out the 
                way in which Keats’s analogies collapse different ecotypes: buds are like women, dew is
                like a teardrop, and clouds are “white as flocks new shorn” (8). This blurring of
                natural objects seems to be the point, especially after, as in his sonnet on the
                grasshopper, he ingrains the poet into the landscape. The poem’s second half (lines
                107–242) goes further: “Here are sweet peas, on tip-toe for a flight / With wings of
                gentle flush o’er delicate white, / And taper fingers catching at all things, / To
                bind them all about with tiny rings” (57–60). The anthropomorphizing cuts both ways,
                for a tiptoeing nature-lover is like a sweet pea just as a sweet pea has “fingers”
                like a human. This is a touchy-feeling ecology, a haptic approach to embracing the
                earth.</p>
                  <p>The second half of <title level="a">I Stood Tip-Toe</title> bears out the well-known 
                lines, spoken by Duke Senior in <title level="m">As You Like It</title>, to “find 
                tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, / Sermons in stones” (II.1.16–17). Yet 
                the logic of <title level="a">I Stood Tip-Toe</title> and <title level="m">Endymion</title> is that only the
                poet possesses the power to divine such natural piety. What binds these two poems
                together, according to John Barnard, is that only male poetic genius has the power
                to render the “truths contained in the natural world” apprehensible to readers and
                to lead the way (53–54). Keats’s queerly ecological mode of leading the way is on
                tiptoes. Less explicit, however, is an intertext like Shelley’s <title level="a">On 
                    Love</title> in which
                he claims that, in the absence of other humans, we “love the flowers, the grass and
                the waters and sky” (505). In his portrayal of the nature-lover as compensating for
                the lack of interpersonal sympathy, he adds: “There is eloquence in the tongueless
                wind and a melody in the flowing of brooks and the rustling of reeds” (504). One
                strange implication of Shelley’s formulation is that in order for the wind to be
                “tongueless,” the wind had to be tongued at some point. In <title level="m">Endymion</title>, the flower bed is a trope to which the author returns
                repeatedly. Flower beds are queerly ecological spaces since they are sites of
                friskiness al fresco. The conclusion to <title level="a">I Stood Tip-Toe</title> is, 
                as many commentators have pointed out, no conclusion at all.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In addition to Wolfson, there is Andrew Motion who, in his 
                    biography of Keats, remarks that that the poem “ends in radical inconclusiveness, 
                    drawing attention to the gulf between its hopes and its achievements”; see
                    <title level="m">Keats</title> (U of Chicago P, 1997), 136.</note> On its 
                open-endedness, Susan J. Wolfson has recently commented that the poem’s abrupt ending 
                is evidence of Keats’s ironizing the “Latin ghost of error in the spirit of wandering” 
                (610). Tiptoeing could be the queerest form of ambulation; it’s certainly an affected 
                kind of movement. Animals tread lightly when approaching prey but no animal stands 
                on its tiptoes. Our only hope is that human beings, seeing the impact of their 
                footprints, change their ways and fast.</p>
                  <p>The last and longest poem, <title level="m">Endymion</title> follows the basic pattern
                at work in <title level="a">I Stood Tip-Toe</title> except that it contains an even 
                more sweeping claim on the interactivity of human and nonhuman desire. Christopher 
                Ricks once zeroed in on the maiden’s blush in lines 99–100 of that earlier poem—as in, 
                “How she would start, and blush . . . Playing in all her innocence of thought”—to claim 
                that a perpetually embarrassed “Keats knows too the blush of innocence” (57). <title level="m">Endymion</title> is noteworthy, by contrast, for
                its shamelessness, and by extension, its blushlessness, as proof that Keats—if we
                must make psycho-biographical claims—was not that innocent. I recommend assigning
                only sections of the first long poem, which stretches more than four books and over
                4,000 lines, dramatically expanding upon the Endymion-Diana myth only touched upon
                in <title level="a">I Stood Tip-Toe.</title> Students will likely <emph>not</emph> 
                know the mythological antecedents to <title level="m">Endymion</title>, so it is worth 
                informing them ahead of time that the poem is a giant allegory for the union of ideal 
                Beauty (incarnated by Cynthia, the lunar goddess) that Endymion, whom Bate once described 
                as a composite character for the “human soul, the poet, or the poetic imagination,” is 
                searching for and desiring throughout the poem’s four books (172). Diana, another moon 
                goddess and virgin, visited Mt. Latmos (in modern-day Turkey) to gaze upon Endymion, a
                shepherd of Caria, as he slept eternally. If you are a professor inclined to
                humorous asides, it might be worth mentioning that Endymion (as a manifestation of
                the “human soul”) is virtually sexless, and that the sobriquet applied by Wolfson to
                Adonis in the poem’s third book is “boy-toy,” as in the “boy-toy Adonis” visited by
                “accidental tourist Endymion” in <title level="m">Reading Keats</title> (43). I show 
                students a painting roughly contemporary with Keats’s poem, Anne-Louis Girodet’s <title level="m">Sleep of Endymion</title>, which the artist painted in 1791 in Rome
                and debuted in Paris two years later. The image is expertly discussed by Whitney
                Davis in his <title level="m">Queer Beauty</title> as a pictorial
                synecdoche for what he calls the “endless and timeless if unconscious sensual-sexual
                responsiveness of the desirable male body” (35).</p>
                  <p>Instructively, a group can explore these themes by considering the question of 
                Endymion’s sexual identity. Abigail Solomon-Godeau’s essay, provocatively entitled <title level="a">Is Endymion Gay?: Historical Interpretation and Sexual Identities,</title> 
                contends that Girodet’s <title level="m">Endymion</title> played an important part 
                in “constructing a queer art history” (84). Here, you can press
                your students to explain the visual markers of such desirability and to connect the
                glaring sensuality of Girodet’s <foreign xml:lang="fr">beau idéal</foreign> with Keats’s
                Endymion. Girodet’s male is not only “light in the loafers,” toes exposed, but his
                body blends with the branches above, and through a landscape that presents itself to
                him through his right armpit. The oval shapes and lack of jarring rectilinear lines
                in Girodet’s canvas help to ingrain another boy-toy, made vulnerable through his
                somnolent and naked state, on Mt. Latmos. The shading technique, or <foreign xml:lang="it">sfumato</foreign>, softens and sensualizes all the edges of his body,
                which is bathed in a divine light. This figure of ideal male beauty is, in the
                parlance of Keats, interassimilated with his environs, or, as Keats writes in Books
                I and III of <title level="m">Endymion</title>, “interknit” (l.811 and l.380).</p>
                  <p>Keats’s <title level="m">Endymion</title> can be a challenging
                text to discuss, but when discussed vis-à-vis Morton’s conception of the mesh, it
                reaps rich rewards. I ask students to visualize the kind of biotic interconnections
                that ecology has made its major focus and to select the best term to describe the
                nonhierarchical relations across species, across organisms, and across the division
                between the organic and inorganic. Then I encourage learners to ponder some of the
                preferred analogies used by ecologists and ecocritics alike (e.g., the web, the
                network, the mesh, the tree of life) and to consider Morton’s proposal that
                “life-forms constitute a <emph>mesh</emph>, a nontotalizable, open-ended
                concatenation of interrelations that blur and confound boundaries at practically any
                level” (275). Morton (2011) reiterates this claim that the “mesh” is best suited to
                register ecological interconnectedness, less “vitalist” and “Internet-ish” than
                “web” or “network” and no less Darwinian (24). “This is what most of us mean when we
                think ecologically,” he writes, “that everything is connected to everything else”
                (26). Students come to class prepared to point out at least five interconnections
                found in Keats’s long poem. To access this kind of deep interdependency, I recommend
                a radical abridgment of Keats’s pastoral and a close reading, in class, of the first
                book’s best-known passage—the so-called “Pleasure Thermometer” passage (769–857)
                that begins with the melodious bird (the nightingale) that Keats would transform,
                via his eponymous ode, into a literary icon (rivaled only by Poe’s raven and, in
                third place, Shelley’s skylark):<quote>

                     </quote>
            Keats felt most at home, rhetorically, in the interrogative mode; hence, the question
                presented above is how humans can understand their desires apart from their
                environment and the other species that inhabit a single ecosystem. Because “men”
                cannot, Keats sensualizes <emph>all</emph> of nature,
                human and nonhuman, and singles out tiptoeing as an action best aligned with
                maintaining a harmony between “men” and “the earth” humanity calls home. Moreover,
                this passage appears later in the gradations that Keats describes as steps on a
                Platonic ladder leading from man’s sensuous engagement with natural and aesthetic
                objects toward “love and friendship,” described as the “chief intensity” and “crown”
                in lines 800–801. Rapt in the worship of nature, the speaker here continues his
                fetishization of flowers and the diverse dependencies between the operations of the
                natural world and human desire. The two are “interknit” (812) but they just as well
                might be described as “interassimilated,” since the latter adjective is the more
                homoerotically charged of the two. The thermometer depicted in this passage is a
                teleological model, as is often commented upon, bound for the purity of
                disinterested love, but no commentator has asked how exactly one gets their foothold
                in this ladder. Yet the lightness associated with the act of tiptoeing appears to
                be, for Keats, how man must proceed as he makes his way to what he calls “earthly
                love” (843). Be sure to remind your class that two centuries after Keats began to
                compose <title level="m">Endymion</title> in April of 1817, the coming years are
                shaping up to be the hottest years on record. Goodbye El Niño, hello record-breaking 
                heat and the very extremes of the spectrum: floods <emph>and</emph> drought, warming
                pleasure-domes <emph>and</emph> calving caves of ice. Due to anthropogenic climate 
                change, the thermometer is rising rapidly and in
                Keats’s pairing of atmospheric pressure and pleasure, his poetry remains not only
                environmentally relevant but crucial and queer in the Age of Man.</p>
                  <p>Following Darwin’s explanation of natural selection as a branching tree that lacks
                both a definite starting point and an endpoint, Morton asserts that the mesh is the
                best ecological term for infinite interdependencies and what he calls the “intimate
                entanglement of all life-forms that the life sciences discover on many levels, from
                evolution to symbiosis” (29). Intimacy is an interesting theme to foreground in your
                explication of <title level="m">Endymion</title> because it
                manifests itself in surprisingly interspecies ways. Keats actually uses the word
                himself, in <title level="m">Lamia</title>, when Lamia kisses Lycius and makes him
                feel “tangled in her mesh” (l.295), and in a similar fashion, desire flows in
                alarmingly cross-species ways in <title level="m">Endymion</title> as well. Karen
                Swann has commented that “Eros in this poem is interspecies romance: romance across
                the bar that divides mortal from immortal . . . human organisms from the figures of
                the poetic medium” (29). Puzzling phrases like “men-slugs” and “human serpentry”
                (l.821), themselves harbingers of the chameleon poet, manifest such
                interassimilations, queer to the extent that identity traverses species and absorbs
                the other.</p>
                  <p>Students and I explore these lines by connecting Keats’s conception of “earthly
                love” with Godwin’s <title level="m">Mandeville</title> (1817)
                because it contains a passage that is nearly identical in terms of projecting
                (masculine) desire onto nature. Nevertheless, photocopying a few pages from
                <title level="m">Mandeville</title> will illustrate that Keats was not the only 
                author in the 1810s who wished to sensualize man’s fusion with the
                natural world, nor was he the only nature-lover that saw man as “neighbor” and
                “portion,” and more radically, as an organism that loves to “frisk” alongside
                flowers, fruit, fawns, and fish. The speaker in this passage from <title level="m">Mandeville</title> is Henrietta, the narrator’s sister, whom 
                Mandeville sits beside under some “venerable elms” that shade the side 
                of a stream:<quote>

                        that Godwin inscribes upon nature and the
                brotherly love he locates there. If, as queer criticism posits, desire exceeds the
                social construct that is identity, queer ecology rubs our faces in the
                constructedness of the very things we not only take for granted but hold to be
                self-evident: human desire and a nonhuman nature.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In David M. Halperin’s <title level="m">How To Be Gay</title>,

                is especially useful in an eco-queer context first
                because it’s a pagan love poem that depicts humans and the natural world as
                “interknit” and forming an ecological whole (III.l.380), and second, because it
                explores the power of love in explicitly erotic ways that occasion states of
                nonsovereignty, or nonpower. It dispenses with the monotheistic presumptions evident
                in Godwin’s novel because, in Keats, there is no single “lord of the creation” since
                there is no power imbalance or anthropocentric hierarchy. Thus queerness grows
                sideways, like a vine or invasive weed, and dismantles the top-down model of
                subjectivity.</p>
                  <p>In teaching queer ecology relative to the Anthropocene, I have discovered that
                Keats’s poetry is particularly well-suited to opening a dialogue about the aforesaid
                topics because of nature’s central role in the Romantic imaginary. Asking students
                to scan a poem for its references to trees, animals, and other living things should
                always be followed by a more challenging and “deeper” query:
                <emph>But what symbolic role do such living things play in this poem? Yes, they are 
                    things, biomass, but what do they signify?</emph> Following
                Crutzen, Timothy Clark has written cogently about how humans will survive in a
                geological epoch marked by man’s heavy-footed impact on planet earth. “To live in
                the Anthropocene seems to present a host of new and largely unprecedented questions
                and dilemmas for human self-conception,” writes Clark, “for ethics, philosophy,
                economics and politics” (285). Poetry and pedagogy are just two of the glaring
                omissions here. Poetry presents us with life-saving ways of making amorous promises
                to the earth. Since the Anthropocene is the geological epoch marked by man’s
                footprint, we ought to follow in the footsteps of Keats and other ecologically alert
                poets of the earth by tiptoeing through the flowers and beyond, through our
                biosphere. In order to survive, we better watch our step.</p>

                    instructors can use to investigate the role of the Romantic subject or the lyric
                    “I” in this latest phase of geological time, the Anthropocene. As a test case,
                    it focuses on the overlooked lyrical ballad, Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Written 
                        in Germany.</title> It explores terms for analyzing media 
                    and media adaptations in the classroom. It
                    investigates how media adaptations can lay bare the rhetoric of the first-person
                    perspective and the philosophical implications of the self’s relationship to
                    nature. Last, it situates the Romantic-era subject within a broader historical
                    and ecological context, and it considers the centered, first-person perspective
                    in relation to marginalized perspectives and the “view from nowhere.” The essay
                    concludes with the importance of allowing shifting perspectives to migrate
                    across multiple media.</p>

                  <p>In a discussion of Alan Weisman’s <title level="m">The World Without Us</title> 
                (2007), Dipesh Chakrabarty writes that historians now
                    find themselves in a paradoxical moment where the tools used for reflecting on
                    the past may no longer aid us in thinking about the future. If the end of human
                    existence, or something close to it, is a future on the horizon, it requires
                    that “we [historians] insert ourselves into a future ‘without us’ in order to
                    visualize it” (197–98). By “visualizing” it, Chakrabarty may refer to the graphs
                    and figures that historians use to spatialize events occurring over time. A
                    history of the formal visualization of history would likely begin in the
                    eighteenth century with Joseph Priestley (1733–1804), who was, according to
                    Rosenberg and Grafton, “the first to lay out systematic principles for the
                    translation of historical data into a visual medium” (116). Indeed, Priestley’s
                    maps of time, and others like it, were dramatically changing the image of humans
                    in history.</p>
                  <p>But visualizations of history may also refer to human
                    relations, if not in a world without us, then perhaps in a postapocalyptic world
                    where humans have been reduced to oral culture or no culture at all. In the
                    Anthropocene, a term coined by Paul J. Crutzen and Eugene F. Stoermer to
                    indicate the planetary stage from 1750 to the present, humans have become
                    geological agents, and with this agency it has become increasingly clear that
                    the relatively hospitable environment of the Holocene could be replaced by the
                    relatively inhospitable “desert of the real.” Indeed, <title level="m">The 
                        Matrix</title> (1999), from which the quote is taken, along with other 
                postapocalyptic films like Chris Marker’s <title level="m">La Jetée</title>
                (1962) and Christopher Nolan’s <title level="m">Interstellar</title> (2014), have 
                already provided images of human relations on the brink of total annihilation. Yet 
                the maturation of these more artistic visualizations and their rhetorical implications 
                can be traced back to the late eighteenth century and the postapocalyptic imagery of 
                Romanticism.</p>
                  <p>The historical narrative of our mediated relationship to the planet is more significant 
                today in the age of global warming. It is important because the various media through 
                which humans can know the conditions of the earth might ultimately determine our species’ 
                place on it. Yet a pernicious skepticism with respect to climate science (second only to 
                capitalist greed) continues to impede global measures towards curbing the human 
                destruction of a habitable planet. Can the origin of this current skepticism also be 
                located in the Romantic period? While Romanticism can be characterized by what Kevis 
                Goodman refers to as an emerging “medium consciousness,” which shared an almost parallel 
                rise with what James McKusick calls the “[invention] of ‘human ecology,’” the same period 
                also emphasizes local and subjective beliefs that render scientific data about the 
                earth’s conditions too “calculating” and “instrumentalist” to be of concern for serious 
                humanistic inquiry.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Goodman traces the emerging medium 
                    consciousness to the seventeenth century, with the convergence of media theory, the 
                    scientific revolution, and a renewed attention to Virgil’s <title level="m">Georgics</title> (18–20). For McKusick, he points to Wordsworth as “one 
                    of the first” to give rise to human ecology, “if by that phrase we mean the study of 
                    the complex relationships between human communities and their dwelling places” 
                    (70).</note> Of course, the antiscientific understanding of Romanticism is no longer 
                tenable, as has been made clear by numerous studies, like Noel Jackson’s <title level="m">Science and Sensation in Romantic Poetry</title> (2008) and Theresa 
                Kelley’s <title level="m">Clandestine Marriage: Botany and Romantic Culture</title> (2012), 
                among others. But it is worth asking exactly how the synthesizers of media consciousness 
                and ecology (i.e., Romantic-era authors) parsed out and hierarchized different genres of 
                media and why; how these media shaped the way that that they related to the planet and 
                thereby produced a particular brand of ecology; and how their conclusions can aid 
                visualizations of human relations in the forthcoming age, if they can at all. My aim in 
                the present essay is to outline an exercise for eliciting such an inquiry in the 
                classroom. In short, this essay asks: How can we use media adaptations to teach and 
                reinforce the history of our mediated relationship to the earth in the Anthropocene?</p>
                  <p>Numerous studies have recently drawn attention to media in the Romantic period, focusing 
                variously on the mediation of the past (Goodman), present human feelings (Chandler), 
                human relations at a distance (Favret), and the sheer excess of media and information 
                (Langan).<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Goodman’s <title level="m">Georgic 
                    Modernity and British Romanticism</title> (2004), James Chandler’s <title level="m">Archaeology of Sympathy</title> (2013), Mary Favret’s <title level="m">War at a Distance</title> (2010), and Celeste Langan’s <title level="a">Understanding Media in 1805: Audiovisual Hallucination in <title level="m">The Lay of the Last Minstrel</title>
                        </title> in <title level="j">Studies in Romanticism</title>, 40.1 (2001). In addition, 
                    a growing number of articles, collections, and monographs have emphasized the materiality 
                    of artworks and the discussions of media that take place within those texts more 
                    generally, including Miranda Burgess, Alexander Dick, and Michelle Levy’s special issue 
                    of <title level="j">European Romantic Review</title> (2011), Andrew Burkett’s <title level="m">Romantic Mediations: Media Theory and British Romanticism</title> (2016), 
                    as well as James Brooke-Smith and Andrew Burkett’s edited collection for <title level="j">Romantic Circles</title>, <title level="m">Multi-Media 
                            Romanticism</title> (2016).</note> Meanwhile, few studies have yet to address 
                the Romantic mediation of the planet as a thing with a particular history extending into 
                the present. Some might object to this warrant’s presentism, a position that has sparked 
                renewed debate.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In their introduction to a special collection 
                    for <title level="j">Victorian Studies</title>, David Coombs and Danielle Coriale make an 
                    appeal for a more “strategic presentism”: “To make presentism a strategy means asking how 
                    presentism might help us better understand and address the ways the past is at work in the 
                    exigencies of the present . . . from the economies of consciousness as a so-called global 
                    workspace to the anthropocene as an epoch whose hallmark, paradoxically, is the radical 
                    compression of the longue durée of geological change” (88). Strategic presentism is not a 
                    call to merely “act <emph>now</emph>.” It is a call to recognize that historical 
                    periods/events—including “the” present—cannot be viewed in a vacuum.</note> The problem is 
                that charges of presentism can be narrowly anthropocentric, and so it should be asked: 
                Presentism according to whom? From the perspective of the planet, the human geological 
                reengineering of its surface is a roughly 300-year-old problem “beginning” with the Industrial 
                Revolution (not counting the thousands of years it took to accumulate the necessary technical 
                know-how). If the present is a problem of perspective and metrics, and the Anthropocene has been 
                and will remain the geological period for some time, even after human existence, then our only 
                recourse to encountering this present is through a mediated—indeed, a very mediated—relationship.</p>
                  <p>But it is also productive to revisit Romantic-era writers in discussions of the Anthropocene 
                because they were thinking about the instability of their position on earth, as David Collings 
                and others have demonstrated.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For Collings, eighteenth-century 
                    discourse tended to align “divine intentionality” and “natural design,” while forgetting about 
                    the “transcendental excess” of the biblical deluge, whereas Romanticism turned its attention 
                    to the latter (351).</note> While poems tend to maintain a centered, subjective, personal 
                outlook, there are also moments when the species’ position on the planet is called into question. 
                Accordingly, the first-person perspective might become subordinated to other views; it may become 
                of equal value; or it may be represented as the one and only one in a “last man” scenario. 
                Regardless of the outcome, it is appropriate and timely to reinforce the emphasis on media in 
                Romantic-era texts by introducing an adaptation project that fleshes out our mediated 
                relationship to the planet. And adaptations are important because they encourage students to 
                think critically and creatively about changes to human relationships that adapt with changes to 
                the earth.</p>
                  <p>In what follows, I focus on a shorter exercise in which students adapt a lyric poem to a 
                hand-drawn illustration. Of course, other media might seem more obvious. Recently, Stephanie 
                Hershinow has written an instructive essay on selfies and Romantic-era novels in the classroom. 
                At bottom, Hershinow’s essay is a “defense of relatability.” No doubt, the ubiquity of the 
                digital image today helps students relate to the text. But it helps them relate to the text 
                according to today. The purpose of the illustrated adaptation may seem a bit backwards given 
                the emphasis on the current geological epoch. And yet, adapting the poem to an illustration 
                allows students to open a new point of access by transforming something unfamiliar into 
                something rudimentary (indeed, rude), the importance of which cannot be overstated. For if 
                humans are to survive in an age of recurring climate disasters, in barely habitable slums, 
                and with minimal access to resources, digital visualizations might help. More likely, under 
                such grim conditions, maintaining basic tools for thought and communication may become a key 
                feature of teaching/education at any level, because, in short, making pictures might be what 
                is available.</p>
                  <p>The goal of the adaptation is to see the source text in a new way that can draw attention to the 
                poem’s details—especially those related to the medium itself—which may be less apparent by 
                reading the poem in its written form only. Through the same process, students will enhance their 
                media literacy; they will investigate a Romantic relationship between the self and nature; and 
                ultimately, they will situate this relationship in a larger history of ecocritical perspectives. 
                It is within this larger history that Romanticism becomes especially useful in the Anthropocene, 
                for it unabashedly raises questions regarding how to orient one’s self in a world without clear 
                markers for orientation, without an indication of one’s dominant (or subordinate) status, or a 
                path leading one beyond any foreseeable horizon. For readers primarily interested in an in-class 
                activity that they can add to their repertoire, I will focus in the first section exclusively on 
                an adaptation exercise with respect to Wordsworth’s “Written in Germany” from <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (1800). In the second section, I will present a vocabulary 
                for interpreting media and media representations in Wordsworth’s poem. The third section focuses 
                on the poem’s depiction of a typical Romantic-era ecocritical perspective: the centered point of 
                view. Last, by offering a brief outline of a class as a whole, I show how a course might locate 
                Wordsworth’s outlook in a broader historical context, bringing the Romantic outlook into contact 
                with views from the Anthropocene that cannot afford to be restricted to the margins.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <title level="a">Written in Germany, on One of the Coldest Days of the Century</title> features 
                Wordsworth sitting alone in his cottage, warmed by a stove, and addressing a housefly that 
                mistakes the stove’s heat for the warm weather that has yet to arrive. What follows is a short 
                description of the fly’s predicament in relation to Wordsworth’s situation. It contains a promise 
                that Wordsworth will look after the fly until the coming spring, followed by an apostrophe to a 
                lover, and concludes with a reference to God as the witness guaranteeing the equilibrium of the 
                world (the return of spring). The poem thereby ends with a more optimistic and less ambiguous 
                version of Shelley’s question, “If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?” (70). Between the 
                address to a nonhuman thing and the emphasis on return or recuperation, <title level="a">Written 
                    in Germany</title> certainly belongs to the larger body of Wordsworth’s work on nature. But 
                given the obscurity of the poem and its almost utter absence from literary criticism, why focus 
                on this nature poem?</p>
                  <p>While most classes on ecopoetry or ecocriticism are likely to study Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey</title> (1798), pairing it 
                with <title level="a">Written in Germany</title> more adequately demonstrates Wordsworth’s direct 
                engagement with the conditions of the planet:<note place="foot" resp="editors">According to John 
                    Shoptaw, it is the direct engagement with the earth that qualifies Wordsworth’s poem as an 
                    ecopoem. Counter to Shoptaw’s claim that an ecopoem must be “environmental” and 
                    “environmentalist,” Timothy Morton believes that, at bottom, all poetry is ecopoetry 
                    (<title level="m">Ecology Without Nature</title> 79).</note>

                     </quote>
                Departing from his pantheistic stance in <title level="a">Tintern Abbey,</title> regarding nature 
                as a motion and a spirit, Wordsworth looks at the earth in <title level="a">Written in 
                    Germany</title> through a Lockean lens. The planet is a body with a lifespan—and it is 
                on a downward trajectory. A course on ecocriticism and textual studies would make much of the 
                fact that the second stanza was included in the poem from 1800–1815, and from this date on 
                it is absent from most collections. One could argue that the later editorial decision as well 
                as the poem’s current online presence overlooks an earlier, more ecocentric version of 
                Wordsworth.</p>
                  <p>In the classroom, students can synthesize the many variables of Wordsworth’s poem by illustrating 
                it. When they arrive in class, the desks are clustered together with paper and markers, 
                crayons, and colored pencils. I withhold prefatory remarks, and instead, with the prompts 
                already distributed, I let students jump into the activity. Beginning with the activity is 
                an inductive approach to teaching. It allows students to go “into the field” to create a host 
                of examples, and from these samples their conclusions ensue. If the course is more focused on 
                environmental science (perhaps as part of a literature and science course), this approach can 
                reinforce the rise of inductive reasoning.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On the inductive 
                    method in Romantic-era literature see Smith’s <title level="m">Fact and 
                        Feeling</title> (45–91).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>After which, students select a quote from the poem that captures an important part or the 
                “whole” of the image. It is an especially useful step for demonstrating how images and the 
                written word are in conversation with each other. Through various combinations, students can 
                play with literal reinforcements, ironic twists, or juxtapositions. Finally, students share 
                their work, providing an account for why they chose to depict Wordsworth’s poem the way they 
                did, and why they selected this particular quote.</p>
                  <p>Administering this exercise on five separate occasions, I have seen an impressive range of 
                variations on Wordsworth’s poem. A typical adaptation includes a poet/speaker figure by a 
                stove inside a cottage. Many of the illustrations place the speaker in the center of the 
                image. The other common variation removes the poet altogether, as if the student were 
                assuming the role of poet describing the cottage, objects, and atmosphere. There is also a 
                significant tendency among students to interpret the poem from an ecocentric 
                standpoint—centering the fly rather than the human narrator.</p>
                  <p>The adaptation becomes an exercise in visual rhetoric. The transposition from one medium to 
                another requires students to ask a different set of questions regarding how the objects 
                depicted relate to one another:<note place="foot" resp="editors">By transposition, I mean 
                    transferring an artwork from one medium or genre to another, while maintaining some 
                    fidelity to the original. For a summary of three types of adaptation (transposition, 
                    commentary, and analogue), see Sanders (17–25).</note> Why are some things big and 
                some small, some centered and some marginalized, some outlined and some filled in, some 
                foregrounded and some backgrounded, and some included and some excluded? As students hear 
                the many explanations behind these myriad images, they realize that each iteration 
                convinces audiences of a different message. Some are anthropocentric, some ecocentric; 
                some are optimistic, some pessimistic. Finally, hanging the images together on the wall 
                demonstrates the incredible nuances of the source text and our reading of it. As I say, 
                it is just like in art class: we’re all painting the same bowl of fruit, but the variety 
                of outcomes is nearly infinite.</p>
                  <p>The exercise also demonstrates that drawing can be part of the writing process. The 
                illustration provides a foothold allowing students to see the poem as a whole and from 
                multiple perspectives. Plus, drawing in a group setting demonstrates the collaborative 
                nature of reading and writing. Last, because students engage with the poem in a creative 
                register, they gain insight into how artworks are made—namely, by transposing an idea 
                from one medium to another. So, while it may seem like a gratuitous detour, students 
                ultimately arrive at a greater appreciation for the wide range of steps leading to a 
                final product and the individual value of those steps.</p>
                  <p>Before entering an extended analysis of the exercise’s significance, I want to point out 
                what is obvious and also the easiest point to miss: if we want to visualize ourselves 
                in the Anthropocene, any picture of the self today already achieves this goal. 
                Twenty-five years ago, I doubt that anyone was drawing this particular Wordsworth 
                poem. And no one was posting images of this poem to Twitter. It is a truism of 
                phenomenology that it is difficult to notice an old medium, or one taken for granted, 
                like a hand-drawn illustration. But technically, once the picture is posted online, 
                that particular combination of media (a digitized illustration) is a relatively recent 
                outlet. The blending of older and newer media can obfuscate not just what we are seeing, 
                but when we are seeing. In other words, visualizing ourselves in a world without us is 
                still a challenge to be addressed, but it is important to bear in mind that we are 
                already visualizing ourselves in the Anthropocene. We could not use these media in this 
                combination without the Anthropocene, and the converse is also true. So, if hand-drawn 
                illustrations of Wordsworth’s poetry strike some as too cute to be taken seriously, 
                consider that their digitized existence on the internet is bound necessarily to the 
                geological reengineering of the planet.</p>

                  <head>Media Hot and Cold</head>
                  <p>Conducting media adaptations in the classroom clarifies the content of the source text, 
                but it also draws attention to the media of the source text and its adaptation. To 
                understand the significance of the media involved, it is necessary to provide students 
                with a vocabulary for interpreting how we relate to media and how different mediums 
                relate to one another (“media” and “mediums” are both acceptable plural forms of 
                “medium”).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Also see Goodman on the etymology and 
                    meaning of “medium” (17–20).</note> The <title level="m">OED</title> defines a 
                medium variously as “something which is intermediate . . . a middle state”; an 
                “intermediate agency, instrument, or channel; a means”; a currency or “anything 
                commonly agreed as a token of value and used in transactions”; “any raw material or 
                mode of expression used in an artistic or creative activity”; a “channel of mass 
                communication” or a “physical material (as tape, disk, paper, etc.) used for 
                recording or reproducing data, images or sound”; and, in the natural world, any 
                “intervening substance through which a force acts on objects at a distance or through 
                which impressions are conveyed to the senses.” I tell students to think of the medium 
                as the vehicle for the content (which is really just another medium). Studying media 
                avoids hermeneutic questions like “What does the text mean?” Instead, media studies 
                can ask, “How fast is a text produced/circulated? How many copies are there? And 
                how many audience members can participate at a given time?” In short, media studies 
                describes how literature functions.</p>
                  <p>Marshall McLuhan offers two useful terms for describing how media work: “hot” and 
                “cold.” A hot medium is one that provides lots of information that targets multiple 
                senses.<note place="foot" resp="editors">McLuhan actually writes that a hot medium 
                    extends a “single” sense in “high definition,” for instance, a photograph with 
                    many pixels targets sight in particular (36). This side of his definition must 
                    be weighed in the balance with his overall definition: warmer media are immersive 
                    because they enwrap the viewer, thus targeting multiple sense faculties 
                    simultaneously.</note> For instance, the theater of the eighteenth century 
                included moving bodies, spoken language, music, costumes, sets, props, and lights 
                (each one is, of course, a different medium under the sign of “theater”). In such an 
                immersive setting, a case could be made for affecting sound and vision, as well as 
                olfactory and haptic senses. On the other end of the spectrum, a book of poetry is a 
                relatively cold medium. It is ink and paper, read with the eyes and held with the 
                hands. The most important distinction between the two examples is the audience’s 
                level of participation. In the case of the theater, the viewer receives expressions 
                of characters’ faces, the inflections of actors’ voices, and the hues of lights, 
                costumes, and scenery. The theater’s details are determined external to the 
                audience’s subjective perceptions. A written text might describe faces, voices, 
                and environmental appearances, but the reader must mentally determine the output of 
                this information. I tell students, cold media require lots of imagination, while hot 
                media provide all the information “prepackaged.” One student, Dexter Blue, added the 
                compelling idea in a recent class that hotter media require less imagination but an 
                increase in attention: there are fewer blanks to fill in but more details to 
                follow.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For participating in this exercise and 
                    contributing their imaginative thoughts and questions, I would like to thank 
                    Dexter (who gave me permission to include his idea and name) and the rest of 
                    the students in English 200, <title level="a">Ecocritical Perspectives: Genres, 
                        Media, and Narratives,</title> at the University of Washington, Seattle, 
                    winter 2017, plus several sections of Composition 101 that focused on ecopoetry 
                    at Highline College (Des Moines, WA).</note> The more students parse out the 
                nuances of a medium (and its many media), the more complicated the conversation 
                becomes.</p>
                  <p>Comparing the poem <title level="a">Written in Germany</title> to an illustration 
                requires a subtle analysis. Students might object: “If we’re only concerned with 
                the medium, then our drawings are no different than the poem.” Indeed, the two 
                artifacts belong to the same medial family: both are ink on paper. But typeface 
                and hand-drawn illustrations vary in terms of style and expression, including 
                texture, color, and movement. These conventions can all be measured in terms of 
                determination. In the majority of printed texts, the type tends to be relatively 
                uniform from copy to copy and even from book to book; when it is not uniform, the 
                typeface calls attention to the written word as a medium (consider the genre of 
                concrete poetry, for example). At which point, the word migrates from a linguistic 
                to a visual modality. So yes, the two media share a great deal. The challenge is 
                dividing them.</p>
                  <p>At another level, McLuhan’s terms can also inform students’ understanding of media 
                as represented in the poem. In the last lines of the second stanza, Wordsworth 
                explains that in 1740 the weather was “cutting and rough,” but “<emph>now</emph>,” 
                according to the “glass” (or the thermometer), it is “four degrees lower.” It is 
                a happy coincidence that an exercise on the poem and the “temperature” of its medium 
                includes a thermometer among the poem’s many images. Likely a representative or 
                metonym for “science,” it seems like a cool medium at first: thermometers provide 
                very little information and target only a single sense faculty. Indeed, counter to 
                the theater, scientific instruments tend to belong to a strictly visual field. And 
                unlike the printed text, their strictly quantitative notation system diminishes 
                room for interpretation: 40 degrees is 40 degrees in all times and places (of 
                course, this absolute is a little less than absolute, given the competing scales, 
                Fahrenheit and Celsius, both eighteenth-century inventions). But when determining 
                the “temperature” of a medium (in this case, the thermometer), it is necessary to 
                consider the object in relation to other objects of its time (synchronically) as 
                well as its place within a wider history of media (diachronically).<note place="foot" resp="editors">McLuhan touches on the historicity of the media he discusses. 
                    Today, the scope of McLuhan’s study has been expanded to include Siegfried 
                    Zielinski’s concept of “deep time.” Jussi Parikka charts the Anthropocene’s 
                    development from a deep history, namely its “systematic relation to the 
                    carboniferous” (17), to its dystopian present and futurity, in which our 
                    everyday technical objects (laptops, mobile phones, and so forth) add to “a 
                    new future layer of zombie media” (114).</note> In this case, Wordsworth wants 
                the coolness of the technical object to stand in stark contrast to the “excellent 
                stuff” that makes up the planet. And the planet is of an ever-increasing age and 
                an ever-decreasing temperature. Accordingly, the thermometer is technically 
                “hotter” than the earth. The poem thus becomes a debate on scientific media 
                versus natural or ecomedia, where the former (instruments) are becoming 
                increasingly adept at “reading” the latter (planet). It is not the case that 
                Wordsworth’s scientific object actually provides more information or targets 
                more sense faculties than the earth (synchronically), but if he is evaluating them 
                on a scale according to age, then scientific inventions are on the newer, hotter 
                end of the spectrum (diachronically).</p>
                  <p>Thus students learn that no medium operates in total isolation. Even the various 
                media in and outside of Wordsworth’s poem maintain a relationship: the planet does 
                feel cooler, which requires a thermometer to measure and a stove to keep warm; the 
                stove allows Wordsworth to remain awake, meditating with his mind and speaking 
                with his voice; we are holding the book documenting this scene; and through the 
                printed words on the page, we are giving voice to Wordsworth’s ideas, very likely 
                with the aid of a light bulb or a screen. McLuhan would say that media alter human 
                relationships—the stove brings humans around the fire, and the lightbulb allows 
                us to have night class. Today, we might say that we are entangled in an “ecology 
                of reading” and the terms “hot” and “cool” can help us measure these 
                relationships—if not precisely, at least in terms that students can readily apply 
                in and outside of the classroom.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For an overview 
                    of criticism on “ecologies of reading” and the way that computational methods

                    Posthumus and Sinclair.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The end goal is to help students think about the value of the range of temperatures 
                among different media in the Anthropocene. As literary scholars concerned with the 
                conditions of the planet, there may be a tendency to downplay the value of hot 
                media. After all, they require less imagination, thus diminishing one’s ability to 
                enter another’s perspective. But the downside of a cooler medium may be that 
                visualizing one’s self leads to some pretty solipsistic interpretations of the 
                present or the future. So it is not enough to simply say that cool media are worth 
                more than hot media, for the perspective one embodies in the act of imagining a 
                world can quickly diminish the adequacy of the representation. It may become, in 
                John Keats’ terms, an instance of the egotistical sublime. Accordingly, in an 
                evaluation of media adaptations in the Anthropocene, an analysis of media at play 
                still requires additional modes of inquiry: perspective must also be considered.</p>

                  <head>Self and Nature</head>
                  <p>Adapting “Written in Germany” to a visual modality and different media also draws 
                out the poem’s implications for the self or the lyric “I” in relation to nature. 
                The history of the lyric “I” is already tied up with the development of this genre’s 
                medium. With the rise of print culture comes the parallel shift from a public to a 
                private lyric. The material history corresponds with a change internal to the genre, 
                the switch from external address to internal meditation. As Scott Brewster 
                introduces the topic, this turn within the genre represents the dominant form of 
                lyric poetry, and reaches maturity during the Romantic period, at the same time 
                that Wordsworth and his circle “elevate” the poet “who becomes synonymous with the 
                lyric ‘I’” (30, 73). In addition to the dialectic between public and private, 
                Brewster’s study explores additional dichotomies within the lyric: timelessness and 
                history, objectivity and subjectivity, and, what is most important for our purposes, 
                self and nature. Echoing Robert Langbaum, Brewster claims that the lyric “constitutes 
                a blurring of the inner and outer worlds: the self is projected onto external nature, 
                which in turn becomes a mirror that reflects back an image of the self” (84). While 
                it is a convenient way to model the self, in the last decade Timothy Morton has 
                promoted a critique of this binary relationship. For Morton, the ecocritic ought to 
                beware of the Romantic subject showcasing the natural landscape: “Instead of looking 
                at the trees, look at the person who looks at the trees” (125). Morton’s advice is 
                rhetorical; for him, the speaker determines the message. Thus, critics should ask, 
                Who is the figure at the center? How have they come to be determined as a speaking 
                self in the first place? And can the speaker be trusted? An examination of the 
                medium through which this figure is encountered can contribute to answering these 
                questions.</p>
                  <p>Because Wordsworth is often depicted in student drawings as a singular individual resting 
                inside a cottage, his position stands in contradistinction to the freezing landscape, 
                which the students make visible by way of a lone window. It is an apt depiction of the 
                “theater of the mind.” This arrangement quickly establishes a division between self and 
                nature, inside and outside, or mind and world. At this stage, students might be 
                introduced to empirical and idealist tendencies in the long eighteenth century. For if 
                everything “outside” the cottage is determined by Wordsworth’s narrator “inside,” the 
                poem seems to maintain the so-called idealist views of George Berkeley, whose influence 
                can be felt in the period from Blake to Byron.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Berkeley 
                    only denies the reality of material substance. In its place, he espouses the 
                    existence of God or a spiritual mind independent of human thought. Accordingly, 
                    Berkeley’s theories can be regarded as idealist, but his idealism is not 
                    antirealist. As Paul Redding points out, it is rather a brand of “spiritual 
                    realism” (3–4).</note> An empirically based idealism calls into question any 
                certainty with respect to objects “outside” of one’s thoughts. The appeal of such a 
                philosophy is the stability it lends to the self. The problem is the instability it 
                lends to everything else. In addition to centering the narrator, the students’ images 
                continue to bolster the poem’s latent idealism by “flattening” the entire poem onto a 
                single page or domain, with only a window to indicate something beyond the medium.</p>
                  <p>Yet the self-contained image of the lyric “I” is often disturbed in literature by a 
                nonhuman intervention. In Wordsworth’s case, a fly happens upon the scene and tiptoes 
                across the stove’s hot iron surface. In literature more generally, Morton explains, 
                the introduction of a nonhuman other destabilizes the illusion of a self-contained 
                “I,” separated from the nature “over there” (99–100). It is an object from the 
                outside which has broached the barrier separating the dreamer from the dream. 
                Furthermore, the fly is the very figure of the disorientation that comes with 
                significant, global, ecological changes. The fly in <title level="a">Written in 
                    Germany</title> has lost all sense of space and time. The fly is a “fool,” 
                “seduc’d” from its “winter retreat” by the heat of the stove, and now creeps across 
                the flat black iron surface, a postapocalyptic image wrought by human hands (11–15). 
                The parallel between the fly and Wordsworth is apparent enough: the poet is also a 
                fool in the wrong place at the wrong time, vacationing in Germany in the dead of 
                winter. Moreover, the postapocalyptic situation of the fly (the sun is gone; the 
                earth is flat, black, and hot) is just one of many possible outcomes also available 
                to Wordsworth. Thus this stranger thing calls into question the stability of the 
                presence that the lyric “I” presupposes, and encourages the suspicion that the fly, 
                Wordsworth, all of us really, are just aimless objects.</p>
                  <p>Of course, Wordsworth attempts to reestablish the inside/outside barrier, but through 
                two very different means: generically and theologically. Consistent with Morton’s 
                formula for ecomimesis, first denying a separation between self and nature but then 
                reifying the difference in the process, the poet contains nature by naming 
                it.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For Morton, ecomimesis “aims to rupture the 
                    aesthetic distance, to break down the subject-object dualism, to convince us 
                    that we belong to this world. But the end result is to reinforce the aesthetic 
                    distance, the very dimension in which the subject-object dualism persists. 
                    Since de-distancing has been reified, distance returns even more strongly, in 
                    surround-sound, with panoramic intensity” (135).</note> Wordsworth identifies 
                nature according to a particular time and place, a common convention of Romantic 
                nature/lyric poetry (Brewster 76–77). In <title level="a">Tintern Abbey,</title> 
                Wordsworth points to a particular time and place in the title, <title level="a">Lines 
                    Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey, on Revisiting the Banks of the Wye 
                    During a Tour, July 13, 1798.</title> He thus transitions once and for all from 
                the timeless/divine plane to a historical/earthly one, creating a convenient heading 
                for the index at the end of the book of the world. The title, <title level="a">Written in Germany,</title> is a less obvious marker because it provides 
                no chronological date, but—and perhaps in a more adequate representation of a 
                particular aspect of reality—it names a specific “location” in the history of the 
                earth through temperature (“on One of the Coldest Days of the Century”). Date and 
                location become temperature and location. Or perhaps more accurate still, especially 
                in a discussion of the longue durée of the planet: time is temperature. Here, the 
                reality of Wordsworth’s situation gets the better of his ecomimesis: between the 
                poet’s relocation to Germany and the temperature’s low point, the central figure of 
                the poet is, in fact, just as disoriented as the fly—he just doesn’t know it yet.</p>
                  <p>Wordsworth’s final attempt to secure the self and the planet can be linked to an 
                apostrophe, or an address to something or someone not present within the 
                poem.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For more on apostrophe, or lyric address, see 
                    Brewster (38–42), and Culler (186–211).</note> In this desolate plane, 
                Wordsworth’s final recourse is God. It is the same logical move Berkeley makes in 
                his philosophy. If essence is perception, things can exist independent of the 
                human mind—even without humans—because ultimately, everything is a perception of 
                God. Wordsworth also finds atonement in the divine testimony, “Yet, God is my 
                witness” (36). God sees all, and thus, even the tree falling in the forest without 
                a human nearby to hear it is real. The problem is that, if Wordsworth finds 
                recourse through an all perceiving and all preserving deity, he remains in good 
                standing even if he disavows scientific knowledge about the planet. Science charts 
                global temperatures and allows Wordsworth to know that, in fact (as far as the 
                information he had at the time could provide), the earth was cooling and becoming 
                less hospitable to life. The safety net God provides brings Wordsworth in the end 
                to the familiar conclusion of optimists, that all will return to a happy 
                equilibrium: “thou small helpless Thing, / Thy life I would gladly sustain / Till 
                summer comes up . . . and with crowds / Of thy brethren a march thou shoud’st sound 
                through the clouds, / And back to the forests again” (36–40). Certainly, if 
                Wordsworth restricts himself to “this” year, a “balance” between winter and spring, 
                nature and self, life and death seems to be had. But the scale with which he begins
                (“coldest day of the century”) haunts the local perspective: the conditions of the 
                earth must be measured according to hundreds of years (really, millions of years), 
                not what’s happening next month.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Timothy Morton 
                    points out that large time scales are far more difficult to process than 
                    infinity, and they severely complicate human relationships: “no one then [one 
                    hundred thousand years from now] will meaningfully be related to me; and my 
                    smallest action now will affect that time in profound ways. A Styrofoam cup 
                    will outlive me by over four hundred years” (<title level="m">Hyperobjects</title> 60).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>While students can see Wordsworth in relationship to (nonhuman) others, neither 
                poem nor visual adaptation satisfies the need to narrate social, political, and 
                economic changes over such a long period time. This conclusion conflicts with the 
                argument put forth by Nick Sousanis, who explains in <title level="m">Unflattening</title> that illustrations (especially, comics), “are 
                read sequentially like a text [and] the entire composition is also taken 
                in—viewed—allatonce” (62). As the pictures on the page and the final phrase’s 
                compression make clear, visual images can demonstrate change without movement, 
                which makes them powerful tools for describing a longer (a much, much longer) 
                narrative about the human position leading up to, within, and even after the 
                Anthropocene. The problem in class is that most students do not draw Wordsworth’s 
                story as a sequence. Instead, they depict Wordsworth and his relations in “a 
                moment,” as the lyric genre would seem to encourage. So the source of the 
                problem—visualizing the self in the Anthropocene with adequacy—can be located 
                in Wordsworth’s point of view, the lyric “I,” which dominates the poem. What is 
                needed then may be a different medium, but it also might be a different way of 
                collating the information from within the same medium.</p>

                  <head>Center, Margin, Nowhere</head>
                  <p>Placing Wordsworth’s poem and the Romantic subject in a broader historical 
                context can raise awareness regarding the larger consequences of the centered 
                view. The course can be divided into three sections. Opposite to the “center” is 
                the view from the “margin,” and all first-person perspectives are called into 
                question by the “view from nowhere.” The organization of the course allows 
                students to recognize the consequences of multiple perspectives, as well as how 
                these have developed over the centuries. Certainly, one could conduct an entire 
                class on ecocritical perspectives from the standpoint of Romanticism alone, 
                switching from anthropocentric to ecocentric views or, for instance, from 
                Wordsworth to Charlotte Dacre.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Dacre’s 
                    ecopoetry was first brought to my attention by Ashely Cross during her talk, 
                    <title level="a">‘Thou art my dew’: Atmospheric Embodiment in Charlotte Dacre’s <title level="m">Hours of Solitude</title> (1805),</title> at the annual 
                    International Conference on Romanticism in 2016 at Colorado 
                    College.</note> But opening historical and generic boundaries is important 
                because we cannot afford to approach the Anthropocene synchronically. While it 
                will not be immediately apparent by focusing strictly on the centered or marginal 
                view, by combining these perspectives with the view from nowhere, it becomes 
                clear that what has happened is still happening and what will happen has happened 
                already.</p>
                  <p>To account for the margins, Shakespeare’s <title level="m">The Tempest</title> (1611) 
               and Gloria Naylor’s <title level="m">Mama Day</title> (1988) provide a long arc, 
               obfuscating the “starting point” of the Anthropocene. Plus, turning from 
               Wordsworth’s printed word to Shakespeare’s theater allows students to adapt the 
               text to yet another medium: the stage. Performing the drama makes palpable the 
               connection between Enlightenment science, the human determination of the planet, 
               and the subordination of an indigenous people to European colonialists.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Following the connection Noël Sturgeon makes between racist and 
                   anthropocentric ideologies, and Jonathan Bate’s claim that <title level="m">The 
                       Tempest</title> prefigures Baconian/Enlightenment science, Elizabeth Gruber 
                   argues that, as an adaptation of <title level="m">The Tempest</title>, Toni 
                   Morrison’s <title level="m">Tar Baby</title> “takes up the narrative of a 
                   postcolonial setting, so that the novel comments on processes and practices 
                   rendered only in inchoate terms in Shakespeare” (226). Gruber’s essay is not 
                   only an excellent introduction to the dichotomy between 
                   white-patriarchal-naturalistic science and black-matriarchal-pantheistic magic, 
                   but she also provides an instructive application of adaptation theory, noting that 
                   the “magic of adaptation resides in paradox, depending as it does on the 
                   simultaneity of repetition and transformation” (225).</note> Reinforcing lessons 
               from <title level="m">The Tempest</title>, Gloria Naylor’s <title level="m">Mama 
                   Day</title> contrasts techno-rationalist science with local folk 
               magic.<note place="foot" resp="editors">I am indebted to Francesca Royster who first 
                   pointed out to me the parallel relationship of <title level="m">The Tempest</title> 
                   and Naylor’s novel. While Naylor herself denied that <title level="m">Mama 
                       Day</title> adapts <title level="m">The Tempest</title> (Gruber 238, note 4), 
                   that fact only provides an additional topic for discussion: Must adaptations be 
                   intentional? And what is the responsibility of a critic in the face of an author 
                   disavowing another work’s influence?</note> The former (science) is found in the 
               city, whereas the latter (magic) endures on an island—on the margin of the 
               continental United States. But Naylor’s narrative also complicates <title level="m">The Tempest</title> and the view from the margin in meaningful ways. 
               Unlike Caliban, Naylor’s characters are not explicitly oppressed by a single white 
               patriarch; instead, they grapple with the subtle ways in which they have internalized 
               white-American, rational-scientific values and beliefs with respect to people and 
               the planet. Students benefit from analyzing how Naylor adapts aspects of 
               Shakespeare’s play, while at the same time recognizing, as Donald J. Reilly points 
               out, how she embeds Gothic conventions dating to the eighteenth century for the sake 
               of creating “a space in which Naylor is able to write back against American hegemony” 
               (243). Within the medium of the text there is a parallel tension with respect to 
               “when” we are as well as “who” or “what” we are. Shakespeare and Naylor call into 
               question the stability of the power over nature that accompanies the centered 
               Romantic outlook even as they reckon with the difficulties that accompany 
               resistance to this power.</p>
                  <p>
                If the ability to resist the capitalist, patriarchic, and techno-rationalist 
                destruction of the planet is compromised by one’s position within this system, then 
                the view from the margins demonstrates on another level that visualizing the 
                instability of the self and human relations within the Anthropocene may be a 
                problem of perspective after all. Of course, such a conclusion ought to raise 
                objections, as if I were suggesting that global warming—a sign of the 
                Anthropocene—is merely a matter of interpretation. While global warming may be an 
                adequate characterization of the planet’s current trajectory, human access to this 
                current and future state remains subject to one’s cultural position. Plenty of 
                information is available with respect to global warming and the Anthropocene, but 
                an understanding of the fuller implications of this information requires the 
                ability to visualize one’s self as subject to it, which requires the ability to 
                visualize one’s self in an unstable position. The earlier part of this essay 
                attempted to outline an exercise for precisely this purpose, visualizing one’s 
                self in an unfamiliar time, place, and climate. But if the information being 
                visualized is grounded in a centralized or marginalized perspective, the 
                information may not communicate the actual conditions and changes to the earth. 
                The information given and the changes depicted may become mere plot devices for 
                effectuating a narrative of blind hope (or a capitalist vision of productive 
                negativity).</p>
                  <p>One solution to this potential pitfall is to subtract perspective altogether. In 
                a section on the “view from nowhere,” students investigate representations of a 
                view detached from its own situation.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In his 
                    eponymous book, Thomas Nagel links the view from nowhere to representation: 
                    “To represent an experience from outside by imagining it subjectively is the 
                    analogue of representing an objective spatial configuration by imagining it 
                    visually. . . . What is represented need not resemble the representation in 
                    all respects. It must be represented in terms of certain general features of 
                    subjective experience—subjective universals. . . . But the capacity to form 
                    universal concepts in any area enables one not only to represent the present 
                    situation from without but to think about other possibilities which one has 
                    not experienced and perhaps never will experience directly” (21).</note> Taking 
                the subject out of the landscape eliminates the phenomenological approach to 
                ecology, personal encounters with other objects and species, and perhaps most 
                importantly, local time and space. Instead of near becomes far and far becomes 
                near, here becomes nowhere and nowhere becomes everywhere. Such a view is 
                exemplified in digital databases, and a good one to accompany Wordsworth’s poem 
                is the <title level="a">World Meteorological Organization Global Weather &amp; 
                    Climate Extremes Archive,</title> hosted by Arizona State University. It is 
                a database containing extreme temperatures (similar to those found in <title level="a">Written in Germany</title>), according to geographical location 
                and date. As students gloss over the various names and numbers, I ask: Who is the 
                narrator in this database? Who is the protagonist? Where is the beginning of this 
                database, the climax, and the dénouement? Because databases do not include a 
                narrator, hero, or a clear beginning, middle, and end, it is difficult to 
                identify with the text or to follow it in relationship to one’s own position. 
                Unlike a Wordsworth poem, <title level="m">The Tempest</title>, or Gloria 
                Naylor’s novel, there is no sequence that mirrors a moment, a few days, or the 
                years of one’s life. Compared to the image, the database flattens time and 
                space by eliminating any centered or marginal “I,” as well as the step-by-step 
                sequence that inevitably leads to some action, discovery, or resolution. In 
                the database, all events are equal.</p>
                  <p>A database does not eliminate bias, but it is an additional aid for exposing 
                “blind spots” in one’s reading.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In a recent 
                    edition of <title level="j">PMLA</title> (2017), a number of scholars 
                    debated the strengths and weaknesses of “distant reading.” I am writing 
                    about a scientific database and not a model of literary history, but 
                    models are relevant because they rely on datasets to produce predictions 
                    with accuracy. In her discussion of textual analysis, Johanna Drucker 
                    rightly points out that some scholars mistake computational methods for 
                    absolute objectivity. They forget that “automated methods are also fraught 
                    with cultural, historical, and other prejudices built into their design” 
                    (631). Indeed, all models are situated in a human, moral-aesthetic domain. 
                    But as Richard Jean So also points out, models are not intended to “[bring] 
                    forth intractable empirical truths that one must accept or reject, [rather] 
                    the reader is encouraged to reason with the model and its maker to better 
                    grasp the data” (671). So concludes that what models do well is expose 
                    error, and error should be thought of as a “constitutive part of 
                    science . . . something to be integrated formally into our research,” 
                    instead of something to be merely “tolerated or avoided” (672). While a 
                    view from nowhere may not be entirely possible, attempting to see from the 
                    perspective of an idealized nonlocation can expose errors reinforced by an 
                    all-to-comfortable faith in our subjective, first-person 
                    observations.</note> In the case of <title level="a">Written in 
                        Germany,</title> Wordsworth writes about a foreign country he visits at 
                a particular time, providing the English with a glimpse at the relative ways 
                humans live out their moral-aesthetic lives. By contrast, the database can 
                provide information on Germany in 1800 as well as the Philippines in 2017. 
                With all of this information combined, climate scientists can make predictions 
                about the planet hundreds of years into the future. Accordingly, the lack of a 
                personal view (and the concomitant absence of a narrative) allows any place at 
                any time on earth to have an equal value in relationship to any other place or 
                time on earth. While some might see this “flattening out” of time and space as 
                equivalent to an “emptying out” of personhood, the same mechanism also affords 
                a place, such as the Philippines, an equitable position in relationship to the 
                United States or the United Kingdom in its struggles with global warming. While 
                some in the United States may suffer from less anxiety over rising sea levels 
                and temperatures, these are exigent environmental issues for the archipelago 
                that makes up the Filipino nation, and it may only be through a database that 
                these two regions (and many more) can be regarded simultaneously and their 
                needs weighed in the balance.<note place="foot" resp="editors">According to 
                    Naomi Klein, even “good intentioned” Westerners that believe in global

                    regions remote from their own homes and are even comfortable with a slight 
                    increase of temperature because it will “improve” the weather “for them,” 
                    while encouraging major disasters for others.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of course, as N. Katherine Hayles claims, databases still require narratives 
                to “achieve dramatic impact and significance” (178). While the database is a 
                great equalizer, it leads back to the historical depictions of humans in time 
                of the kind Joseph Priestly was so adeptly renovating at the end of the 
                eighteenth century. They certainly attempt to achieve a degree of adequacy, 
                but these maps say little about how to relate to others. Nor can we find total 
                satisfaction with Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Written in Germany,</title> as 
                it reveals how one’s personal outlook can obscure the facts regarding 
                normative and nondiscursive registers. Really, what is needed is Wordsworth’s 
                narrative in relationship to a larger network of human and nonhuman relations 
                throughout time and space, and media adaptations can still help map such 
                interconnections. One can envision a larger project that asks students to 
                incorporate all or most of the materials from a class on environmental 
                literature into a final project, repurposing Wordsworth’s lyric in 
                combination with other poems, novels, dramas, even blogs, scholarly articles, 
                and databases. Based on the amalgamation of these modes, genres, and media, 
                students might make their own conjectures regarding human relations in the 
                last instant, at the end of the Anthropocene, or just prior to a world 
                without us.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay addresses the theoretical, philosophical,
                    and aesthetic uses of silence in the work of William Wordsworth and John Cage.
                    Through close readings of poems by both writers, an examination of their texts on
                    poetics, and an excursus on the concepts of slow violence and the Anthropocene, I
                    ask whether silence might be a useful strategy to resist the traumatic effects of
                    neoliberalism and socio-ecological breakdown. In order to demonstrate the
                    pedagogical usefulness of silence, I also share a sound collage created with my
                    students, in which we employed Wordsworth’s and Cage’s compositional and
                    philosophical methods to try to capture something like the texture of silence mixed
                    directly onto an audio file. Finally, the essay closes by asking whether attunement
                    to silence might help us recognize and respond to the slow violence (military,
                    economic, ideological, and so on) that seems simply to be the world we inhabit.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <p>This essay is predicated on a direct link between our current moment in the
                Anthropocene, the concept of “slow violence,” and the notion of silence as it
                emerges in the work of William Wordsworth and John Cage. The linkage between slow
                violence and the Anthropocene has been theorized adroitly by Rob Nixon in <title level="m">Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor</title> (2011). My
                own contribution involves bringing Wordsworth, Cage, and pedagogy into the picture,
                and to that end I trace out three points or positions in what follows. First, I
                address very provisionally what I take to be an important and largely unremarked
                link between the compositional strategies of Wordsworth and Cage, specifically the
                role of silence as envisioned by the two writers. Next, I share a sound recording
                produced with my students as part of a class on environmental citizenship, a
                recording whose compositional procedure was inspired by Wordsworth and Cage.
                Finally, I ask whether silence, as method, ethos, pedagogy, and spiritual practice,
                constitutes a viable politics, or whether, as seems the case with so many other
                related aesthetic practices and theories developed within the Anthropocene (e.g.,
                personal “development,” “freedom,” the concept of “nature,” etc.), it ultimately
                threatens to fold back into itself and become yet another form of solipsism or
                liberal subjectivism.</p>
                  <p>A word about the Anthropocene and the concept of liberal subjectivity more broadly
                figured: as readers of this volume are well aware, the Anthropocene marks our 
                present interval in time, a moment going back (at least) several centuries, during 
                which many geologically significant conditions and processes have been profoundly 
                altered by human activities. As students of Romanticism are similarly aware, its texts 
                and premises occupy an oddly oblique position vis-à-vis the ravages of the Anthropocene. 
                That is, even as Romanticism arises as response to what “man has made of man” 
                (Wordsworth, <title level="a">Lines Written in Early Spring</title>), arguably its 
                privileging of a liberal, democratic subject—autonomous, free, appetitive, propertied, 
                universal, and self-willed—provides the “natural” grounds for global capitalism. 
                Whether silence as a Romantic concept cuts into and denatures this subjectivity, 
                offering in its place a different defamiliarized subject, able in some measure to 
                resist neoliberalism’s thrall, or whether silence merely resounds as yet another form 
                of acquiescence will be one of this essay’s key concerns.</p>
                  <p>In order to frame what follows and also to set up a kind of resonance, I want to
                begin with three quotations, from which I derive three propositions. First, the
                quotations:
            <list type="simple">
                        <item n="a">“ . . . there came a pause / Of silence such as baffled his best skill”
                    —Wordsworth, <title level="a">There Was a Boy</title>
                        </item>
                        <item n="b">“Where none of these other goals [preexisting form, intentionality] is
                    present, silence becomes something else—not silence at all, but sounds . . .
                    ambient sounds” —Cage (1973, 22)</item>
                        <item n="c">Chance composition frees “the ego from its taste and memory, its concern for
                    profit and power . . . silencing the ego so that the rest of the world has a
                    chance to enter the ego’s own experience whether that be outside or inside.”
                    —Cage (1979)</item>
                     </list>
            And now, the corresponding propositions:
            <list type="simple">
                        <item n="a">silence is that which baffles our best skill (that is, our intentions to
                    control outcomes, to commodify, or to force solutions) </item>
                        <item n="b">silence is not the absence of sound</item>
                        <item n="c">silence allows the sounds of the “world” (that which is outside the
                    ego—screened or merely unnoticed) to enter in </item>
                     </list>
            Let me say at the outset that it seems to me an extremely difficult thing to try to
                put these theorems into practice as a writer, researcher, and teacher. It is my
                small hope that at least some of the writing and thinking that follows will be
                attuned to the spirit of silence, even as it attempts to say more clearly what it is
                and how it functions.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>And, When There Came a Pause</head>
                  <p>One of Romanticism’s primary texts for thinking about silence is, of course,
                Wordsworth’s “There Was a Boy.” Arguably, the most important recent reading of that
                poem belongs to Anne-Lise François. For François, neither New Historicist nor
                psychoanalytic readings can account for the “mood of quiet reception” in the poem
                (167–68). But I confess that I am interested in a much more vulgar and
                instrumentalist kind of reading. I want to account not so much for the quiet,
                receptive mood but rather for the sense of being violently opened up by silence.
                Here are the pertinent and well-known passages: <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                           <l>And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands </l>
                           <l>Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth </l>
                           <l>Uplifted, he, as through an instrument,</l>
                           <l>Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls</l>
                           <l>That they might answer him.—And they would shout</l>
                           <l>Across the watery vale, and shout again,</l>
                           <l>Responsive to his call,—with quivering peals,</l>
                           <l>And long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud </l>
                           <l>Redoubled and redoubled; concourse wild</l>
                           <l>Of jocund din! And, when there came a pause</l>
                           <l>Of silence such as baffled his best skill:</l>
                           <l>Then, sometimes, in that silence, while he hung </l>
                           <l>Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise</l>
                           <l>Has carried far into his heart the voice</l>
                           <l>Of mountain-torrents; or the visible scene</l>
                           <l>Would enter unawares into his mind</l>

                           <l>Its woods, and that uncertain heaven received</l>
                           <l>Into the bosom of the steady lake. (<title level="m">The Prelude</title> 173)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote>
            Like François, I want to resist the impulse to impute traumatic origins or triggers
                (personal or historical) to the radical opening of the boy’s heart and mind.
                Instead, I want to address the ambient and objective nature of the violence
                contained or revealed within Wordsworth’s silence. I borrow the concept of
                “objective” or ambient violence from Slavoj Žižek, who borrows it from Hannah
                Arendt, Freud, and Walter Benjamin; I am also indebted to Timothy Morton’s linkage
                of the Anthropocene to a violent metaphysics of presence (Morton, <title level="a">How I Learned</title>
                259–60; Žižek 9–14). Objective or slow violence can be correlated with the
                phenomenon of microaggression and/or microtrauma—a type of ideological violence that
                is not particularly visible and may not even register for its victims but does its
                damage nonetheless. Geoffrey Hartman comments on the violent nature of silence in
                Wordsworth, reminding us that muteness in his poetry is often experienced as “close
                to a mutilation” (148). Yet what interests me is not only the mutilated and
                mutilating “shock” and the “surprise,” but also the fact that silence reveals, or
                maybe silence merely <emph>is</emph>, the most common everyday sounds and
                images—the same rivers, rocks, lakes, and trees that the boy would have seen every
                day of his life. The question, then, is twofold: what kept the boy from seeing and
                hearing the solemn imagery and sound before the pause; and, what is it in or about
                this silence that makes the revelation possible? </p>
                  <p>It is not at all my intention to attempt yet another reading of the poem. Instead I
                want for now to focus on a single word, a word that both François and Hartman seize
                upon in their readings of the poem: “unawares.” The shock of encountering a form of
                silence, which, again, I am arguing is not the absence of sound, leads us into the
                realm of John Cage’s poetics—Cage, who famously said, “I have nothing to say, and I
                am saying it” (<title level="m">Silence</title> 109). Thinking Wordsworth through Cage
                allows us to see that “unawares” in this context means not only without knowledge
                but also without intentionality. What is more, it reveals something like anamnesis,
                an uncanny dreamlike state in which “a gentle shock of mild surprise” signals the
                obliteration of the borders of the everyday self, and with them, everyday
                temporality. For Cage, as I will show, the desire to compose in a state of
                nonintentionality leads him to embrace practices of chance composition. For
                Wordsworth, nonintentionality comes about in two distinctly different ways. In many
                poems, there seems to be a sensual or emotional overload, a sign perhaps of
                perceptual or psychic overdetermination—think of the opening stanzas of 
                <title level="a">Lines Written in Early Spring,</title> for example (“I heard a 
                thousand blended notes . . .”)—which leads then to a kind of stupor, a hollowed-out 
                state of receptiveness. Alternatively, as in the particular case of 
                <title level="a">There Was a Boy,</title> it may be that failure itself provides 
                the catalyst (when one’s own “skill” is baffled), rather than sensual pleasure 
                or overload.</p>
                  <p>Either way, for both writers, new forms of music or poetry require new forms of
                listening. Here is Cage in conversation discussing this new mode of
                attentiveness:
            <quote>When I hear music, it seems to me that someone is talking, and talking about his
                feelings, or about his ideas, of relationships. But when I hear traffic, the sound
                of traffic here on sixth avenue for instance, I don’t have the feeling that anyone
                is talking. I have the feeling that sound is acting. And I love the activity of
                sound. What it does is it gets louder and quieter, and it gets higher and lower, and
                it gets longer and shorter . . . it does all those things . . . I’m completely
                satisfied with that. I don’t need sound to talk to me. (<title level="a">John Cage about
                Silence</title>)</quote>
            Cage’s openness, his attention to the activity of sound (within traffic for example),
                is contrasted to the sound of someone talking. Here of course we hear echoes of
                Gertrude Stein, where the intentionality of “resemblance” obscures rather than
                reveals meaning (175). For Cage, as for Stein, it seems as though the only truly
                living (one cannot say “meaningful,” since Cage rejects the notion that sound must
                mean) verbal utterances are those denuded of intention. From his earliest writing,
                Cage addresses this nonintentionality, arguing that not all silences are equal.<lb/>

                     </quote>
            Building on Bergson’s theories of duration, Cage emphasizes the interrelation of time
                and space, not as <emph>a priori</emph> forms of
                perception, but rather as aspects of sonorous and rhythmic activity 
                (<title level="m">Silence</title> 97; Crnković 180). Cage writes that in 
                traditional composition silence has an important but subservient
                role to play insofar as it structures the sound into “a strict division of parts”
                (<title level="m">Silence</title> 18–19). In “new” music, silence is freed from
                its merely structural aspects; importantly, we are reciprocally freed from the
                structuring stranglehold of our own intentions 
                (<title level="m">X: Writings</title> ix).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Timothy 
                    Morton writes of Cage’s prepared piano compositions as exemplary of the asymmetry 
                    in the age of hyperobjects, specifically the delinking of personal expressivity 
                    and music (<title level="m">Hyperobjects</title> 165).</note> Cage recognizes 
                that in all ambient sound there is pitch, duration, amplitude, etc. It falls 
                back on the listener to pay attention to this activity of sound, not in order to 
                recombine elements in more original and unique ways (e.g., Roland 
                Barthes’s privileging of writerly versus readerly texts),
                but rather to listen with “mouth shut and . . . ears open,” or, as Wilfred Bion
                would later suggest to psychoanalysts, to learn to listen without memory or desire
                (Cage, <title level="m">Silence</title> 49; Bion 41). Thus, in a new awareness of
                “silence,” there is recognition of something like a radically democratic,
                egalitarian, and “horizontal” impulse—guided by a willingness to let go of
                preexisting structure and the need to control and/or possess (Crnković 172–73; Diaz
                56).</p>

                  <p>It was this awareness, and with it this sense of unknowing, that I hoped to impart to
                my students in a class on environmental citizenship cotaught in 2016 with a
                political geographer. The other primary intertext that I asked the students to read,

                <title level="m">Composition in Retrospect</title> (ca. 1983), was 
                Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Lines Written in Early Spring.</title> I emphasized 
                to them on the first day the concept of contingency, and in the next class period, 
                ambience. I also handed out Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Fenwick</title> note 
                for <title level="a">Lines Written in Early Spring.</title> Interestingly, the 
                note supports a more open—we might even call it horizontal—reading of the poem, 
                not at all what one would expect from the poet of reflection.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Arthur Hallam’s description of Wordsworth in 1831,
                            in contradistinction to Tennyson (545).</note> That is, faced
                with a poem that seems on one level to be arguing for a deeper meaning at the core
                of natural pleasure (in contrast to human manufacture), the note seems unconcerned
                with meaning at all, striving only to recall sensuous detail, that is, “pleasant
                thoughts” (pleasure) with no “sad thoughts” (ideology) brought to mind. Wordsworth
                paints a picture of silence whose intense particularity of detail is worthy of his
                sister:
            <quote>The brook fell down a sloping rock so as to make a waterfall considerable for that
                country, and across the pool below had fallen a tree, an ash if I rightly remember,
                from which rose perpendicularly, boughs in search of the light intercepted by the
                deep shade above. The boughs bore leaves of green that for want of sunshine had
                faded into almost lily-white; and from the underside of this natural sylvan bridge
                depended long and beautiful tresses of ivy which waved gently in the breeze that
                might poetically speaking be called the breath of the waterfall. This motion varied
                of course in proportion to the power of water in the brook. 
                (<title level="m">Fenwick</title> 36–37)</quote>
            Wordsworth’s recollection of the scene, perhaps like the recollection of the poem, is
                marked by moments of accident and contingency—the fallen tree, the lily-white
                leaves, the varied motion of the ivy. There also seems to be an erotic element to
                the note—the blending of “tresses” and “breath” for example—a kind of psychic
                remainder that does not make it into the poem. Yet perhaps, as Freud would later
                argue, we are dealing with a mode of memory that functions not so much like a camera
                with an oversensitive shutter-release button (click, click, click), but rather as a
                collection of memory-traces, which unconsciously selects an image that comes
                “halfway” up to meet the remembering subject (318). In other words, the depiction
                (in the note) of the fallen ash whose branches are “in search of the light”
                anticipates and retroactively confirms the line (in the poem), “The budding twigs
                spread out their fan” (<title level="m">Major Works</title> 80). Thus, the visual
                richness of the scene confirms for us that imagistic quietude, like its aural
                counterpart silence, is not the absence of information, but is instead the ground
                and possibility of change. </p>

                relation to Wordsworth’s theory of composition led me to offer my students a few
                impressionistic words about “spontaneous overflow,” basically a gloss of the
                <title level="a">Preface</title> to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>. This 
                seems to me now wholly inadequate, primarily because the “continued influx” of 
                feelings and thoughts that the <title level="a">Preface</title> describes seems 
                to have a teleological thrust, an almost physiological drive towards the ultimate 
                and miraculous production of the poet and the poem (Wordsworth, 
                <title level="m">Major Works</title> 598). A much better place to begin
                would have been the preface to the 1815 collection of poems. In that work, written
                13 years after the <title level="a">Preface</title> to <title level="m">Lyrical 
                    Ballads</title>, Wordsworth adopts a tone closer to Cage’s. No longer is 
                imaginative coloring “thrown over” raw perception as it was in the 
                <title level="a">Preface</title> to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>,
                although meter and associative links may be “superadded.” Instead, the poet
                represents things “as they are in themselves,” in all of their stubborn facticity
                (<title level="m">Major Works</title> 597). Thus, an ash tree that has fallen
                across a brook requires no additional ornament. Like Cage, Wordsworth’s ideal poet
                does not need nature to talk to him. The “thousand blended notes” of the poem are
                represented synesthetically, as sound image to be experienced—not, I want to stress,
                as text to be deciphered or interpreted: <quote>

            The “fair works” of nature are linked to the human soul as much through sound and
                rhythm (“sweet mood,” “sad thoughts,” and “fair works” are all arguably spondaic) as
                through the supposed psychology or even argument of the poem. Furthermore, it is as
                though the Fenwick note were itself a musical score for the poem.<note place="foot" resp="editors">To score: to gain a point in a game; to evaluate; to orchestrate

                        Verse,</title> in which he suggests that the contemporary poet, in typing 
                    their poem, creates a “scoring to his [<emph>sic</emph>] composing . . . a script 
                    to its vocalization” (245). Cage and Olson were colleagues and collaborators at 
                    Black Mountain College around the time the P.V. was written. There is a further 
                    link to be made from Olson’s comments about a “script” to the poem’s vocalizations 
                    back to Wordsworth’s claim in the 1819 <title level="a">Preface</title> that the 
                    reader must be given room to improvise (“modulate”) the music of the poem 
                    (<title level="m">Major Works</title> 630).</note> That is, we “hear” the brook 
                and rustling leaves not only, or even primarily, by association (for the 
                Wordsworth of 1815, a feature of the imagination and fancy—one of several prerequisite 
                “powers” of the poet), nor by prosodic “invention” (another power), but, more 
                importantly, through observation and description, the first power of the poet 
                in Wordsworth’s new classificatory system: “The ability to observe with accuracy 
                things as they are in themselves, and with fidelity to describe them unmodified by 
                any passion or feeling existing in the mind of the Describer” (<title level="m">Major 
                    Works</title> 626). The issue is not whether or not it is possible to observe 
                anything without the mind of the “Describer” from entering in to some degree (it 
                isn’t), but rather, what opens up for us (and for the poem) when we attempt 
                these types of decentered observations.<note place="foot" resp="editors">James
                            Heffernan considers the preface to the 1815 collection clearer and more
                            defined than Wordsworth’s earlier prose explanations of his poetics,
                            arguing that his “ability to define the workings of imagination varied
                            inversely with the power of his own” (111).</note> For
                twenty-first-century readers, it means rethinking the poet of spontaneous overflow
                as also the poet of detached observation.</p>
                  <p>It means recognizing that, for Wordsworth, all the potential elements of the poem are
                present in the silence of a properly observed scene. Even philosophical
                consideration—for example, the idea “what man has made of man”—comes neither from
                the poet’s or speaker’s interior nor from the cultural and social surround; it is
                not dialectically produced through the speaker’s contemplation of nature. Rather,
                like early industrial pollution, the effects of enclosure on rural populations, or a
                waywardly discharged soldier, it is copresent in nature, and thus “linked” to the
                speaker by unobtrusive observation rather than through busy association. Like the
                “tresses of ivy” that form part of the sonorous experience of the poem, ideas, for
                Wordsworth, even philosophical or political ideas, are “dependent”—that is, linked
                to raw data through the perceptive faculties. One requires a degree of silence in
                order to be unobtrusively observant.</p>
                  <p>This is the most benevolent reading I can offer of Wordsworth’s philosophical
                quandary in this poem. Perhaps this is because being attentive to silence robs us of
                some of our defensive critical reflexivity. What I mean by this is that much of
                Wordsworth’s poetry of this period demands to be read and reread with as much
                naiveté as is manageable. “What man has made of man” seems so naturally
                self-evident—its iambic evenness reinforces this—that we are not inclined to stop
                and question what it means. At first, it seems clear that the first “man” is
                different from the second “man.” If we read it that way, then one reading might be:
                “what [industrial capitalism] man made of [natural] man.” Or, we might hear: “what
                [capitalist] man made of [laborer] man,” etc. As I discussed with my students in
                class—in fact, they pointed it out in the first place—a kind of violence is
                suggested either way by this line, especially by its fundamental asymmetry. But
                beyond any empathetic impulse or even well-meaning liberal outrage we might feel in
                response to that violence, there is nothing in the line that keeps us from reading
                it as: “what man [as a concept] has made of man [a particular contingent person].”
                This last reading leads us away from a conceptualized and concretized poet and/or
                reader, and, like the Winander Boy, towards a decentered observer and
                percipient.</p>
                  <p>I am not claiming that Wordsworth’s and Cage’s poetry can be read as part and parcel
                of a continuous poetics—of course not; in fact, my own slight reading here is
                tendentious insofar as I leave out any discussion of “I must think, do all I can /
                That there was pleasure there,” clearly a line that begs to be read in terms of
                alienation, extreme self-interest, as well as imaginative labor and value, as
                opposed to mere receptiveness (<title level="m">Major Works</title> 81). Rather, I am
                merely suggesting that there is, on one level, a similar commitment to disinterested
                listening involved in the theory and compositional methods of both writers, and a
                heightened attention to, almost an enthrallment with, ambience.</p>
                  <p> Hoping to materialize this for my students, I asked a small group of them to go out
                onto campus and record ambient noise with their smartphones. I then edited them
                together, trying to allow for chance procedure, in order to recreate something like
                a Cage composition—or, to put it in Wordsworthian terms, to allow us to hear a
                thousand blended notes. Here is one mix of that experiment.
                <media url="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/anthropocene/ruderman_mix3597.m4a"
                            mimeType="audio"/>
            For students, this was a useful exercise in discovering how to pay attention to
                environments and to let go of preconceived forms and ideas. That is, we allowed
                every contingent sound—the wind (it was a windy and unseasonably warm winter day), a
                ping pong game, muffled voices, the sound of a metal clasp clanging against a metal
                flagpole, and so on—to enter into and become a part of our mix. Something as
                seemingly unimportant as solitary footsteps in a corridor or laughter in the food
                court became an essential part of our recording. It was exhilarating and strange.
                Yet, we decided after classroom debate about the issue that mere aesthetic attention
                to, even occupation of, this silence is still an extremely weak form of politics.
                That is, awareness of environment, when merely aestheticized and not theorized as
                part of a larger system (i.e., capitalism, the institutional ideologies of higher
                education, etc.), and especially, when it does not lead to action, doubles back on
                itself and becomes practice of conformism, a watered-down version of care for the
                self.</p>

                  <p>What then are the political gains, if any, in attending to the activity of sound?
                Because this question contains within it an unstated assumption about an aesthetic
                education, namely that it has the power to (even minimally) effect political change,
                it must be threaded back through the relation between the individual and the
                collective, the aesthetic and the political, and systematic/symbolic violence and
                subjective or intersubjective violence as such. With this in mind, let me stipulate
                that the political dimension of silence as I understand it being theorized through
                Cage and Wordsworth is something like a container that provides the conditions and
                the imaginative space for political action.<note prev="foot" resp="editors">I am 
                    using the term “container” in one of the many senses given to it by the 
                    psychoanalytic thinker and writer W. S. Bion. Specifically, he suggests the 
                    possibility of an unsaturated container, that is, the ability to contain bits 
                    and fragments (of experience, dream, etc.) without the need to turn them into 
                    a narrative or memory (107–8).</note> That is, it hardly matters if the
                poem itself has political content. Rather, the formal and compositional strategies
                of the poem create silences that are, as Cage would say, freed from intention.
                Unlike, say, a poem that is deeply saturated with political content—for example,
                Shelley’s <title level="a">England 1819</title>—observational poems that are 
                attuned to silence (another obvious example would be <title level="a">A Slumber 
                    Did my Spirit Seal</title>) create such containing
                spaces for the reader. My question then becomes whether or not it is possible to
                hear also the otherwise unheard gears of neoliberalism and war in our own silences
                if we listen “unawares.” Wordsworth himself was increasingly insensible to the
                abstract yet brutal dimension of silence when it came to political matters; as his
                text <title level="a">The Convention of Cintra</title> makes clear, he was not only 
                in favor of war when it augured “liberty,” but also whenever it was merely 
                in the interest of the “nation.” Cage, on the other hand, a pacifist throughout his 
                life, understood that from the
                perspective of silence, war is as contingent upon the determinate and arbitrary
                flows of capital as the “thousand blended notes” are upon a fallen ash tree, the
                wind, or the tresses of ivy in the water. In other words, war forms a part of the
                symbolically violent background of our experience, and, as such, is always part and
                parcel of silence: “The world is teeming: anything can / happen . . . The telephone
                rings . . . / Each person is in the best seat . . . / War begins at any moment” 
                (<title level="m">Silence</title> 96–97).</p>
                  <p>In a recent conference seminar called <title level="a">On Worldlessness and Worklessness,</title>
                David Clark recalled Spinoza’s statement that peace is not the absence of war. This
                reverberates with Cage’s (explicit) and Wordsworth’s (implicit) claim that silence
                is not the absence of sound. In an earlier text on Kant and war, Clark has argued
                that peace is “not a respite but, quite to the contrary, [it] marks a period of
                maximal rethinking about the very nature of sociality” (69). He goes on to
                write:
                <quote>War is not only a punctual event, with a beginning and an end, but also a 
                    pervasive milieu of state-sponsored and financialized destruction that penetrates 
                    the everyday, that entangles everyone and everything in unredeemable war debts, 
                    and whose disfiguring violence extends to the far reaches of the globe. (65)</quote>
            Extrapolating from Clark’s remarks, it may be possible that if we listen to the
                activity of political “peacetime” discourse, we might hear more directly, and
                without the need for psychological explanation, the activity of war—on the working
                class, the poor, the planet, in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, etc.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Favret mines very similar territory. See also Virilio and 
                    Lotringer: “What we classically call ‘war’ is just a smokescreen for this diffused
                            phenomenon which is now neither peace nor war, which in fact abolishes
                            this kind of distinction” (31).</note> Just as all silences are
                not equal, neither are all peacetimes equal. More or less can be at stake, and the
                citizen may wonder why it feels as though the air is charged with violence.
                Wordsworth hints at this dissymmetry in the final lines of <title level="a">There Was 
                    a Boy,</title> lines that challenge the reader to name precisely what or who is 
                being mourned: nature? youth? the boy? an earlier political epoch?

            Again, as Bergson famously argues, segments of temporality, even when measured
                carefully, are not equal even to their own durations because some are so saturated
                with loss and desire. This is how I read the lines “I believe that there / A long
                half-hour together I have stood / Mute . . .” The speaker cannot determine with
                accuracy (“I <emph>believe</emph>”) how long the silent vigil goes on
                because there is simply no way to measure the durational thickness: how saturated
                are these reverberations? There is also the instability of the word “together”—to
                whom does the speaker refer? This uncertainty is attenuated when we consider that,
                in an early draft, Wordsworth used the first-person singular pronoun in the first
                verse paragraph, suggesting that the speaker was identical with the boy: “Then,
                sometimes, in that silence, while <emph>I</emph> hung / Listening . . .”
                    (<title level="m">The Prelude</title> 492, my emphasis). What we hear in peacetime
                therefore are conflictual and overlapping temporalities, so saturated with the
                “pervasive milieu of state-sponsored and financialized destruction” that personal
                and collective histories and trajectories are conflated (Clark 65). A missed call
                and the news of a war beginning half a world away consume the same amount of space
                and data on our screen.</p>
                  <p>It seems to me that these subjective and collective uncertainties (as well as their
                effects) form the core of our contemporary experience. Awareness of our own
                enmeshment within the Anthropocene intensifies as our silences become more and more
                saturated in late capitalism. Drone strikes, proxy wars, and covert operations take
                the place of open declarations of war, not to mention Clark’s assertion of our
                entanglement in the “disfiguring violence” of “unredeemable war debt” (65). Thus, if
                I were to ask the students in my environmental citizenship class (taught, remember,
                in the spring of 2016) if they thought that we, as a nation, were currently at war,
                my guess is that they would say no, or most of them would. I am tempted to say that
                this is not because they (or we) are too naïve, but rather because we are not naïve
                enough. We have not stood long enough, “mute—looking at the grave.” We have not
                learned, that is, to listen “unawares.” </p>
                  <p>In the silence that emerges from the quietness of the owls, the Winander Boy suddenly
                discovers his true condition. As though predestined, this discovery prefigures (his
                death. When read in this way the poem takes on the patina of myth (resonant with the
                ending of <title level="a">Strange Fits of Passion</title>). That is, it becomes 
                a meta-signifier, in this case reinforcing the romantic linkage between knowledge 
                and death. Perhaps what our
                current war on terror and immigration (and its liberal backlash) obscures in its own
                mythologizing hysteria is the fact that the majority of (nonimmigrant) Americans,
                including most of my students—working class and working poor—are not only entangled
                in a brutal and violent war, but, “gentle shock of mild surprise,” that they are
                also its unnamed enemy
                (<title level="m">The Prelude</title> 173).</p>

                  <head>Coda: We “May Be Depended Upon to Exist”</head>
                  <p>Wordsworth and Cage demonstrate that, when listened to through the aperture of
                silence, the terms “nature” and “music” cease to need to be anything more or less
                than their mere material components and effects. I find myself coming down on the
                side of Cage’s wholehearted embrace of this denaturing of representation, not for
                deep philosophical reasons but rather for pragmatic, political ones. Wordsworth’s
                liberal handwringing about the destruction of nature seems to feed back so easily
                into the system: as I suggest above, “what man has made of man” can easily be heard
                in the vein of a 1970s public service announcement. Interestingly, many if not most
                of my students disagree. They like the same yearning in Wordsworth that I find
                distasteful, and they find Cage’s atonal and experimental poetry and music
                unlistenable and, even more damning by their lights, unintelligible and depressing.</p>
                  <p>It may be that one of the most important reasons to continue to teach and read
                Wordsworth is not just that he often transcends his own liberal perspectives, but
                that entering into the poetry we find ourselves caught up “unawares” by our own
                liberal identifications. That is, who among us, schooled in and by Wordsworth
                whether we know it (or like it) or not, has not “lamented” the past in a pious way,
                or, “in vacant or in pensive mood,” has not looked backwards rather than dealing
                with the difficulties of the moment
                (<title level="m">Major Works</title> 81, 304)? In order to
                resist these intoxicating deflections and to remain in the instability of silence,
                that is, the instability of my own ambivalence, I’ve taken to reading the final
                lines of <title level="a">Lines Written in Early Spring</title>—“Have I not 
                reason to lament / What man has made of man?”—as more than a rhetorical 
                question. To read them in this open and
                naïve way is to leave the “thousand blended notes” open, cacophonous, unblended,
                untranslated, unlamented—and the poem itself unfinished, less sure of itself, and
                less ideologically contagious.</p>
                  <p>The conditional clauses that frame the final question take slightly different forms
                in different published versions. The version in <title level="m">Lyrical
                    Ballads</title> reads “If these my thoughts may not prevent, / If such be of my
                creed the plan, / Have I not reason . . .”
                (<title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> 66). Yet, in the 1815
                collection, interestingly grouped with <title level="a">Poems of Sentiment and 
                    Reflection,</title> the same stanza reads “If this belief from heaven be 
                sent, / If such be Nature’s holy plan, / Have I not reason . . .”
                (<title level="m">Major Works</title> 81). It is tempting to find
                expressed in this revision the tendency within the late Enlightenment to codify
                conceptualizations, to turn thinking into revelation and personal creed into holy
                writ—again, meta-signification. While this explanatory narrative makes a kind of
                sense, it seems to me that both responses (the psychological explanation of 1798 and
                the ideological concretization of 1815) are both ways to silence the silence, so to
                speak. That is, “And much it grieved my heart to think / What man has made of man,”
                the first iteration of the refrain, allows us to feel fully the violence of the
                aforementioned split between “man” and “man,” a split that calls to be read as both
                an internal rupture (that is, as a figure for modern subjectivity) and as a
                historical causal “fact” (industrial capitalism, colonialism, etc.). Therefore, when
                we focus on the repetition of the phrase in the final stanza, we should approach its
                question without judgment (do we have reason to lament? or, perhaps, is lamentation
                another form of evasion, conformism in the guise of empathy?). To resist the impulse
                to suture “man” and “man” together seems to me the more productive as well as
                ethical approach. Remember that it is the Winander Boy’s failure, his inability to
                communicate with nature, to suture subject and object, here and there, past and
                present, that opens him to this new duration, this new way of being in the world.
                Perhaps like the speaker in the poem, we will find ourselves, seemingly by accident,
                standing at numerous gravesites together—shattered subjects of the Anthropocene.</p>
                  <p>Reading in this naïve yet devastated way, attentive to the silences that arise from
                failure, we can read the end of the poem as questioning humankind’s monstrousness to
                itself, or rather, relatedly, one strata or class’s monstrousness to another
                (ironically, the only reading precluded by this approach is the reading that is so
                often proffered, namely the fear of nature “red in tooth and claw”). Furthermore,
                “what man has made of man” anticipates Bertolt Brecht’s <foreign xml:lang="de">Mann ist
                    Mann</foreign> by hinting at (demonstrating?) humankind’s inability to be equal to
                itself.</p>
                  <p>Since, as I wrote earlier, I teach at a regional campus of a large midwestern
                research university in a mostly poor and working poor area, many of my students have
                a visceral experience of this inequality. Yet more and more of them approach this
                material not as bits of cultural capital to be consumed, but rather as a life or
                death matter. Without knowing what else to do, I encourage them to treat these texts
                as signposts or road maps for negotiating the intensely difficult terrain of late
                capitalism, specifically the topography of the working-poor microculture in which
                they find themselves. Many of my students in fact are training to work in health
                care or the “criminal justice” system, taking a full load of classes while working
                full-time at service sector jobs, many of them parents themselves. For them, what
                “man has made of man” is neither a psychosocial phenomenon nor a one-time historical
                act. Rather, as Cage teaches us, it is an ongoing and contingent process. Yet while
                “anything can / happen” and “war [could begin] at any moment,” my students recognize
                that good things tend to happen much more regularly to people in the upper layers of
                the socioeconomic scale, and that the costs of bad things happening, including and
                especially war, are nearly always passed down to the working class and the poor
                (Cage, <title level="m">Silence</title> 96–97). For them, thinking about and
                theorizing silence sometimes feels like a luxury; experiencing its shocks to the
                system, on the other hand, is an inevitable fact of everyday life.</p>
                  <p> It is not necessarily that the silence is louder or more violent in early
                twenty-first-century central Ohio than it was, say, in the Lake District around
                1800. For example, the recent opioid addiction (all but forgotten in wake of the
                Covid 19 pandemic), which has ravaged parts of Ohio, West Virginia, Michigan, and
                other economically impoverished areas, mirrors in some ways the use of opium in
                nineteenth-century England. And while I am not claiming a direct cause and effect,
                the devastation created in families and the larger community (what is this if not
                slow violence?) was preceded by a loss of manufacturing jobs that has resulted in
                over 50% of the community living below the poverty line in some areas (e.g., Dayton,
                Ohio). Now, for the first time in recent history, life expectancy is trending
                downward for middle-aged working-class men in the United States, due primarily to
                the uptick in overdoses and suicide. A recent report refers to these (perhaps a bit
                pathetically) as “deaths of despair” (Case and Deaton). I believe that Cage
                and Wordsworth, albeit from vastly different political positions, call on us to
                listen to this ambient violence, to recognize its many forms, and to work
                collectively in our various communities to make its many ravages audible and
                visible. Listening and attending to silence’s all-pervasive political surround is
                not at all the same as acquiescence to the “way things [supposedly] are.” A similar
                Romantic paradox confronts us when we remember Wordsworth’s dictum: we cannot begin
                to change ourselves or the world without the “ability to observe with accuracy
                things as they are in themselves” (<title level="m">Major Works</title> 626).</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay reflects on the experience of teaching Romantic bird poetry 
                    through the lens of our current anthropogenic environmental crises. In particular, it considers 
                    how we can not only read but also <emph>hear</emph> Romantic poetry anew as an undulating 
                    constellation murmuring beneath the Anthropocene, particularly as birdsong is in the 
                    process of disappearing as climate change threatens mass avian extinction. It explores how 
                    we might attend to those bird sounds and silences in poetry by Smith, Coleridge, Keats, and 
                    Clare in light of this impending silence. I describe the lesson in detail, which begins 
                    with students giving an account of their lives among our wasted environments (on local and 
                    global levels) before moving into the Romantic past. I frame this backward pedagogical 
                    approach through the rhetorical figure of <foreign xml:lang="la">hysteron proteron</foreign> 
                    (temporal inversion). The lesson chiefly aims to cultivate a sonic sensibility, one that 
                    makes students better listening subjects attuned to sonic changes in their environments. 
                    It accomplishes this by pairing select poems about the nightingale with a contemporary 
                    digital sound sculpture that makes bird sound audible and visible. Developing a method 
                    of “close listening,” a model of acoustic intimacy that requires becoming attentive to 
                    the layers of ubiquitous sounds, I frame listening as an act of turning us outward, one 
                    that makes us more perceptually aware citizens of the Anthropocene.</p>

                  <p>“Where are we?” With this question, I
                    begin my upper-level undergraduate Romantics course at the University of New
                    Brunswick (Canada). Class answers start with the classroom and quickly slide
                    through larger conceptual containers (next the university, then city, province,
                    country), culminating in the expanses of “planet Earth” and “the twenty-first
                    century.” At this point, I invite students to consider locating themselves
                    geologically within the Anthropocene, an era wherein humans have become a
                    geological force responsible for irreparably damaging the earth.</p>
                  <p>The first week of the course is dedicated
                    to establishing a foundational understanding of the Anthropocene, the current
                    “specter” that, as J. R. McNeill suggests, “is haunting academia” (117). I
                    assign students critical readings, including excerpts from the work of Dipesh
                    Chakrabarty, Paul Crutzen, Jeremy Davies, and J. R. McNeill, to help frame the
                    discursive parameters and give a sense of the texture of this emergent field of
                    scholarship. A preliminary definition of the Anthropocene comes from Crutzen’s
                    brief article, <title level="a">Geology of Mankind</title>:<quote>
                        For the past three centuries, the effects of humans on the global environment 
                        have escalated. Because of these anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, 
                        global climate may depart significantly from natural behaviour for many 
                        millennia to come. It seems appropriate to assign the term “Anthropocene” 
                        to the present . . . human-dominated, geological epoch. . . . The Anthropocene 
                        could be said to have started in the latter part of the eighteenth century, 
                        when analyses of air trapped in polar ice showed the beginning of growing 
                        global concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane. This date also happens 
                        to coincide with James Watt’s design of the steam engine in 1784. (23)</quote>
                  </p>
                  <p>I propose one way to think about our
                    world, which is increasingly marked by anthropogenic environmental crises, is
                    that we inhabit a “wasted environment.” I mean to evoke both senses of the term
                    “waste.” First, our environment is saturated in waste (pollution, detritus, and
                    rejectamenta); second, it is an environment that itself has been wasted (missed,
                    lost, allowed to expire), in the sense of anthropogenic wasting. Wordsworth
                    evokes this second kind of waste in his poem “The world is too much with us”:
                    “The world is too much with us; late and soon, / Getting and spending, we lay
                    waste our powers” (1–2). Here, the Anthropocene is perhaps more appropriately
                    thought of as the “Anthrobscene” (to borrow Jussi Parikka’s phrase), where waste
                    becomes inextricably enmeshed with human legacy. A class discussion quickly
                    generates numerous examples of wasted environments on global and local levels. I
                    ask students to push beyond what Timothy Morton calls the “hyperobject” of
                    climate change to instead identify regional or provincial examples, of which
                    there are no shortage. Some examples generated by students include New
                    Brunswick’s atmospheric and river contamination; destructive forestry practices,
                    including the use of herbicide glyphosate spraying, a chemical used to kill
                    hardwood growth around powerlines;<note place="foot" resp="editors">The World 
                        Health Organization has classified glyphosate as a “probable carcinogenic” 
                        and California has banned its use. New Brunswick advocacy groups are calling 
                        for the end of spraying.</note> and the rapidly declining deer population, 
                as well as the increase of rare physical deformities found among deer.<note place="foot" resp="editors">According to CBC reports, New Brunswick’s deer population has 
                    decreased 70% in the past three decades (McEachern), while deer deformities have 
                    increased (Knopp). In both cases, glyphosate spraying is a suspected 
                    factor.</note> Their enthusiastic contributions to this discussion, and their 
                articulated feelings of anger, grief, and betrayal over their wasted environments, 
                make me hopeful that classrooms can be solvents against such waste.</p>
                  <p>This pedagogical work of scaling up, bursting from the microbubble (the classroom) 
                to the macrosphere (the Anthropocene), is only the first movement we make. The 
                second movement is to pull the thin film of the present into contact with the 
                Romantic past. Yet turning backward, this <foreign xml:lang="la">hysteron 
                    proteron</foreign>—the rhetorical figure of temporal inversion—is not a nostalgic 
                or corrective move.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <foreign xml:lang="la">Hysteron proteron</foreign>, meaning “latter before,” implies 
                    both a temporal inversion, putting that which is latter first, and a
                            preposterous or disordered speech. In classical rhetoric, as Richard
                            Rand notes, it is when “two terms are reversed according to the
                            sequence, the order, temporal, spatial, causal, in which you ordinarily
                            find them” (51).</note> For as Peter Sloterdijk puts it, “It is too 
                late to dream ourselves back to a place under celestial domes whose interiors 
                would permit domestic feelings of order” (28). Instead, the goal in going about 
                things backward—the inversion of past and future—is to revitalize a present 
                relationship, to hear Romantic poetry, ideas, and problematics as a frenetic, 
                undulating constellation murmuring beneath the Anthropocene.<note place="foot" resp="editors">My use of <foreign xml:lang="la">hysteron proteron</foreign> is 
                    closest to Coleridge’s use of the term in <title level="m">Biographia 
                        Literaria</title>. For him, poetry’s pleasure is to be considered first 
                    rather than lastly as an effect, an inversion that he calls “a small <foreign xml:lang="la">Hysteron-Proteron</foreign>” as “the communication of pleasure 
                    is the introductory means by which alone the poet must expect to moralize his
                    readers” (<title level="m">Biographia Literaria</title> II, 131).</note> To 
                proceed backward in this <foreign xml:lang="la">hysteron proteron</foreign> is a 
                strategy befitting the preposterous and the disorderly, one that complements the 
                name that novelist Amitav Ghosh, in his recent book on climate change, gives our 
                era: “the time of the Great Derangement” (11).</p>
                  <p>In what follows, I describe one lesson that
                    attempts to amplify the murmuring of what we might call the Romantic
                    Anthropocene. The lesson focuses on birdsong—a ubiquitous sound that often
                    disappears into the layers of our everyday sonic environment. Yet more than
                    that, birdsong is also a sound that is disappearing in a different way, that is,
                    as a result of anthropogenic environmental destruction. The “silent spring”
                    proposed by Rachel Carson in 1962 has given way to a more profound silence
                    where, in Keats’ words, “no birds sing,” as we face the most widespread loss of
                    birdsong human have ever experienced as a result of climate change. Indeed,
                    climate change is now the primary threat to mass avian extinction.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a sustained examination of avian extinction, see Thom 
                        van Dooren’s <title level="m">Flight Ways</title>, which focuses on five 
                        different groups of endangered birds. Dooren explores important ethical 
                        questions (“What does it mean to care for a disappearing species? What 
                        obligations do we have to hold open space in the world for other living 
                        beings?”) but does not consider bird sound or the ethics of listening 
                        (5).</note> According to Audubon’s <title level="m">Bird and Climate Change 
                            Report</title>, published in 2014, rising temperatures threaten to
                    reduce 314 species of North American birds by over half their current ranges 
                    by 2080.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See also Gary Langham et al., 
                        <title level="a">Conservation Status of North American Birds in the Face 
                            of Future Climate Change.</title>
                     </note> As one of the world’s leading 
                evolutionary biologists, Anders Pape Møller, reports, climatic conditions affect 
                bird vocalization; warmer temperatures and increased humidity and precipitation 
                alter the vegetation or “song posts” from which birds typically sing. How do we 
                respond to this? How do we hear this impending loss of sound if bird sounds are 
                already ubiquitous, if they have already, at least in some senses, disappeared—if 
                silence is already sprung?</p>
                  <p>Part of the challenge, I tell my students, is to make these sounds audible again, 
                to bring them back to the summer of their full-throated ease (to riff on Keats). 
                This, I believe, is the first step toward making these sounds meaningful. 
                Indeed, my objective in teaching these poems is twofold: first, to cultivate 
                in students a sonic sensibility, one that makes them better listening subjects 
                attuned to sonic changes in their environments, and second, to extend the 
                vocalization range of Romantic bird poetry. The best-known Romantic bird poems, 
                such as Keats’s <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title> and Shelley’s <title level="a">To a Sky-lark,</title> are often read as metaphors for the work of 
                poetry itself, with the bird inevitably becoming a figure for the poet, poetry, 
                or other “flights” of imagination. To step away from these rich yet well-worn 
                readings and find new lines of flight requires a “shock to thought,” to borrow 
                a phrase by Brian Massumi.</p>
                  <p>My students are slightly surprised when asked to briefly step away from the text, 
                comfortable as they are, as upper-level undergraduate students of literature, 
                with the business of close reading. But where does reading happen in the body? 
                Where, beyond the brain, is the “somatic locus,” as Garrett Stewart puts it, 
                for this silent activity of reading (238)? It is also “the organs of vocal 
                production, from diaphragm up through throat to tongue and palate” (1). This 
                “silent reading,” as Stewart calls it, “locates itself . . . in the conjoint 
                cerebral activity and suppressed muscular action of a simultaneously summoned 
                and silenced enunciation” (1). After a discussion over the complimentary nature 
                of reading and listening—a discussion supplemented by Geoffrey Hartman’s chapter 
                in <title level="m">Saving the Text</title>, where he challenges Derrida’s conflation of
                    logocentrism and phonocentrism, and Jean-Luc Nancy’s phenomenological reflection
                    on the act of listening—we discuss the stakes of this pedagogical experiment in
                    what we might call “close listening.”</p>
                  <p>Close listening means to be attentive to the
                    various layers of sound—layers made visible (as I will describe in detail
                    below)—which, in turn, models an acoustic intimacy that we can transpose to the
                    poems in order to attend with greater perception to those minimal sounds or
                    other minor elements that might otherwise fade away. In a feedback loop, this
                    process also transforms readers into better listeners—that is, better listening
                    subjects that pay greater attention to those ubiquitous sounds, those metonyms
                    for the unsaid or silences within discourse.</p>
                  <p>Why does listening matter, not only in terms
                    of our engagement with Romantic poetry but also with our lives within the
                    Anthropocene? Ultimately, listening may cultivate within us a heightened sonic
                    sensibility, a better perception or attunement with the world, which, one hopes,
                    will translate into acting. The effect of a “sharpened sense of perception,” as
                    sound theorist Michel Chion writes, is world changing:<quote>
                        The information that we receive and which is the matter with which we 
                        fashion our opinions and thoughts is richer and more diversified. Is what is 
                        at stake with a trained perception to lift the veil of illusion and to see 
                        reality behind the appearances? Not so much as that, but simply to become 
                        aware of our “perceiving body” and to restate it, more vigilant and more 
                        active, in that ocean of messages in which it is tossed. (241)</quote>
                While Chion suggests that language oftentimes “scotomizes” or darkens our access to 
                sound, I suggest that poetry which directly engages with sound—that sounds sound, as 
                it were—invites us to hear again. But what are we listening to, and what are we 
                listening for?</p>
                  <p>This lesson brings together Romantic bird
                    poetry—selections by Charlotte Smith, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, and
                    John Clare—and contemporary digital sound art by Australian multimedia artist
                    Andy Thomas. For this particular lesson I select poems that focus on the
                    nightingale, poetry’s long-prized bird in a history that begins with the ancient
                    Greeks and Romans (Homer, Simon, and Ovid), extends through Milton, and
                    culminates in the Romantics. When we look at the etymology of the nightingale,
                    students are surprised to find the same word for nightingale in ancient Greek
                    (αηδών) already being used metaphorically for songstress, poet, and
                    poetry.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Jeni Williams makes a similar point 
                        in <title level="m">Interpreting Nightingales: Gender, Class and 
                            Histories</title> but does not attend to the metaphorical usage (20). 
                        See instead the detailed entry for αηδών (“nightingale”) in Liddell and 
                        Scott’s <title level="m">A Greek-English Lexicon</title>
                     </note> This helps 
                us think about how this association itself becomes a sustained note heard throughout 
                generations of poetry. What, I ask them, might it mean if this becomes the only way 
                we encounter this bird? Does avian extinction affect how we feel about the legacy 
                of this etymology, of the work of this metaphor?</p>
                  <p>In 2013, as part of the Europeana Creative project, Thomas produced a digital sound 
                sculpture out of two bird sounds (see Figure 1). <title level="m">Nightingale and 
                    Canary</title>, the video of the two audio lifeforms, was created using
                    3D software and sound recordings of these titular birds from the archives of the
                    Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision. The brief video—less than three
                    minutes in length—is a mesmerizing, colorful display of abstract forms that
                    react to sound. As we listen to the first sound of the nightingale, abstract
                    audio lifeforms flicker and flash before our eyes. Variegated textures of thick
                    tendrils, tight folds, and loose cloudy vapors all pop and fade in rich greens,
                    purples, browns, and pinks. Sidestepping here a technical discussion of the
                    project’s digital production,<note place="end" resp="editors">Thomas’s <title level="m">Nightingale and Canary</title> reuses archived sounds and runs 
                        them through various computer-generated 3D imaging software. Thomas 
                        discusses his process and the software used: “I start by listening to the 
                        sound carefully, going for a walk, and concentrating on the sound, then I 
                        do some sketches, and search the Internet for inspiration, nature related 
                        inspiration, such as flowers and insects, whatever I feel suits the sound 
                        vision that I see in my imagination. Then I experiment with forms in my 3D 
                        software to try to emulate these visions. I take the waveform of the sound, 
                        run it into 3Ds Max and activate simple geometry with the audio float 
                        controller then use the geometry as either an emitter or a surface 
                        constraint. Then I use a variety of different particle effects: FumeFX, 
                        KRAKATOA, RealFlow, Phoenix FD, and I especially like the XSI ICE system. 
                        Finally, I render with Vray” (qtd. in Komen).</note> it suffices to note 
                that Thomas’s sound sculpture also incorporates the color of plumage and natural 
                environments of the birds (Thomas <title level="a">Visualizing the Sound</title>). 
                This detail, included in the sonic design, points to those inaudible forms within 
                the larger acoustic ecology. <title level="m">Nightingale and Canary</title> features 
                gorgeous abstract forms that twit and twitter, making visible the different layers, 
                registers, intensities, and speeds of bird sound.</p>

                  <p>We typically know it when we hear it, but what
                    exactly is bird sound or birdsong? A quick gloss and brief anatomical lesson
                    serves my students and I well here: birdsong consists of “brief vocalizations
                    separated by pauses” called syllables; according to a recent scientific study,
                    “In many cases, a bird can produce these vocalizations very rapidly, several per
                    second. In these cases, the pauses are so brief that the song appears to be a
                    continuous succession of sounds” (Mindlin and Laje 13). Romantic science was
                    also interested in understanding birdsong. Surgeon and anatomist John Hunter,
                    who dissected many songbirds at the request of Daines Barrington, determined
                    strong larynx muscles to be linked to those birds with the loudest voice, and
                    found the strongest in the nightingale (Barrington 262).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Daines Barrington (judge, antiquary, and naturalist) 
                        founded <title level="j">The Naturalist’s Journal</title> in 1767, and was 
                        (along with Thomas Pennant) the real-life correspondent to Gilbert White’s 
                        <title level="m">Natural History of Selborne</title> (1789). Barrington’s 
                        essay on birdsong first appeared in the <title level="j">Philosophical 
                            Transactions</title>and was included in the third volume of 
                        Pennant’s <title level="m">British Zoology</title> (Oxford Dictionary of 
                        National Biography). Barrington offers a more lyrical definition of 
                        birdsong: “a succession of three or more different notes, which are 
                        continued without interruption during the same interval with a musical 
                        bar of four crotchets in an adagio movement, or whilst a pendulum swings 
                        four seconds” (252).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The abstract forms that we see in <title level="m">Nightingale and Canary</title> 
                illustrate the highly controlled syringeal muscles used for vocalization in birds, 
                each vocalization appearing as an emerging visualization. Simultaneously listening 
                and seeing this visualized sound enables us to better identify the different parts 
                and textures of the vocalization. Paradoxically, this digital sound sculpture 
                enables us to think about questions of legibility, of how we can “read” our animal 
                others, and hence merges ethology with sound art and poetry. To work from an 
                ethological perspective, as Parikka puts it in <title level="m">Insect 
                    Media</title>, is to “evaluate bodies not according to their innate, 
                morphological essences but as expressions of certain movements, sensations, and 
                interactions with their environments” (xxv). Thomas’s dynamic audio lifeforms 
                call our attention back to the voice, rendering us more attentive listeners.</p>
                  <p>There is good reason to be called back to sound, particularly when thinking about 
                the voice of the animal. As Tobias Menely compellingly argues in <title level="m">The Animal Claim</title>, “To recover the face of the vocal 
                imperative—its capacity to intervene or interpose, its availability to redirection 
                or remediation—is to understand community not as a closed system of reciprocal 
                entitlements, but as something constitutively open to those whose voices lay 
                claim to rights not yet recognized” (1). Following the long association between 
                the poet and the animal voice—recalling Virgil’s Orpheus who sings for the 
                animals—Menely offers that what is unique to the eighteenth-century poets of 
                sensibility (Pope, Thomson, Smart, and Cowper) is an amplified attentiveness to 
                the animal, of speaking for animals. Advocacy, he reminds us, is etymologically 
                linked to the Latin <foreign xml:lang="la">vocare</foreign>, “to call” (1). While 
                birdsong is not a voice heard in Menely’s text, we should consider what this 
                voice and advocacy means for thinking about entangled environments and shared 
                soundscapes with those that do not hold “companion species” status.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Companion species is Donna Haraway’s term to describe those 
                    animals we have domesticated and brought close to ourselves, such as 
                    dogs.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I begin by having the class listen with their eyes closed as I play Thomas’s 
                <title level="m">Nightingale and Canary</title> with the projector screen turned 
                off. We then have a brief discussion about what we have heard. Students generally 
                struggle to describe the bird sounds. This, I reassure them, is to be expected. 
                For while we know what close reading involves, what are the tools of close 
                listening? Next, I play the video of <title level="m">Nightingale and 
                    Canary</title> with the screen on, and ask the class to both watch and
                    listen. We have another lively discussion after the video finishes about what
                    they have heard and watched, and what they find striking about the video. Some
                    students note that the video gives the bird sounds a language, and that they
                    could hear the sound better, able to identify in more detail because of the
                    visualization. Of course, Thomas’s audio forms are not the first visualization
                    of bird sound, and we next look at earlier spectrogram images—images that record
                    sound intensity and variations over time—of these birdsongs.<note place="foot" resp="editors">I also note in class that those who are especially interested 
                        in the visualization of these sounds may download apps such as SpectrumView, 
                        a real-time spectrogram. A future project might explore what reading a bird 
                        poem, such as Clare’s <title level="a">The Progress of Ryhme,</title> would 
                        look like on a spectrogram.</note> Another brief discussion ensues as we 
                consider the formal and affective differences between these two visualization models. 
                Students are eager to explore and share their personal responses to the models, and 
                overwhelmingly prefer the dynamism of Thomas’s audio lifeforms.</p>
                  <p>Next, I ask students to keep in mind this experience, this feeling they have had with 
                the bird sound becoming visible—and, as a result, heard with new ears—and ask them 
                to bring it with them as we approach our Romantic bird poems. For here, we are also 
                invited to experience bird sound with a similar feeling of acute fascination. Indeed, 
                the goal is to transport the affect of this audio-visual experience with the audio 
                lifeforms into one we have with the Romantic bird poem. This technique, 
                another <foreign xml:lang="la">hysteron proteron</foreign>, primes the class to be 
                    able to experience such affect in relation to the sound of the animal, a figure 
                    that twit-twits and chew-chews in the background of their lives.</p>
                  <p>After such audio-visual priming, I then prepare the class for reading the Romantic 
                bird poems (Smith, Coleridge, Keats, and Clare) by briefly recalling the Philomela 
                myth and the longer traditions of associating poets with birds, and birds with the 
                beautiful. Aristophanes, Ovid, Petrarch, Shakespeare, and Milton are all key figures 
                in this history. However, the greatest contextualizing comes by outlining how the 
                bird participates in the discourse of Romantic aesthetics, serving as a recurrent 
                figure for the beautiful in Edmund Burke’s <title level="m">A Philosophical Enquiry 
                    into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful</title> (1757)—a 
                text we study earlier in the term. Burke’s text formatively shapes our 
                contextualization of the poems to come. A brief rehearsal with the class of the 
                aesthetic concept of the beautiful (as distinct from the sublime) is productive, 
                as it helps to sharpen the stakes of the beautiful: “There is a wide difference 
                between admiration and love. The sublime, which is the cause of the former, always 
                dwells on great objects, and terrible; the latter on small ones, and pleasing; we 
                submit to what we admire, <emph>but we love what submits to us</emph>” (103, 
                emphasis mine). The takeaway point of Burke’s aesthetics, I stress, is how this 
                constellation of fragility, beauty, love, and submission remains a problematic, 
                tangled cluster of ideas for us today living in wasted environments. Some 
                questions that we explore include: In what ways is aesthetics tangled with an 
                ethics of ecological care? What is the role of aesthetics, and specifically the 
                beautiful, in shaping our responses to our various eco-disasters? And what kind 
                of space might that leave for ugliness? Toggling back to Thomas’s <title level="m">Nightingale and Canary</title>, how does Burke’s theory of the 
                beautiful dovetail with what we might find affecting and problematic in the 
                abstract audio lifeforms? In <title level="m">A Philosophical Enquiry</title>, 
                Burke provides a lengthy analysis of the beauty of the
                    dove, beautiful for the serpentine line of beauty, smoothness, and pleasing
                    variations in plumage: “it agrees very well with most of the conditions of
                    beauty. It is smooth and downy; its parts are (to use that expression) melted
                    into one another; you are presented with no sudden protuberance through the
                    whole, and yet the whole is continually changing” (104). Students are quick to
                    point out the ease with which Burke slides from the beautiful bird to the
                    beautiful woman, celebrating both on similar grounds, which serves as an
                    effective transition into poetry’s similar gendering of the nightingale. At 
                    this point, we discuss the intersection of eighteenth-century aesthetics, 
                    natural history, gender, and poetic representations of the nightingale as 
                    female (cf. Milton’s <title level="m">Il Penseroso</title> and Thomson’s <title level="m">Spring</title>).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Next 
                            time I teach this, I will discuss at greater length the growing 
                            counterpressure of natural history at this juncture, as 
                            eighteenth-century ornithological knowledge, contra a certain 
                            poetic tradition, comes to identify the male nightingale as the 
                            one who sings. See, for example, Daines Barrington’s <title level="a">Experiments and Observations on the Singing of 
                                Birds</title> (1773) and Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de 
                            Buffon’s <title level="m">The Natural History of Birds</title> 
                            (1770–83). For an overview of this see Bethan Roberts’s <title level="a">The Nightingale in the Poetry and Science of the 
                                Long Eighteenth Century.</title>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Subsequently, we turn to a close reading of the poems that treat in detail not 
                only the figure of the bird, but particularly its sound. Proceeding chronologically, 
                we begin with selections from Charlotte Smith’s <title level="m">Elegiac 
                    Sonnets</title> (1784). Sonnet III (<title level="a">To a Nightingale</title>), 
                gesturing to Petrarch, addresses the “poor melancholy bird” (1). This poem 
                foregrounds the speaker’s work as a poet, as one of “translating” the bird’s 
                voice in her work. In Sonnet VII (<title level="a">On the Departure of the 
                    Nightingale</title>), the speaker translates something of the poetic identity 
                back to the bird, here apostrophizing it as “Sweet poet of the woods,” and 
                making numerous allusions to the poetry of Shakespeare and Milton. We hear 
                nothing of what the song actually sounds like, as Smith’s sonnets immediately 
                sublimate the sound into an abstraction, a metaphor for “the soft voice of young 
                and timid Love” and “Hope’s dear voice” (Sonnet LV, <title level="a">The Return 
                    of the Nightingale,</title> 7, 14). In Smith’s sonnets the bird consistently 
                functions as a figure for poetic identity. This trope continues in 
                Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence of Poetry</title> (1821) that portrays the

                  </p>
                  <p>We next turn to Coleridge, a poet enormously influenced by Smith. However, 
                Coleridge, contra Smith, directly challenges the poetic tradition of associating 
                the bird with melancholy in his conversational poem <title level="m">The 
                    Nightingale,</title> published in <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> 
                (1798): “A melancholy bird! Oh! idle thought! / In nature there is nothing 
                melancholy” (14–15). Coleridge’s poem differs from Smith’s bird poems with its 
                attention to the estrangement between the material reality of the bird—a 
                reality that impresses itself through its joyful sound—and its poeticized 
                identity. Coleridge chastises the listener who projects his own negative 
                memories or feelings onto the bird, he who fills “all things with himself, 
                / And made all gentle sounds tell back the tale / Of his own sorrow” (19–21). 
                Poets, Coleridge charges, reify this association, echoing the emotional 
                projections of some first sullen human rather than the bird’s actual sounds. 
                Thus the central problem in this poetic economy is a hearing loss, as it 
                were, a restricted economy of sound that operates without carefully listening 
                to the bird itself. The solution, as the poem offers, is a model of close 
                listening. Far better for the poet would be an attentiveness to “the 
                influxes / Of shapes and sounds and shifting elements / Surrendering his 
                whole spirit, of his song” (27–29).</p>
                  <p>The voice of Coleridge’s nightingale “crowds,
                    and hurries, and precipitates / With fast thick warble his delicious notes”
                    (44–45). Shifting from the individual vocalization in the second stanza, the
                    poem’s third stanza offers us a dense acoustic ecology of what a wild grove
                    teeming with nightingales sounds like:<quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                           <l>But never elsewhere in one place I knew</l>

                           <l>In wood and thicket, over the wide grove,</l>

                           <l>And one low piping sound more sweet than all—</l>

            Sampling the nightingales’ bioacoustics—the
                    sounds birds make to communicate with one another—the poem finds avian answers
                    and provocations without pressing for a human understanding, without speculating
                    on what they are saying. Nevertheless, despite this not-knowing, the collective
                    power of their voices is illuminating (night becomes day), again part of
                    Coleridge’s efforts here to redirect the sound of the nightingale away from its
                    entrenched melancholic association. When asked what the stakes are of this poem,
                    and why Coleridge might want to shift these melancholic associations away from
                    the bird, some students provocatively suggested it could be an ethical move. One
                    student explained how attributing certain qualities, like “dangerous,” to
                    animals can lead to their demise, such as in the case of sharks. We first decide
                    that an animal is dangerous, and then we act as if we naturally find this animal
                    dangerous; humans conveniently forget their own role in shaping how we see the
                    world. So, I asked my class, is Coleridge trying to save the nightingale? In
                    some senses, yes, they answered. Another student insightfully suggested that it
                    was an effort to see past entrenched stereotypes, a comment on the importance of
                    being able to see or hear something in a new light.</p>
                  <p>Next, students nestle Keats’s <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title> between 
                the tradition of associating the bird with melancholy (Smith) and those inclined 
                toward ornithological observation (Coleridge). Keats’s ode positions the 
                nightingale’s voice as a <foreign xml:lang="grc">pharmakon</foreign>,
                    as both poison and cure. The speaker, “being too happy in thine [the bird’s]
                    happiness” (6), describes in the first stanza the feeling of a “drowsy numbness”
                    that “pains / My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk” (1–2). This pleasure
                    that is also a pain comes from listening to the bird’s song that “Singest of
                    summer in full-throated ease” (10). If the birdsong is not initially
                    melancholic, and here Keats is like Coleridge, its song gradually comes to be
                    framed in these terms as the poem unfolds, later described as a “high requiem”
                    and “plaintive anthem” (60, 75). We consider this shift throughout the poem as a
                    formal indicator of the way that human pressures, especially emotional and
                    psychological ones, redress this sound. One student noted that it was as if
                    Keats (like Coleridge) knew he shouldn’t associate the nightingale with
                    melancholy, but then ultimately gives in and does. What might contribute to this
                    melancholic indulgence, to this “giving in”? I direct students to stanza six,
                    which ruminates on the openness of the birdsong throughout human history. Here,
                    the speaker imagines the birdsong he hears to be the same one that “found a path
                    / Through the sad heart of Ruth” (65–66) and “The same that oft-times hath /
                    Charm’d magic casements, opening on the foam / Of perilous seas, in faery lands
                    forlorn” (68–70). The sound, students suggest, is a way of establishing a
                    connection back to the beginning of time; the speaker is motivated to treat the
                    sound this way perhaps because he is lonely. After all, they note, we don’t
                    encounter any other sounds (of, say, human companions) in the poem. Like the
                    illuminating power that Coleridge ascribes to the nightingale’s sound, Keats’s
                    poem imagines this sound’s affective power, unlocking hearts and casements
                    alike. Like the dynamic sound of the nightingale that was championed in
                    Coleridge’s poem and richly visualized and heard in Thomas’s audio lifeforms,
                    Keats’s poem cannot fix the sound to one melody or concept (contra Smith).</p>
                  <p>The final poet we study in this lesson is John
                Clare, beginning with <title level="a">The Nightingales Nest,</title> a poem that 
                immediately calls for quiet: “lets softly rove / And list the nightingale—she 
                dwelleth here / Hush let the wood gate softly clap” (1–3). With the invitation to 
                listen and to follow, readers travel “through matted thorns” (13) to nestle down 
                and watch the nightingale as it sings:<quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                           <l>Her wings would tremble in her extacy</l>
                           <l>And feathers stand on end as twere with joy</l>
                           <l>And mouth wide open to release her heart</l>
                           <l>Of its out sobbing songs—the happiest part</l>
                           <l>Of summers fame she shared (22–26)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote>
            Students admitted to being the least interested in this poem. Clare’s language was 
            estranging to some, and unnerving to at least one student who felt the poem strangely 
            sexualized the bird through its descriptions, pointing out key words: the singing 
            bird as “trembling” in “ecstasy” with a wide-open mouth. Is this, I asked, a bird 
            orgasm? Students laughed and blushed. (Things you never thought you’d say in the 
            classroom). Inviting serious discussion on this latter point, I asked students to 
            think about the rhetorical strategy of this representation. It makes Clare, lurking 
            in the bush, look “super creepy” (their words), but if we apply this thinking more 
            broadly to humanity, it becomes a critique of the act of looking. Is looking a kind 
            of touching? Is there not a kind of voyeurism operating in this poem? And what ways 
            does this looking become a kind of bad touching? I asked students to pause in 
            answering that last question, as we moved past Clare’s unique attention to the 
            physiological features of the singing bird, and turned to the poem’s next object 
            choice: the nest itself, an object overlooked in the other studied poems. I invited 
            students to describe the nest. They were underwhelmed by its description, almost 
            disappointed to find that the nest appears to be haphazardly constructed with loose 
            materials, dead leaves, and scraps of grass. The flowers surrounding the nest itself, 
            one student noted, are prettier than the nest. Another student remarked that one 
            doesn’t typically find an ugly or mediocre object as the focus of a poem. Another 
            student called attention to the way that the nest itself doesn’t seem to be special, 
            but Clare transforms it by including it in the poem, and thus makes it 
            special. <emph>What kind of nest are you looking for?</emph> I handed out scrap 
                paper and asked my students to draw me a nest. What became apparent is how the 
                students envision the Ideal Nest, a round, tightly woven structure, some with 
                perfectly shaped eggs nestled at the bottom. We circulated the drawings while 
                talking about what it means, then, to encounter a nest that doesn’t fit with 
                their idealizations. Suddenly, students found the poem to be asking us to 
                attend to differences and to that which defies our expectations. Suddenly, 
                Clare isn’t such a dirty bird.</p>
                  <p>Having moved from the bird’s physiology to its nest, I next draw my students’ 
                attention to the changes in bird sound as humans approach the nest:<quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">

                           <l>That might betray her home so even now</l>
                           <l>Well leave it as we found it—safetys guard</l>
                           <l>Of pathless solitude shall keep it still (59–63)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote>
                Between the close attention to the bird’s shift in vocalization and the nest 
                itself, Clare’s poem now offers us a glimpse into human interference, that is, 
                the silences that are the result of the human listening subject. I 
                stress <emph>human</emph> listening subject here because the poem also frames 
                the bird’s environment itself (“a wilderness of listening leaves” [32]) as a 
                listening subject. The poem explores the idea that while humans are not the 
                only listening subjects, they are the only ones that are disruptive: the “rude 
                boys” and the speaker himself are the only ones in the poem that make the bird 
                mute.</p>
                  <p>In the poem’s final stanza, the speaker
                    promises the bird that “We will not plunder music of its dower / Nor turn this
                    spot of happiness to thrall” (69–70). Here, we pause over the promises humanity
                    makes to animals and the environment. How are such promises to “leave them still
                    unknown to wrong” (92) perhaps compromised by the speaker’s desire to see what
                    he hears, to pursue the nightingale to her hiding places? While we might
                    recognize the speaker’s desire for minimal interference, in what ways might we
                    be skeptical of this possibility? In short: do we believe our speaker? This
                    question made for a lively discussion. Some students insisted that we should not
                    believe the speaker because he has already tracked and followed her down this
                    far, and has already crossed a line he shouldn’t have. Others cautiously offered
                    a more optimistic reading: that we should trust him precisely because he has
                    come this far and then turns away, and has caused no real harm to the bird.
                    Other students responded, in turn, by noting that the speaker has caused
                    distress to the bird just by coming close to the nest, evident in her being
                    described as “choking fear.” What if human looking always brings with it some
                    kind of violence? What if looking is a kind of fetishizing or sexualizing that
                    becomes a plundering? I leave these questions unanswered as a way to segue into
                    our final poem.</p>
                  <p>While the human-caused silence of birds is a
                    repeated concern throughout Clare’s poetry, I conclude the lesson with one last
                    poem, the short “Birds in Alarm,” which consists of ornithological observations
                    of the different threat responses of birds. The poem catalogues the silence of
                    the yellow hammer, nightingale, and pewet when their nests are found alongside
                    the wrens’ “chitter loud” and the robins’ “hollow tut” (13, 14). The poem
                    extends similar concerns as “The Nightingales Nest” and helps build an
                    additional dimension into Clare’s sensibility, his interest in bird sound and
                    the conditions of silence. This, I offer, textures Clare’s sensibility, his
                    self-described approach in his natural history letters to “looking” with a
                    “poetic feeling” at the environment:<quote>
                        I love to look on nature with a poetic feeling which magnifys the pleasure 
                        I love to see the nightingale in its hazel retreat &amp; the cuckoo hiding 
                        in its solitudes of oaken foliage &amp; not to examine their carcasses in 
                        glass cases yet naturalists &amp; botanists seem to have no taste for this 
                        poetical feeling they merely make collections of dryd specimens classing 
                        them after Leanius into tribes &amp; familys. (<title level="m">The Natural 
                            History Prose Writings</title> 38)</quote>
                We discuss what Clare means by looking with a poetic feeling. To look with a poetic 
                feeling, as Clare puts it, is not to imagine nature as pristine or untouched. It is 
                to take pleasure in animals alive and in their habitats, to put them under the 
                magnifying power of poetry rather than look at them as classified “carcasses in 
                glass cases.” Students suggested that it is a way of capturing the life or vitality 
                of the animal, as opposed to the lifeless, stuffed specimen that one could encounter 
                in a museum. What Clare is talking about, another student noted, is a different 
                experience: of engaging with an animal alive versus dead. One of the experiential 
                differences between the animal alive or dead is a dimension we often overlook: its 
                sound. For Clare, sound and our attention to it by listening is key to being able to 
                look with a poetic feeling. As Stephanie Kuduk Weiner notes, Clare celebrates 
                “listening as a means of making sense of the world” (382). In considering the 
                activity of listening as a way of engaging with and making sense of the world around 
                us, my students and I come away from our reading of Clare with a heightened sense 
                for the benefits (the magnified pleasures) of listening to the world around us. 
                Could listening be a solution to the trouble with looking? This is a bigger 
                question, one that kicks us out of the cozy nest that we’ve created for ourselves 
                with these Romantic bird poems, and back out into the hot, carbon-filled atmosphere 
                of the Anthropocene.</p>
                  <p>To approach Romantic bird poetry with such a
                    poetic feeling, as I understand Clare’s phrase to mean, demands our
                    participation in the soundscape; this is what my overlaying of these poems by
                    Smith, Coleridge, Keats, and Clare with Andy Thomas’s digital sound sculpture
                    attempts. Attending to the “dust of the lark that Shelley heard” means more than
                    searching for a “little ball of feather and bone,” to borrow the words of Thomas
                    Hardy (<title level="a">Shelley’s Skylark</title>). It is to think and listen for that which otherwise
                    wastes away. For these poems call us to be attuned, to be listening, which, as
                    Jean-Luc Nancy puts it, means “to be straining toward a possible meaning, and
                    consequently one that is not immediately accessible” (6). Listening is different
                    from hearing, as hearing “is to understand the sense . . . to understand at
                    least the rough outline of a situation” (6). To hear something is to recognize
                    already and thus partially understand the source or message. To listen is rather
                    the act of being open to the unknown, to be unsure of the source or message. As
                    part of our closing discussion and reflection on the week spent on these poems,
                    I confess that while I hope my students have heard me and one another and that
                    they have at least roughly understood our discussions, I would be happiest if
                    what they took from our discussions was an enhanced commitment to listening in
                    their lives beyond the classroom.</p>
                  <p>The pedagogical payoff of learning to listen
                    in the Anthropocene is substantial and undoubtedly exceeds the parameters of the
                    Romantic classroom. It is a defiant gesture against the anthropocentric work of
                    letting go in the way it actively opens up subjects to the more than
                    human.<note place="foot" resp="editors">I am gesturing here to Roy Scranton’s 
                        work in <title level="m">Learning to Die in the Anthropocene</title>, which 
                        makes the case for the importance of letting go: “learning to let go of the 
                        ego, the idea of the self, the future, certainty, attachment, the pursuit of 
                        pleasure, permanence, and stability. Learning to let go of salvation. 
                        Learning to let go of hope. Learning to let go of death” (92).</note> What 
                might have happened if Orpheus had only listened to Eurydice’s footsteps instead of 
                turning around to see her? Listening turns us outward, an act worth taking—especially 
                when it is toward a wasted environment.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Listening is 
                    also one of the “arts of noticing” that Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing identifies as a tool 
                    for survival in the Anthropocene. See chapter 1 in <title level="m">The Mushroom 
                        at the End of the World</title>.</note> As I tell my students, to be 
                listening is “a straining toward”; it opens us to the unknown, the sonorous, an act 
                that places us “on the
                    edge of meaning” rather than within understanding or meaning itself (Nancy 9,
                    7). This heightened sense of perception, in turn, makes us more aware of
                    perceptual bodies, both our own and of nonhuman others. Listening is not only a
                    way of “looking” with a “poetic feeling” in Clare’s sense, but is also one
                    strategy in the cultivation of an ethics of care for all that will be
                    wasted.</p>
                  <p>To listen is to be attentive to that which is
                    elusive and unfamiliar. Moreover, when listening is also synesthetic, as in the
                    case of the sound sculptures used in class, these bring the additional benefit
                    of exposing “us to stimuli that may stress and strain the ‘structures’ of
                    sensory apprehension we have developed to organize sound, sight, and touch into
                    meaning” (Heard 58). To break us out of the habitual ways of making sense of the
                    world is one way to rethink our ways of being in the Anthropocene.</p>
                  <p>Listening, as Salomé Voegelin notes, “produces
                    me as a dynamic subjectivity intertwined with the dynamic things . . . The sonic
                    self finds the collective from his solitary agency of listening through his body
                    rather than through language” (94). As I try to stress to my students, listening
                    is a form of acting. To actively cultivate listening students is to prepare them
                    for greater civic and public engagement with the world, waste and all. In
                    sharpening their perceptions by calling attention to sound, and particularly
                    sounds that are wasting away, we create a new relation to the world by inviting
                    them to become more self-aware of the ways they are perceptible bodies, not just
                    reading and writing machines (which they often feel like in the thick of the
                    semester). If students learn to become, in the words of Chion, “more vigilant
                    and more active” (241) in the space of the classroom through lessons like this
                    one, the hope is that they will become more creative thinkers and problem
                    solvers, more active, perceptually aware citizens out in the community who will
                    be committed to, in Donna Haraway’s words, “staying with the trouble,” or
                    working with and through the waste.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay takes two experimental forms, both of which
                    are meant to exemplify what I call “hyper-jump pedagogy.” The first form tracks
                    backward, reading sex and gender in the work of Lucy Corin’s <title level="m">One
                        Hundred Apocalypses</title>, <title level="m">Mad Max: Fury Road</title>,
                    and Cormac McCarthy’s <title level="m">The Road</title> to where
                    the course began, the works of Mary Wollstonecraft and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, before
                    lurching forward to <title level="m">Wall-E</title>, where the course ended. The
                    second essay form uses the <title level="m">Romantic Circles Pedagogy Commons</title> Drupal
                    platform to generate a random version of the essay with paragraphs disarranged. Both
                    forms demonstrate how temporality in the Anthropocene disorients and defamiliarizes
                    our beliefs about our place in relation to time. This disorientation and
                    defamiliarization leads to a reconsideration of reproduction as it relates to sex,
                    gender, and the family.</p>

                Romanticism in the Anthropocene?<note place="foot" resp="editors">My thanks to the Francis 
                    Marion University Honors Program and its director, Dr. Jon Tuttle, for green-lighting 
                    this class. I also wish to think the 12 students who made the course a joy to teach
                            with their vibrant, boundless curiosity and intelligence. This essay, in
                            so many ways, would not exist without them.</note> As we have
                seen, postapocalyptic Romanticism makes claims on us about human reproduction and
                species extinction, the former often the forbearer of the latter, oddly, since
                repeopling leads to warfare that extinguishes humanity in Byron’s poem and other
                texts in this genre. Wollstonecraft, meanwhile, wants us to erase gender inequality
                in order to achieve social equality but to do so in ways that proliferate ever-novel
                iterations of sexual and moral love, both harbingers and enablers of more humans. In
                the end, we postulated that perhaps the only way for such perpetuation to occur is
                by thinking crosswise about extinction: human extinction necessarily precedes human
                reproduction. Only once we accept that we have no future might there be a future,
                one worth fighting for rather than against, one worth us all being
                post-Apocalyptasauri about. Perhaps the present must be a barren blooming of the
                future if the future keeps demanding more time to have less sex, less pleasure, and
                instead more pleasureless reproduction. Perhaps Wall-E and EVE (the name not for
                nothing a call-back to the biblical paradise’s Eve) are right in needing sexual and
                moral love to “raise” a plant not of their own robotic nonreproducing loins,
                exampling a jointure whose sexual tumescence is undescribable, a weird type of
                reproduction that is not human but a model for post-Apocalyptasauri reproduction.
                Perhaps the Apocalyptasauri-that-is-us—our unbending belief in a future
                paradise-to-come and like-minded climate-changing determination to prevent that
                future—means that we should start fucking so that we may enjoy our sex before it is
                the last because it will occur before whatever unannounced beginning, unheralded
                repeopling, may come, which is too late to enjoy since by then “us” is erased (if we
                are not already under erasure). Perhaps within that aporia exists the future
                inexistence of the existence of the future human “species,” the
                post-Apocalyptasauri? These are odd, strange thoughts, perhaps, but they are the
                thoughts we thought in this thought experiment of a class.</p>
                  <p>We generated only speculative answers to these questions in writing and discussion.
                For one, we could sketch out a different reproductive futurity from the patrilineal
                manscapes of <title level="m">The Road</title> and <title level="m">Mad Max</title>, 
                as well as a <emph>jouissance</emph>,
                perhaps, that defies Rousseau’s notion of a last sex on earth in favor of
                Wollstonecraft’s celebratory sexual energy. We thought that, maybe, the
                Apocalyptasaurus’s “last sex on earth” introduced the possibility of new types of
                sex post-sex and with it re-people, “people” who are people but not people as we
                currently conceptualize people, but rather something radically different that we
                cannot yet know. It is a vision of futurity that perhaps extends in ecological
                directions wherein humans and the world become more entangled (perhaps in Karen
                Barad’s sense of “quantum entanglement,” wherein the subject and object mutually
                create the other as well as new spacetimes through intra-action) than we currently
                understand, leading us into the maze of a territory for which we do not as yet have
                a map. It is as if we have hyper-jumped into a future and find our bearings
                completely unbalanced. Such a scenario traverses both Edelman’s “no future” and
                Sheldon’s “child-to-come” since both are predicated on current notions of
                reproduction that are steadfastly human, although Sheldon does want to think beyond
                such categories. Perhaps the future will not be a future in human terms? Or perhaps
                Corin’s work affords us space for thinking beyond white heteronormative patriarchy,
                beyond the social contract(s) as we know it/them.</p>
                  <p>Although such reading was beyond the scope of this course, both Edelman and Sheldon
                touch on aspects of our analysis of Corin’s flash fiction and help delineate the
                final conclusions, such as they are, of the course. On our last day of reading, we
                considered the last flash fiction piece in her book, “What is was like was,” to
                think about the Apocalyptasaurus fucking in the field.
            <quote>Stars fell in unison, and in a mossy grove on the hill, the Apocalyptasaurus 
                was having the last sex on earth. I headed to the mobile unit. I hadn’t brought any 
                animals because that’s how shortsighted I am. <emph>Something will provide</emph>, 
                I seemed to be thinking, but who knows anymore, I haven’t had to think in so long I 
                don’t know when I’m doing it or not. I drifted away. Unpeopling, repeopling, all in 
                the past with the automatic sprinklers, and soon the cries of leftover apocalypses 
                were all that remained. Some of the things we knew were true. I’d only wanted to keep 
                the bells ringing. (182–83)</quote>Throughout the course we established a distinction 
                between apocalypse and postapocalypse. Apocalypse derives from the Greek <emph>apocalypsis</emph>
                and means “revelation,” as in a revelation of a renewed paradise on earth. In works
                like the ones in this course, this definition clearly does not apply. Postapocalypse
                means what comes after any renewed paradise is possible, when one lives with what
                remains of the human species in the ruins of societal structures. Corin’s fiction,
                in general, confounded us, but we excavated from this piece by-now familiar course
                themes. Stars falling imply disaster since “disaster” stems from the Latin 
                <emph>dis-aster</emph>, or, as <emph>dis-</emph> means “apart,”
                the sense becomes a star apart from the sky, literally a falling, or in some cases,
                a dis-eased star. At once we are in postapocalyptic time even as the
                Apocalyptasaurus, seemingly a representative of paradise, engages in “the last sex
                on earth.” What could this possibly mean, we asked? Is it heralding a new form of
                sex, post-Apocalyptasaurus sex? What would that mean? And what does “unpeopling,
                repeopling” mean? Is the Apocalyptasaurus’s sex unpeopling the earth, removing all
                traces of humanity and, thereby, somehow, repeopling it with new people? Why does
                the speaker wish she has “brought . . . animals?” To carnivorously continue the
                human species? Or are animals necessary somehow for whatever the Apocalyptasaurus’s
                sexual ritual performs and produces? Is the Apocalyptasaurus a metaphor for
                capitalism and, like capitalism, needs to put animals to death for food? In the
                biblical paradise of the Garden of Eden, humans did not eat animals, so is this an
                indication of paradise’s contortion into nightmarish postapocalypse? If “leftover
                apocalypses were all that remained,” is that an indication that only remnants of
                paradise survive? Does “leftovers” fulfill this capitalist eating metaphor? If so,
                is that postapocalypse? Is that connected to the repeopling, the “re-people” being
                those leftovers? That the bells no longer seem to be ringing appears to be a
                metaphor for erstwhile society, but why a campanological metaphor that seems
                specifically to reference churches? What “things” and why were “some” (and why only
                some?) of them “true”? </p>
                  <p>The second text is Rebekah Sheldon’s
                <title level="m">The Child to Come</title> (2016), which stakes
                out different ground in relation to the figure of the child and reproductive
                futurity: <quote>The child binds the realization of nonhuman vitality back into the 
                    charmed circle of the human, encircling the future in the promise of generationality. 
                    For it is not just the case that the child retro-reproductively forecloses the 
                    future but also the figuration of the child as the self-similar issue of the 
                    present, the safe space of human prosperity and a return to a manageable nature, 
                    forecloses the mutational in the reproductive. And yet this grafting of the 
                    culture of life over the <emph>culturing</emph> of life generates a queer 
                    child-figure whose humanity is always suspiciously intimate with other-than-human 
                    forms-of-life. (6)</quote>On Sheldon’s reading of the figure of the child—which for 
                her is not tied to the symbolic order necessarily, as Edelman thinks, but to a historical 
                post-1960s world that sees this figure as its future in the atomic age—it is, nonetheless, 
                like the critical views Edelman’s polemic rails against, linked to reproductive futurity 
                and the survival of the species. More children must be produced for the species to
                continue. Yet Sheldon also finds in the figure a double bind: on one hand, “the
                reproductive” that bars any mutational genealogical deviation from species
                homogeneity and, on the other, a grafting of the child onto life in so unnatural a
                way that it ensures such mutation and enwraps the figure with nonhuman possibility.
                Like the plant raised by those nonhumans, Wall-E and EVE, Sheldon theorizes a queer
                child-figure whose nonhuman entanglement evades the no-futurism of Edelman’s queer
                non-child-figure at the heart of the death drive of the species. Contra Edelman,
                Sheldon allows for a future, but one that avoids the manacles of heteronormative
                cultures of life Edelman fears and that instead prevents heterogeneity in
                whatever-is-to-come.</p>
                  <p>Corin’s <title level="m">One Hundred Apocalypses and Other Apocalypses</title> proved
                at once to be the most illuminating and infuriating text (or set of texts) for
                interpretation. In my courses, I place
                emphasis on our own thoughts and interpretations that emerge from collective class
                discussion, making close reading and what follows from it the prime directive
                steering the ship. To this end, I rarely introduce outside secondary theories, and
                did not in this course, but it would pay, perhaps, to briefly mention two that
                relate to the class’s thinking. The first is Lee Edleman’s
                <title level="m">No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive</title> (2004).
                He writes, regarding the notion that the figure of the child underwrites any
                plausible notion of futurity: <quote>For the social order exists for this universalized 
                    subject, this fantasmatic Child, a notional freedom more highly valued than the 
                    actuality of freedom itself, which might, after all, put at risk the Child to whom 
                    such a freedom falls due. Hence, whatever refuses this mandate by which our 
                    political institutions compel the collective reproduction of the Child must appear 
                    as a threat not only to the organization of a given social order but also, and 
                    far more ominously, to social order as such, insofar as it threatens the logic 
                    of futurism on which meaning always depends. (11)</quote>For Edelman, queerness 
                threatens the social order because the social order orders
                itself on what Edelman calls “reproductive futurism,” the need to replicate
                ourselves and our present through our children in the imagined future that
                recursively structures our present. Spawning generationally equals not only our
                genetic perpetuity but humanistic species vitality in general. Edelman argues,
                though, that “no future” is preferable to this type of future since this future
                requires a heteropatriarchal normativity that shuts down any queerness. In that
                sense, Edelman’s no future constitutes a to-be-hoped-for future-to-come in its
                negatively worked inclusivity. To put Edelman’s work in the context of the
                Anthropocene: we think our future will somehow be apocalyptic, a miraculous return
                to the past in a paradisiacal future, wherein even if we do not survive, our
                offspring will. As Edelman writes, we always seek to protect against that very
                future’s arrival with an endless <emph>replication of the present</emph>
                in the form of more children who are our replicants. However, to press Edelman’s
                thinking further into the postapocalyptic Anthropocene mud, since climate change
                projects against just such a future that features generations of children, we enter
                Edelman’s notion of queer no-futurity by force, as it were. For everybody. “No
                future,” in this postapocalyptic scenario, queers its own queerness and refuses the
                idea that we should not continue to reproduce. Instead, perversely, for there to be
                “no future” in the Anthropocene, we must reproduce precisely to preserve the human
                species in the present, to stave off a future with no people. If <emph>reproducing 
                    the present</emph> occurs through this endless replication of it in
                hetero-children, then it can also occur through an endless replication of queer,
                trans, or nonbinary children since what is really being produced are not children
                but time, the present. Queerness, on my reading of Edelman, then, is a paradoxically
                positively negative force in that it prevents such reproduction and thereby undoes
                heteronormative meaning-making, the social structures that cage queerness within
                these same limiting, confining frameworks of meaning, even as it also allows for new
                possibilities of nonheteronormative reproduction in the context of the
                Anthropocene’s strange temporality.</p>
                  <p>Roughly around this time we came to the end of our (re)reading of Rousseau and
                Wollstonecraft and made the hyperdrive jump to McCarthy’s <title level="m">The
                    Road</title>.</p>
                  <p>The more recent <title level="m">Mad Max: Fury Road</title>, celebrated for its
                feminist take on the road movie, evinces a Christological fixation at odds with the
                version of human mortality <title level="m">The Road </title>manifests. Mad Max is 
                initially depicted as crucified, his arms splayed out, lashed upright to the front of a
                vehicle. Later, this metaphor is made explicit as he, Christlike, gives his blood to
                save the too-weak Imperator Furiosa, the purported heroine of the film that lends it
                a feminist voice. As many students pointed out in their essays, Immorten Joe, the
                “bad guy” leader of the society we see in the film, is purposefully associated with
                a god figure. Again and again, in discussion and essays, we recurred to Joe’s
                promise to Nux, one of his “war boys”: “I myself will carry you to the gates of
                Valhalla. You shall ride eternal, shiny and chrome.” Religious discourse, students
                argued, ultimately held out only illusory hope for a future, just as Joe’s promise
                turns out to be bunk, a claim meant to con his followers into doing his bidding. In
                our close reading of the last paragraph of <title level="m">The Road</title> we had
                discovered something similar in postapocalyptic fiction: the future is constantly
                theorized in relation not to the hope of a future—since there is no future on earth
                for humans in a religious, or any, sense—but to procreation, the biopolitical
                production of new bodies. The unvoiced theme of postapocalyptic literature, then,
                according to this reading, is sex, literally the sexual act understood as a
                procreative act that leads to children. In <title level="m">The Road</title>, the boy
                finds a family with other children to carry on once his father passes, whereas
                others in the novel seek to cannibalize children. Immorten Joe, on the other hand,
                keeps a stable of women as his consorts, not for reasons of love, but because he
                uses them as birthing vessels for him to breed new war boys. War, again, which was
                for a moment no more, is given birth again to glut—the war boys take marauders like
                Max and use them as blood donors to help themselves survive although they do not
                have what Captain McCrea of the Axiom would call “life.” Indeed,
                they have only a “half-life,” as it is termed in the film.</p>
                  <p>These final lines provided much room for discussion and despair. In a classroom close
                reading exercise, students spent ten minutes writing on these sentences. Subsequent
                discussion resulted in, initially, an either-or situation: either the natural world,
                “older than man,” preexists humanity and will perhaps continue postperishing of the
                species; or, for other students, humans’ capacity for wholesale destruction will tow
                the world in its wake to inexistence. But neither solution solves the problem of
                what the “mystery” is. Is it simply that the world is completely alien from humans
                and hence a thing of mystery that we cannot understand? Or is the mystery that
                humans will get no answers since the world is indifferent to their plight? Is this
                why the trout are inscribed with “maps and mazes,” at once signifying being able to
                find the right path and to find oneself, for however long, maybe five minutes or
                forever, lost without a map to the maze’s just-around-the corner exit? One requires
                a road to somewhere, the other a road to nowhere. Eventually, our reading decided,
                the humanless glens hum with mystery because no answers are possible; we cannot know
                prehumen existence fully, nor can we glimpse the future, even if that future
                includes humans. We are lost even though we think we are moving forward along a
                temporal axis mapped out for us—and this is one more reason to experiment with
                hyper-jump pedagogy. Our belief in a future may be not only impossible but also
                irrelevant: we are mapless in time’s nonhuman maze. At the same time, since this
                “thing . . . cannot be made right again,” we wondered whether the novel finally
                argues that these glens older than man have been irrevocably destroyed by humans.
                Perhaps, according to the novel, humans should cease to exist, some students
                suggested. Perhaps the man’s wife, an apparently cold-hearted, faithless villainess,
                who leaves him and their son in order to enter the darkness and die, had the right
                suicidal idea about human reproduction and extinction in that the former should
                cease and the latter increase? (This suggestion, we would later see, was incorrect
                because it is just another form of the novel’s misogyny.)</p>
                  <p>Over several weeks our close readings of fictional texts provided us an overview of
                how postapocalyptic literature configures sex and gender. In these narratives, women
                are reduced to little more than historically heteronormative pieces on patriarchy’s
                chessboard (patriarchy being the player whose king always checkmates). Sex
                disappears in these texts but reproduction, however weird in form, remains. The
                nihilism of Byron’s <title level="a">Darkness,</title> for instance, recurs to 
                Plato’s <emph>khora</emph>, the womb or breadbasket of the world preceding the world itself,
                personified in his poem as a “darkness” at the end of the world: “Darkness . . . she
                was the universe” (81–82). As dark womb, mother to a dead race and world, khoratic
                darkness becomes cyclical abortive genesis, birthing nothing since its offspring has
                expired. It is perhaps a kind of barren nonflowering, like those Wollstonecraft says
                characterized women: “one cause of this barren blooming I attribute to a false
                system of education, gathered from the books written on this subject by men who,
                considering females rather as women than human creatures” (10). Perhaps the most
                famous postapocalyptic contemporary work, besides the necrophiliac navel-gazing of
                <title level="m">The Walking Dead</title>, is McCarthy’s dreary
                neoliberalism-championing mansplainer that takes as its <emph>raison
                    d’etre</emph> the continuance of the patrilineal in the form of a father and son
                who, when they find the world’s last lonely can of Coca-Cola, remind us, like that
                other mainstream mansplainer, <title level="m">Mad Men</title>, that such lineages
                always want to “buy the world a Coke.” Patrilinealism is a hungry, hungry hippo for
                capitalism, and thus goes hand-in-hand, as we’ve seen, with the state. In the novel,
                before the man’s wife leaves him to take death for a lover, comparing herself, to
                make sure we get the misogynistic point in neon red-district lights, to a “faithless
                slut” whose faithlessness breaks the social contract, they reenact the
                Rousseau-Wollstonecraft encounter (as we will see below): “there was no argument.
                The hundred nights they’d sat up debating the pros and cons of self destruction with
                the earnestness of philosophers chained to a madhouse wall” (59). They are not
                “survivors,” she declares, but “the walking dead in a horror film,” a similar
                distinction <title level="m">Wall-E</title> makes (59). 
                Meanwhile, the misogynistic portrayal of the mother figure who appears at novel’s
                end, “adopting” the orphaned boy, depicts her as the bad kind of looney tune, not at
                all like Bugs Bunny: a religious zealot who worships at the feet of a hope the final
                lines of the novel melancholically dispel even as its heteronormativity equates the
                human species with its masculine noun: “Once there were brook trout in the streams
                in the mountains. You could see them standing in the amber current where the white
                edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand.
                Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that
                were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not
                be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things
                were older than man and they hummed of mystery” (286–87).</p>
                  <p>One theoretical underpinning of the course was that postapocalyptic literature,
                though ostensibly about the end of humanity, carries us back to the future, to the
                fundamental debate of Enlightenment politics that reappears in allegorical form in
                postapocalyptic literature. In postapocalyptic worlds, the disappearance of
                governmental and social institutions forces humans into a familiar (strangely, it is
                because these options are what disappeared) choice: libertarian anarchism—everyone
                in it for themselves—versus a new form of social-contract democratization for living
                together in a world where humans appear intent on killing each other off. This
                distinction is, at base, the difference between the thought of Thomas Hobbes and
                Rousseau. Both writers had their own theories about how to create self-governing
                societies that could avert the “war of all against all” we see depicted in our
                return to “the state of nature”—that imagined theoretical space of the
                Enlightenment—in postapocalyptic literature (Hobbes 76). This theoretical space
                structured Enlightenment debates over the proper role of government in citizens’
                lives, leading to, through legal codification, covenants structuring the state’s
                politics. State-of-nature debates anticipate postapocalyptic literature, then, a
                genre that originated in 1816’s “the year without a summer” when Romantic-period
                authors began writing “last man” and “end-of-the-world” poems and novels. In poems
                such as Byron’s <title level="a">Darkness</title>—which we read, annotated, and discussed 
                on the first day of class as a kind of hors d'oeuvre, just as humanity is for “War” in the
                poem—humans must start over in forming governmental structures, building societies,
                or, as is so often the case in postapocalyptic literature, engaging in species-wide
                warfare that hastens their ultimate demise. “War,” the speaker of the poem tells us,
                “which for a moment was no more / did glut himself again” (38–39). Hobbes’
                prediction—that war will proliferate without a social contract headed by a strong
                monarch who can restrain people—turns out, for Byron’s field-defining vision of
                postapocalyptic worlds, to best Rousseau’s claim that people in this savage state of
                nature will live contentedly alone or make common cause to survive (and here we can
                hear echoes of the <title level="m">Wall-E</title> choice between
                stupefied survival or satisfied living as well).</p>
                  <p>Wollstonecraft of course also disagrees with Rousseau that women are dominant in
                society and argues consistently against this idea in her book, and our class found
                her deconstruction of Rousseau’s pathology to be a forceful corrective to
                Enlightenment debates about sex and gender. In short, by claiming sexual love gets
                banished in society in favor of moral love, Rousseau banished it from his own
                thinking, according to Wollstonecraft, thereby neutering his vision of society of
                any but reproductive purposes (as a psychobiographical note, Rousseau supposedly had
                five children and sent them to orphanages). <emph>Jouissance</emph>, then,
                finds no place in Rousseau’s society. Wollstonecraft, on the other hand, does not
                see sex solely as a matter of reproduction—it is a means of <emph>jouissance</emph>, 
                of pleasure, of coming to the other. While many critics debate
                the status of sex in Wollstonecraft’s work, she actually unleashes sexual energy
                into Enlightenment and Romantic discourse as a positive force, one that is natural
                whereas sex-as-species-reproduction alone is, for her, as we saw in her reading of
                Rousseau, unnatural. Neither the prude some find nor the slut others fashion,
                Wollstonecraft in her feminism avows both sexual liberation and true love as
                progressive politics between individuals.</p>
                  <p>As scholars of the Enlightenment and Romanticism will recognize, many of these
                questions require historical and theoretical contexts to flesh out the terminology,
                concepts, and ideas. As the nature of the course was more broadly interdisciplinary
                and contemporary than would permit a full exploration of, say, “sensibility,” we
                made do with concise, though hopefully lucid, explanations. We glossed sensibility
                as an emotive attribute ascribed to women at the time, aligning them with emotional
                ontological states in contrast to men’s ostensibly more rational ontology. Some of
                this we returned to in earlier chapters of Wollstonecraft’s book to see, now, the
                impact of comments that had proved recalcitrant to our understanding the first time
                    through.<note place="foot" resp="editors">These two passages, for instance: 
                        “it is asserted, in direct terms, that
                            the minds of women are enfeebled by false refinement . . . and that . .
                            . they are treated as a kind of subordinate beings, and not as a part of
                            the human species, when improveable reason is allowed to be the
                            dignified distinction which raises men above the brute creation”
                            (Wollstonecraft 10); “Dismissing then those pretty feminine phrases,
                            which the men condescendingly use to soften our slavish dependence, and
                            despising that weak elegancy of mind, exquisite sensibility, and sweet
                            docility of manners, supposed to be the sexual characteristics of the
                            weaker vessel” (Wollstonecraft 12).</note> Doing so helped us
                realize how Wollstonecraft turns the tables on Rousseau, accusing him of being the
                one overwhelmed and controlled by emotion to the extent that it distorts his reason.
                Therefore, we realized, Wollstonecraft is proposing a solution to Rousseau’s
                delusive impassioned nature: he needs either to masturbate and alleviate his
                unstoppable desire for real sex, or to have real sex and put the brakes on his
                full-throttle masturbation. Given that Wollstonecraft proscribes masturbation
                subsequently in her text, it would seem odd, then, to prescribe it here; this must
                mean that she urges the latter. With the phrase, “had he given way to these
                desires,” she advocates that he enter the world and expend his lasciviousness in
                carnal pleasure with other humans. Here, a student pointed out the word “natural” as
                the opposite of Rousseau’s claim that “moral love” is “unnatural.” In fact, what we
                discovered is that Wollstonecraft reverses Rousseau’s argument entirely: in society,
                sexual love is necessary to preserve the imagination lest one give in to self-denial
                (again, we can see Rousseau’s sexual anxiety play out in the castration fantasy of
                <title level="m">Julie</title>’s rewriting of the story of Abelard and Heloise),
                which debauches the purity of the imagination. Sex, for Wollstonecraft, despite her
                proclamations elsewhere in this <title level="m">Vindication</title>, is natural and
                necessary. Nor, as for Rousseau, is sex merely reproductive in nature but rather
                vital to mental preservation. Men are ruled by their passions so strongly that it
                leads them into the error of becoming passionless, of fantasizing about sex rather
                than engaging in it, thereby distorting their reason. Men are not, as Rousseau
                thinks, enchained by women’s love but rather by their own mental enslavement to
                their own unfulfilled desires. To put it differently, as I have written elsewhere,
                if for Rousseau the state of nature requires a social contract and the social
                contract requires the state of nature—a seeming impossibility given his demarcation
                of the two spaces, yet one that his work nonetheless forwards—then, on
                Wollstonecraft’s reading of Rousseau, the state of nature in the social contract
                requires sex, and the social contract in the state of nature needs moral love
                (Washington).</p>
                  <p>Derrida famously reads masturbation in Rousseau as but another figure for
                supplementarity (or what Derrida otherwise calls “the trace” or 
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">différance</foreign>) in Rousseau’s deconstruction of speech and 
                writing, and students likewise zeroed in on a passage in Wollstonecraft on sexual 
                gratification and the denial of one’s passions that we developed into a critique of Rousseau
                (Derrida, <title level="m">Grammatology</title> 165–71). As Derrida notes, in
                <title level="m">The Confessions</title> Rousseau has, in
                society, abjured sex for masturbation because the supplement of non-sex fills the
                lack of a sexual situation with his beloved adopted <foreign xml:lang="fr">maman</foreign>
                that was, unconsummated, itself sex as non-sex. Masturbation supplements the lack of
                real sex that, precisely because it needs to be supplemented, is not “real” enough
                in its realness, or even real at all, and not more real than the fantasy with which
                it must supplement itself. Masturbation, the lack of real sex, is therefore realer
                sex for Rousseau than real sex. Wollstonecraft’s critique/rebuke appears in chapter
                V on male authors who have made women objects of pity: <quote>But all Rousseau’s errors 
                    in reasoning arose from sensibility, and sensibility to their charms women are very 
                    ready to forgive! When he should have reasoned he became impassioned, and reflection 
                    inflamed his imagination instead of enlightening his understanding. Even his virtues 
                    also led him farther astray; for, born with a warm constitution and lively fancy, 
                    nature carried him toward the other sex with such eager fondness, that he soon became 
                    lascivious. Had he given way to these desires, the fire would have extinguished 
                    itself in a natural manner; but virtue, and a romantic kind of delicacy, made him 
                    practise self-denial; yet, when fear, delicacy, or virtue, restrained him, he 
                    debauched his imagination, and reflecting on the sensations to which fancy gave 
                    force, he traced them in the most glowing colours, and sunk them deep into 
                    his soul. (95)</quote>In order to explicate Wollstonecraft’s somewhat densely stated 
                estimation of Rousseau, we asked some word-level questions. What does “sensibility” mean 
                in this context and why would it be something that leads one into “errors”? How does
                “impassioned” work in opposition to “reasoned”? Or how does “imagination” work
                against “understanding”? How can virtue, which should provide a moral compass for a
                life of noble rectitude, lead one “farther astray”? Wollstonecraft seems to be
                implying that Rousseau “should have given way to these desires” of his for the other
                sex. But why? Usually we link debauchery to a physical act in accord with
                “lascivious,” so why does Wollstonecraft claim it was his imagination, as if his
                imagination itself were some eighteenth-century libertine, that did all this
                debauching? What, moreover, does “self-denial” mean in this context? Is she
                recommending that he should masturbate—perform “auto-affection” rather than
                “self-denial”—to relieve his lasciviousness rather than have sex? Or have sex rather
                than fantasize about it?</p>
                  <p>Both of these comments, the students noted, deplore the role of women in the state of
                nature and in society. In the second instance, they pointed out, Rousseau, perhaps
                unintentionally, lapses into a weird paradox, since he positions women as kings
                ruling over society. In the first passage, students noted that women are explicitly
                associated with objects for men in the state of nature: <quote>The savage, lacking any 
                    sort of enlightenment, experiences passions only of the latter kind; his desires 
                    do not go beyond his physical needs; the only goods in the world he knows are food, 
                    a female, and repose, and the only evils he fears are pain and hunger. I say pain 
                    and not death, for an animal will never know what it is to die, and a knowledge of 
                    death and its terrors is one of man’s first acquisitions upon leaving the animal 
                    condition. (34–35)</quote> Rousseau’s idea that females are goods to be possessed led 
                the class to question whether or not Rousseau’s other ideas were made in good faith and 
                could be taken at face value (indeed, one question we would inconclusively pose later in 
                the semester, borrowing the parlance of <title level="m">The Road</title>: is Rousseau 
                a “bad guy”?). The second passage on gender in the
                <title level="m">Discourse</title> that students repeatedly
                returned to appears less bold-facedly retrograde in its gender assumptions but more
                complicated for the genuine aporia it opens in Rousseau’s state-of-nature politics.
                Rousseau distinguishes two types of love, the sexual and the emotional, which he
                calls “the moral side of love”: <quote>The physical is the universal desire that leads 
                    one sex to unite with the other; the moral is what shapes desire and focuses it on 
                    a single object, or at least makes the desire for the chosen object more forceful. 
                    It is easily seen that the moral side of love is an unnatural sentiment, born of 
                    social custom and honoured by women with much care and skill in order to establish 
                    their power over men and so make dominant the sex that ought to obey. 
                    (49)</quote>If, for Rousseau, the creation of society leads to inequality, then it 
                appears that this inequality manifests, not by means of the enclosure of land and subsequent
                capitalistic divisions this introduces (“the true founder of civil society was the
                first man who, having enclosed a piece of land, thought of saying, ‘this is mine,’
                and came across people simple enough to believe him” [55]), but through power
                machinations performed by gender involutions. It seems, students suggested, that for
                Rousseau inequality in society occurs via a script-flip: women, submissives who obey
                in the state of nature, become dominatrices using “moral love” to entrain men to
                obey them in society. Sexual love, for Rousseau, is natural to humans, whereas
                deeper attachment and sentiment is a perversion of the true state of things (perhaps
                this is the real key to Rousseau’s
                <title level="m">Julie, or the New Heloise</title> [1761] in that
                the lovers are prevented from being together and, according to Rousseau’s views
                here, as well they should be). Following Rousseau’s logic, physical or sexual love
                in the state of nature is acceptable because it produces no attachment between the
                solitary individuals living in that state—sex is just an urge to be sated—whereas in
                society women form attachments to men not through physical seduction but by enticing
                them to <emph>feel</emph>, to have real feelings, moral love, for women.
                The great enemy of the human condition for Rousseau, then, is love but not sex,
                which flourished in the state of nature, but ceases in society when confronted and
                shackled by love. This, we said, puts a new spin on his famous opening line that
                “man was born free, and everywhere he is in chains” because women have men in chains
                by their love (<title level="m">Social</title> 45)! The last sex on earth, for
                Rousseau, it turns out, occurred in the state of nature and human contact in society
                is therefore no more than mere facility to reproduction of the species. Moral love
                erases sexual pleasure in society. </p>
                  <p>Although I lack the space to cover every aspect of our discussions on Rousseau and
                Wollstonecraft, I want to highlight some of the passages that students fixed on
                since these passages, in our recyclical journey through them, bespeak the dilemma we
                had begun to sketch: should humans accede to extinction or somehow find a way to
                reproduce, to live in ways that are more than mere survival? Beyond reading these
                thinkers and discussing the thought experiment of the state of nature, we had not
                set an agenda when we initially read these two difficult texts. Very slowly, as our
                understanding of the two authors increased, we circled in on key moments in the
                texts that seemed to encapsulate not only larger points about the ideas the authors
                were developing but also, more crucially for us, evasions of certain other ideas.
                Regarding these evasions, students, for instance, both in our class discussions and
                in their short essays (our first paper was an exploratory one on Rousseau), found
                Rousseau to be an intriguing thinker but one who had little to say about gender (we
                could of course have looked at
                <title level="m">Emile</title> [1762], which would have bolded
                his gender concerns, but since that work is not explicitly focused on the state of
                nature, we refrained). Part of this stemmed from the difficulty in coming to grips
                with what he meant by a state of nature. We eventually crystallized this, for
                discussion, as a time and place prior to human society in which humans lived
                individually alone and were perfectly content in that solitude. Having established a
                working definition of Rousseau’s concept, backtracking through the text helped us
                identify a few misogynist comments in Rousseau’s discursus that threatened to upend
                his larger argument about the state of nature’s placidity.</p>
                  <p>Although we did not know it to begin with, <title level="m">The Road</title> and 
                <title level="m">Mad Max</title> set the agenda for the class in terms of sex and 
                gender: both texts concern themselves primarily with reproduction—the boy in 
                <title level="m">The Road</title> and the war boys in <title level="m">Mad 
                    Max</title>—but both also evince no joy or pleasure in the act of reproduction. 
                To put it in <title level="m">Wall-E</title>’s terms, the human species survives but 
                does not live, auguring different futures of automation, bodies deprived of all but 
                the basic needs: oxygen, water, food, shelter, and the trudge toward them in a 
                depressing world with dwindling resources. In both texts, the characters have returned 
                to a state of nature. Is this the paradise Rousseau imagined with his state of nature 
                thought experiment?</p>
                  <p>When Paul de Man had his infamous deconstructive <emph>agon</emph> with
                Jacques Derrida, the crossroads of their rapprochement ran through the work of
                Jean-Jacques Rousseau and dissension over exactly whose blind spot was blinder when
                it came to Rousseau (de Man; Derrida, <title level="a">Typewriter</title>). This 
                <emph>agon</emph> serves as yet another reminder of the way logocentricism blinds even
                the best of critics to Rousseau’s prime interrogator of the Enlightenment: Mary
                Wollstonecraft. Wollstonecraft, whose critique of the patriarchal and capitalistic
                assumptions informing the work of both Edmund Burke and Rousseau gifted us radical
                critical tools for thinking about, and theorizing, sex and gender in democratic
                societies, also recalls us to the blind spot of postapocalyptic literature,
                namely . . . sex and gender.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Wollstonecraft’s 
                    daughter, Mary Shelley, wrote <title level="m">The Last Man</title> (1826),
                    indebted, as she said, to Byron’s <title level="a">Darkness.</title> This novel 
                    does deal with sex and gender, as several critics have argued.</note> Our
                class, after a close-reading warm-up walk-through of Byron’s <title level="m">Darkness</title> (1816), began reading and contrasting Rousseau’s <title level="m">A Discourse on Inequality</title> (1755) with Wollstonecraft’s
                    <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Women</title> (1792)
                    before making a 200-year leap forward to McCarthy’s <title level="m">The Road</title>
                (2006) and the film <title level="m">Mad Max: Fury Road</title> (2015). We finished
                the course by reading Corin and conducting the above-mentioned group presentations
                (this essay began, then, where the class ended). If Wollstonecraft, in alerting us
                to the importance of sex and gender for establishing equality in societies, disrupts
                the genderless democratic debates of the Enlightenment, and given that the same
                debates recur in postapocalyptic fiction, then the past, at least from the
                perspective of the Enlightenment, is the future in that it still remains our
                present. But how do we get there, wherever <emph>there</emph> is?</p>
                  <p>What time is it then? And what time is it for the future of humanity, for our species
                reproduction, or, as Edelman calls it, our “reproductive futurity”? As Rebekah
                Sheldon remarks, “genealogical succession, the ‘so on’ of reproduction, derives its
                meaning-making force from conceiving of time as unfolding in a straight line running
                out to meet the horizon. Space travel is already a perversion of this conception of
                time” (67). Hyper-jump pedagogy reckons with this space travel temporal
                perversion—which we can see develop in our reading of <title level="m">Wall-E</title>—by 
                continuing to pervert how we conceive of reproduction in terms of
                <foreign xml:lang="grc">chronos</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">telos</foreign>, 
                a straight line or a purpose-driven end. In short, what this class taught me is that 
                to rethink survival, to rethink reproduction like those in <title level="m">Wall-E</title>, 
                the faceless, indiscernible children and the listless, indiscernible adults, surviving
                enough to survive but not to live, we have to rethink pedagogies that experiment
                with different futures; but since reproductivity is itself temporally based, we also
                have to think about what reproduction and sex might mean in these different
                temporalities and what nonnormative, radical temporalities mean for sex and
                reproduction. </p>
                  <p>And this is where what I want to call “hyper-jump pedagogy” can help us rethink
                teaching the Anthropocene in relation to Romanticism. Hyper-jump pedagogy reflects
                the scrambled futural temporality the Anthropocene places us in. We discussed this
                temporality in Derridean terms in class, although we did not frame it via his
                philosophy of time but through a discussion of Lucy Corin’s flash fiction,
                <title level="m">One Hundred Apocalypses and Other Apocalypses</title> (2013).
                Corin’s work exemplifies an atemporal logic wherein the short pieces of fiction seem
                to arise in random order, as if a shuffling of cards, with no setting, location, or
                time announced. This atemporal dislocation rendered it impossible for us to discern
                fixed spacetime points for any one piece. In these fictions, the past could well
                take place before the present and the future before the past—but not in a flashback
                or flash-forward narrative chronological strategy; rather, each short fiction seemed
                radically unbound from the other, as if set in its own spacetime, some time always
                temporally to-come from the piece that preceded or anteceded it. Through this
                achronology we can better understand how the Derridean “to-come” signals more than a
                simple futurity; it marks how the future is always hyper-jumping away from us even
                as the future constantly arrives in each moment that becomes the present, which, in
                turn, becomes the past, which is, it follows, perpetually becoming the present which
                becomes the future. And yet, the future is always disappearing, which means that the
                future is also always still out there. Far ahead of us, if it exists, the future
                exists in the future (to put it paradoxically but accurately), always a hyper-jump
                away, a space-ial movement that traverses the erasure of time by leaping over the
                present-become-the-future to the future. Hyper-jump pedagogy takes this temporal
                challenge seriously by attempting to elide the limitations of typical class
                structures and chronological historicism—the time(s) that no longer inhere(s) in the
                logic of the Anthropocene—hyper-jumping from epoch to epoch, genre to genre, text to
                text without necessary linkages. In the Anthropocene, according to some predictions,
                humankind can no longer survive or live, and so our notion of time as a measurement
                of human lifespans linked to a future is (always) already under erasure. Hyper-jump
                pedagogy seeks to be a pedagogy for the Anthropocene, to discover linkages that do
                not yet exist, to go from the past and present into a future unknown, what might
                even be, in both the grammatical and temporal sense, a future imperfect or a present
                past participle.</p>
                  <p>By design we had no predetermined answers in this class because I purposefully wanted
                the course to operate as a semester-long thought experiment that explored, in the
                most wide-ranging sense of that term, the issues of sex and gender in the
                Anthropocene through a Romantic frame. We tend to think of the Anthropocene as a
                version of environmental or ecological crisis that results from climate change,
                worldwide deep-down damage that might kill the planet and the human species along
                with every other life form. But the focus on species and futurity tends to belie the
                gender and sexual politics that the former entails when interlocked with the latter:
                for the species to have a future, we must reproduce, must have sex. But, as Rosi
                Braidotti puts it when noting that we need to “rethink sexuality without genders,”
                “sexuality may be caught in the sex-gender binary but is not reducible to it” (36).
                Teaching the Anthropocene in the Romantic period, in this respect, is also a
                consideration of why and how we have sex and what sexuality is.</p>
                  <p>The above reading, at any rate, is an expanded version of the collective
                extemporaneous explication of the film we worked out in the honors course I taught,
                <title level="a">Gender and Postapocalyptic Literature,</title> in the spring of 2017 
                at Francis Marion University. Students screened clips from the film during a group 
                presentation in the final weeks of the class. During these group presentations, students 
                chose to present on whatever text they wanted—whether that was film clips, short stories,
                novel snippets, poems, or television shows—as long as it spoke to the overall class
                theme of gender and postapocalypse. Our <title level="m">Wall-E</title> reading stages a 
                recurrent topic throughout the semester: should humans continue with the reproduction of 
                their species if they are nothing more than destructive annihilators? Should, to borrow
                the title of Lee Edelman’s book, humans have “no future?” Or, perhaps, as we asked,
                humans simply do not have a future regardless of the fact that one way we
                conceptualize life is in relation to the idea of a future, that life will continue,
                individually and collectively, in a time-to-come? What if, though, there is no
                future? What if, having disrupted the parameters for life on earth, like the humans
                in <title level="m">Wall-E</title>, the future, unbeknownst to us, has already been
                erased, time travel–like, by the past and our present? What if there is no future
                because we will be dead given that climate change makes the planet unlivable for
                humans? What if we have already, to borrow from <title level="m">Spaceballs</title>
                (1987), “gone to plaid” in a hyperdrive jump that outdistances the possibility of
                our own future, of our own existence?</p>
                  <p>This capitalist critique also speaks to climate change in our present because it
                questions the fundamental assumption of the Anthropocene: humans may not be
                necessary for the earth’s survival but the earth is necessary for humans to have a
                life that is more than meaningless consumption. According to the film, if humans do
                continue unheedingly devouring everything in their path, they will become mere
                automatons controlled by capitalism’s invisible hands (indeed, the onboard computer
                system is named “AUTO,” a harbinger of what humans are becoming), just like we see
                on the Axiom where they are whisked away to different appointments with no real
                investment or volition manifest. They can’t get no satisfaction unless from
                stupefaction. Amidst humans’ stupefaction, the film deals a crushing blow to our
                anthropocentric perspective that humans are the center of the world, and, indeed,
                the universe. Wall-E, we see, has discovered a lone plant growing on the literal
                dumpster dive that is the earth (the film’s original working title was <title level="m">Trash Planet</title>), and when he shows it to EVE, a search droid
                sent back to Earth to record its current vital status, her operational protocols
                kick in and she delivers the plant to the Axiom. This leads to a tense scene where
                the ship’s captain, McCrea, inspired by this fresh sprig of plant life, declares to
                the ship’s resisting onboard computer system, AUTO, that he wishes to return to
                Earth, to home. AUTO assures him that it is far better to remain in space where the
                humans can all survive since they continue to reproduce in a mechanical fashion,
                maintaining their species even though, stupefied, they derive no pleasure from the
                sexual act: AUTOmated sex. To AUTO’s assurance, McCrea loudly retorts, “I don’t want
                to survive, I want to LIVE!” This declaration captures the film’s overall thesis,
                which offers a genuine theorization of what life is and what living means, a theory
                that claims that humans need more than AUTOmated replication, they need 
                <emph>jouissance</emph>, pleasure in sex, if they are more than to
                survive, as they are doing on the Axiom, if they are to live. As Wall-E and EVE, 
                “parents” of the plant, demonstrate, though, the offspring of
                such sex might be more than simply an extension of the human species. Wall-E and EVE
                save the plant, raise it in a sense, while carrying out their love affair, creating
                a queer family. Perhaps, then, the film—beyond its capitalistic critique and climate
                change warning—wants us to rethink how and why we have sex and reproduce, as well as
                what we are reproducing and what constitutes a family-to-come in the “future.”</p>
                  <p>At the beginning of the film <title level="m">Wall-E</title> (2008), we hover in space, 
                gazing not on the image of the familiar pale blue dot of Earth but instead on a brown
                mud-ball blot before zooming in further on this dusky orb to witness the last
                vestiges of the havoc capitalism has wrought on the formerly populated planet. Here,
                a trash-compacting service droid—the titular Wall-E—continues his lonely work,
                picking up, breaking down, and stacking up garbage, marking the film as an
                environmental text on how capitalism’s commodity fetish piles rubbish we clamor for
                higher and higher. That hedonist humans and the capitalist system they adore have
                driven their abandonment of Earth is made clear once we travel with Wall-E to one of
                the ships that the humans fled the planet on, the Axiom. Here we find out that the
                purpose of Wall-E units is restorative; they are “Working to Dig you Out,” a tagline
                the BNL corporation has come up with that unintentionally captures how an
                environmental cleanup effort gets tangled within the “Workings” of capitalism. This
                project has failed, unsurprisingly, and humans remain islanded in a sea of stars
                while the earth, apparently, slowly dies. Meanwhile, the film is even more
                incisively cutting in its critique of human fallibility and folly. Aboard the Axiom,
                humans have achieved the ultimate supposed utopian <foreign xml:lang="la">terminus ad
                    quem</foreign> of capitalism—no longer able to stand up due to obesity and attendant
                atrophied muscles, they are hoovered about on floating beds to sample the goods
                available at a dazzling display of neon-fronted food shops and boutique beauty
                salons. They are no longer working but buying, as the slogan for BNL, “Buy N Large,”
                perfectly articulates in its witty pun: buy and become enlarged, exactly what has
                happened to these super-sized humans.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps this future is already the present—as perhaps the reading experience of this
                essay demonstrates as we arrive at the end, which is the beginning of the course,
                the past that has become the future. Hyper-jump pedagogy takes us back to the
                future, our past, to examine our present, the imperfect future.</p>
