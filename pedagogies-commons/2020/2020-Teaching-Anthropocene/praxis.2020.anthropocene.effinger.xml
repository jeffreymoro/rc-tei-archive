            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">This essay reflects on the experience of teaching Romantic bird poetry 
                    through the lens of our current anthropogenic environmental crises. In particular, it considers 
                    how we can not only read but also <emph>hear</emph> Romantic poetry anew as an undulating 
                    constellation murmuring beneath the Anthropocene, particularly as birdsong is in the 
                    process of disappearing as climate change threatens mass avian extinction. It explores how 
                    we might attend to those bird sounds and silences in poetry by Smith, Coleridge, Keats, and 
                    Clare in light of this impending silence. I describe the lesson in detail, which begins 
                    with students giving an account of their lives among our wasted environments (on local and 
                    global levels) before moving into the Romantic past. I frame this backward pedagogical 
                    approach through the rhetorical figure of <foreign xml:lang="la">hysteron proteron</foreign> 
                    (temporal inversion). The lesson chiefly aims to cultivate a sonic sensibility, one that 
                    makes students better listening subjects attuned to sonic changes in their environments. 
                    It accomplishes this by pairing select poems about the nightingale with a contemporary 
                    digital sound sculpture that makes bird sound audible and visible. Developing a method 
                    of “close listening,” a model of acoustic intimacy that requires becoming attentive to 
                    the layers of ubiquitous sounds, I frame listening as an act of turning us outward, one 
                    that makes us more perceptually aware citizens of the Anthropocene.</p>

            <p>“Where are we?” With this question, I
                    begin my upper-level undergraduate Romantics course at the University of New
                    Brunswick (Canada). Class answers start with the classroom and quickly slide
                    through larger conceptual containers (next the university, then city, province,
                    country), culminating in the expanses of “planet Earth” and “the twenty-first
                    century.” At this point, I invite students to consider locating themselves
                    geologically within the Anthropocene, an era wherein humans have become a
                    geological force responsible for irreparably damaging the earth.</p>
            <p>The first week of the course is dedicated
                    to establishing a foundational understanding of the Anthropocene, the current
                    “specter” that, as J. R. McNeill suggests, “is haunting academia” (117). I
                    assign students critical readings, including excerpts from the work of Dipesh
                    Chakrabarty, Paul Crutzen, Jeremy Davies, and J. R. McNeill, to help frame the
                    discursive parameters and give a sense of the texture of this emergent field of
                    scholarship. A preliminary definition of the Anthropocene comes from Crutzen’s
                    brief article, <title level="a">Geology of Mankind</title>:<quote>
                        For the past three centuries, the effects of humans on the global environment 
                        have escalated. Because of these anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, 
                        global climate may depart significantly from natural behaviour for many 
                        millennia to come. It seems appropriate to assign the term “Anthropocene” 
                        to the present . . . human-dominated, geological epoch. . . . The Anthropocene 
                        could be said to have started in the latter part of the eighteenth century, 
                        when analyses of air trapped in polar ice showed the beginning of growing 
                        global concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane. This date also happens 
                        to coincide with James Watt’s design of the steam engine in 1784. (23)</quote>
            </p>
            <p>I propose one way to think about our
                    world, which is increasingly marked by anthropogenic environmental crises, is
                    that we inhabit a “wasted environment.” I mean to evoke both senses of the term
                    “waste.” First, our environment is saturated in waste (pollution, detritus, and
                    rejectamenta); second, it is an environment that itself has been wasted (missed,
                    lost, allowed to expire), in the sense of anthropogenic wasting. Wordsworth
                    evokes this second kind of waste in his poem “The world is too much with us”:
                    “The world is too much with us; late and soon, / Getting and spending, we lay
                    waste our powers” (1–2). Here, the Anthropocene is perhaps more appropriately
                    thought of as the “Anthrobscene” (to borrow Jussi Parikka’s phrase), where waste
                    becomes inextricably enmeshed with human legacy. A class discussion quickly
                    generates numerous examples of wasted environments on global and local levels. I
                    ask students to push beyond what Timothy Morton calls the “hyperobject” of
                    climate change to instead identify regional or provincial examples, of which
                    there are no shortage. Some examples generated by students include New
                    Brunswick’s atmospheric and river contamination; destructive forestry practices,
                    including the use of herbicide glyphosate spraying, a chemical used to kill
                    hardwood growth around powerlines;<note place="foot" resp="editors">The World 
                        Health Organization has classified glyphosate as a “probable carcinogenic” 
                        and California has banned its use. New Brunswick advocacy groups are calling 
                        for the end of spraying.</note> and the rapidly declining deer population, 
                as well as the increase of rare physical deformities found among deer.<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">According to CBC reports, New Brunswick’s deer population has 
                    decreased 70% in the past three decades (McEachern), while deer deformities have 
                    increased (Knopp). In both cases, glyphosate spraying is a suspected 
                    factor.</note> Their enthusiastic contributions to this discussion, and their 
                articulated feelings of anger, grief, and betrayal over their wasted environments, 
                make me hopeful that classrooms can be solvents against such waste.</p>
            <p>This pedagogical work of scaling up, bursting from the microbubble (the classroom) 
                to the macrosphere (the Anthropocene), is only the first movement we make. The 
                second movement is to pull the thin film of the present into contact with the 
                Romantic past. Yet turning backward, this <foreign xml:lang="la">hysteron 
                    proteron</foreign>—the rhetorical figure of temporal inversion—is not a nostalgic 
                or corrective move.<note place="foot" resp="editors"><foreign 
                    xml:lang="la">Hysteron proteron</foreign>, meaning “latter before,” implies 
                    both a temporal inversion, putting that which is latter first, and a
                            preposterous or disordered speech. In classical rhetoric, as Richard
                            Rand notes, it is when “two terms are reversed according to the
                            sequence, the order, temporal, spatial, causal, in which you ordinarily
                            find them” (51).</note> For as Peter Sloterdijk puts it, “It is too 
                late to dream ourselves back to a place under celestial domes whose interiors 
                would permit domestic feelings of order” (28). Instead, the goal in going about 
                things backward—the inversion of past and future—is to revitalize a present 
                relationship, to hear Romantic poetry, ideas, and problematics as a frenetic, 
                undulating constellation murmuring beneath the Anthropocene.<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">My use of <foreign xml:lang="la">hysteron proteron</foreign> is 
                    closest to Coleridge’s use of the term in <title level="m">Biographia 
                        Literaria</title>. For him, poetry’s pleasure is to be considered first 
                    rather than lastly as an effect, an inversion that he calls “a small <foreign 
                        xml:lang="la">Hysteron-Proteron</foreign>” as “the communication of pleasure 
                    is the introductory means by which alone the poet must expect to moralize his
                    readers” (<title level="m">Biographia Literaria</title> II, 131).</note> To 
                proceed backward in this <foreign xml:lang="la">hysteron proteron</foreign> is a 
                strategy befitting the preposterous and the disorderly, one that complements the 
                name that novelist Amitav Ghosh, in his recent book on climate change, gives our 
                era: “the time of the Great Derangement” (11).</p>
            <p>In what follows, I describe one lesson that
                    attempts to amplify the murmuring of what we might call the Romantic
                    Anthropocene. The lesson focuses on birdsong—a ubiquitous sound that often
                    disappears into the layers of our everyday sonic environment. Yet more than
                    that, birdsong is also a sound that is disappearing in a different way, that is,
                    as a result of anthropogenic environmental destruction. The “silent spring”
                    proposed by Rachel Carson in 1962 has given way to a more profound silence
                    where, in Keats’ words, “no birds sing,” as we face the most widespread loss of
                    birdsong human have ever experienced as a result of climate change. Indeed,
                    climate change is now the primary threat to mass avian extinction.<note place="foot" 
                        resp="editors">For a sustained examination of avian extinction, see Thom 
                        van Dooren’s <title level="m">Flight Ways</title>, which focuses on five 
                        different groups of endangered birds. Dooren explores important ethical 
                        questions (“What does it mean to care for a disappearing species? What 
                        obligations do we have to hold open space in the world for other living 
                        beings?”) but does not consider bird sound or the ethics of listening 
                        (5).</note> According to Audubon’s <title level="m">Bird and Climate Change

                            of Future Climate Change.</title></note> As one of the world’s leading 
                evolutionary biologists, Anders Pape Møller, reports, climatic conditions affect 
                bird vocalization; warmer temperatures and increased humidity and precipitation 
                alter the vegetation or “song posts” from which birds typically sing. How do we 
                respond to this? How do we hear this impending loss of sound if bird sounds are 
                already ubiquitous, if they have already, at least in some senses, disappeared—if 
                silence is already sprung?</p>
            <p>Part of the challenge, I tell my students, is to make these sounds audible again, 
                to bring them back to the summer of their full-throated ease (to riff on Keats). 
                This, I believe, is the first step toward making these sounds meaningful. 
                Indeed, my objective in teaching these poems is twofold: first, to cultivate 
                in students a sonic sensibility, one that makes them better listening subjects 
                attuned to sonic changes in their environments, and second, to extend the 
                vocalization range of Romantic bird poetry. The best-known Romantic bird poems, 
                such as Keats’s <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title> and Shelley’s <title 
                    level="a">To a Sky-lark,</title> are often read as metaphors for the work of 
                poetry itself, with the bird inevitably becoming a figure for the poet, poetry, 
                or other “flights” of imagination. To step away from these rich yet well-worn 
                readings and find new lines of flight requires a “shock to thought,” to borrow 
                a phrase by Brian Massumi.</p>
            <p>My students are slightly surprised when asked to briefly step away from the text, 
                comfortable as they are, as upper-level undergraduate students of literature, 
                with the business of close reading. But where does reading happen in the body? 
                Where, beyond the brain, is the “somatic locus,” as Garrett Stewart puts it, 
                for this silent activity of reading (238)? It is also “the organs of vocal 
                production, from diaphragm up through throat to tongue and palate” (1). This 
                “silent reading,” as Stewart calls it, “locates itself . . . in the conjoint 
                cerebral activity and suppressed muscular action of a simultaneously summoned 
                and silenced enunciation” (1). After a discussion over the complimentary nature 
                of reading and listening—a discussion supplemented by Geoffrey Hartman’s chapter 
                in <title level="m">Saving the Text</title>, where he challenges Derrida’s conflation of
                    logocentrism and phonocentrism, and Jean-Luc Nancy’s phenomenological reflection
                    on the act of listening—we discuss the stakes of this pedagogical experiment in
                    what we might call “close listening.”</p>
            <p>Close listening means to be attentive to the
                    various layers of sound—layers made visible (as I will describe in detail
                    below)—which, in turn, models an acoustic intimacy that we can transpose to the
                    poems in order to attend with greater perception to those minimal sounds or
                    other minor elements that might otherwise fade away. In a feedback loop, this
                    process also transforms readers into better listeners—that is, better listening
                    subjects that pay greater attention to those ubiquitous sounds, those metonyms
                    for the unsaid or silences within discourse.</p>
            <p>Why does listening matter, not only in terms
                    of our engagement with Romantic poetry but also with our lives within the
                    Anthropocene? Ultimately, listening may cultivate within us a heightened sonic
                    sensibility, a better perception or attunement with the world, which, one hopes,
                    will translate into acting. The effect of a “sharpened sense of perception,” as
                    sound theorist Michel Chion writes, is world changing:<quote>
                        The information that we receive and which is the matter with which we 
                        fashion our opinions and thoughts is richer and more diversified. Is what is 
                        at stake with a trained perception to lift the veil of illusion and to see 
                        reality behind the appearances? Not so much as that, but simply to become 
                        aware of our “perceiving body” and to restate it, more vigilant and more 
                        active, in that ocean of messages in which it is tossed. (241)</quote>
                While Chion suggests that language oftentimes “scotomizes” or darkens our access to 
                sound, I suggest that poetry which directly engages with sound—that sounds sound, as 
                it were—invites us to hear again. But what are we listening to, and what are we 
                listening for?</p>
            <p>This lesson brings together Romantic bird
                    poetry—selections by Charlotte Smith, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, and
                    John Clare—and contemporary digital sound art by Australian multimedia artist
                    Andy Thomas. For this particular lesson I select poems that focus on the
                    nightingale, poetry’s long-prized bird in a history that begins with the ancient
                    Greeks and Romans (Homer, Simon, and Ovid), extends through Milton, and
                    culminates in the Romantics. When we look at the etymology of the nightingale,
                    students are surprised to find the same word for nightingale in ancient Greek
                    (αηδών) already being used metaphorically for songstress, poet, and
                    poetry.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Jeni Williams makes a similar point 
                        in <title level="m">Interpreting Nightingales: Gender, Class and 
                            Histories</title> but does not attend to the metaphorical usage (20). 
                        See instead the detailed entry for αηδών (“nightingale”) in Liddell and 
                        Scott’s <title level="m">A Greek-English Lexicon</title></note> This helps 
                us think about how this association itself becomes a sustained note heard throughout 
                generations of poetry. What, I ask them, might it mean if this becomes the only way 
                we encounter this bird? Does avian extinction affect how we feel about the legacy 
                of this etymology, of the work of this metaphor?</p>
            <p>In 2013, as part of the Europeana Creative project, Thomas produced a digital sound 
                sculpture out of two bird sounds (see Figure 1). <title level="m">Nightingale and 
                    Canary</title>, the video of the two audio lifeforms, was created using
                    3D software and sound recordings of these titular birds from the archives of the
                    Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision. The brief video—less than three
                    minutes in length—is a mesmerizing, colorful display of abstract forms that
                    react to sound. As we listen to the first sound of the nightingale, abstract
                    audio lifeforms flicker and flash before our eyes. Variegated textures of thick
                    tendrils, tight folds, and loose cloudy vapors all pop and fade in rich greens,
                    purples, browns, and pinks. Sidestepping here a technical discussion of the
                    project’s digital production,<note place="end" resp="editors">Thomas’s <title 
                        level="m">Nightingale and Canary</title> reuses archived sounds and runs 
                        them through various computer-generated 3D imaging software. Thomas 
                        discusses his process and the software used: “I start by listening to the 
                        sound carefully, going for a walk, and concentrating on the sound, then I 
                        do some sketches, and search the Internet for inspiration, nature related 
                        inspiration, such as flowers and insects, whatever I feel suits the sound 
                        vision that I see in my imagination. Then I experiment with forms in my 3D 
                        software to try to emulate these visions. I take the waveform of the sound, 
                        run it into 3Ds Max and activate simple geometry with the audio float 
                        controller then use the geometry as either an emitter or a surface 
                        constraint. Then I use a variety of different particle effects: FumeFX, 
                        KRAKATOA, RealFlow, Phoenix FD, and I especially like the XSI ICE system. 
                        Finally, I render with Vray” (qtd. in Komen).</note> it suffices to note 
                that Thomas’s sound sculpture also incorporates the color of plumage and natural 
                environments of the birds (Thomas <title level="a">Visualizing the Sound</title>). 
                This detail, included in the sonic design, points to those inaudible forms within 
                the larger acoustic ecology. <title level="m">Nightingale and Canary</title> features 
                gorgeous abstract forms that twit and twitter, making visible the different layers, 
                registers, intensities, and speeds of bird sound.</p>

            <p>We typically know it when we hear it, but what
                    exactly is bird sound or birdsong? A quick gloss and brief anatomical lesson
                    serves my students and I well here: birdsong consists of “brief vocalizations
                    separated by pauses” called syllables; according to a recent scientific study,
                    “In many cases, a bird can produce these vocalizations very rapidly, several per
                    second. In these cases, the pauses are so brief that the song appears to be a
                    continuous succession of sounds” (Mindlin and Laje 13). Romantic science was
                    also interested in understanding birdsong. Surgeon and anatomist John Hunter,
                    who dissected many songbirds at the request of Daines Barrington, determined
                    strong larynx muscles to be linked to those birds with the loudest voice, and
                    found the strongest in the nightingale (Barrington 262).<note place="foot" 
                        resp="editors">Daines Barrington (judge, antiquary, and naturalist) 
                        founded <title level="j">The Naturalist’s Journal</title> in 1767, and was 
                        (along with Thomas Pennant) the real-life correspondent to Gilbert White’s 
                        <title level="m">Natural History of Selborne</title> (1789). Barrington’s 
                        essay on birdsong first appeared in the <title level="j">Philosophical 
                            Transactions</title>and was included in the third volume of 
                        Pennant’s <title level="m">British Zoology</title> (Oxford Dictionary of 
                        National Biography). Barrington offers a more lyrical definition of 
                        birdsong: “a succession of three or more different notes, which are 
                        continued without interruption during the same interval with a musical 
                        bar of four crotchets in an adagio movement, or whilst a pendulum swings 
                        four seconds” (252).</note></p>
            <p>The abstract forms that we see in <title level="m">Nightingale and Canary</title> 
                illustrate the highly controlled syringeal muscles used for vocalization in birds, 
                each vocalization appearing as an emerging visualization. Simultaneously listening 
                and seeing this visualized sound enables us to better identify the different parts 
                and textures of the vocalization. Paradoxically, this digital sound sculpture 
                enables us to think about questions of legibility, of how we can “read” our animal 
                others, and hence merges ethology with sound art and poetry. To work from an 
                ethological perspective, as Parikka puts it in <title level="m">Insect 
                    Media</title>, is to “evaluate bodies not according to their innate, 
                morphological essences but as expressions of certain movements, sensations, and 
                interactions with their environments” (xxv). Thomas’s dynamic audio lifeforms 
                call our attention back to the voice, rendering us more attentive listeners.</p>
            <p>There is good reason to be called back to sound, particularly when thinking about 
                the voice of the animal. As Tobias Menely compellingly argues in <title 
                    level="m">The Animal Claim</title>, “To recover the face of the vocal 
                imperative—its capacity to intervene or interpose, its availability to redirection 
                or remediation—is to understand community not as a closed system of reciprocal 
                entitlements, but as something constitutively open to those whose voices lay 
                claim to rights not yet recognized” (1). Following the long association between 
                the poet and the animal voice—recalling Virgil’s Orpheus who sings for the 
                animals—Menely offers that what is unique to the eighteenth-century poets of 
                sensibility (Pope, Thomson, Smart, and Cowper) is an amplified attentiveness to 
                the animal, of speaking for animals. Advocacy, he reminds us, is etymologically 
                linked to the Latin <foreign xml:lang="la">vocare</foreign>, “to call” (1). While 
                birdsong is not a voice heard in Menely’s text, we should consider what this 
                voice and advocacy means for thinking about entangled environments and shared 
                soundscapes with those that do not hold “companion species” status.<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">Companion species is Donna Haraway’s term to describe those 
                    animals we have domesticated and brought close to ourselves, such as 
                    dogs.</note></p>
            <p>I begin by having the class listen with their eyes closed as I play Thomas’s 
                <title level="m">Nightingale and Canary</title> with the projector screen turned 
                off. We then have a brief discussion about what we have heard. Students generally 
                struggle to describe the bird sounds. This, I reassure them, is to be expected. 
                For while we know what close reading involves, what are the tools of close 
                listening? Next, I play the video of <title level="m">Nightingale and 
                    Canary</title> with the screen on, and ask the class to both watch and
                    listen. We have another lively discussion after the video finishes about what
                    they have heard and watched, and what they find striking about the video. Some
                    students note that the video gives the bird sounds a language, and that they
                    could hear the sound better, able to identify in more detail because of the
                    visualization. Of course, Thomas’s audio forms are not the first visualization
                    of bird sound, and we next look at earlier spectrogram images—images that record
                    sound intensity and variations over time—of these birdsongs.<note place="foot" 
                        resp="editors">I also note in class that those who are especially interested 
                        in the visualization of these sounds may download apps such as SpectrumView, 
                        a real-time spectrogram. A future project might explore what reading a bird 
                        poem, such as Clare’s <title level="a">The Progress of Ryhme,</title> would 
                        look like on a spectrogram.</note> Another brief discussion ensues as we 
                consider the formal and affective differences between these two visualization models. 
                Students are eager to explore and share their personal responses to the models, and 
                overwhelmingly prefer the dynamism of Thomas’s audio lifeforms.</p>
            <p>Next, I ask students to keep in mind this experience, this feeling they have had with 
                the bird sound becoming visible—and, as a result, heard with new ears—and ask them 
                to bring it with them as we approach our Romantic bird poems. For here, we are also 
                invited to experience bird sound with a similar feeling of acute fascination. Indeed, 
                the goal is to transport the affect of this audio-visual experience with the audio 
                lifeforms into one we have with the Romantic bird poem. This technique, 
                another <foreign xml:lang="la">hysteron proteron</foreign>, primes the class to be 
                    able to experience such affect in relation to the sound of the animal, a figure 
                    that twit-twits and chew-chews in the background of their lives.</p>
            <p>After such audio-visual priming, I then prepare the class for reading the Romantic 
                bird poems (Smith, Coleridge, Keats, and Clare) by briefly recalling the Philomela 
                myth and the longer traditions of associating poets with birds, and birds with the 
                beautiful. Aristophanes, Ovid, Petrarch, Shakespeare, and Milton are all key figures 
                in this history. However, the greatest contextualizing comes by outlining how the 
                bird participates in the discourse of Romantic aesthetics, serving as a recurrent 
                figure for the beautiful in Edmund Burke’s <title level="m">A Philosophical Enquiry 
                    into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful</title> (1757)—a 
                text we study earlier in the term. Burke’s text formatively shapes our 
                contextualization of the poems to come. A brief rehearsal with the class of the 
                aesthetic concept of the beautiful (as distinct from the sublime) is productive, 
                as it helps to sharpen the stakes of the beautiful: “There is a wide difference 
                between admiration and love. The sublime, which is the cause of the former, always 
                dwells on great objects, and terrible; the latter on small ones, and pleasing; we 
                submit to what we admire, <emph>but we love what submits to us</emph>” (103, 
                emphasis mine). The takeaway point of Burke’s aesthetics, I stress, is how this 
                constellation of fragility, beauty, love, and submission remains a problematic, 
                tangled cluster of ideas for us today living in wasted environments. Some 
                questions that we explore include: In what ways is aesthetics tangled with an 
                ethics of ecological care? What is the role of aesthetics, and specifically the 
                beautiful, in shaping our responses to our various eco-disasters? And what kind 
                of space might that leave for ugliness? Toggling back to Thomas’s <title 
                    level="m">Nightingale and Canary</title>, how does Burke’s theory of the 
                beautiful dovetail with what we might find affecting and problematic in the 
                abstract audio lifeforms? In <title level="m">A Philosophical Enquiry</title>, 
                Burke provides a lengthy analysis of the beauty of the
                    dove, beautiful for the serpentine line of beauty, smoothness, and pleasing
                    variations in plumage: “it agrees very well with most of the conditions of
                    beauty. It is smooth and downy; its parts are (to use that expression) melted
                    into one another; you are presented with no sudden protuberance through the
                    whole, and yet the whole is continually changing” (104). Students are quick to
                    point out the ease with which Burke slides from the beautiful bird to the
                    beautiful woman, celebrating both on similar grounds, which serves as an
                    effective transition into poetry’s similar gendering of the nightingale. At 
                    this point, we discuss the intersection of eighteenth-century aesthetics, 
                    natural history, gender, and poetic representations of the nightingale as 
                    female (cf. Milton’s <title level="m">Il Penseroso</title> and Thomson’s <title 
                        level="m">Spring</title>).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Next 
                            time I teach this, I will discuss at greater length the growing 
                            counterpressure of natural history at this juncture, as 
                            eighteenth-century ornithological knowledge, contra a certain 
                            poetic tradition, comes to identify the male nightingale as the 
                            one who sings. See, for example, Daines Barrington’s <title 
                                level="a">Experiments and Observations on the Singing of 
                                Birds</title> (1773) and Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de 
                            Buffon’s <title level="m">The Natural History of Birds</title> 
                            (1770–83). For an overview of this see Bethan Roberts’s <title

                                Long Eighteenth Century.</title></note></p>
            <p>Subsequently, we turn to a close reading of the poems that treat in detail not 
                only the figure of the bird, but particularly its sound. Proceeding chronologically, 
                we begin with selections from Charlotte Smith’s <title level="m">Elegiac 
                    Sonnets</title> (1784). Sonnet III (<title level="a">To a Nightingale</title>), 
                gesturing to Petrarch, addresses the “poor melancholy bird” (1). This poem 
                foregrounds the speaker’s work as a poet, as one of “translating” the bird’s 
                voice in her work. In Sonnet VII (<title level="a">On the Departure of the 
                    Nightingale</title>), the speaker translates something of the poetic identity 
                back to the bird, here apostrophizing it as “Sweet poet of the woods,” and 
                making numerous allusions to the poetry of Shakespeare and Milton. We hear 
                nothing of what the song actually sounds like, as Smith’s sonnets immediately 
                sublimate the sound into an abstraction, a metaphor for “the soft voice of young 
                and timid Love” and “Hope’s dear voice” (Sonnet LV, <title level="a">The Return 
                    of the Nightingale,</title> 7, 14). In Smith’s sonnets the bird consistently 
                functions as a figure for poetic identity. This trope continues in 
                Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence of Poetry</title> (1821) that portrays the 
                poet as “a nightingale, who sits in darkness and sings to cheer its own solitude 
                with sweet sounds” (<title level="m">SPP</title> 486), and in Keats’s November 
                22, 1817, <title level="a">Letter to Bailey,</title> which offers a vision of 
                becoming-sparrow—two texts that students will also encounter in the course 
                (when we discuss poetic identity).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Keats writes 
                    in his letter to Bailey, 22 November 1817, “if a Sparrow come before my 
                    Window I take part in its existince [<emph>sic</emph>] and pick about the 
                    Gravel” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 1:186). However, Keats’ avian 
                    poetics is attuned to the bird’s movements rather than its sound.</note></p>
            <p>We next turn to Coleridge, a poet enormously influenced by Smith. However, 
                Coleridge, contra Smith, directly challenges the poetic tradition of associating 
                the bird with melancholy in his conversational poem <title level="m">The 
                    Nightingale,</title> published in <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> 
                (1798): “A melancholy bird! Oh! idle thought! / In nature there is nothing 
                melancholy” (14–15). Coleridge’s poem differs from Smith’s bird poems with its 
                attention to the estrangement between the material reality of the bird—a 
                reality that impresses itself through its joyful sound—and its poeticized 
                identity. Coleridge chastises the listener who projects his own negative 
                memories or feelings onto the bird, he who fills “all things with himself, 
                / And made all gentle sounds tell back the tale / Of his own sorrow” (19–21). 
                Poets, Coleridge charges, reify this association, echoing the emotional 
                projections of some first sullen human rather than the bird’s actual sounds. 
                Thus the central problem in this poetic economy is a hearing loss, as it 
                were, a restricted economy of sound that operates without carefully listening 
                to the bird itself. The solution, as the poem offers, is a model of close 
                listening. Far better for the poet would be an attentiveness to “the 
                influxes / Of shapes and sounds and shifting elements / Surrendering his 
                whole spirit, of his song” (27–29).</p>
            <p>The voice of Coleridge’s nightingale “crowds,
                    and hurries, and precipitates / With fast thick warble his delicious notes”
                    (44–45). Shifting from the individual vocalization in the second stanza, the
                    poem’s third stanza offers us a dense acoustic ecology of what a wild grove
                    teeming with nightingales sounds like:<quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
            <l>But never elsewhere in one place I knew</l>
            <l>So many nightingales; and far and near,</l>
            <l>In wood and thicket, over the wide grove,</l>
            <l>They answer and provoke each other’s song,</l>
            <l>With skirmish and capricious passalongs,</l>
            <l>And murmurs musical and swift jug jug,</l>
            <l>And one low piping sound more sweet than all—</l>
            <l>Stirring the air with such a harmony,</l>
            <l>That should you close your eyes, you might almost</l>
            <l>Forget it was not day! (55–64)</l></lg>
                    </quote>
            Sampling the nightingales’ bioacoustics—the
                    sounds birds make to communicate with one another—the poem finds avian answers
                    and provocations without pressing for a human understanding, without speculating
                    on what they are saying. Nevertheless, despite this not-knowing, the collective
                    power of their voices is illuminating (night becomes day), again part of
                    Coleridge’s efforts here to redirect the sound of the nightingale away from its
                    entrenched melancholic association. When asked what the stakes are of this poem,
                    and why Coleridge might want to shift these melancholic associations away from
                    the bird, some students provocatively suggested it could be an ethical move. One
                    student explained how attributing certain qualities, like “dangerous,” to
                    animals can lead to their demise, such as in the case of sharks. We first decide
                    that an animal is dangerous, and then we act as if we naturally find this animal
                    dangerous; humans conveniently forget their own role in shaping how we see the
                    world. So, I asked my class, is Coleridge trying to save the nightingale? In
                    some senses, yes, they answered. Another student insightfully suggested that it
                    was an effort to see past entrenched stereotypes, a comment on the importance of
                    being able to see or hear something in a new light.</p>
            <p>Next, students nestle Keats’s <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title> between 
                the tradition of associating the bird with melancholy (Smith) and those inclined 
                toward ornithological observation (Coleridge). Keats’s ode positions the 
                nightingale’s voice as a <foreign xml:lang="grc">pharmakon</foreign>,
                    as both poison and cure. The speaker, “being too happy in thine [the bird’s]
                    happiness” (6), describes in the first stanza the feeling of a “drowsy numbness”
                    that “pains / My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk” (1–2). This pleasure
                    that is also a pain comes from listening to the bird’s song that “Singest of
                    summer in full-throated ease” (10). If the birdsong is not initially
                    melancholic, and here Keats is like Coleridge, its song gradually comes to be
                    framed in these terms as the poem unfolds, later described as a “high requiem”
                    and “plaintive anthem” (60, 75). We consider this shift throughout the poem as a
                    formal indicator of the way that human pressures, especially emotional and
                    psychological ones, redress this sound. One student noted that it was as if
                    Keats (like Coleridge) knew he shouldn’t associate the nightingale with
                    melancholy, but then ultimately gives in and does. What might contribute to this
                    melancholic indulgence, to this “giving in”? I direct students to stanza six,
                    which ruminates on the openness of the birdsong throughout human history. Here,
                    the speaker imagines the birdsong he hears to be the same one that “found a path
                    / Through the sad heart of Ruth” (65–66) and “The same that oft-times hath /
                    Charm’d magic casements, opening on the foam / Of perilous seas, in faery lands
                    forlorn” (68–70). The sound, students suggest, is a way of establishing a
                    connection back to the beginning of time; the speaker is motivated to treat the
                    sound this way perhaps because he is lonely. After all, they note, we don’t
                    encounter any other sounds (of, say, human companions) in the poem. Like the
                    illuminating power that Coleridge ascribes to the nightingale’s sound, Keats’s
                    poem imagines this sound’s affective power, unlocking hearts and casements
                    alike. Like the dynamic sound of the nightingale that was championed in
                    Coleridge’s poem and richly visualized and heard in Thomas’s audio lifeforms,
                    Keats’s poem cannot fix the sound to one melody or concept (contra Smith).</p>
            <p>The final poet we study in this lesson is John
                Clare, beginning with <title level="a">The Nightingales Nest,</title> a poem that 
                immediately calls for quiet: “lets softly rove / And list the nightingale—she 
                dwelleth here / Hush let the wood gate softly clap” (1–3). With the invitation to 
                listen and to follow, readers travel “through matted thorns” (13) to nestle down 
                and watch the nightingale as it sings:<quote>
                    <lg type="stanza">
            <l>Her wings would tremble in her extacy</l>
            <l>And feathers stand on end as twere with joy</l>
            <l>And mouth wide open to release her heart</l>
            <l>Of its out sobbing songs—the happiest part</l>
            <l>Of summers fame she shared (22–26)</l>
                    </lg></quote>
            Students admitted to being the least interested in this poem. Clare’s language was 
            estranging to some, and unnerving to at least one student who felt the poem strangely 
            sexualized the bird through its descriptions, pointing out key words: the singing 
            bird as “trembling” in “ecstasy” with a wide-open mouth. Is this, I asked, a bird 
            orgasm? Students laughed and blushed. (Things you never thought you’d say in the 
            classroom). Inviting serious discussion on this latter point, I asked students to 
            think about the rhetorical strategy of this representation. It makes Clare, lurking 
            in the bush, look “super creepy” (their words), but if we apply this thinking more 
            broadly to humanity, it becomes a critique of the act of looking. Is looking a kind 
            of touching? Is there not a kind of voyeurism operating in this poem? And what ways 
            does this looking become a kind of bad touching? I asked students to pause in 
            answering that last question, as we moved past Clare’s unique attention to the 
            physiological features of the singing bird, and turned to the poem’s next object 
            choice: the nest itself, an object overlooked in the other studied poems. I invited 
            students to describe the nest. They were underwhelmed by its description, almost 
            disappointed to find that the nest appears to be haphazardly constructed with loose 
            materials, dead leaves, and scraps of grass. The flowers surrounding the nest itself, 
            one student noted, are prettier than the nest. Another student remarked that one 
            doesn’t typically find an ugly or mediocre object as the focus of a poem. Another 
            student called attention to the way that the nest itself doesn’t seem to be special, 
            but Clare transforms it by including it in the poem, and thus makes it 
            special. <emph>What kind of nest are you looking for?</emph> I handed out scrap 
                paper and asked my students to draw me a nest. What became apparent is how the 
                students envision the Ideal Nest, a round, tightly woven structure, some with 
                perfectly shaped eggs nestled at the bottom. We circulated the drawings while 
                talking about what it means, then, to encounter a nest that doesn’t fit with 
                their idealizations. Suddenly, students found the poem to be asking us to 
                attend to differences and to that which defies our expectations. Suddenly, 
                Clare isn’t such a dirty bird.</p>
            <p>Having moved from the bird’s physiology to its nest, I next draw my students’ 
                attention to the changes in bird sound as humans approach the nest:<quote>
            <lg type="stanza">
                <l rendition="#indent5">now near</l>
                <l>Her nest she sudden stops—as choking fear</l>
                <l>That might betray her home so even now</l>
                <l>Well leave it as we found it—safetys guard</l>
                <l>Of pathless solitude shall keep it still (59–63)</l>
            </lg></quote>
                Between the close attention to the bird’s shift in vocalization and the nest 
                itself, Clare’s poem now offers us a glimpse into human interference, that is, 
                the silences that are the result of the human listening subject. I 
                stress <emph>human</emph> listening subject here because the poem also frames 
                the bird’s environment itself (“a wilderness of listening leaves” [32]) as a 
                listening subject. The poem explores the idea that while humans are not the 
                only listening subjects, they are the only ones that are disruptive: the “rude 
                boys” and the speaker himself are the only ones in the poem that make the bird 
                mute.</p>
            <p>In the poem’s final stanza, the speaker
                    promises the bird that “We will not plunder music of its dower / Nor turn this
                    spot of happiness to thrall” (69–70). Here, we pause over the promises humanity
                    makes to animals and the environment. How are such promises to “leave them still
                    unknown to wrong” (92) perhaps compromised by the speaker’s desire to see what
                    he hears, to pursue the nightingale to her hiding places? While we might
                    recognize the speaker’s desire for minimal interference, in what ways might we
                    be skeptical of this possibility? In short: do we believe our speaker? This
                    question made for a lively discussion. Some students insisted that we should not
                    believe the speaker because he has already tracked and followed her down this
                    far, and has already crossed a line he shouldn’t have. Others cautiously offered
                    a more optimistic reading: that we should trust him precisely because he has
                    come this far and then turns away, and has caused no real harm to the bird.
                    Other students responded, in turn, by noting that the speaker has caused
                    distress to the bird just by coming close to the nest, evident in her being
                    described as “choking fear.” What if human looking always brings with it some
                    kind of violence? What if looking is a kind of fetishizing or sexualizing that
                    becomes a plundering? I leave these questions unanswered as a way to segue into
                    our final poem.</p>
            <p>While the human-caused silence of birds is a
                    repeated concern throughout Clare’s poetry, I conclude the lesson with one last
                    poem, the short “Birds in Alarm,” which consists of ornithological observations
                    of the different threat responses of birds. The poem catalogues the silence of
                    the yellow hammer, nightingale, and pewet when their nests are found alongside
                    the wrens’ “chitter loud” and the robins’ “hollow tut” (13, 14). The poem
                    extends similar concerns as “The Nightingales Nest” and helps build an
                    additional dimension into Clare’s sensibility, his interest in bird sound and
                    the conditions of silence. This, I offer, textures Clare’s sensibility, his
                    self-described approach in his natural history letters to “looking” with a
                    “poetic feeling” at the environment:<quote>
                        I love to look on nature with a poetic feeling which magnifys the pleasure 
                        I love to see the nightingale in its hazel retreat &amp; the cuckoo hiding 
                        in its solitudes of oaken foliage &amp; not to examine their carcasses in 
                        glass cases yet naturalists &amp; botanists seem to have no taste for this 
                        poetical feeling they merely make collections of dryd specimens classing 
                        them after Leanius into tribes &amp; familys. (<title level="m">The Natural 
                            History Prose Writings</title> 38)</quote>
                We discuss what Clare means by looking with a poetic feeling. To look with a poetic 
                feeling, as Clare puts it, is not to imagine nature as pristine or untouched. It is 
                to take pleasure in animals alive and in their habitats, to put them under the 
                magnifying power of poetry rather than look at them as classified “carcasses in 
                glass cases.” Students suggested that it is a way of capturing the life or vitality 
                of the animal, as opposed to the lifeless, stuffed specimen that one could encounter 
                in a museum. What Clare is talking about, another student noted, is a different 
                experience: of engaging with an animal alive versus dead. One of the experiential 
                differences between the animal alive or dead is a dimension we often overlook: its 
                sound. For Clare, sound and our attention to it by listening is key to being able to 
                look with a poetic feeling. As Stephanie Kuduk Weiner notes, Clare celebrates 
                “listening as a means of making sense of the world” (382). In considering the 
                activity of listening as a way of engaging with and making sense of the world around 
                us, my students and I come away from our reading of Clare with a heightened sense 
                for the benefits (the magnified pleasures) of listening to the world around us. 
                Could listening be a solution to the trouble with looking? This is a bigger 
                question, one that kicks us out of the cozy nest that we’ve created for ourselves 
                with these Romantic bird poems, and back out into the hot, carbon-filled atmosphere 
                of the Anthropocene.</p>
            <p>To approach Romantic bird poetry with such a
                    poetic feeling, as I understand Clare’s phrase to mean, demands our
                    participation in the soundscape; this is what my overlaying of these poems by
                    Smith, Coleridge, Keats, and Clare with Andy Thomas’s digital sound sculpture
                    attempts. Attending to the “dust of the lark that Shelley heard” means more than
                    searching for a “little ball of feather and bone,” to borrow the words of Thomas
                    Hardy (<title level="a">Shelley’s Skylark</title>). It is to think and listen for that which otherwise
                    wastes away. For these poems call us to be attuned, to be listening, which, as
                    Jean-Luc Nancy puts it, means “to be straining toward a possible meaning, and
                    consequently one that is not immediately accessible” (6). Listening is different
                    from hearing, as hearing “is to understand the sense . . . to understand at
                    least the rough outline of a situation” (6). To hear something is to recognize
                    already and thus partially understand the source or message. To listen is rather
                    the act of being open to the unknown, to be unsure of the source or message. As
                    part of our closing discussion and reflection on the week spent on these poems,
                    I confess that while I hope my students have heard me and one another and that
                    they have at least roughly understood our discussions, I would be happiest if
                    what they took from our discussions was an enhanced commitment to listening in
                    their lives beyond the classroom.</p>
            <p>The pedagogical payoff of learning to listen
                    in the Anthropocene is substantial and undoubtedly exceeds the parameters of the
                    Romantic classroom. It is a defiant gesture against the anthropocentric work of
                    letting go in the way it actively opens up subjects to the more than
                    human.<note place="foot" resp="editors">I am gesturing here to Roy Scranton’s 
                        work in <title level="m">Learning to Die in the Anthropocene</title>, which 
                        makes the case for the importance of letting go: “learning to let go of the 
                        ego, the idea of the self, the future, certainty, attachment, the pursuit of 
                        pleasure, permanence, and stability. Learning to let go of salvation. 
                        Learning to let go of hope. Learning to let go of death” (92).</note> What 
                might have happened if Orpheus had only listened to Eurydice’s footsteps instead of 
                turning around to see her? Listening turns us outward, an act worth taking—especially 
                when it is toward a wasted environment.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Listening is 
                    also one of the “arts of noticing” that Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing identifies as a tool 
                    for survival in the Anthropocene. See chapter 1 in <title level="m">The Mushroom 
                        at the End of the World</title>.</note> As I tell my students, to be 
                listening is “a straining toward”; it opens us to the unknown, the sonorous, an act 
                that places us “on the
                    edge of meaning” rather than within understanding or meaning itself (Nancy 9,
                    7). This heightened sense of perception, in turn, makes us more aware of
                    perceptual bodies, both our own and of nonhuman others. Listening is not only a
                    way of “looking” with a “poetic feeling” in Clare’s sense, but is also one
                    strategy in the cultivation of an ethics of care for all that will be
                    wasted.</p>
            <p>To listen is to be attentive to that which is
                    elusive and unfamiliar. Moreover, when listening is also synesthetic, as in the
                    case of the sound sculptures used in class, these bring the additional benefit
                    of exposing “us to stimuli that may stress and strain the ‘structures’ of
                    sensory apprehension we have developed to organize sound, sight, and touch into
                    meaning” (Heard 58). To break us out of the habitual ways of making sense of the
                    world is one way to rethink our ways of being in the Anthropocene.</p>
            <p>Listening, as Salomé Voegelin notes, “produces
                    me as a dynamic subjectivity intertwined with the dynamic things . . . The sonic
                    self finds the collective from his solitary agency of listening through his body
                    rather than through language” (94). As I try to stress to my students, listening
                    is a form of acting. To actively cultivate listening students is to prepare them
                    for greater civic and public engagement with the world, waste and all. In
                    sharpening their perceptions by calling attention to sound, and particularly
                    sounds that are wasting away, we create a new relation to the world by inviting
                    them to become more self-aware of the ways they are perceptible bodies, not just
                    reading and writing machines (which they often feel like in the thick of the
                    semester). If students learn to become, in the words of Chion, “more vigilant
                    and more active” (241) in the space of the classroom through lessons like this
                    one, the hope is that they will become more creative thinkers and problem
                    solvers, more active, perceptually aware citizens out in the community who will
                    be committed to, in Donna Haraway’s words, “staying with the trouble,” or
                    working with and through the waste.</p>
