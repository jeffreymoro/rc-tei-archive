                <p rend="noCount">In this article, I present a way of teaching John
                    Keats’s <title level="a">I stood tip-toe upon a little hill</title> and 
                    <title level="m">Endymion</title> (amongst other Romantic-era poetical and prose works) 
                    as queerly ecological and as useful components of a pedagogical paradigm serviceable 
                    to those wishing to discuss environmental issues in the Anthropocene. The article shows 
                    the interdependencies of earthiness and eroticism in two short poems by Keats who was,
                    as I argue, not simply a sensualist but a subversive nature poet that imbued the
                    environment with erotic energy and promoted the conservationist practice of
                    tiptoeing as the best way of feeling the earth beneath one’s feet. It then examines
                    how <title level="m">Endymion</title>, with its well-known “Pleasure Thermometer”
                    passage, enacts a queer ecology that resonates in instructive ways vis-à-vis Timothy
                    Morton’s theorization of “the mesh.” The texts discussed here provide an instruction
                    manual for scholars and teachers investigating nineteenth-century depictions of
                    interdependencies in the natural world and human sexuality in a current Anthropocene
                    that threatens the futures of both of these phenomena.</p>

            <p>Close attention to the poetical works of John Keats and the dually queer and
                ecological dependencies evident in these works can facilitate ways of interrogating
                nature (and the end of nature) in the college classroom. For instance, students and
                I might ask, what commonalities do queer people and the natural world share beyond
                their innate diversity—or what Burke called the “infinite variety of forms”
                locatable in the beauty of flowers—and the fact that their rights are continually
                under siege (86)? Provided your students have already read Blake, and Burke, my
                epigraph is a strong starting point because it propounds a view of nature that is
                blurry at best. Without an outline, “nature” exists in a state of
                <emph>a priori</emph> indeterminacy, awaiting the
                ordering instincts of the human. Any classroom discussion of a queer ecological
                perspective—its origins, its outlines, its objectives in the ecocidal and homophobic
                world we inhabit in the Anthropocene—should start precisely there, with nature’s
                lack of a rigid outline because nature and sexuality, especially queer sexuality and
                identity, have a certain open-endedness in common. The “Q” in LGBTQ politics (and
                studies) has, for now, put a provisional period after the four-part acronym that
                precedes it, but who really knows where it will find its terminus? The etymology of
                “queer,” after all, can be traced to the word “<emph>-twerkw</emph>,” or
                “across,” in its Indo-European root, so, in terms of queerness (where it starts and
                where it stops), it’s unrestricted. BLTGQ—it’s amusing to rearrange the letters as
                one might turn a Rubik’s Cube—slips out of our hands every time, and like the old
                word “nature,” the new word “LGBTQ” (as a critical discourse <emph>and</emph> as 
                way of identifying oneself and others) is as intersectional as it is infinite.</p>
            <p>Whenever I encounter a wiggly word like “nature,” one that wears a thick patina of
                    <emph>strange familiarity</emph>, I ask students to assist me in
                better breaking down that word and its various meanings for the Romantics and their
                predecessors. You might invite your students to list, or even cluster-diagram, its
                multiple meanings or ask whether a univocal “nature” is even necessary. In 2006,
                Scott Hess began his invaluable handbook for teaching Romanticism vis-à-vis ecology
                in <title level="j">Romantic Circles</title> with Raymond Williams’ definition of
                nature as an entry point though his purview was confined to Clare and to the
                Wordsworths. A lot has changed in 11 years, and living in the new geological epoch
                known as the Anthropocene (coined, in 2000, by the atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen)
                means that the human impact on the earth is already a deep and damaging one. The
                environmental and evolutionary impacts of mass extinction are unknowable. As a newsy
                neologism, “Anthropocene” has belatedly gone mainstream, appearing in
                <title level="j">The New York Times Magazine</title> in February of 2017 under the 
                bold-print heading, “Only Human,” and in the <title level="j">London Review 
                    of Books</title> the term was described as having a “luscious
                mouth-feel” and as seeming “just the thing to bring new urgency and direction to all
                the tired old arguments about climate change, resource depletion, the future of the
                planet” (Turner 23). Tired? Old? Never has the future of Planet Earth been treated
                so dismissively. It’s useful, then, to present your class with other instances of
                the Anthropocene in the headlines. Citing what he calls the “ephemera” of the daily
                news—permafrost melting, the Exxon Mobil chairman appointed as Secretary of State,
                America’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord—Wesley Yang, in the <title 
                    level="j">Times</title>, writes: “Our inability to connect the day’s ephemera
                with the geological time scale has summoned a striking neologism,” namely “the
                Anthropocene, or the ‘Age of Man’” (9).</p>
            <p>Ecological approaches to Romantic-age literature have never been more urgent, but how
                do you teach the Age of Man and its congruence with the Age of the Straight Man in
                relation to English Romantic literature, or, put another way, how do you teach queer
                ecological practices in the classroom when time is running out? Presenting your
                students with the aforesaid articles, culled from the popular press, can potentially
                open a dialogue about living in and, more importantly, <emph>surviving</emph> the 
                Anthropocene. One more way into this pressing question can be found in
                <title level="m">Half-Earth: Our Planet’s Fight for Life</title> (2016)
                by Edward O. Wilson in which he postulates the following thought experiment:<quote>
                    Suppose that in the far-distant future geologists were to dig through Earth’s 
                    crusted deposits to the strata spanning the past thousand years of our time. 
                    There they would encounter sharply defined layers of chemically altered soil. 
                    They would recognize the physical and chemical signatures of rapid climate 
                    changes. They would uncover abundant fossil remains of domesticated plants and 
                    animals that had replaced, suddenly and globally, most of Earth’s prehuman 
                    fauna and flora. They would excavate fragments of machines, and a veritable 
                    museum of deadly weapons. (9)</quote>
                This is a probing passage, not the least because it stridently asserts that the earth
                is not ours and that <foreign xml:lang="la">Homo sapiens</foreign> is a
                guest here with an unknown check-out time. Is it already too late to employ
                questions of the environment, and its potential end, to the critical learning
                environment that is the college classroom? An article by Ron Wagler in
                <title level="m">The American Biology Teacher</title> appears to
                have beaten us “nonscience” humanities folks to the punch; Wagler explains the major
                effects of diminishing global biodiversity, including habitat destruction,
                pollution, and climate change, but reminds us that education, while not exactly the
                silver bullet, is an important start. He claims: “one component of possibly reducing
                the rising anthropogenic affects [<emph>sic</emph>] associated with the
                current Anthropocene mass extinction is education” (80). To that end, one way to
                connect the Epoch of Man with the Epoch of the Straight Man is to ask students to
                “dig through” the deposits leading to the sedimentation of heterosexuality as
                “natural.” How, for example, does Foucault imply a depth model when he famously
                claims that the homosexual was invented in fin-de-siècle Anglo-American culture? Ken
                Bain, in <title level="m">What the Best College Teachers Do</title>, contends that
                queries like “What’s the next question?” and “What can we ask now?” propel any
                discussion forward (103). The next questions, in this context, seem to be: <emph>How 
                    can we queer the Anthropocene? How does the threat of mass
                    extinction assume that humanity is uniformly reproductive and leave out the role
                    of LGBTQ people in preserving a natural world that they have not necessarily
                    replenished with new life-forms but are no less dedicated to preserving?</emph> 
                The readiness of Romanticism is all; woven into the poetical works of Keats,
                discussed below, is the embeddedness of erotic life in our natural world. How does
                the interconnectedness (a hallmark of ecological science) of straight and queer
                life-forms affect our conceptions of a monolithic “Man” that may or may not be
                reaching its finitude? With the advent of more socially liberal-minded approaches to
                human health and sexuality, we are beginning to see the permeability of the borders
                between different sexual orientations and practices.</p>
            <p>Before answering that crucial question and providing what I have found to be a few
                successful approaches, I want to return one more time to the lexical locale where
                Hess began back in 2006—that is, with Raymond Williams’s 1976 outline of nature’s
                various meanings, which has endured for good reason. Calling nature “perhaps the
                most complex word in the language,” Williams added the following on the word’s
                etymology: “The relevant L[atin] phrase for the developed meanings is <foreign 
                    xml:lang="la">natura rerum</foreign>—the nature of things, which already in some
                L[atin] uses was shortened to <foreign xml:lang="la">natura</foreign>—the constitution 
                of the world” (219). Its first two meanings can denote (1) an external nonhuman entity
                (e.g. “wild nature” or “nature-lover”) but also (2) a directional force with agentic
                power, as in “Let nature run its course,” a “law of nature,” or, closer to home, the
                Wordsworthian injunction, “Let Nature be your teacher” (whereby the poet operates as
                a substitute teacher). Students will more readily recall the caveat of Dr. Ian
                Malcom in Spielberg’s <title level="m">Jurassic Park</title> (1993) who challenges 
                the park’s creator by refuting the idea that bringing condors back from the brink of
                extinction is different than resurrecting the thoroughly extinct Tyrannosaurus rex:
                “Dinosaurs had their shot and nature selected them for extinction . . . what you
                call discovery, I call the rape of the natural world.” Unlike the T-Rex, <foreign 
                    xml:lang="la">Homo sapiens</foreign> may become the only species in history who
                consciously willed its own extinction.</p>
            <p>A third but by no means final meaning of “nature” refers to someone or something’s
                    essence.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Often the meanings of “nature” are 
                        interassimilated in themselves. A clear proof of this lies in the queerest 
                        of Shakespeare’s sonnets, Sonnet 20, which begins “A woman’s face, with 
                        Nature’s own hand painted, / Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion” 
                        (1–2). Here nature possesses the agency of a painter, but the line’s meaning 
                        is also blurry, for it’s this pretty face’s lack of cosmetic that makes it 
                        “naturally” beautiful.</note> A clear proof of this can be
                found in the spirited debate between Anne Elliot and Captain Harville over the
                “nature” of a man’s affection (versus a woman’s) in Jane Austen’s <title 
                    level="m">Persuasion</title> (1817); Harville asserts that “if the change be not from
                outward circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature, man’s nature,” to
                which Elliot replies: “No, no, it is not man’s nature” (242). But those are only its
                pedestrian and depoliticized usages; once the binarism of “natural” versus
                “unnatural” makes its discursive entry, “nature” becomes a polarizing term.<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">For Romantic-era judgment premised on the binarism of natural 
                    versus unnatural, see Austen’s <title level="m">Persuasion</title> and her subtle
                            abjuration of her heroine Anne Elliot’s development: “She had been
                            forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew
                            older—the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning” (69).</note> Surely 
                we can all agree that Wordsworth died of <emph>natural</emph> causes at the ripe old 
                age of 80, while the same cannot be said about Austen (aged 41), Wollstonecraft (38), 
                Shelley (29), or Polidori and Keats (both 25). Within a few weeks of teaching Romanticism, 
                you should have enough references to “nature” to point out these multifarious meanings 
                to spur a spirited discussion. Even thornier is the painfully reductive and false dilemma
                known as “nature versus nurture,” as it relates to sexuality, which, more than a
                century ago, Freud claimed was not complex enough to “cover all the issues” involved
                in sexual matters, especially the cause of “inversion” and all “its varieties” of
                sexual behavior (6–7). More recently Timothy Morton has observed that disability
                studies and queer theory have a vested interest in contesting the “idea of natural
                and unnatural altogether” (700).</p>
            <p>What are the benefits of a queer ecological standpoint in the Age of Man, and how, as
                a discussion leader, can you ascertain how the Romantics wade into this double
                threat to political justice and futurity? First, queer ecology rejects any
                conception of a transcendental and ahistorical nature and insists we fully feel the
                earth and our proximity to other living things. Following Morton, Christopher
                Schmidt (2012) comments that by dispensing with the nature/culture division, which
                only facilitates the othering of nature as “over there” and thereby easier to
                exploit, “queer nature is thus one possible avenue for looking at . . .
                environmental problems differently” and for rejecting the fantasy of a “transcendent
                nature” (73–74). Queer ecology forces teachers and students alike to confront the
                queerness within; nonbinary identities and practices are, after all, only natural.
                Consider the fact that, in 2017, a female zebra shark in an Australian aquarium gave
                birth three years after she had last seen her sexual mate. Biologists say this is
                evidence of a vertebrate swapping its sexuality from sexual to asexual reproduction
                (known as parthenogenesis) due to captivity. The shark, whose name is Leonie, lived
                with its partner for six years but only after it was moved to a separate tank did it
                lay eggs. This unusual fact prompted one reporter to query: “Are the guys really
                obsolete” (Cummins)? Such a question cannot be answered here but it does support
                what Morton, the unofficial father of queer ecology, wrote in the
                <title level="j">PMLA</title> in 2010 when he first outlined the
                concept of queer ecology: “Biodiversity and gender diversity are deeply intertwined
                . . . cells reproduce asexually, like their single-celled ancestors and the
                blastocyst attached to the uterus wall at the start of pregnancy” (276). If you wish
                to teach queer ecology, Morton’s inaugural essay is another useful starting point,
                and in Morton’s wide-ranging style, it includes Carolyn Merchant’s
                <title level="m">The Death of Nature</title> and Jon Krakauer’s
                    <title level="m">Into the Wild</title>. So, too, is Stacy
                Alaimo’s <title level="a">Eluding Capture: The Science, Culture, and Pleasure of 
                    ‘Queer Animals,’</title> which considers the infamous kink of bonobos, the 
                all-male families of the flightless bird known as the Greater Rhea, the more than 
                28,000 sexes of mushrooms, and identifies what Alaimo calls the “queer, green, place, 
                in which pleasure, desire, and the proliferation of differing lifeworlds provoke intense, 
                ethical, reactions” (67). I will try to deploy the Mortonesque style here as well, 
                which, at the risk of seeming scattershot, casts the critical net wide in the hopes of
                providing my colleagues with a myriad of texts with which they can cultivate their
                own pedagogic gardens.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, I promise not to wander but to patiently stay in one place, and to
                focus on the practice of tiptoeing in Keats’s poetical works with the aim of
                revealing the queerly ecological implications of treading lightly across the earth.
                Whoever or <emph>whatever</emph> she is, Keats’s
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">femme fatale</foreign> Lamia is a tiptoer: “She
                rose / Tiptoe with white arms spread” (l.287). Rose-like, Lamia opens her arms and
                embraces an earth of which she is and is <emph>not</emph> a natural part.
                Regardless, her human lover Lycius sees Lamia’s ability to tiptoe, arms spread, as
                an “amorous promise” and, in what follows, the act of tiptoeing as an affective
                embrace, of nature and of queerness, will become increasingly clear (287–90).
                Centering on one lyric in particular, “I stood tip-toe upon a little hill” (1816), I
                will demonstrate how Keatsian tiptoeing can direct a classroom discussion about
                nature, nonnormative sexuality, and what their important overlap means to teaching
                Romanticism in the Anthropocene. The act of tiptoeing in the works of Keats is a
                green <emph>and</emph> pink practice insofar as it effaces man’s footsteps altogether. 
                Both “footstep” and “animal track” are derived from the Latin <foreign 
                    xml:lang="la">vestigium</foreign> (from which we derive “vestige”). In
                what follows, I will outline not nature, which invariably wiggles out of a very
                human effort to objectify it as a “thing”—pinned and wriggling on the wall, in the
                parlance of T. S. Eliot—but will instead outline the ways in which queer ecology can
                be articulated in the classroom.</p>

            <p>Biographical approaches to the Romantic poets never fails to hold students’
                attention, and the fact that Keats’s letters both clarify <emph>and</emph> obfuscate 
                his poetical works is scarcely in doubt. A mixture of Keats’s letters and a few clips 
                of your choosing from Jane Campion’s 2009 biopic, <title level="m">Bright Star</title>, 
                help to bring the author to life. From a queer point of view, his letter to his younger 
                brother George and sister-in-law Georgiana, written in the fall of 1819, is a jaw-dropper. 
                Presented to students as a window into Keats’s conceptions of gender, his letter is 
                not as intensely gynophobic as his anxious outpouring to Benjamin Bailey (penned the
                previous summer) in which he decries the great gulf between the sexual fantasies he
                had as a schoolboy and the “reality” of being in a “Lady’s Company” as a grown man
                (264). This is the letter (frequently anthologized) wherein Keats confesses that,
                amongst men, he harbors “no evil thoughts, no malice, no spleen,” whereas, in the
                company of women, he feels those very emotions and is in a “hurry to be gone” (265).
                Keats was at his most prodigious during the summer of 1818 when, in a long line of
                close male friendships, his friendship with John Hamilton Reynolds was as close as
                could be, and the poets walked on Hampstead Heath and recited poetry to each other.
                Prompted by his brother’s recent marriage and impending emigration to America, Keats
                shows enough self-awareness in his letter to Bailey that he apologizes for giving
                voice to such “perversity” (265). By no means gone for good, such perverse feelings
                resurfaced in the fall of 1819 when he addressed George directly in letter form and
                again praised the positive effects of living in homosocial confines wherein men can
                “interassimulate” with each other (265). Here Keats confesses to feeling lonely and
                “altered” due to his brother’s absence and credits the act of letter writing as a
                way of assuaging that pain:<quote>
                    This is the reason why men who had been bosom friends, on being separate for any 
                    number of years, afterwards meet coldly, neither of them knowing why—The fact is 
                    they are both altered—Men who live together have a silent moulding and influencing 
                    power over each other—They interassimulate. ‘T is an uneasy thought. (369)</quote>
                Keats’s conception of masculine interassimilation is a radical development of
                Wordsworth’s word choice in <title level="a">Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern
                Abbey</title>—“interfused” (l.97)—and with a cheeky pun on intercourse <foreign 
                    xml:lang="la">per anum</foreign>—it’s self-consciously queer in its embrace of 
                same-sex domesticity and the “moulding” influence, or persuasiveness, men exert over 
                each other when they cohabitate. As for their not “knowing why,” there is a clear
                self-deception at work, resulting in the coldness Keats attributes to masculine
                friendships. In <title level="m">The Keats Brothers</title>, biographer Denise Gigante
                comments that, in the context of the sonnet <title level="a">To My Brother 
                    George,</title> John’s writings for George register the “deep need for human 
                connection that the fraternal bond fulfilled,” and that whenever George was far from 
                John, the poet “discovered thoughts and feelings inside himself that he might not 
                otherwise have known” (14). Rachel Schulkins, in <title level="m">Keats, Modesty and 
                    Masturbation</title>, goes further by identifying the poet’s “outbursts against 
                the opposite sex” as proof not just of his “conflicted feelings towards women” but 
                of his “misogynistic tendencies” (9). Perhaps this accounts for why his admission that 
                he prefers the company of men over that of women to George ends in the very same way 
                his outpouring to Bailey does, that is, with anxiety (i.e., “uneasy thought” and 
                disappointment in himself as a man). Albeit essentializing, I sometimes ask my 
                classes: <emph>Women in the room, how does this text make you uneasy? And, for the men, 
                    what strikes you as out of the ordinary here, and why?</emph></p>
            <p>I have had success in the classroom by using three poems, of increasing length, by
                Keats to demonstrate his queer kind of interassimilating with other humans and with
                nature. The first is his sonnet <title level="a">On the Grasshopper and Cricket</title> 
                (1816), which is hardly queer, unless you admit the presence of animal jouissance in 
                the insatiate grasshopper—“never done / With his delights” (l.6–7)—though it is ecologically
                minded inasmuch as it depicts a zombified earth that is “never dead” (1). What the
                Shelleyist William A. Ulmer once identified as the “hydrogen cycle” at work in <title 
                    level="m">Adonais</title> (1821) can also be located in Keats’s first quatrain:
                to avoid a “hot sun,” birds hide in “cooling trees,” which implies a leafy sort of
                shade but the potential aftereffects of rain, now a mist (216). Either way, the
                birds are, in the parlance of <title level="a">To Autumn,</title> the “close bosom-friend[s] 
                    of the maturing sun” (l.2), and the union of the eponymous season with the sun, as 
                    Helen Vendler has recently noted, is a procreative one, since it “makes her bear fruit”
                (259). The bosom-friends in this earlier sonnet are the eponymous insect organisms
                and, implicitly, the poet himself who translates their unintelligible voices into a
                single discrete poetic form: the sonnet. The “new-mown mead,” wherein the poem takes
                place, features a variety of vegetation (trees, hedges, weeds, and grass upon the
                hillside) and the salient seasonality at work in the poem (moving from “summer
                luxury” to “winter evening”) reinforces the living cycle and Keats’s idea of the
                sonneteer as nature’s spokesman (4–10). Working in a self-interested mode, then, the
                poem serves two masters: nature <emph>and</emph> an Elysium (or paradisiacal afterlife) 
                    reserved for England’s finest poets, that “abode,” as Shelley calls it in the final 
                    line of <title level="m">Adonais</title>, “where the Eternal are” (l.495). In short, 
                    poets are a force for environmental good. Thus the poet cherishes the earth as 
                    a living community in the ecological sense,
                that is, not merely as a gathering of organisms in one place but as the adaptations
                that diverse species make for each other and for themselves. John Curtis conceived,
                for example, of any plant community as a “web of species connected by rubber bands”
                because “if you move the status of one species, it changes the tension of all the
                other species” (qtd. in Allen and Hoekstra 156–57).</p>
            <p>The second of the poems applicable to a queer ecological paradigm is <title 
                level="a">I Stood Tip-Toe</title> (completed at the end of 1816 as a precursor to <title 
                    level="m">Endymion</title>, which was the title Keats originally assigned to it but later
                abandoned). Here Keats resists stratification and represents <foreign xml:lang="la">Homo
                    sapiens</foreign> and nonhuman Nature as inextricably interassimilated. Brimming with
                bugs (bees and moths), birds (ring-doves and goldfinches), and flower buds (laburnum
                and marigolds), <title level="a">I Stood Tip-Toe</title> includes detailed descriptions 
                of nature’s processes, or what Keats calls “Nature’s gentle doings” (l.63). Building on 
                Alan Bewell’s reading of flowers at the poem’s opening as surrogate women—replete with
                sensuous curves and diadems—Schulkins has called <title level="a">I Stood Tip-Toe</title> 
                a “celebration of nature’s eroticism and its symbiotic relationship, where each natural 
                object benefits from its association with another” (45). The mutually beneficial effects of
                those associations are integral to Keatsian interassimilation though he uses the
                word “interchange” in line 85 to mean essentially the same thing but with a queerish
                twist: nature is imbued with anthropoid feeling, as in “the ripples seem glad right
                glad to reach those cresses, / And cool themselves among the em’rald tresses” (81–82). 
                What Keats calls “variety” (l.16), ecologists now call <emph>biodiversity</emph>, 
                and in keeping with the poems outlined here, human eroticism is naturalized as part 
                of a wider erotic force at work in the biosphere. This is
                especially salient in <title level="m">Endymion</title>, a discussion of which will
                end this essay and highlight the queerest and most ecologically alert components of
                Keats’s oeuvre.</p>
            <p>Keats’s use of the first-person pronoun to commence his poem—“I stood tip-toe upon a
                little hill”—effectively establishes the sovereignty of the outward eye throughout
                the poem (l.1). The human eye is the organ that reigns supreme, which Keats
                reinforces with scopophilic lines such as “I gazed awhile” and “many pleasures to my
                vision started” (23–26), and through the imperative: “But turn your eye” (80).
                Still, if the primary sensory organ that makes <title level="a">On the 
                    Grasshopper</title> cohere is the human ear, <title level="a">I Stood 
                        Tip-Toe</title> is organized around the theme of vision and seeing
                nature not as a lazy onlooker but—to borrow from Seamus Heaney—as an “artful voyeur”
                (113). “Linger awhile,” writes Keats, “And watch intently Nature’s gentle doings”
                (l.61–63). Tiptoeing also establishes the human observer’s elevation over the
                landscape, which is, after all, artificial. Standing on “tippy-toes” is a way,
                evidenced by the aforementioned line from <title level="m">Lamia</title>, to rise,
                stretch, and elongate the body. The physicality of standing tippy-toes is erotically
                charged: in <title level="m">Romeo and Juliet</title>, a frisky Romeo entices his
                beloved with the line: “Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day / Stands
                tiptoe on the misty mountain tops” (III.iv.9–10).</p>
            <p>Assuming the poem’s speaker is Keats himself, why is the act of tiptoeing
                significant? Famously diminutive in stature, the author may have stood on tiptoe to
                either appear taller or to see further. Hunt reported that the poem was inspired by
                a summer afternoon in which Keats stood by a gate that ran from Battery Hill on
                Hampstead Heath into the ancient woodland known as Caen Wood; whether Keats was
                tiptoeing at the time is unknown but he did craft a poem in which the human observer
                derives “pleasure” from this unique way of standing and seeing. Tiptoeing has three
                additional meanings, however: first, to tiptoe is to stand tall with pride, as in
                Henry V’s Saint Crispin’s Day speech—“He that outlives this day, and comes safe
                home, / Will stand a’ tiptoe when this day is named” (IV.iii.41–2). Second,
                tiptoeing can signify a form of avoidance, as in the idiomatic “walking on
                eggshells.” Lastly, tiptoeing is synonymous with pussyfooting, that is, to tread
                lightly or stealthily. For instance, in Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb
                    Williams</title>, a villainous character named Grimes “advanced on tiptoe with 
                his finger to his lip” (66).</p>
            <p>In the second part of the opening couplet, one can hear an echo of “the cooling
                trees” in <title level="a">On the Grasshopper,</title> as in “the air was cooling,” 
                which renders the speaker’s entire body, skin and all, as one giant receiver of nature’s 
                doings (2). It also continues to operationalize the hydrogen cycle insofar as morning 
                dew is personified as the “early sobbing of the morn” (7). It’s worth pointing out the 
                way in which Keats’s analogies collapse different ecotypes: buds are like women, dew is
                like a teardrop, and clouds are “white as flocks new shorn” (8). This blurring of
                natural objects seems to be the point, especially after, as in his sonnet on the
                grasshopper, he ingrains the poet into the landscape. The poem’s second half (lines
                107–242) goes further: “Here are sweet peas, on tip-toe for a flight / With wings of
                gentle flush o’er delicate white, / And taper fingers catching at all things, / To
                bind them all about with tiny rings” (57–60). The anthropomorphizing cuts both ways,
                for a tiptoeing nature-lover is like a sweet pea just as a sweet pea has “fingers”
                like a human. This is a touchy-feeling ecology, a haptic approach to embracing the
                earth.</p>
            <p>The second half of <title level="a">I Stood Tip-Toe</title> bears out the well-known 
                lines, spoken by Duke Senior in <title level="m">As You Like It</title>, to “find 
                tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, / Sermons in stones” (II.1.16–17). Yet 
                the logic of <title level="a">I Stood Tip-Toe</title> and <title 
                    level="m">Endymion</title> is that only the
                poet possesses the power to divine such natural piety. What binds these two poems
                together, according to John Barnard, is that only male poetic genius has the power
                to render the “truths contained in the natural world” apprehensible to readers and
                to lead the way (53–54). Keats’s queerly ecological mode of leading the way is on
                tiptoes. Less explicit, however, is an intertext like Shelley’s <title level="a">On 
                    Love</title> in which
                he claims that, in the absence of other humans, we “love the flowers, the grass and
                the waters and sky” (505). In his portrayal of the nature-lover as compensating for
                the lack of interpersonal sympathy, he adds: “There is eloquence in the tongueless
                wind and a melody in the flowing of brooks and the rustling of reeds” (504). One
                strange implication of Shelley’s formulation is that in order for the wind to be
                “tongueless,” the wind had to be tongued at some point. In <title 
                    level="m">Endymion</title>, the flower bed is a trope to which the author returns
                repeatedly. Flower beds are queerly ecological spaces since they are sites of
                friskiness al fresco. The conclusion to <title level="a">I Stood Tip-Toe</title> is, 
                as many commentators have pointed out, no conclusion at all.<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">In addition to Wolfson, there is Andrew Motion who, in his 
                    biography of Keats, remarks that that the poem “ends in radical inconclusiveness, 
                    drawing attention to the gulf between its hopes and its achievements”; see
                    <title level="m">Keats</title> (U of Chicago P, 1997), 136.</note> On its 
                open-endedness, Susan J. Wolfson has recently commented that the poem’s abrupt ending 
                is evidence of Keats’s ironizing the “Latin ghost of error in the spirit of wandering” 
                (610). Tiptoeing could be the queerest form of ambulation; it’s certainly an affected 
                kind of movement. Animals tread lightly when approaching prey but no animal stands 
                on its tiptoes. Our only hope is that human beings, seeing the impact of their 
                footprints, change their ways and fast.</p>
            <p>The last and longest poem, <title level="m">Endymion</title> follows the basic pattern
                at work in <title level="a">I Stood Tip-Toe</title> except that it contains an even 
                more sweeping claim on the interactivity of human and nonhuman desire. Christopher 
                Ricks once zeroed in on the maiden’s blush in lines 99–100 of that earlier poem—as in, 
                “How she would start, and blush . . . Playing in all her innocence of thought”—to claim 
                that a perpetually embarrassed “Keats knows too the blush of innocence” (57). <title 
                    level="m">Endymion</title> is noteworthy, by contrast, for
                its shamelessness, and by extension, its blushlessness, as proof that Keats—if we
                must make psycho-biographical claims—was not that innocent. I recommend assigning
                only sections of the first long poem, which stretches more than four books and over
                4,000 lines, dramatically expanding upon the Endymion-Diana myth only touched upon
                in <title level="a">I Stood Tip-Toe.</title> Students will likely <emph>not</emph> 
                know the mythological antecedents to <title level="m">Endymion</title>, so it is worth 
                informing them ahead of time that the poem is a giant allegory for the union of ideal 
                Beauty (incarnated by Cynthia, the lunar goddess) that Endymion, whom Bate once described 
                as a composite character for the “human soul, the poet, or the poetic imagination,” is 
                searching for and desiring throughout the poem’s four books (172). Diana, another moon 
                goddess and virgin, visited Mt. Latmos (in modern-day Turkey) to gaze upon Endymion, a
                shepherd of Caria, as he slept eternally. If you are a professor inclined to
                humorous asides, it might be worth mentioning that Endymion (as a manifestation of
                the “human soul”) is virtually sexless, and that the sobriquet applied by Wolfson to
                Adonis in the poem’s third book is “boy-toy,” as in the “boy-toy Adonis” visited by
                “accidental tourist Endymion” in <title level="m">Reading Keats</title> (43). I show 
                students a painting roughly contemporary with Keats’s poem, Anne-Louis Girodet’s <title 
                    level="m">Sleep of Endymion</title>, which the artist painted in 1791 in Rome
                and debuted in Paris two years later. The image is expertly discussed by Whitney
                Davis in his <title level="m">Queer Beauty</title> as a pictorial
                synecdoche for what he calls the “endless and timeless if unconscious sensual-sexual
                responsiveness of the desirable male body” (35).</p>
            <p>Instructively, a group can explore these themes by considering the question of 
                Endymion’s sexual identity. Abigail Solomon-Godeau’s essay, provocatively entitled <title 
                    level="a">Is Endymion Gay?: Historical Interpretation and Sexual Identities,</title> 
                contends that Girodet’s <title level="m">Endymion</title> played an important part 
                in “constructing a queer art history” (84). Here, you can press
                your students to explain the visual markers of such desirability and to connect the
                glaring sensuality of Girodet’s <foreign xml:lang="fr">beau idéal</foreign> with Keats’s
                Endymion. Girodet’s male is not only “light in the loafers,” toes exposed, but his
                body blends with the branches above, and through a landscape that presents itself to
                him through his right armpit. The oval shapes and lack of jarring rectilinear lines
                in Girodet’s canvas help to ingrain another boy-toy, made vulnerable through his
                somnolent and naked state, on Mt. Latmos. The shading technique, or <foreign 
                    xml:lang="it">sfumato</foreign>, softens and sensualizes all the edges of his body,
                which is bathed in a divine light. This figure of ideal male beauty is, in the
                parlance of Keats, interassimilated with his environs, or, as Keats writes in Books
                I and III of <title level="m">Endymion</title>, “interknit” (l.811 and l.380).</p>
            <p>Keats’s <title level="m">Endymion</title> can be a challenging
                text to discuss, but when discussed vis-à-vis Morton’s conception of the mesh, it
                reaps rich rewards. I ask students to visualize the kind of biotic interconnections
                that ecology has made its major focus and to select the best term to describe the
                nonhierarchical relations across species, across organisms, and across the division
                between the organic and inorganic. Then I encourage learners to ponder some of the
                preferred analogies used by ecologists and ecocritics alike (e.g., the web, the
                network, the mesh, the tree of life) and to consider Morton’s proposal that
                “life-forms constitute a <emph>mesh</emph>, a nontotalizable, open-ended
                concatenation of interrelations that blur and confound boundaries at practically any
                level” (275). Morton (2011) reiterates this claim that the “mesh” is best suited to
                register ecological interconnectedness, less “vitalist” and “Internet-ish” than
                “web” or “network” and no less Darwinian (24). “This is what most of us mean when we
                think ecologically,” he writes, “that everything is connected to everything else”
                (26). Students come to class prepared to point out at least five interconnections
                found in Keats’s long poem. To access this kind of deep interdependency, I recommend
                a radical abridgment of Keats’s pastoral and a close reading, in class, of the first
                book’s best-known passage—the so-called “Pleasure Thermometer” passage (769–857)
                that begins with the melodious bird (the nightingale) that Keats would transform,
                via his eponymous ode, into a literary icon (rivaled only by Poe’s raven and, in
                third place, Shelley’s skylark):<quote><lg type="stanza">
            <l> She sings but to her love, nor e’er conceives</l>
            <l> How tiptoe Night holds back her dark-grey hood.</l>
            <l> Just so many love, although ‘tis understood</l>
            <l> The mere commingling of passionate breath,</l>
            <l> Produce more than our searching soul witnesseth,</l>
            <l> What I know not: but who, of men, can tell</l>
            <l> That flowers would bloom, or that green fruit would swell</l>
            <l> To melting pulp, that fish would have bright mail,</l>
            <l> The earth its dower of river, wood, and vale,</l>
            <l> The meadows runnels, runnels pebble-stones,</l>
            <l> The seed its harvest, or the lute its tones,</l>
            <l> Tones ravishment, or ravishment is sweet,</l>
            <l> If human souls did never kiss and greet? (830–42)</l>
                </lg></quote>
            Keats felt most at home, rhetorically, in the interrogative mode; hence, the question
                presented above is how humans can understand their desires apart from their
                environment and the other species that inhabit a single ecosystem. Because “men”
                cannot, Keats sensualizes <emph>all</emph> of nature,
                human and nonhuman, and singles out tiptoeing as an action best aligned with
                maintaining a harmony between “men” and “the earth” humanity calls home. Moreover,
                this passage appears later in the gradations that Keats describes as steps on a
                Platonic ladder leading from man’s sensuous engagement with natural and aesthetic
                objects toward “love and friendship,” described as the “chief intensity” and “crown”
                in lines 800–801. Rapt in the worship of nature, the speaker here continues his
                fetishization of flowers and the diverse dependencies between the operations of the
                natural world and human desire. The two are “interknit” (812) but they just as well
                might be described as “interassimilated,” since the latter adjective is the more
                homoerotically charged of the two. The thermometer depicted in this passage is a
                teleological model, as is often commented upon, bound for the purity of
                disinterested love, but no commentator has asked how exactly one gets their foothold
                in this ladder. Yet the lightness associated with the act of tiptoeing appears to
                be, for Keats, how man must proceed as he makes his way to what he calls “earthly
                love” (843). Be sure to remind your class that two centuries after Keats began to
                compose <title level="m">Endymion</title> in April of 1817, the coming years are
                shaping up to be the hottest years on record. Goodbye El Niño, hello record-breaking 
                heat and the very extremes of the spectrum: floods <emph>and</emph> drought, warming
                pleasure-domes <emph>and</emph> calving caves of ice. Due to anthropogenic climate 
                change, the thermometer is rising rapidly and in
                Keats’s pairing of atmospheric pressure and pleasure, his poetry remains not only
                environmentally relevant but crucial and queer in the Age of Man.</p>
            <p>Following Darwin’s explanation of natural selection as a branching tree that lacks
                both a definite starting point and an endpoint, Morton asserts that the mesh is the
                best ecological term for infinite interdependencies and what he calls the “intimate
                entanglement of all life-forms that the life sciences discover on many levels, from
                evolution to symbiosis” (29). Intimacy is an interesting theme to foreground in your
                explication of <title level="m">Endymion</title> because it
                manifests itself in surprisingly interspecies ways. Keats actually uses the word
                himself, in <title level="m">Lamia</title>, when Lamia kisses Lycius and makes him
                feel “tangled in her mesh” (l.295), and in a similar fashion, desire flows in
                alarmingly cross-species ways in <title level="m">Endymion</title> as well. Karen
                Swann has commented that “Eros in this poem is interspecies romance: romance across
                the bar that divides mortal from immortal . . . human organisms from the figures of
                the poetic medium” (29). Puzzling phrases like “men-slugs” and “human serpentry”
                (l.821), themselves harbingers of the chameleon poet, manifest such
                interassimilations, queer to the extent that identity traverses species and absorbs
                the other.</p>
            <p>Students and I explore these lines by connecting Keats’s conception of “earthly
                love” with Godwin’s <title level="m">Mandeville</title> (1817)
                because it contains a passage that is nearly identical in terms of projecting
                (masculine) desire onto nature. Nevertheless, photocopying a few pages from
                <title level="m">Mandeville</title> will illustrate that Keats was not the only 
                author in the 1810s who wished to sensualize man’s fusion with the
                natural world, nor was he the only nature-lover that saw man as “neighbor” and
                “portion,” and more radically, as an organism that loves to “frisk” alongside
                flowers, fruit, fawns, and fish. The speaker in this passage from <title 
                    level="m">Mandeville</title> is Henrietta, the narrator’s sister, whom 
                Mandeville sits beside under some “venerable elms” that shade the side 
                of a stream:<quote>

                Be sure to call your class’s attention to the <foreign 
                    xml:lang="fr">fraternité</foreign> 
                        that Godwin inscribes upon nature and the
                brotherly love he locates there. If, as queer criticism posits, desire exceeds the
                social construct that is identity, queer ecology rubs our faces in the
                constructedness of the very things we not only take for granted but hold to be
                self-evident: human desire and a nonhuman nature.<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">In David M. Halperin’s <title level="m">How To Be Gay</title>, 
                    he observes: “when psychoanalytic thinkers advance their claim about desire exceeding

                            process whose effect is ultimately not to undermine but to promote and
                            to universalize heterosexuality” (89).</note><title level="m">Endymion</title> 
                is especially useful in an eco-queer context first
                because it’s a pagan love poem that depicts humans and the natural world as
                “interknit” and forming an ecological whole (III.l.380), and second, because it
                explores the power of love in explicitly erotic ways that occasion states of
                nonsovereignty, or nonpower. It dispenses with the monotheistic presumptions evident
                in Godwin’s novel because, in Keats, there is no single “lord of the creation” since
                there is no power imbalance or anthropocentric hierarchy. Thus queerness grows
                sideways, like a vine or invasive weed, and dismantles the top-down model of
                subjectivity.</p>
            <p>In teaching queer ecology relative to the Anthropocene, I have discovered that
                Keats’s poetry is particularly well-suited to opening a dialogue about the aforesaid
                topics because of nature’s central role in the Romantic imaginary. Asking students
                to scan a poem for its references to trees, animals, and other living things should
                always be followed by a more challenging and “deeper” query:
                <emph>But what symbolic role do such living things play in this poem? Yes, they are 
                    things, biomass, but what do they signify?</emph> Following
                Crutzen, Timothy Clark has written cogently about how humans will survive in a
                geological epoch marked by man’s heavy-footed impact on planet earth. “To live in
                the Anthropocene seems to present a host of new and largely unprecedented questions
                and dilemmas for human self-conception,” writes Clark, “for ethics, philosophy,
                economics and politics” (285). Poetry and pedagogy are just two of the glaring
                omissions here. Poetry presents us with life-saving ways of making amorous promises
                to the earth. Since the Anthropocene is the geological epoch marked by man’s
                footprint, we ought to follow in the footsteps of Keats and other ecologically alert
                poets of the earth by tiptoeing through the flowers and beyond, through our
                biosphere. In order to survive, we better watch our step.</p>
