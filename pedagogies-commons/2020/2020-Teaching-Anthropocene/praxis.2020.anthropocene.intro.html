            <p class="noCount">This introduction shows how this volume crafts an intersectional Romantic pedagogy
               of resistance to human-made climate change in the Anthropocene. Such a pedagogy rejects
               ideas about “humans as one unified species” and seeks instead a dialogue between race,
               class, gender, sexuality, nonhumans, and queer alignments, among others. The introduction

               <p>The problem of the Anthropocene is the problem of, and for, Romanticism. Ever since
                  biologist Eugene F. Stoermer coined, and atmospheric scientist Paul Crutzen then popularized,
                  the term “Anthropocene,” the humanities as a whole has gradually undertaken a reevaluation
                  of its role in the creation of this new geological era. Romanticism is perhaps different
                  than other literary periods, though. For if, as some scientists (like Crutzen) argue,
                  humans gained the capabilities in the late eighteenth century’s industrial age to
                  disastrously alter the earth’s climate, then the Romantic period begins to take on
                  catastrophic resonances and implications. “Catastrophe” literally means a “down turning,”
                  a turn we can witness Romanticism as a period and a profession experiencing. What
                  once looked like a literary revolution marked by a turn toward the imaginative abilities
                  of human achievement and a renewed environmental appreciation of nature now shuttles
                  along a remarkably wilder course toward the potential, some would even say probable,
                  end of the human species if not the end of the world, or at least (at best?) the end
                  of the world on the anthropocentric assumption that it exists for humans.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Gillen D’Arcy Wood shows us that the climate disaster of 1816, “the year without a
                     summer,” although not a human-induced event—its cause was the eruption of Mount Tambora
                     in Indonesia—models possibilities humans will have to look forward to in the future
                     of the Anthropocene. So not only can we understand that the period perhaps coincides
                     with the birth of catastrophic climate change, it also provides a preview of what
                     such future change will bring if we fail (and perhaps we already have) to mitigate
                     it. Another twist in this turn therefore is that the period’s long-celebrated intimate,
                     imaginative, liberal subject takes on different contours since it is this powerful
                     subjectivity that makes capable the institutional and systemic economic and cultural
                     climate drivers that initiate the Anthropocene. As D. B. Ruderman puts it in this
                     volume, it is “arguably” Romanticism’s “privileging of a liberal, democratic subject—autonomous,
                     free, appetitive, propertied, universal, and self-willed—that provides the ‘natural’
                     grounds for global capitalism,” and, we could add, the Anthropocene. In this sense,
                     Romanticism finds itself looking more like a coconspirator in climate change’s devastation
                     rather than a poetics of transcendent individualism precisely because of its adulated
                     emancipatory liberalism. Yet another turn, another catastrophe, is the turning of
                     the human trope of Romantic irony around on itself, as the only thing the Anthropocene
                     might wipe out is the “anthropos,” the human, which means in this Romantic progressive
                     fantasy that if in becoming more imaginative humans have become more human, then they
                     have done so at the risk of their own extinction. The Anthropocene, it seems, has
                     a fierce sense of irony; perhaps it gets it from Romanticism, another indication that
                     they are in latent conspiratorial cahoots.

                              climate change is the reemergence of what made climate possible. Climate was manufactured
                              from climate change” (19).</span></div>

                  <p>That having been said, nothing in this volume is meant to link the Anthropocene exclusively
                     to capitalism, let alone argue for a renaming of it, as some do, as the “Capitalocene,”
                     although it is certainly true that predominantly white, heteronormative, Western,
                     patriarchal culture has largely been responsible for the changes in the Earth’s atmosphere.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Jason W. Moore, for instance, argues for this terminological switch as do others in
                              his related edited volume, Anthropocene or Capitalocene?</span></div>
                     </div> This connection points to the problem of the blame-game in general. As Tom Cohen and
                     Claire Colebrook observe in <em>Twilight of the Anthropocene Idols</em>, “one of the features of what has come to be known as the Anthropocene is that very
                     few want to own up to being the guilty party: as soon as the Anthropocene was declared
                     as a way of uniting humans once again, objections started pouring in” (7). One can
                     see this, as Stacy Alaimo argues, in a foundational critical text for thinking the
                     Anthropocene in literary studies, Dipesh Chakrabarty’s 
                     “The Climate of History: Four Theses,”
                      which, she writes, homogenizes humanity as a species rather than embraces its multiplicity
                     and quite different levels of responsibility (94–103). The United States and Western
                     empires, for example, pollute more than Non-Western countries whose carbon emission
                     output, due to lack of large-scale industrialism, is minimal. To lump all humans together
                     as a species, as Chakrabarty does, repeats the “anthropos” thinking of the Anthropocene
                     and erases key factors about who is responsible for climate change. In these terms,
                     as teachers and scholars of Romanticism, it seems we should pause to ask: is Romanticism,
                     too, somehow culpable in this “anthopos”ing? Historically, the period’s big-six white
                     male coalition, alongside two comparatively well-off white women novelists, has formed
                     the Romantic canon, although the work of scholars like Frances Botkin, Manu Chander,
                     Patricia A. Matthew, Joel Pace, Deanne Koretsky, and Paul Youngquist dispenses with
                     this hagiography.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                              (3)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See Works Cited for their specific works.</span></div>
                     </div> But as a kind of thought experiment, let us hypothesize for the moment that Romanticism
                     is, indeed, somehow partially responsible for the Anthropocene and the dangers and
                     challenges it poses.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The larger questions this collection asks stem from this hypothesis. What are Romanticism’s
                  responsibilities if this indictment stands? Secondly, the collection asks whether
                  Romanticism possesses the energies needed to survive its potential demise at its own
                  hands or, relatedly, to provide means and method to combat the climate-changing disasters
                  it has helped loose on the world with the Anthropocene. In other words, perhaps we
                  might begin to think of Romanticism as we currently teach it as not simply historically
                  congruent with the Anthropocene but instead as a thought or writing whose contemporary
                  pedagogical charge stems from its ability to counter the Anthropocene’s violence precisely
                  because of its unique historical and dialectical interinvolvement with it.</p>
               <p>And perhaps we will find that the Anthropocene sparks Romanticism’s imagination insofar
                  as it reminds Romanticism that one of its distinguishing features is its self-reflexivity,
                  its ability to distance itself ironically from its own Romantic ideology ever since
                  the work of Paul de Man, Jerome McGann, and Anne Mellor (to name only a few) demonstrated
                  this critical trait. Perhaps in its reaction to the Anthropocene, Romanticism will
                  remember, or learn, that it has to be radically Romantic, that it has to self-reflect
                  on its own responsibilities and liabilities in a fashion it has not been forced to
                  do previously without getting tied down in a self-imposed guilt it does not deserve.
                  However, this is not to argue for a version of a “good Anthropocene,” as some do,
                  as if it is a particularly disliked vegetable like kale that we are told is good for
                  us anyway, since the volume assuredly does not see the Anthropocene in such crunchable,
                  delectable lights. Instead, the writers here rightly view the Anthropocene as a period
                  with horribly damaging consequences for all life, and nonlife, on Earth. But this
                  is another reason to investigate Romanticism’s culpability. To this end, as writers
                  in this volume show, the Anthropocene makes us question, in our classrooms and scholarship,
                  what Romanticism can and will be in the time of our present global crisis, which continues
                  to spool out in expected and unexpected ways.</p>
               <p>This collection, for instance, began as a panel, 
                  “Living through Human Trumpery: Teaching Romanticism in the Anthropocene,”
                  arranged and moderated by the brilliant bricoleur Kate Singer at the International
                  Conference for Romanticism at Colorado College in 2016. During the Q and A for the
                  panel, one intrepid graduate student asked a question that proved crucially formative
                  to this volume: “What about race in Romanticism and the Anthropocene?” While the panel
                  took up many topics, race was, indeed is, an overlooked topic in Romanticism, certainly
                  in relation to the Anthropocene. Several scholars do study race in the period, of
                  course, with burgeoning work amongst graduate students, but the field, and canon,
                  remains largely white—although the recent transatlantic and global explosion of the
                  Romantic canon sketched above offers an alternative. The panel, it turned out, driven
                  to self-reflection at this moment, showcased Romanticism’s possibilities as well as
                  its limitations since no one on the panel had any real answer to this question.</p>
               <p>In undertaking the editorship of this volume, I sought, therefore, to incorporate
                  as diverse a set of voices concerning as wide a range of topical concerns as feasible,
                  not the least of which was to offer some kind of answer to the lacunae the above question
                  highlighted. Despite everyone's best intention, circumstances intervened and a planned
                  essay on race and the Anthropocene does not appear in this volume. Nonetheless, the
                  collection hopefully succeeds in addressing some long-standing historical as well
                  as contemporary concerns on issues of cultural and societal justice in Romanticism:
                  David Ruderman on social class, poetics, and war; Elizabeth Effinger on animal studies
                  and a mobilizing nonhuman politics; Brian Rejack on the current politics of pessimism
                  that can lead to an affirmative affect of care; Colin Carman on a queer ecology that
                  gives us tools to realize and transcend our normative practices in the classroom;
                  Aaron Ottinger on ecocriticism and media studies and the salutary dissolution of the
                  solitary Romantic “I”; and Chris Washington on gender, sex, and queer families.</p>
               <p>Specifically, these essays trace how the Anthropocene forces us to rethink our pedagogical
                  and methodological practices in the classroom and beyond, as well as the values and
                  beliefs that underscore said methodologies and practices. In the process, a kind of
                  accretive vision of a transformed and transformational Romanticism that hails us from
                  a burning down of our beliefs about the period begins to signal through the smoke
                  and fire of the Anthropocene.</p>
               <p>If the volume can be said to have an argument abstracted from the varied topics and
                  inquiries the scholars in this volume undertake, then it is that Romanticism, as a
                  scholarship based around a historical period and its culture, as a set of writers,
                  and as a pedagogy and pedagogical set of practices, should strive for a radical intersectionality.
                  Much like the essays in <em>Anthropocene Feminism</em>, which collectively clamor for an intersectional new-wave feminism equally attentive
                  to matters of human social justice and nonhuman materialism, Anthropocene Romanticism,
                  if we can put it that way for now (as Effinger does), displays a cross-spectrum of
                  interests and ideas. The Anthropocene, this volume demonstrates, cannot be allowed
                  to subsume the social and ontological differences that exist between humans and nonhumans
                  in the name of “species.” As Rosi Braidotti, in that volume, writes, “Earth-related
                  issues are not immune to social relations of class, race, age, disability, sexual
                  preference and should not be renaturalized” (40). These interests and ideas exceed
                  the narrow focus on the human that has long dominated and defined Romanticism, a picture
                  this volume rejects in favor of an intersectional vision that connects class, race,
                  gender, age, disability, sexual preference, nonhuman materialism, and feminist materialism
                  into a vital politics.</p>
               <p>But even as it foregrounds intersectionality, the volume queries what we mean by the
                  term “human.” Much like Jacques Derrida once cautioned about “the animal” when he
                  wrote that there is no animal only animals (“<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">animaux</span>” is his proposed nomenclature), these essays refuse a categorical humanness, or even,
                  as Alaimo warns against above, the homogeneity of a “human species” (Derrida 32–41).
                  Instead, the Romanticism that appears here draws lines of connection even as it is
                  also fractured, disparate, and shattered, with each author offering myriad views of
                  how to pick up the pieces.</p>
               <p>We can observe this in Rejack’s and Carman’s different readings of Keats, Ruderman
                  and Ottinger exploring dramatically divergent but complementary Wordsworths, and in
                  Rejack’s, Effinger’s, and Washington’s rethinking of Romantic time.</p>
               <p>Rejack’s essay, both personal and polemical, begins in melancholy as he ponders memories
                  of his wedding, the day before which he found himself gazing up at ancient mushroom
                  rocks in the Rocky Mountains. To him the mushroom rocks, part of a formation that
                  dates back 1.7 billion years, recall us to deep time, the fact that the earth existed
                  long before us and will likely persist well after us. For Rejack, a true Keatsian,
                  a melancholy fit falls as “the shock and sadness that accompany this strange temporal
                  situation came to mind” during what should have been a happy event. What, he wonders,
                  will be left of the world in the future? To this end, he turns, in what could serve
                  as an overarching explanation of not only his own but all of the essays in this volume,
                  to “focus in this essay on how the feeling of living in the Anthropocene and its strange
                  temporality affects how we teach, and specifically how we teach Romanticism.” The
                  course he designed, 
                  “The Failures of Romanticism,”
                  captures something of the complicity concerns that began this introduction. But if
                  Rejack’s essay begins in melancholy and failure, it quickly becomes something else.
                  Winding together contemporary song lyrics, Mary Shelley’s <em>The Last Man</em>, Percy Shelley’s <em>A Defence of Poetry</em>, Jeff Vandermeer’s <em>Southern Reach</em> trilogy, and finally Keats’s last on-earth pun (“I am leading a posthumous existence”)
                  and weird fairyland trip <em>The Cap and Bells</em>, Rejack serves up a pedagogical polemic for how to laugh together in the classroom
                  rather than cower in fear and despair. In this sense, the essay skillfully draws an
                  affective Romanticism between teacher, student, text, and scholar. It is a touching
                  and forceful invocation, “a defence of Romanticism” that is thoroughly Romantic, a
                  reminder of the pedagogical power the period still holds to teach us all something
                  we didn’t know we didn’t know.</p>
               <p>Carman’s essay serves as a kind of <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">vade mecum</span> for how to teach queer ecology in the Anthropocene, which he develops through a careful,
                  in-depth, startlingly brilliant reading of Keats’s “I stood tip-toe upon a little
                  hill” and <em>Endymion</em>. As Carman remarks, thinking queer ecology makes sense because both “nature” and
                  “queer sexuality” share “a lack of a rigid outline.” Think of the example of LGBTQ,
                  he suggests, which for now is end-stopped by Q but which looks “as intersectional
                  as it is infinite.” For Carman, Keats draws together the queer and the ecological
                  in these poems because they unleash an eroticized desire that comports with queerness
                  even as it is a desire that advises us how to steward the earth by walking tenderly
                  on tip-toe rather than mashing the ground beneath our feet. In this powerful reading
                  that gives us a much more ecologically minded Keats than we have previously encountered,
                  Carman reminds us that even if the Anthropocene is the “Age of Man,” it does not necessarily
                  follow that it is the “Age of the Straight Man” since “<em>LGBTQ people . . . are no less dedicated to preserving</em>” the Earth even if they do not, as he says, procreate like straight people do. Carman’s
                  essay gives us a Romanticism that finds <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jouissance</span> in sexuality and eroticism, a theme that Washington likewise explores in his own
                  essay later in this volume, evoking a Romanticism hopeful about the future.</p>
               <p>And yet, Romanticism is often characterized as skeptical in nature, which speaks to
                  the discourse and industry of climate denial. But “can this current skepticism be
                  traced to the Romantic period?” Ottinger asks of climate-change deniers. While Ottinger
                  notes that a spate of new studies on Romantic science render accounts of it as “anti-science . . . untenable,”
                  worries about the period’s skeptical nature nonetheless require an exploration of
                  how “the hierarchized different genres of media” Romantic authors created “shaped
                  the way that that they related to the planet and thereby produced a particular brand
                  of ecology.” An exploration of Romantic media lends itself to experiments with media
                  in the classroom, specifically, an exercise where students draw lyrics on paper. Ottinger
                  traces the results of one such experiment when he asks students to sketch what Wordsworth
                  describes in a lyric from <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, 
                  “Written in Germany, on One of the Coldest Days of the Century.”
                  In visualizing the poem through art, students gain an increased awareness of the perspective
                  of the Romantic lyric “I” since they have to think through Wordsworth’s position in
                  the cottage as well as what subsists outside the cottage, namely nature, the weather,
                  and the earth, all of which are steadily getting colder. For Ottinger, the exercise
                  literally mitigates our strange subject position vis-à-vis climate and the Anthropocene
                  by staging “one’s self in an alien time, place, and climate,” the very thing the Anthropocene
                  threatens to force us to do whether we wish to or not. In this sense, Ottinger invents
                  a pedagogy that enacts a divestment of ourselves as we see, through the media of ink
                  on paper, the eco-mimetic separation of the Romantic “I” from the world around it.
                  We become disoriented from ourselves, unsure where the world ends and we begin, which
                  places us in a certain time and space even while dislocating us from time and space.</p>
               <p>D. B. Ruderman’s pedagogical experiments join nicely with Ottinger’s, and Effinger’s
                  below, to help students query their own subject position re the larger world around
                  them. Like Rejack, Ruderman takes a personal turn as he notes that his students in
                  south central Ohio experience the Anthropocene in the form of the trickle-down effects
                  of a capitalist economy that has long crushed them in its invisible hands. To grasp
                  the full impact of these effects, though, requires listening to the ambient silence
                  of the world. Ruderman looks to silence as theorized in the work of Wordsworth and
                  John Cage to investigate “whether silence as a romantic concept cuts into and denatures
                  . . . subjectivity, offering us another defamiliarized subject in its place, or whether
                  silence merely resounds as yet another form of acquiescence.” For Ruderman, silence—which
                  is not the absence of sound, he writes—is what allows for the outside to enter in,
                  a formulation reminiscent of Ottinger’s pedagogical artwork illustrations of the lyric.
                  In this fashion, Ruderman gives us an auditory pedagogy for the Anthropocene parallel
                  to Ottinger’s visual one. In Wordsworth and Cage, on Ruderman’s and his class’s interpretation,
                  silence “is something like a container that provides the conditions and the imaginative
                  space for political action.” Having read Wordsworth’s 
                  “There Was A Boy”
                  as well as listened to and read Cage’s reflections on silence, Ruderman’s students
                  then did field work: they recorded ambient noise which Ruderman created a sound mix
                  of in order to listen to the silence between the odd sounds found in their outside
                  environment. To the students, this type of keying into the environment amounted to
                  a weak type of politics, one that, they argued, while aesthetically interesting, required
                  theorizing specific action. His students, aware that they are at the mercy of a neoliberal
                  war aimed at the poor and the lower middle class, wanted a viable politics with which
                  to fight back. And yet, as Ruderman writes, only by listening to the unheard, undeclared
                  kinds of violence being directed at us, subjects of the Anthropocene, can we begin
                  to hear “what man has made of man,” as Wordsworth puts it.</p>
               <p>Effinger’s class engaged in a complimentary experiment with sound as well as a study
                  of disruptive Anthropocene temporalities. In classical rhetoric, as Effinger notes,
                  <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">hysteron proteron</span> means the temporal inversion of speech, but Effinger uses it as one basis for rethinking
                  pedagogy in the Anthropocene. As she writes, “the goal in going about things backward—the
                  inversion of past and future—is to revitalize a present relationship, to hear Romantic
                  poetry, ideas, and problematics as a frenetic, undulating constellation murmuring
                  beneath the Anthropocene.” Romantic birdsong poetry, so often obsessed with its own
                  failure to capture the purer poetry of the bird mimetically, and thus claiming the
                  poet and the poem as a failure, in Effinger’s lesson finally may have achieved its
                  goal. She points out that in the Anthropocene, “climate change is now the primary
                  threat to avian extinction,” which means that returning to Romantic birdsong can,
                  after a fashion, return us to a time before avian extinction. It allows Effinger to
                  locate in the birdsong of the past the full murmur of what we can no longer hear—perhaps
                  because, as Effinger says, in the Anthropocene we are drowned by silent wars in the
                  every day. Effinger institutes a practice she calls “close listening,” an exercise
                  that we can hear murmuring gently in the ear of Ruderman’s silence, to help students
                  tune into the “ubiquitous sounds, those metonyms for the unsaid or silences within
                  discourse.” Through close listening to bird poems by Charlotte Smith, Samuel Taylor
                  Coleridge (from whose <em>Biographia Literaria</em> Effinger takes and reimagines the use of <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">hysteron proteron</span>), John Keats, and John Clare, Effinger and her students work their way toward a political
                  call to action in the Anthropocene that “opens up the subject to the more than human.”
                  Politically this serves as a form of resistance to our very humanness, a to-be-called
                  by the other in a Levinasian sense that strikes back at the heart of the Anthropocene:
                  us.</p>
               <p>Like Effinger, Washington is interested in temporally scrambled pedagogies that also
                  invoke the nonhuman as central to any Anthropocene politics Romanticism develops.
                  But for him, both the human and nonhuman remain categorically elusive in the Anthropocene
                  to the extent that new hybrid formations will necessarily continue to develop. Washington
                  invokes what he terms “hyper-jump pedagogy,” something of a counterpart to Effinger’s
                  <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">hysteron proteron</span> pedagogy, to attempt to literally model how time works in the Anthropocene: we are
                  not necessarily going back to the future so much as the future always slips away,
                  slip-sliding us back into a past and present we have no temporal control over. His
                  contribution presents a choose-your-own-adventure scenario with two versions of his
                  “essay.” In the first, you can read a version that tracks backward, from the end of
                  the essay to the beginning, an upside-down schema via a kind of chiasmus. It begins
                  with a reading of Wollstonecraft and Rousseau—the past, in other words—but tracks
                  forward to a reading that ranges over Cormac McCarthy’s <em>The Road</em>, <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>, Lucy Corin’s flash fiction, and <em>Wall-E</em>. Yet it does so by taking flight with the readings of Wollstonecraft and Rousseau
                  that only the later readings make possible. The second version of the essay tries
                  to institute a nice derangement of paragraphs by allowing readers to click a button
                  that generates a random presentation of the essay. Paragraph 21 might open this version
                  followed by paragraph 1 or paragraph 10, a higgedly-piggedly chronology meant to mimic
                  the erasure of <em>telos</em> in the Anthropocene and our own (non)experience of time’s futural pastness. In the
                  interstices of this chiasmatic and/or contingent disorientation, we see how sex and
                  gender might play out in the Anthropocene’s postapocalypse when who we have sex with
                  and how we have it can stymie or unleash an energy that is not merely biopolitical
                  in a human sense but queer in ways that crosshatch Carman’s reading of Keats’s digit(al),
                  and Rejack’s and Ottinger’s digital, environmental protection agency.</p>
               <p>With its roots in political revolution and individual imaginative expression, Romanticism
                  has always been relevant to today, whenever that is. Yet we have faced the same so-called
                  humanities crisis since the 1960s. To wit, academe in general does not matter, so
                  the charge goes, not least Romanticism with its thorny questions of what exactly a
                  modern politics might constitute, what an individual might be, what the world and
                  our relation to it consists of, and even what it means to think the human and/or the
                  nonhuman. No one, it seems, cares about an academe that tries to transgress the safe
                  spaces of discourse that accounts for all viewpoints. In many ways, Romanticism of
                  course represents the purest ideal and commitment to free, unadulterated speech, a
                  democratic laissez faire of the individual that many libertarians look to in order
                  to justify their desired dismantlement of the social contract (Godwin’s anarchist
                  theory, for instance). If this volume demonstrates anything, though, then it reminds
                  us that Romanticism can, or should, never be about injustice, to our fellow human
                  beings or our non-fellow nonhumans, or to the idea, in general, of difference.</p>
               <p>The pedagogies grouped here recollect us to Romanticism as a fight, a battle cry,
                  a rally, a movement against injustice, against prejudice, against pride in our own
                  perceived humanity, a battle constantly waged in our classrooms and beyond. Romanticism,
                  Evan Gottlieb recalls, is not one thing (8). But it is, as these essays demonstrate,
                  certainly not certain things. It is resistance in its multihued forms; it is resistance
                  against class warfare from the 1%; it is resistance to ethnocentricism; it is resistance
                  to heteronormativity; it is resistance to human pride, selfishness, and greed; it
                  is resistance to inhibitions of expression; it is resistance to sexual shaming; it
                  is resistance to misogyny; it is resistance to politics as usual; it is resistance
                  to “sit down and shut up”; it is resistance to homophobia; it is resistance to racism;
                  it is resistance to the Anthropocene “feel good”; it is resistance to any form of
                  discrimination or oppression; it is resistance to the human trumpery we in the United
                  States have subjected ourselves to. This volume is—or wants to be—a pedagogical politics
                  of resistance. How successful its Romanticism is, is up to you, dear reader.</p>
               <p>This collection reminds us that Percy Shelley’s notion of poets as the unacknowledged
                  legislators of the world takes new charge in the Anthropocene, a time that tests teaching
                  with its evanescence, to augur Romanticism as more important than ever in our vanishing
                  classrooms. To remind us that we, as teachers, are unacknowledged legislators too.
                  It reminds us that if human life begins to end in the Anthropocene, then perhaps humans
                  and nonhumans may yet be able to live through, with, and by Romanticism.</p>
