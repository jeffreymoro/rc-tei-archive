            <p class="noCount">This essay outlines a media adaptation exercise instructors can use to investigate
               the role of the Romantic subject or the lyric “I” in this latest phase of geological
               time, the Anthropocene. As a test case, it focuses on the overlooked lyrical ballad,
               Wordsworth’s 
               “Written in Germany.”
               It explores terms for analyzing media and media adaptations in the classroom. It investigates
               how media adaptations can lay bare the rhetoric of the first-person perspective and
               the philosophical implications of the self’s relationship to nature. Last, it situates
               the Romantic-era subject within a broader historical and ecological context, and it
               considers the centered, first-person perspective in relation to marginalized perspectives
               and the “view from nowhere.” The essay concludes with the importance of allowing shifting
               perspectives to migrate across multiple media.

               <p>In a discussion of Alan Weisman’s <em>The World Without Us</em> (2007), Dipesh Chakrabarty writes that historians now find themselves in a paradoxical
                  moment where the tools used for reflecting on the past may no longer aid us in thinking
                  about the future. If the end of human existence, or something close to it, is a future
                  on the horizon, it requires that “we [historians] insert ourselves into a future ‘without
                  us’ in order to visualize it” (197–98). By “visualizing” it, Chakrabarty may refer
                  to the graphs and figures that historians use to spatialize events occurring over
                  time. A history of the formal visualization of history would likely begin in the eighteenth
                  century with Joseph Priestley (1733–1804), who was, according to Rosenberg and Grafton,
                  “the first to lay out systematic principles for the translation of historical data
                  into a visual medium” (116). Indeed, Priestley’s maps of time, and others like it,
                  were dramatically changing the image of humans in history.
               </p>
               <p>But visualizations of history may also refer to human relations, if not in a world
                  without us, then perhaps in a postapocalyptic world where humans have been reduced
                  to oral culture or no culture at all. In the Anthropocene, a term coined by Paul J.
                  Crutzen and Eugene F. Stoermer to indicate the planetary stage from 1750 to the present,
                  humans have become geological agents, and with this agency it has become increasingly
                  clear that the relatively hospitable environment of the Holocene could be replaced
                  by the relatively inhospitable “desert of the real.” Indeed, <em>The Matrix</em> (1999), from which the quote is taken, along with other postapocalyptic films like
                  Chris Marker’s <em>La Jetée</em> (1962) and Christopher Nolan’s <em>Interstellar</em> (2014), have already provided images of human relations on the brink of total annihilation.
                  Yet the maturation of these more artistic visualizations and their rhetorical implications
                  can be traced back to the late eighteenth century and the postapocalyptic imagery
                  of Romanticism.

                  <p>The historical narrative of our mediated relationship to the planet is more significant
                     today in the age of global warming. It is important because the various media through
                     which humans can know the conditions of the earth might ultimately determine our species’
                     place on it. Yet a pernicious skepticism with respect to climate science (second only
                     to capitalist greed) continues to impede global measures towards curbing the human
                     destruction of a habitable planet. Can the origin of this current skepticism also
                     be located in the Romantic period? While Romanticism can be characterized by what
                     Kevis Goodman refers to as an emerging “medium consciousness,” which shared an almost
                     parallel rise with what James McKusick calls the “[invention] of ‘human ecology,’”
                     the same period also emphasizes local and subjective beliefs that render scientific
                     data about the earth’s conditions too “calculating” and “instrumentalist” to be of
                     concern for serious humanistic inquiry.

                              the convergence of media theory, the scientific revolution, and a renewed attention
                              to Virgil’s Georgics (18–20). For McKusick, he points to Wordsworth as “one of the
                              first” to give rise to human ecology, “if by that phrase we mean the study of the
                              complex relationships between human communities and their dwelling places” (70).</span></div>
                     </div> Of course, the antiscientific understanding of Romanticism is no longer tenable, as
                     has been made clear by numerous studies, like Noel Jackson’s <em>Science and Sensation in Romantic Poetry</em> (2008) and Theresa Kelley’s <em>Clandestine Marriage: Botany and Romantic Culture</em> (2012), among others. But it is worth asking exactly how the synthesizers of media
                     consciousness and ecology (i.e., Romantic-era authors) parsed out and hierarchized
                     different genres of media and why; how these media shaped the way that that they related
                     to the planet and thereby produced a particular brand of ecology; and how their conclusions
                     can aid visualizations of human relations in the forthcoming age, if they can at all.
                     My aim in the present essay is to outline an exercise for eliciting such an inquiry
                     in the classroom. In short, this essay asks: How can we use media adaptations to teach
                     and reinforce the history of our mediated relationship to the earth in the Anthropocene?

                  <p>Numerous studies have recently drawn attention to media in the Romantic period, focusing
                     variously on the mediation of the past (Goodman), present human feelings (Chandler),
                     human relations at a distance (Favret), and the sheer excess of media and information
                     (Langan).

                              collections, and monographs have emphasized the materiality of artworks and the discussions
                              of media that take place within those texts more generally, including Miranda Burgess,
                              Alexander Dick, and Michelle Levy’s special issue of Europe…</span></div>
                     </div> Meanwhile, few studies have yet to address the Romantic mediation of the planet as
                     a thing with a particular history extending into the present. Some might object to
                     this warrant’s presentism, a position that has sparked renewed debate.

                              and Danielle Coriale make an appeal for a more “strategic presentism”: “To make presentism
                              a strategy means asking how presentism might help us better understand and address
                              the ways the past is at work in the exigencies of the present . . . from the economies
                              of consciousness as a so-called global workspace to the anthropocene as an epoch whose
                              hallmark, paradoxically, is the radical compression of the longue durée of geological
                              change” (88). Strategic presentism is not a call to merely “act now.” It is a call
                              t…</span></div>
                     </div> The problem is that charges of presentism can be narrowly anthropocentric, and so
                     it should be asked: Presentism according to whom? From the perspective of the planet,
                     the human geological reengineering of its surface is a roughly 300-year-old problem
                     “beginning” with the Industrial Revolution (not counting the thousands of years it
                     took to accumulate the necessary technical know-how). If the present is a problem
                     of perspective and metrics, and the Anthropocene has been and will remain the geological
                     period for some time, even after human existence, then our only recourse to encountering
                     this present is through a mediated—indeed, a very mediated—relationship.

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>But it is also productive to revisit Romantic-era writers in discussions of the Anthropocene
                     because they were thinking about the instability of their position on earth, as David
                     Collings and others have demonstrated.

                              and “natural design,” while forgetting about the “transcendental excess” of the biblical
                              deluge, whereas Romanticism turned its attention to the latter (351).</span></div>
                     </div> While poems tend to maintain a centered, subjective, personal outlook, there are also
                     moments when the species’ position on the planet is called into question. Accordingly,
                     the first-person perspective might become subordinated to other views; it may become
                     of equal value; or it may be represented as the one and only one in a “last man” scenario.
                     Regardless of the outcome, it is appropriate and timely to reinforce the emphasis
                     on media in Romantic-era texts by introducing an adaptation project that fleshes out
                     our mediated relationship to the planet. And adaptations are important because they
                     encourage students to think critically and creatively about changes to human relationships
                     that adapt with changes to the earth.
                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>In what follows, I focus on a shorter exercise in which students adapt a lyric poem
                  to a hand-drawn illustration. Of course, other media might seem more obvious. Recently,
                  Stephanie Hershinow has written an instructive essay on selfies and Romantic-era novels
                  in the classroom. At bottom, Hershinow’s essay is a “defense of relatability.” No
                  doubt, the ubiquity of the digital image today helps students relate to the text.
                  But it helps them relate to the text according to today. The purpose of the illustrated
                  adaptation may seem a bit backwards given the emphasis on the current geological epoch.
                  And yet, adapting the poem to an illustration allows students to open a new point
                  of access by transforming something unfamiliar into something rudimentary (indeed,
                  rude), the importance of which cannot be overstated. For if humans are to survive
                  in an age of recurring climate disasters, in barely habitable slums, and with minimal
                  access to resources, digital visualizations might help. More likely, under such grim
                  conditions, maintaining basic tools for thought and communication may become a key
                  feature of teaching/education at any level, because, in short, making pictures might
                  be what is available.
               </p>
               <p>The goal of the adaptation is to see the source text in a new way that can draw attention
                  to the poem’s details—especially those related to the medium itself—which may be less
                  apparent by reading the poem in its written form only. Through the same process, students
                  will enhance their media literacy; they will investigate a Romantic relationship between
                  the self and nature; and ultimately, they will situate this relationship in a larger
                  history of ecocritical perspectives. It is within this larger history that Romanticism
                  becomes especially useful in the Anthropocene, for it unabashedly raises questions
                  regarding how to orient one’s self in a world without clear markers for orientation,
                  without an indication of one’s dominant (or subordinate) status, or a path leading
                  one beyond any foreseeable horizon. For readers primarily interested in an in-class
                  activity that they can add to their repertoire, I will focus in the first section
                  exclusively on an adaptation exercise with respect to Wordsworth’s “Written in Germany”
                  from <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (1800). In the second section, I will present a vocabulary for interpreting media
                  and media representations in Wordsworth’s poem. The third section focuses on the poem’s
                  depiction of a typical Romantic-era ecocritical perspective: the centered point of
                  view. Last, by offering a brief outline of a class as a whole, I show how a course
                  might locate Wordsworth’s outlook in a broader historical context, bringing the Romantic
                  outlook into contact with views from the Anthropocene that cannot afford to be restricted
                  to the margins.

               <h2><span class="head">Illustrating Wordsworth’s 
                     “Written in Germany”

               <p>
                  “Written in Germany, on One of the Coldest Days of the Century”
                  features Wordsworth sitting alone in his cottage, warmed by a stove, and addressing
                  a housefly that mistakes the stove’s heat for the warm weather that has yet to arrive.
                  What follows is a short description of the fly’s predicament in relation to Wordsworth’s
                  situation. It contains a promise that Wordsworth will look after the fly until the
                  coming spring, followed by an apostrophe to a lover, and concludes with a reference
                  to God as the witness guaranteeing the equilibrium of the world (the return of spring).
                  The poem thereby ends with a more optimistic and less ambiguous version of Shelley’s
                  question, “If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?” (70). Between the address to
                  a nonhuman thing and the emphasis on return or recuperation, 
                  “Written in Germany”
                  certainly belongs to the larger body of Wordsworth’s work on nature. But given the
                  obscurity of the poem and its almost utter absence from literary criticism, why focus
                  on this nature poem?

                  <p>While most classes on ecopoetry or ecocriticism are likely to study Wordsworth’s 
                     “Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey”
                      (1798), pairing it with 
                     “Written in Germany”
                      more adequately demonstrates Wordsworth’s direct engagement with the conditions of
                     the planet:

                     “Tintern Abbey,”
                      regarding nature as a motion and a spirit, Wordsworth looks at the earth in 
                     “Written in Germany”
                      through a Lockean lens. The planet is a body with a lifespan—and it is on a downward
                     trajectory. A course on ecocriticism and textual studies would make much of the fact
                     that the second stanza was included in the poem from 1800–1815, and from this date
                     on it is absent from most collections. One could argue that the later editorial decision
                     as well as the poem’s current online presence overlooks an earlier, more ecocentric
                     version of Wordsworth.

                  <p>In the classroom, students can synthesize the many variables of Wordsworth’s poem
                     by illustrating it. When they arrive in class, the desks are clustered together with
                     paper and markers, crayons, and colored pencils. I withhold prefatory remarks, and
                     instead, with the prompts already distributed, I let students jump into the activity.
                     Beginning with the activity is an inductive approach to teaching. It allows students
                     to go “into the field” to create a host of examples, and from these samples their
                     conclusions ensue. If the course is more focused on environmental science (perhaps
                     as part of a literature and science course), this approach can reinforce the rise
                     of inductive reasoning.

               <p>After which, students select a quote from the poem that captures an important part
                  or the “whole” of the image. It is an especially useful step for demonstrating how
                  images and the written word are in conversation with each other. Through various combinations,
                  students can play with literal reinforcements, ironic twists, or juxtapositions. Finally,
                  students share their work, providing an account for why they chose to depict Wordsworth’s
                  poem the way they did, and why they selected this particular quote.
               </p>
               <p>Administering this exercise on five separate occasions, I have seen an impressive
                  range of variations on Wordsworth’s poem. A typical adaptation includes a poet/speaker
                  figure by a stove inside a cottage. Many of the illustrations place the speaker in
                  the center of the image. The other common variation removes the poet altogether, as
                  if the student were assuming the role of poet describing the cottage, objects, and
                  atmosphere. There is also a significant tendency among students to interpret the poem
                  from an ecocentric standpoint—centering the fly rather than the human narrator.

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The adaptation becomes an exercise in visual rhetoric. The transposition from one
                     medium to another requires students to ask a different set of questions regarding
                     how the objects depicted relate to one another:

                     outlined and some filled in, some foregrounded and some backgrounded, and some included
                     and some excluded? As students hear the many explanations behind these myriad images,
                     they realize that each iteration convinces audiences of a different message. Some
                     are anthropocentric, some ecocentric; some are optimistic, some pessimistic. Finally,
                     hanging the images together on the wall demonstrates the incredible nuances of the
                     source text and our reading of it. As I say, it is just like in art class: we’re all
                     painting the same bowl of fruit, but the variety of outcomes is nearly infinite.

               </div>
               <p>The exercise also demonstrates that drawing can be part of the writing process. The
                  illustration provides a foothold allowing students to see the poem as a whole and
                  from multiple perspectives. Plus, drawing in a group setting demonstrates the collaborative
                  nature of reading and writing. Last, because students engage with the poem in a creative
                  register, they gain insight into how artworks are made—namely, by transposing an idea
                  from one medium to another. So, while it may seem like a gratuitous detour, students
                  ultimately arrive at a greater appreciation for the wide range of steps leading to
                  a final product and the individual value of those steps.
               </p>
               <p>Before entering an extended analysis of the exercise’s significance, I want to point
                  out what is obvious and also the easiest point to miss: if we want to visualize ourselves
                  in the Anthropocene, any picture of the self today already achieves this goal. Twenty-five
                  years ago, I doubt that anyone was drawing this particular Wordsworth poem. And no
                  one was posting images of this poem to Twitter. It is a truism of phenomenology that
                  it is difficult to notice an old medium, or one taken for granted, like a hand-drawn
                  illustration. But technically, once the picture is posted online, that particular
                  combination of media (a digitized illustration) is a relatively recent outlet. The
                  blending of older and newer media can obfuscate not just what we are seeing, but when
                  we are seeing. In other words, visualizing ourselves in a world without us is still
                  a challenge to be addressed, but it is important to bear in mind that we are already
                  visualizing ourselves in the Anthropocene. We could not use these media in this combination
                  without the Anthropocene, and the converse is also true. So, if hand-drawn illustrations
                  of Wordsworth’s poetry strike some as too cute to be taken seriously, consider that
                  their digitized existence on the internet is bound necessarily to the geological reengineering
                  of the planet.

                     To understand the significance of the media involved, it is necessary to provide students
                     with a vocabulary for interpreting how we relate to media and how different mediums
                     relate to one another (“media” and “mediums” are both acceptable plural forms of “medium”).

                     </div> The <em>OED</em> defines a medium variously as “something which is intermediate . . . a middle state”;
                     an “intermediate agency, instrument, or channel; a means”; a currency or “anything
                     commonly agreed as a token of value and used in transactions”; “any raw material or
                     mode of expression used in an artistic or creative activity”; a “channel of mass communication”
                     or a “physical material (as tape, disk, paper, etc.) used for recording or reproducing
                     data, images or sound”; and, in the natural world, any “intervening substance through
                     which a force acts on objects at a distance or through which impressions are conveyed
                     to the senses.” I tell students to think of the medium as the vehicle for the content
                     (which is really just another medium). Studying media avoids hermeneutic questions
                     like “What does the text mean?” Instead, media studies can ask, “How fast is a text
                     produced/circulated? How many copies are there? And how many audience members can
                     participate at a given time?” In short, media studies describes how literature functions.

                  <p>Marshall McLuhan offers two useful terms for describing how media work: “hot” and
                     “cold.” A hot medium is one that provides lots of information that targets multiple
                     senses.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>McLuhan actually writes that a hot medium extends a “single” sense in “high definition,”
                              for instance, a photograph with many pixels targets sight in particular (36). This
                              side of his definition must be weighed in the balance with his overall definition:
                              warmer media are immersive because they enwrap the viewer, thus targeting multiple
                              sense faculties simultaneously.</span></div>
                     </div> For instance, the theater of the eighteenth century included moving bodies, spoken
                     language, music, costumes, sets, props, and lights (each one is, of course, a different
                     medium under the sign of “theater”). In such an immersive setting, a case could be
                     made for affecting sound and vision, as well as olfactory and haptic senses. On the
                     other end of the spectrum, a book of poetry is a relatively cold medium. It is ink
                     and paper, read with the eyes and held with the hands. The most important distinction
                     between the two examples is the audience’s level of participation. In the case of
                     the theater, the viewer receives expressions of characters’ faces, the inflections
                     of actors’ voices, and the hues of lights, costumes, and scenery. The theater’s details
                     are determined external to the audience’s subjective perceptions. A written text might
                     describe faces, voices, and environmental appearances, but the reader must mentally
                     determine the output of this information. I tell students, cold media require lots
                     of imagination, while hot media provide all the information “prepackaged.” One student,
                     Dexter Blue, added the compelling idea in a recent class that hotter media require
                     less imagination but an increase in attention: there are fewer blanks to fill in but
                     more details to follow.

               <p>Comparing the poem 
                  “Written in Germany”
                  to an illustration requires a subtle analysis. Students might object: “If we’re only
                  concerned with the medium, then our drawings are no different than the poem.” Indeed,
                  the two artifacts belong to the same medial family: both are ink on paper. But typeface
                  and hand-drawn illustrations vary in terms of style and expression, including texture,
                  color, and movement. These conventions can all be measured in terms of determination.
                  In the majority of printed texts, the type tends to be relatively uniform from copy
                  to copy and even from book to book; when it is not uniform, the typeface calls attention
                  to the written word as a medium (consider the genre of concrete poetry, for example).
                  At which point, the word migrates from a linguistic to a visual modality. So yes,
                  the two media share a great deal. The challenge is dividing them.

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>At another level, McLuhan’s terms can also inform students’ understanding of media
                     as represented in the poem. In the last lines of the second stanza, Wordsworth explains
                     that in 1740 the weather was “cutting and rough,” but “<em>now</em>,” according to the “glass” (or the thermometer), it is “four degrees lower.” It is
                     a happy coincidence that an exercise on the poem and the “temperature” of its medium
                     includes a thermometer among the poem’s many images. Likely a representative or metonym
                     for “science,” it seems like a cool medium at first: thermometers provide very little
                     information and target only a single sense faculty. Indeed, counter to the theater,
                     scientific instruments tend to belong to a strictly visual field. And unlike the printed
                     text, their strictly quantitative notation system diminishes room for interpretation:
                     40 degrees is 40 degrees in all times and places (of course, this absolute is a little
                     less than absolute, given the competing scales, Fahrenheit and Celsius, both eighteenth-century
                     inventions). But when determining the “temperature” of a medium (in this case, the
                     thermometer), it is necessary to consider the object in relation to other objects
                     of its time (synchronically) as well as its place within a wider history of media
                     (diachronically).

                              McLuhan’s study has been expanded to include Siegfried Zielinski’s concept of “deep
                              time.” Jussi Parikka charts the Anthropocene’s development from a deep history, namely
                              its “systematic relation to the carboniferous” (17), to its dystopian present and
                              futurity, in which our everyday technical objects (laptops, mobile phones, and so
                              forth) add to “a new future layer of zombie media” (114).</span></div>
                     </div> In this case, Wordsworth wants the coolness of the technical object to stand in stark
                     contrast to the “excellent stuff” that makes up the planet. And the planet is of an
                     ever-increasing age and an ever-decreasing temperature. Accordingly, the thermometer
                     is technically “hotter” than the earth. The poem thus becomes a debate on scientific
                     media versus natural or ecomedia, where the former (instruments) are becoming increasingly
                     adept at “reading” the latter (planet). It is not the case that Wordsworth’s scientific
                     object actually provides more information or targets more sense faculties than the
                     earth (synchronically), but if he is evaluating them on a scale according to age,
                     then scientific inventions are on the newer, hotter end of the spectrum (diachronically).

                  <p>Thus students learn that no medium operates in total isolation. Even the various media
                     in and outside of Wordsworth’s poem maintain a relationship: the planet does feel
                     cooler, which requires a thermometer to measure and a stove to keep warm; the stove
                     allows Wordsworth to remain awake, meditating with his mind and speaking with his
                     voice; we are holding the book documenting this scene; and through the printed words
                     on the page, we are giving voice to Wordsworth’s ideas, very likely with the aid of
                     a light bulb or a screen. McLuhan would say that media alter human relationships—the
                     stove brings humans around the fire, and the lightbulb allows us to have night class.
                     Today, we might say that we are entangled in an “ecology of reading” and the terms
                     “hot” and “cool” can help us measure these relationships—if not precisely, at least
                     in terms that students can readily apply in and outside of the classroom.

               <p>The end goal is to help students think about the value of the range of temperatures
                  among different media in the Anthropocene. As literary scholars concerned with the
                  conditions of the planet, there may be a tendency to downplay the value of hot media.
                  After all, they require less imagination, thus diminishing one’s ability to enter
                  another’s perspective. But the downside of a cooler medium may be that visualizing
                  one’s self leads to some pretty solipsistic interpretations of the present or the
                  future. So it is not enough to simply say that cool media are worth more than hot
                  media, for the perspective one embodies in the act of imagining a world can quickly
                  diminish the adequacy of the representation. It may become, in John Keats’ terms,
                  an instance of the egotistical sublime. Accordingly, in an evaluation of media adaptations
                  in the Anthropocene, an analysis of media at play still requires additional modes
                  of inquiry: perspective must also be considered.

               <h2><span class="head">Self and Nature</span></h2>
               <p>Adapting “Written in Germany” to a visual modality and different media also draws
                  out the poem’s implications for the self or the lyric “I” in relation to nature. The
                  history of the lyric “I” is already tied up with the development of this genre’s medium.
                  With the rise of print culture comes the parallel shift from a public to a private
                  lyric. The material history corresponds with a change internal to the genre, the switch
                  from external address to internal meditation. As Scott Brewster introduces the topic,
                  this turn within the genre represents the dominant form of lyric poetry, and reaches
                  maturity during the Romantic period, at the same time that Wordsworth and his circle
                  “elevate” the poet “who becomes synonymous with the lyric ‘I’” (30, 73). In addition
                  to the dialectic between public and private, Brewster’s study explores additional
                  dichotomies within the lyric: timelessness and history, objectivity and subjectivity,
                  and, what is most important for our purposes, self and nature. Echoing Robert Langbaum,
                  Brewster claims that the lyric “constitutes a blurring of the inner and outer worlds:
                  the self is projected onto external nature, which in turn becomes a mirror that reflects
                  back an image of the self” (84). While it is a convenient way to model the self, in
                  the last decade Timothy Morton has promoted a critique of this binary relationship.
                  For Morton, the ecocritic ought to beware of the Romantic subject showcasing the natural
                  landscape: “Instead of looking at the trees, look at the person who looks at the trees”
                  (125). Morton’s advice is rhetorical; for him, the speaker determines the message.
                  Thus, critics should ask, Who is the figure at the center? How have they come to be
                  determined as a speaking self in the first place? And can the speaker be trusted?
                  An examination of the medium through which this figure is encountered can contribute
                  to answering these questions.

                  <p>Because Wordsworth is often depicted in student drawings as a singular individual
                     resting inside a cottage, his position stands in contradistinction to the freezing
                     landscape, which the students make visible by way of a lone window. It is an apt depiction
                     of the “theater of the mind.” This arrangement quickly establishes a division between
                     self and nature, inside and outside, or mind and world. At this stage, students might
                     be introduced to empirical and idealist tendencies in the long eighteenth century.
                     For if everything “outside” the cottage is determined by Wordsworth’s narrator “inside,”
                     the poem seems to maintain the so-called idealist views of George Berkeley, whose
                     influence can be felt in the period from Blake to Byron.

                              Berkeley’s theories can be regarded as idealist, but his idealism is not antirealist.
                              As Paul Redding points out, it is rather a brand of “spiritual realism” (3–4).</span></div>
                     </div> An empirically based idealism calls into question any certainty with respect to objects
                     “outside” of one’s thoughts. The appeal of such a philosophy is the stability it lends
                     to the self. The problem is the instability it lends to everything else. In addition
                     to centering the narrator, the students’ images continue to bolster the poem’s latent
                     idealism by “flattening” the entire poem onto a single page or domain, with only a
                     window to indicate something beyond the medium.
                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>Yet the self-contained image of the lyric “I” is often disturbed in literature by
                  a nonhuman intervention. In Wordsworth’s case, a fly happens upon the scene and tiptoes
                  across the stove’s hot iron surface. In literature more generally, Morton explains,
                  the introduction of a nonhuman other destabilizes the illusion of a self-contained
                  “I,” separated from the nature “over there” (99–100). It is an object from the outside
                  which has broached the barrier separating the dreamer from the dream. Furthermore,
                  the fly is the very figure of the disorientation that comes with significant, global,
                  ecological changes. The fly in 
                  “Written in Germany”
                  has lost all sense of space and time. The fly is a “fool,” “seduc’d” from its “winter
                  retreat” by the heat of the stove, and now creeps across the flat black iron surface,
                  a postapocalyptic image wrought by human hands (11–15). The parallel between the fly
                  and Wordsworth is apparent enough: the poet is also a fool in the wrong place at the
                  wrong time, vacationing in Germany in the dead of winter. Moreover, the postapocalyptic
                  situation of the fly (the sun is gone; the earth is flat, black, and hot) is just
                  one of many possible outcomes also available to Wordsworth. Thus this stranger thing
                  calls into question the stability of the presence that the lyric “I” presupposes,
                  and encourages the suspicion that the fly, Wordsworth, all of us really, are just
                  aimless objects.

                  <p>Of course, Wordsworth attempts to reestablish the inside/outside barrier, but through
                     two very different means: generically and theologically. Consistent with Morton’s
                     formula for ecomimesis, first denying a separation between self and nature but then
                     reifying the difference in the process, the poet contains nature by naming it.

                              is to reinforce the aesthetic distance, the very dimension in which the subject-object
                              dualism persists. Since de-distancing has been reified, distance returns even more
                              strongly, in surround-sound, with panoramic intensity” (135).</span></div>
                     </div> Wordsworth identifies nature according to a particular time and place, a common convention
                     of Romantic nature/lyric poetry (Brewster 76–77). In 
                     “Tintern Abbey,”
                      Wordsworth points to a particular time and place in the title, 
                     “Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey, on Revisiting the Banks of the Wye
                     During a Tour, July 13, 1798.”
                      He thus transitions once and for all from the timeless/divine plane to a historical/earthly
                     one, creating a convenient heading for the index at the end of the book of the world.
                     The title, 
                     “Written in Germany,”
                      is a less obvious marker because it provides no chronological date, but—and perhaps
                     in a more adequate representation of a particular aspect of reality—it names a specific
                     “location” in the history of the earth through temperature (“on One of the Coldest
                     Days of the Century”). Date and location become temperature and location. Or perhaps
                     more accurate still, especially in a discussion of the longue durée of the planet:
                     time is temperature. Here, the reality of Wordsworth’s situation gets the better of
                     his ecomimesis: between the poet’s relocation to Germany and the temperature’s low
                     point, the central figure of the poet is, in fact, just as disoriented as the fly—he
                     just doesn’t know it yet.

                  <p>Wordsworth’s final attempt to secure the self and the planet can be linked to an apostrophe,
                     or an address to something or someone not present within the poem.

                     </div> In this desolate plane, Wordsworth’s final recourse is God. It is the same logical
                     move Berkeley makes in his philosophy. If essence is perception, things can exist
                     independent of the human mind—even without humans—because ultimately, everything is
                     a perception of God. Wordsworth also finds atonement in the divine testimony, “Yet,
                     God is my witness” (36). God sees all, and thus, even the tree falling in the forest
                     without a human nearby to hear it is real. The problem is that, if Wordsworth finds
                     recourse through an all perceiving and all preserving deity, he remains in good standing
                     even if he disavows scientific knowledge about the planet. Science charts global temperatures
                     and allows Wordsworth to know that, in fact (as far as the information he had at the
                     time could provide), the earth was cooling and becoming less hospitable to life. The
                     safety net God provides brings Wordsworth in the end to the familiar conclusion of
                     optimists, that all will return to a happy equilibrium: “thou small helpless Thing,
                     / Thy life I would gladly sustain / Till summer comes up . . . and with crowds / Of
                     thy brethren a march thou shoud’st sound through the clouds, / And back to the forests
                     again” (36–40). Certainly, if Wordsworth restricts himself to “this” year, a “balance”
                     between winter and spring, nature and self, life and death seems to be had. But the
                     scale with which he begins (“coldest day of the century”) haunts the local perspective:
                     the conditions of the earth must be measured according to hundreds of years (really,
                     millions of years), not what’s happening next month.

               <p>While students can see Wordsworth in relationship to (nonhuman) others, neither poem
                  nor visual adaptation satisfies the need to narrate social, political, and economic
                  changes over such a long period time. This conclusion conflicts with the argument
                  put forth by Nick Sousanis, who explains in <em>Unflattening</em> that illustrations (especially, comics), “are read sequentially like a text [and]
                  the entire composition is also taken in—viewed—allatonce” (62). As the pictures on
                  the page and the final phrase’s compression make clear, visual images can demonstrate
                  change without movement, which makes them powerful tools for describing a longer (a
                  much, much longer) narrative about the human position leading up to, within, and even
                  after the Anthropocene. The problem in class is that most students do not draw Wordsworth’s
                  story as a sequence. Instead, they depict Wordsworth and his relations in “a moment,”
                  as the lyric genre would seem to encourage. So the source of the problem—visualizing
                  the self in the Anthropocene with adequacy—can be located in Wordsworth’s point of
                  view, the lyric “I,” which dominates the poem. What is needed then may be a different
                  medium, but it also might be a different way of collating the information from within
                  the same medium.

                     adapt the text to yet another medium: the stage. Performing the drama makes palpable
                     the connection between Enlightenment science, the human determination of the planet,
                     and the subordination of an indigenous people to European colonialists.

                              of The Tempest and Naylor’s novel. While Naylor herself denied that Mama Day adapts
                              The Tempest (Gruber 238, note 4), that fact only provides an additional topic for
                              discussion: Must adaptations be intentional? And what is the responsibility of a critic
                              in the face of an author disavowing another work’s influence?</span></div>
                     </div> The former (science) is found in the city, whereas the latter (magic) endures on an
                     island—on the margin of the continental United States. But Naylor’s narrative also
                     complicates <em>The Tempest</em> and the view from the margin in meaningful ways. Unlike Caliban, Naylor’s characters
                     are not explicitly oppressed by a single white patriarch; instead, they grapple with
                     the subtle ways in which they have internalized white-American, rational-scientific
                     values and beliefs with respect to people and the planet. Students benefit from analyzing
                     how Naylor adapts aspects of Shakespeare’s play, while at the same time recognizing,
                     as Donald J. Reilly points out, how she embeds Gothic conventions dating to the eighteenth
                     century for the sake of creating “a space in which Naylor is able to write back against
                     American hegemony” (243). Within the medium of the text there is a parallel tension
                     with respect to “when” we are as well as “who” or “what” we are. Shakespeare and Naylor
                     call into question the stability of the power over nature that accompanies the centered
                     Romantic outlook even as they reckon with the difficulties that accompany resistance
                     to this power.

               <p>If the ability to resist the capitalist, patriarchic, and techno-rationalist destruction
                  of the planet is compromised by one’s position within this system, then the view from
                  the margins demonstrates on another level that visualizing the instability of the
                  self and human relations within the Anthropocene may be a problem of perspective after
                  all. Of course, such a conclusion ought to raise objections, as if I were suggesting
                  that global warming—a sign of the Anthropocene—is merely a matter of interpretation.
                  While global warming may be an adequate characterization of the planet’s current trajectory,
                  human access to this current and future state remains subject to one’s cultural position.
                  Plenty of information is available with respect to global warming and the Anthropocene,
                  but an understanding of the fuller implications of this information requires the ability
                  to visualize one’s self as subject to it, which requires the ability to visualize
                  one’s self in an unstable position. The earlier part of this essay attempted to outline
                  an exercise for precisely this purpose, visualizing one’s self in an unfamiliar time,
                  place, and climate. But if the information being visualized is grounded in a centralized
                  or marginalized perspective, the information may not communicate the actual conditions
                  and changes to the earth. The information given and the changes depicted may become
                  mere plot devices for effectuating a narrative of blind hope (or a capitalist vision
                  of productive negativity).

                  <p>One solution to this potential pitfall is to subtract perspective altogether. In a
                     section on the “view from nowhere,” students investigate representations of a view
                     detached from its own situation.

                              “To represent an experience from outside by imagining it subjectively is the analogue
                              of representing an objective spatial configuration by imagining it visually. . . .
                              What is represented need not resemble the representation in all respects. It must

                              universals. . . . But the capacity to form universal concepts in any area enables
                              one not only to represent the present situation from without but to think about other

                     </div> Taking the subject out of the landscape eliminates the phenomenological approach to
                     ecology, personal encounters with other objects and species, and perhaps most importantly,
                     local time and space. Instead of near becomes far and far becomes near, here becomes
                     nowhere and nowhere becomes everywhere. Such a view is exemplified in digital databases,
                     and a good one to accompany Wordsworth’s poem is the 
                     “World Meteorological Organization Global Weather &amp; Climate Extremes Archive,”
                      hosted by Arizona State University. It is a database containing extreme temperatures
                     (similar to those found in 
                     “Written in Germany”
                     ), according to geographical location and date. As students gloss over the various
                     names and numbers, I ask: Who is the narrator in this database? Who is the protagonist?
                     Where is the beginning of this database, the climax, and the dénouement? Because databases
                     do not include a narrator, hero, or a clear beginning, middle, and end, it is difficult
                     to identify with the text or to follow it in relationship to one’s own position. Unlike
                     a Wordsworth poem, <em>The Tempest</em>, or Gloria Naylor’s novel, there is no sequence that mirrors a moment, a few days,
                     or the years of one’s life. Compared to the image, the database flattens time and
                     space by eliminating any centered or marginal “I,” as well as the step-by-step sequence
                     that inevitably leads to some action, discovery, or resolution. In the database, all
                     events are equal.

                              weaknesses of “distant reading.” I am writing about a scientific database and not
                              a model of literary history, but models are relevant because they rely on datasets
                              to produce predictions with accuracy. In her discussion of textual analysis, Johanna
                              Drucker rightly points out that some scholars mistake computational methods for absolute
                              objectivity. They forget that “automated methods are also fraught with cultural, historical,
                              and other prejudices built into their design” (631). Indeed, all models are situated
                              …</span></div>
                     </div> In the case of 
                     “Written in Germany,”
                      Wordsworth writes about a foreign country he visits at a particular time, providing
                     the English with a glimpse at the relative ways humans live out their moral-aesthetic
                     lives. By contrast, the database can provide information on Germany in 1800 as well
                     as the Philippines in 2017. With all of this information combined, climate scientists
                     can make predictions about the planet hundreds of years into the future. Accordingly,
                     the lack of a personal view (and the concomitant absence of a narrative) allows any
                     place at any time on earth to have an equal value in relationship to any other place
                     or time on earth. While some might see this “flattening out” of time and space as
                     equivalent to an “emptying out” of personhood, the same mechanism also affords a place,
                     such as the Philippines, an equitable position in relationship to the United States
                     or the United Kingdom in its struggles with global warming. While some in the United
                     States may suffer from less anxiety over rising sea levels and temperatures, these
                     are exigent environmental issues for the archipelago that makes up the Filipino nation,
                     and it may only be through a database that these two regions (and many more) can be
                     regarded simultaneously and their needs weighed in the balance.

                              from their own homes and are even comfortable with a slight increase of temperature
                              because it will “improve” the weather “for them,” while encouraging major disasters

               <p>Of course, as N. Katherine Hayles claims, databases still require narratives to “achieve
                  dramatic impact and significance” (178). While the database is a great equalizer,
                  it leads back to the historical depictions of humans in time of the kind Joseph Priestly
                  was so adeptly renovating at the end of the eighteenth century. They certainly attempt
                  to achieve a degree of adequacy, but these maps say little about how to relate to
                  others. Nor can we find total satisfaction with Wordsworth’s 
                  “Written in Germany,”
                  as it reveals how one’s personal outlook can obscure the facts regarding normative
                  and nondiscursive registers. Really, what is needed is Wordsworth’s narrative in relationship
                  to a larger network of human and nonhuman relations throughout time and space, and
                  media adaptations can still help map such interconnections. One can envision a larger
                  project that asks students to incorporate all or most of the materials from a class
                  on environmental literature into a final project, repurposing Wordsworth’s lyric in
                  combination with other poems, novels, dramas, even blogs, scholarly articles, and
                  databases. Based on the amalgamation of these modes, genres, and media, students might
                  make their own conjectures regarding human relations in the last instant, at the end
                  of the Anthropocene, or just prior to a world without us.

               the convergence of media theory, the scientific revolution, and a renewed attention
               to Virgil’s <em>Georgics</em> (18–20). For McKusick, he points to Wordsworth as “one of the first” to give rise
               to human ecology, “if by that phrase we mean the study of the complex relationships
               between human communities and their dwelling places” (70).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               “Understanding Media in 1805: Audiovisual Hallucination in <em>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</em>”
               in <em>Studies in Romanticism</em>, 40.1 (2001). In addition, a growing number of articles, collections, and monographs
               have emphasized the materiality of artworks and the discussions of media that take
               place within those texts more generally, including Miranda Burgess, Alexander Dick,
               and Michelle Levy’s special issue of <em>European Romantic Review</em> (2011), Andrew Burkett’s <em>Romantic Mediations: Media Theory and British Romanticism</em> (2016), as well as James Brooke-Smith and Andrew Burkett’s edited collection for

         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">In their introduction to a special collection for <em>Victorian Studies</em>, David Coombs and Danielle Coriale make an appeal for a more “strategic presentism”:
               “To make presentism a strategy means asking how presentism might help us better understand
               and address the ways the past is at work in the exigencies of the present . . . from
               the economies of consciousness as a so-called global workspace to the anthropocene
               as an epoch whose hallmark, paradoxically, is the radical compression of the longue
               durée of geological change” (88). Strategic presentism is not a call to merely “act
               <em>now</em>.” It is a call to recognize that historical periods/events—including “the” present—cannot
               be viewed in a vacuum.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               and “natural design,” while forgetting about the “transcendental excess” of the biblical
               deluge, whereas Romanticism turned its attention to the latter (351).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               Wordsworth’s poem as an ecopoem. Counter to Shoptaw’s claim that an ecopoem must be
               “environmental” and “environmentalist,” Timothy Morton believes that, at bottom, all
               poetry is ecopoetry (<em>Ecology Without Nature</em> 79).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               for instance, a photograph with many pixels targets sight in particular (36). This
               side of his definition must be weighed in the balance with his overall definition:
               warmer media are immersive because they enwrap the viewer, thus targeting multiple

               McLuhan’s study has been expanded to include Siegfried Zielinski’s concept of “deep
               time.” Jussi Parikka charts the Anthropocene’s development from a deep history, namely
               its “systematic relation to the carboniferous” (17), to its dystopian present and
               futurity, in which our everyday technical objects (laptops, mobile phones, and so
               forth) add to “a new future layer of zombie media” (114).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               the existence of God or a spiritual mind independent of human thought. Accordingly,
               Berkeley’s theories can be regarded as idealist, but his idealism is not antirealist.
               As Paul Redding points out, it is rather a brand of “spiritual realism” (3–4).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               subject-object dualism, to convince us that we belong to this world. But the end result
               is to reinforce the aesthetic distance, the very dimension in which the subject-object
               dualism persists. Since de-distancing has been reified, distance returns even more
               strongly, in surround-sound, with panoramic intensity” (135).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               and Jonathan Bate’s claim that <em>The Tempest</em> prefigures Baconian/Enlightenment science, Elizabeth Gruber argues that, as an adaptation
               of <em>The Tempest</em>, Toni Morrison’s <em>Tar Baby</em> “takes up the narrative of a postcolonial setting, so that the novel comments on
               processes and practices rendered only in inchoate terms in Shakespeare” (226). Gruber’s
               essay is not only an excellent introduction to the dichotomy between white-patriarchal-naturalistic
               science and black-matriarchal-pantheistic magic, but she also provides an instructive
               application of adaptation theory, noting that the “magic of adaptation resides in
               paradox, depending as it does on the simultaneity of repetition and transformation”
               (225).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note18_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               Must adaptations be intentional? And what is the responsibility of a critic in the

               “To represent an experience from outside by imagining it subjectively is the analogue
               of representing an objective spatial configuration by imagining it visually. . . .
               What is represented need not resemble the representation in all respects. It must
               be represented in terms of certain general features of subjective experience—subjective
               universals. . . . But the capacity to form universal concepts in any area enables
               one not only to represent the present situation from without but to think about other
               possibilities which one has not experienced and perhaps never will experience directly”
               (21).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note20_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note21"><span class="noteLabel">21. </span><span class="noteBody">In a recent edition of <em>PMLA</em> (2017), a number of scholars debated the strengths and weaknesses of “distant reading.”
               I am writing about a scientific database and not a model of literary history, but
               models are relevant because they rely on datasets to produce predictions with accuracy.
               In her discussion of textual analysis, Johanna Drucker rightly points out that some
               scholars mistake computational methods for absolute objectivity. They forget that
               “automated methods are also fraught with cultural, historical, and other prejudices
               built into their design” (631). Indeed, all models are situated in a human, moral-aesthetic
               domain. But as Richard Jean So also points out, models are not intended to “[bring]
               forth intractable empirical truths that one must accept or reject, [rather] the reader
               is encouraged to reason with the model and its maker to better grasp the data” (671).
               So concludes that what models do well is expose error, and error should be thought
               of as a “constitutive part of science . . . something to be integrated formally into
               our research,” instead of something to be merely “tolerated or avoided” (672). While
               a view from nowhere may not be entirely possible, attempting to see from the perspective
               of an idealized nonlocation can expose errors reinforced by an all-to-comfortable
               faith in our subjective, first-person observations.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note21_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
