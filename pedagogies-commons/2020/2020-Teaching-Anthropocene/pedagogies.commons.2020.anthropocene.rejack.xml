                <p rend="noCount">This essay explores how the feeling of living in the
                    Anthropocene and its strange temporality affects how we teach, and specifically how
                    we teach Romanticism. Teaching without a solid sense of futurity—the reigning
                    affective state of our current moment—cuts at the core of pedagogical practice.
                    Drawing on a recent experience of teaching an undergraduate-level course in
                    Romanticism with a focus on “The Failures of Romanticism,” I suggest that
                    Romantic-era texts can offer models of feeling appropriate to the affective
                    experience of living amidst global ecological catastrophe, and maybe help us fail
                    together better. When teaching without a future we must combine our melancholic
                    embrace of vulnerability with other affective modes; in this essay I propose we
                    imbue our Anthropocenic pedagogy with love, acceptance, and humor.</p>

            <p>Two summers ago I was lucky enough to get married in Estes Park, Colorado, amidst the
                grandeur and geologic variety of the Rocky Mountains. The day before the ceremony,
                some friends and I visited Rocky Mountain National Park, driving along its famed
                Trail Ridge Road, eventually stopping at a parking area located more than 12,000
                feet above sea level, where we gawked at a herd of grazing bighorn sheep. After
                getting our fill of the sheep, we proceeded to walk up the gentle slope of the
                Tundra Communities Trail. It brought us to a group of several mushroom rocks, so
                named for their mushroom-like appearance, and which, a small plaque informed us,
                were composed of some of the oldest rocks in the park. The granite base and schist
                cap date back approximately 1.7 billion years, having been formed through volcanic
                and metamorphic processes respectively, then covered for millions of years by a sea
                and the many layers of sediment it deposited on top of them, sediment that would
                later erode away through several periods of glaciation. So it happens that the
                mountain range’s ancestral rocks come to reemerge in our present. </p>

            <p>The deep time of geologic processes was not the only thing on my mind over the course
                of the nuptial weekend. Getting married, it turns out, tends to focus one rather
                intensely on the present. In addition to basking in the love flowing between all
                those gathered in celebration, there are pressing issues like ensuring that one’s
                eyebrows look good (failure), figuring out how to lower the room temperature at the
                reception (mostly failure), or getting the background music to the perfect volume
                level for all parts of the room (success!). Even so, I had geologic time in the back
                of my mind. Living in the Anthropocene has this effect: we can’t help but think of
                the unimaginably vast stretches of time and space that brought the world to the
                state we find it in, while also recognizing that we inhabit a present in which we
                are responsible for the anthropogenic destruction rendering the future so tenuous.
                As the editors of <title level="m">Arts of Living on a Damaged Planet</title> pose it,
                “living arrangements that took millions of years to put into place are being undone
                in the blink of an eye” (Tsing et al. G1). The shock and sadness that accompany this
                strange temporal situation came to mind during the reception, when I was at once
                deeply touched by a family member’s remark that he and his wife would be celebrating
                their fortieth anniversary next year, and deeply troubled by the thought that 40
                years from now my spouse and I might not have much of a world in which to celebrate
                that milestone for ourselves. I recognize that talk of “the end of the world” or
                other dire speculations on the fallout from climate change may seem alarmist,
                exaggerated, or overly dramatic. But the reality of what we will have wrought by
                2057, or whatever arbitrary future target we set for ourselves, doesn’t matter as
                much as the feeling that such calamitous things may come to pass. As David Collings
                writes in <title level="m">Stolen Future, Broken Present</title>: “We are now caught
                in a surpassingly strange, horrific moment—a moment when we cannot help but think,
                is it too late? Do we still have a future?” (11). We don’t and can’t know for
                certain the answers to those questions, but that we exist in a moment when asking
                them is not ridiculous enhances the urgency of responding to them. The affective
                experience of living in the Anthropocene matters crucially when we consider, as
                Collings writes, that “<emph>the future is never just for the people of
                    the future; without that future, what we do now loses its force</emph>. Without a
                future, there is no present and not much of a past” (19).</p>
            <p>I focus in this essay on how the feeling of living in the Anthropocene and its
                strange temporality affects how we teach, and specifically how we teach Romanticism.
                Teaching without a solid sense of futurity cuts at the core of the practice. 
                In <title level="m">Learning to Die in the Anthropocene</title>, Roy Scranton suggests
                that “the greatest challenge the Anthropocene poses . . . is a philosophical one:
                understanding that this civilization is already dead” (23). How does one teach—a
                profession predicated on the future and on stable structures of civilization—with
                that realization? In the spring of 2016 I taught a course in which that question was
                always present in my mind; through that experience I sought to understand the
                intersections between Romanticism, ecological collapse, and the role of affect in
                the space of the classroom. The course was a 200-level undergraduate class on
                Romanticism I titled “The Failures of Romanticism,” and the conceptual premise was
                that as much as Romantic writers exude optimism, in other ways the recognition of
                Romanticism’s own failures is built into the project. With this focus, I asked
                students to recognize one way we continue the legacy of Romanticism, given that we
                now reckon with so many systems (economic, political, social, and of course,
                ecological) falling apart. The experience of consistently bumming out my students
                about the fate of the world, however, led me to think deeply about the pedagogical
                effectiveness of such affective work. The neoliberal university in its terrifying
                ideal form would turn faculty members into little more than customer service workers
                emitting mandated positive affect like any other laborer in the precarious gig
                economy. Such a fate in no way appeals to me, nor does it make much sense when
                contemplating ecological catastrophe. Even so, I continued to wrestle with the
                nagging sense that melancholy and anxiety might not be the best affects for
                pedagogically engaging with the Anthropocene.</p>
            <p>So what to do, then? I would suggest that teaching in the Anthropocene calls for a
                shared embrace of vulnerability, which ought to begin with the teacher’s own
                displays of (often melancholic) feeling, but must not end there.<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">In both <title level="m">Ecology without Nature</title> and
                    <title level="m">The Ecological Thought</title>, Timothy Morton argues
                            that melancholy is the privileged affect of the Anthropocene. While he
                            does note that the “ecological thought . . . is realistic, depressing,
                            intimate, alive and ironic all at the same time,” I suggest that
                            irony—and particularly playful, joyful irony—ought to receive more
                            attention and emphasis (<title level="m">Ecological Thought</title> 16). I
                            share with both Chris Washington and Morton the sense that we can do
                            without the irony of “postmodern hipster posturing” and its “T-shirt
                            sloganeering” (Washington 454; Morton, 
                    <title level="m">Hyperobjects</title> 173). Washington suggests that Romantic irony,
                            particularly in its tragic register, can help us “be relocated into the
                            tragedy of the present rather than the farce of the future” (454). But
                            the tragedy of the present needs the irony of the fool as well—an irony
                            of joy as well as of sorrow, and utterly, embarrassingly sincere with
                            respect to both.</note> After the fall, we still exist, and we
                require other sensations. Collapse is, etymologically, a 
                <emph>falling together</emph>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">From the Latin
                    <emph>col-</emph> (together) <emph>labi</emph> (to fall). The <title level="m">OED</title>
                            notes that the participial adjective “collapsed” appears to have emerged
                            (from the Latin form, <hi rend="italic">collapsus</hi>) before the verb
                            and noun usages.</note> Teaching Romanticism with this focus on
                failure and collapse reinforced for me my sense that Romantic-era texts can offer
                models of feeling appropriate to the affective experience of living amidst global
                ecological catastrophe, and maybe help us fall together better. The poetics of
                sensibility in Charlotte Smith’s <title level="m">The Emigrants</title> and 
                <title level="m">Beachy Head</title>, the extension of sympathy to the downtrodden in
                Mary Robinson’s <title level="m">Lyrical Tales</title>, John Keats’s experiments with
                the core being of sensation and affect, and Mary Shelley’s temporally layered
                contemplations of human finitude in <title level="m">The Last Man</title>—all these
                textual encounters become newly inflected as we teach in a time when we cannot
                choose but feel in radically different ways thanks to what we have wrought. By the
                time we reached the end of the semester and read <title level="m">The Last
                Man</title>, I (and, I think, my students) felt an affinity with its narrator and
                titular figure, Lionel Verney, who writes to no one save “<hi rendition="#smcap">the
                    illustrious dead,</hi>” whom he bids “<hi rendition="#smcap">arise, and read your
                    fall!</hi>” (466). Like Verney, we now experience the deep temporal disruption
                wrought by the Anthropocene. As Verney’s beloved Idris exclaims early in 
                <title level="m">The Last Man</title>, we too feel as if “already the to-morrow is
                come” (85).</p>
            <p>But even if we are “Too, too late for the fond believing lyre” and its
                forward-looking messages of hope, teaching this class reinforced my sense that we
                cannot rely on despair or sadness alone for our affective pedagogical modes. Unlike
                Verney, my students and I did not have the option of responding to the recognition
                of global catastrophe by embarking on a solitary voyage around the world’s oceans.
                We are here. We are alive. As we find ourselves surrounded by the “haunted
                landscapes” characteristic of the Anthropocene, the persistent pasts we’ve attempted
                to raze nevertheless remain, and because of their ghostly presences, these pasts
                “relentlessly trouble the narratives of Progress, and urge us to radically imagine
                worlds that are possible because they are already here” (Tsing et al. G12). Or as
                Austra poses it in the opening track of her poignantly Anthropocenic album 
                <title level="m">Future Politics</title>, “<ref rend="new"
                    target="https://austramusic.bandcamp.com/track/we-were-alive">It’s like we were
                    alive</ref>.” After the fall, after the revelation that is apocalypse, we move
                forward with the recognition that the vitality of humans and nonhumans always has
                been there, even when we were too dull to sense it, and always will be there, even
                when we recklessly pursue our own destruction. In the span of geologic time, the
                earth will be just fine, even as climate change in our shorter-term span will render
                unimaginable suffering for human and nonhuman beings. We need to act as if we were
                alive, even if it is already too late for us. In the classroom, when teaching
                without a future, we must combine our melancholic embrace of vulnerability with
                other affective modes; at the risk of sounding like some sort of New Age self-help
                book, I propose we imbue our pedagogy with love, acceptance, and humor.</p></div>

            <p>When we teach, we put our loves on display. We embody and perform our loves not 
                necessarily of other people, but of the things that we teach, the things we attempt 
                to commune with and communicate to our students. This assertion likely calls to 
                mind any number of teaching narratives in which teachers profess their abiding 
                passion for their subjects, for their students, for teaching itself. Indeed, 
                one might say that passion for one’s subject material is an essential component of 
                good teaching; we’ve all, at one point or another, been either praised or shamed 
                for the degree to which we express enthusiasm for our subject material in the 
                classroom. The unstated assumption is that the more visible the passion, the better 
                the teaching, and the better the teaching, the better the learning. I hope to expand 
                on our commonplace understanding of the relationship between passion and learning by 
                drawing attention to an affect intimately related to love: namely interest, which 
                Silvan Tomkins in his influential model refers to as the “most seriously neglected” 
                of the affects (337). A pedagogy of love requires attunement to the transformations 
                and rearticulations of interest (and perchance love) by students. This is not to say 
                that we should love our students and that they should (nay, <emph>must</emph>) love 
                us in return. Of course there are affective bonds between teacher and student, but 
                for a variety of reasons including the inappropriate forms of teacher-student love 
                that manifest at various levels of education, I call for something quite different. 
                The love that transpires moves through objects, not subjects. We love the objects of 
                interest; students themselves become interested in those objects; in the aftermath, 
                both teacher and student come to love (or not) an object of interest that is and is 
                not the object with which they began. That is to say, a pedagogy of love operates 
                iteratively. We iterate our love and students translate that love into a new 
                iteration, which we take up, transform, and reiterate.<note place="foot"

                    points and in different ways.</note></p>
            <p>A similar model of love exists in Percy Bysshe Shelley’s short essay 
                <title level="a">On Love.</title> His attempt at a definition begins:<quote>
            <emph>Thou</emph> demandest what is Love. It is that powerful attraction
                    towards all we conceive, or fear, or hope beyond ourselves, when we find within
                    our own thoughts the chasm of an insufficient void, and seek to awaken in all
                    things that are, a community with what we experience within ourselves. If we
                    reason we would be understood; if we imagine we would that the airy children of
                    our brain were born anew within another’s; if we feel we would that another’s
                    nerves should vibrate to our own, that the beams of their eyes should kindle at
                    once and mix and melt into our own; that lips of motionless ice should not reply
                    to lips quivering and burning with the heart’s best blood:—this is Love. This is
                    the bond and the sanction which connects not only man with man, but with every
                    thing which exists. (503–4)</quote>
                I draw on Shelley’s notion of love since it’s as much a theory of communication as it 
                is a contemplation of love. It figures love as a communicative process of tuning or 
                harmonizing signals. Love begins in what Roman Jakobson calls the phatic register of 
                communication, when an utterance exists primarily to test the status of the channel 
                (e.g., “Can you hear me now? Is this thing on?”). In a manner similar to how Maurice 
                Blanchot poses the communicative content of a work of literature, “What it says is 
                exclusively this: that it is—and nothing more” (22), love likewise references itself. 
                Love, however, operates in the interrogative. What love says is exclusively this: 
                <emph>is it that</emph>? Promising something ever more about to be, love requires 
                response. As Shelley puts it, love demands that “another’s nerves should vibrate to 
                our own.” We approach love with trepidation because the answer to “is it that?” may 
                return as a resounding, Prufrockian “That is not it, at all.” Phatic communication 
                likewise risks never receiving a reliable response indicating an open channel. When 
                I speak to a silent classroom, it might as well be engulfed in a wall of noise that 
                my meek voice could never hope to rise above. This pedagogy of love, then, is not 
                some magical answer to the ambiguity of transfer. Instead, I propose that we table 
                the question altogether. Much is to be gained from the acceptance of noise, darkness, 
                obscurity, and the anxiety such obstacles provoke.</p>
            <p>In testing our love for the objects we teach, students potentially become the
                signal-boosters of the message. With no future, though, what kind of signal can we
                ever hope to hear echoing back to us? First we must simply accept that communication
                moves through “enfeebl[ing] . . . mediums,” as Shelley puts it in <title level="m">A 
                    Defence of Poetry</title> (513). But a related strategy is to shift the agency
                of love to the side of those objects that interest us (for me, always my first love,
                Keats). Embracing a Latour-inspired distributed agency, one that posits the crucial
                role of nonhuman objects, ought to come easily, given the language we use to discuss
                interest in loved objects. When something <emph>piques our
                interest</emph>, it stabs us, leaving an imprint of itself in the shape of a wound, a
                remnant of its liveliness. When interest wanes, the object <emph>does
                    nothing</emph> for us. When we say <emph>that interests me</emph>, the
                causal emphasis ought to fall on the same side as the grammatical subject of the
                sentence. When interest begins, we say <emph>I’m into that right
                    now</emph>, emphasizing the spatial and temporal aspects of affective interest.
                Objects are mediums for interest to navigate between the different things existing
                in the spaces those objects occupy and coproduce. Such spaces emerge, evolve, and
                dissipate over time. Using the intransitive valence, we can say that objects are
                always <hi rend="italic">interest</hi>ing, always doing the activity of interest,
                whether or not some other object (like a teacher or a student) comes along to
                respond to its vibratory activity.<note place="foot" resp="editors">My account 
                    of the vibrancy and vitality of objects in this paragraph is indebted 
                    to Jane Bennett’s model of agency in <title 
                        level="m">Vibrant Matter</title>.</note> Here we can point
                again to Shelley’s model of love as a communicative process involving requests for
                other lively objects to act in concert with us, to share interest and thereby
                “kindle,” “mix,” and “melt” with one another. The bonds of this kind of love connect
                not only humans to humans, and not only sentient beings to other sentient beings,
                but “every thing which exists.”</p>
            <p>What are the payoffs then? For one, this approach to love in the realm of pedagogy,
                when articulated via the kinds of vocabulary I’ve adopted throughout, counters some
                of the reigning assumptions about the role of passion in teaching. Love in the sense
                I invoke it operates not as something that one willfully adopts, but rather as an
                affect acting through us and our interactions with others (humans and nonhumans).
                One benefit of such a theoretical alignment is the possibility of novelty. Because
                our interests choose us as much as we choose them, new things emerge without our
                conscious designs necessarily implementing their arising. This other-oriented love,
                this haunted and haunting love for dark objects, is also ethical and political in
                nature. It demands that we reckon with the being of all things in the altered
                ecology of the Anthropocene. Objects of interest speak to us. Sometimes we know not
                what they say until their voices resound through our students’ taking up of those
                same objects, and thus we commune with our students. We share that which is common,
                that which means. We correspond by co-responding, responding together, to things
                that are not us. Thus a pedagogy of love—not a selfish, but an 
                <emph>other</emph>ish love; in Blakean terms, the love of a clod, not of a
                pebble—offers a means of resisting a key ideological assumption of neoliberalism:
                the notion that we are all autonomous, divided selves fully responsible for our own
                successes and failures, both of which can only ever be adjudicated by the dictates
                of the market. Shelley argues that “the great secret of morals is Love; or a going
                out of our own nature” (<title level="m">Defence</title> 517). Poetry and imagination
                operate on us by strengthening our ability to go out of our natures, and now that
                the Anthropocene urgently forces us to reimagine our natures and the imbrication of
                our natures with our altered environments, we need to exercise those faculties as
                much as possible. The classroom may be one of our last discursive places in which
                such exercises are not only possible, but actively encouraged and cultivated. This
                expansive notion of love and the forms it circulates in will not prevent
                Anthropocenic despair, but attempting a pedagogy rooted in love may at least help us
                and our students better attend to the world in which we find ourselves, tenuous and
                temporary as it is. And attending to reality is the first step toward imagining
                another one.</p>

            <p>We hear a lot about climate denial in the United States, although perhaps less than
                we used to, now that alternative strategies to the complete rejection of facts and
                science have surfaced (“I’m no scientist!” “Sure,
                CO<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> plays a part, but we can’t know
                what other factors are involved,” or the utterly inane, childish, nonsensical
                Pittsburgh-not-Paris excuse). Just as grieving individuals work their way through
                denial and eventually proceed to acceptance, we as a species (and especially the
                U.S. as a country) need to work toward that point. The difference in this situation
                is that we need to accept not only the reality of anthropogenic climate change and
                all that it has already and will continue to do; we need also to accept that we are
                to blame. If a murderer were to pass through the five stages of grief for his
                victim, I suppose that’s what humanity now faces. In this case, though, the murder
                occurred through billions and trillions of tiny cuts, with all of us joining in the
                slaying like so many Caesarian conspirators, albeit with many more stabs coming from
                some peoples and places (i.e., the citizens, myself included, of the one country
                that continues to deny the existence of climate change most vociferously, despite
                having across history accounted for the greatest proportion of <ref rend="new"

            <p>If we treat the objects of our inquiry with love, honor, and care, we will ideally be
                led to respect their full reality, even if we cannot fully apprehend it. When we
                apply that thinking to the reality of climate change and global ecological
                catastrophe, a corollary affective response will be acceptance, as long as we can
                find ways to move through denial, anger, and other understandable responses to the
                recognition of inhabiting a planet that may already be locked into a future in which
                human life will more or less become impossible. For this reason, acceptance of our
                complicity in creating the Anthropocene ought to become the emblematic affect of our
                new epoch. The challenge is to prevent ourselves from moving immediately after
                acceptance into quiescent despair. But first I should explain why I even conceive of
                acceptance as an affect, given that it may more readily be understood as a logically
                reasoned position one consciously adopts. True acceptance emerges precisely from 
                <emph>not knowing</emph>. While I can certainly affirm that I am complicit
                in anthropogenic climate change, I can never know exactly how I am folded into it
                (to gesture toward the etymology of <emph>complicit</emph>, which comes
                from the Latin <foreign xml:lang="la">plicare</foreign>, meaning to fold or to weave). The
                folds of causality and responsibility are aesthetic in nature, meaning that we
                cannot know them, but we can feel their effects and affects.<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">In <title level="m">Hyperobjects</title> Tim Morton argues as much 
                    to explain the impossibility of fully cognizing a massively distributed (across
                            time and space) object like global warming.</note> As Keats
                attempts with the Grecian urn and the mysterious “leaf-fring’d legend” which “haunts
                about [its] shape,” the contours of my part in affecting the global climate can only
                ever be probed by questioning contemplation, by being teased out of thought and into
                embodied response by encounters with the ghostly objects moving about us. When I
                type this sentence on my computer, I play a part in introducing more carbon dioxide
                into the atmosphere. Yet it’s a part for which I do not know the lines, even though
                I’m so obviously already standing on the stage. To accept is to feel one’s presence
                in the drama that is the Anthropocene even while remaining in the dark about how the
                play began and how it will end. The classroom becomes a recursive, iterative
                performance of this pageant, one in which my embodiment of acceptance helps to guide
                students into recognizing that they too share the stage with us all.</p>
            <p>Acceptance is thus a particularly performative affect. As is the case with Sara
                Ahmed’s discussion of the stickiness of affect, my notion of acceptance involves how
                we orient ourselves toward, and how we are oriented by, other subjects and objects.
                What is the point of acceptance if we do not embody it forth for others? Here we
                arrive at the strategy to make other outcomes than despair issue from acceptance.
                For an illustration of this strategy, I turn to Jeff VanderMeer’s novel 
                <title level="m">Acceptance</title> (aptly titled for my purposes).
                <title level="m">Acceptance </title>is the last volume in
                VanderMeer’s <title level="m">Southern Reach</title> trilogy, a series that revolves
                around an unexplainable ecological catastrophe in an unknown location described
                simply as Area X. Across the three novels we learn some things about the past of
                Area X and its present situation, as well as characters’ attempts to make sense of
                the fundamentally altered world they find themselves in. Toward the trilogy’s
                conclusion, one of the main characters provides this gloss on acceptance
                specifically with respect to the new reality of Area X, but which can be readily
                translated into a reflection on living in the Anthropocene: “The world we are a part
                of now is difficult to accept, unimaginably difficult. I don’t know if I accept
                everything even now. I don’t know how I can. But acceptance moves past denial, and
                maybe there’s defiance in that, too” (338). To accept that we have no future, to
                accept that we are to blame, is perhaps the best means we have for defiance today.
                Acceptance marks a refusal to fight against things as they are, but it does not mean
                that we refuse to work toward how things might otherwise be. The defiant force of
                acceptance comes from the affectively embodied recognition of what we’ve done, even
                while not fully knowing how or why we did it, or even precisely what it was. We thus
                open a space for the future, even if it’s an already doomed one. A doomed future is
                nonetheless a future, and it’s ours if we accept it.</p>
            <p>We might even venture beyond defiance and into what Jean Baudrillard, in a much
                different context, calls “refusal by overacceptance” (219). I know that my love for
                Keats (or any other writers/texts from Romanticism) will remain always devoid of any
                clear, unambiguous vibratory response, but I accept and love nonetheless. And I know
                that what I do now as a teacher might not matter if we have no future as a species,
                but I accept and love nonetheless. Thence proceeds melancholy, but also joy, which
                is what I find on every track of Anohni’s recent album, <title level="m">Hopelessness</title>, 
                and in particular on the track <title level="a">4 Degrees,</title> which provides
                the soundtrack to this essay’s opening. Encountered as quotations in an essay, the
                song’s lyrics (such as “I want to see this world / I want to see it boil,” or “I
                want to hear the dogs crying for water”) probably seem anything but joyful. Indeed,
                they are disturbing, and deeply sardonic. But if something can be simultaneously
                sardonic and sincere, this song accomplishes it. Anohni performs radical acceptance.
                She sings with glee of her desire to “burn the sky” and “burn the breeze,” of
                reveling in seeing “the animals die in the trees.” A purely sardonic reading of the
                song would perhaps imagine Anohni performing the role of some crazed fossil fuel
                baron, cheering on the destruction of the globe as we pursue four degrees of warming
                as if it were a quarterly earning target (here, and throughout her album, she is not
                unlike Wordsworth taking on different voices in <title level="m">Lyrical
                    Ballads</title>, or Robinson making similar moves in <title level="m">Lyrical
                    Tales</title>). While that reading is certainly a valid one, we might also read in
                the affective sincerity of her voice an admission and acceptance of her own
                complicity. Sure, those in the extractive industries who actively work against the
                interests of reducing emissions are easy to caricature as monstrous villains devoted
                to global destruction, but the brilliance of Anohni’s song is its insistence that we
                are all monstrous. We are all folded into this complicated mess, even if we try to
                get off the grid. The problem is there is no off-grid. As Anohni sings in the final
                lines of the album, “We are all Americans now.” No one escapes blame, even as
                different levels of blame are surely warranted. While sorting out and apportioning
                blame in just ways is crucial for the politico-economic realm, the more fitting
                affective and aesthetic answer is to belt out an electro-pop number proclaiming just
                how mired in it we all are: “Let’s Go! Let’s Go!” The song won’t do anything to stop
                rising CO<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> levels (and how could it?), but it does teach
                us something about the irony of acceptance and the complexity of how it feels.

            <p>It may be a stretch to claim that <title level="a">4 Degrees</title> is funny, but it 
                certainly has a kind of gallows humor beneath its macabre surface. Does gallows humor 
                become unfunny when the entire globe is approaching the scaffold? In any case, the path 
                from love to acceptance next takes me to humor, or at least irony and the possibility of 
                joyful laughter always residing in irony, even in its darkest forms. In this final
                affective register I find the greatest value in what I regularly do in my
                Romanticism classrooms, which I’ve modeled throughout this essay: putting
                contemporary materials into relation with Romantic ones. As D. B. Ruderman and
                Rachel Feder point out in their introduction to <title level="m">Teaching
                    Romanticism with the Contemporary</title>, this method may seem to risk “potential
                anti-historicist implications,” but they counter that “sometimes one must think
                trans-historically in order to produce a historicist understanding.” They continue,
                “it is possible to wield the contemporary to peel back the cloak of canonicity that
                sometimes obscures Romantic literary experiments, all the while making students
                better readers—indeed, Romanticist readers—of their own literary, cultural, and
                historical moments.” One element of the current historical moment that the Romantic
                and neo-Romantic pairings can illuminate is the set of geologic, political,
                cultural, and ecological forces and effects that we have come to denominate with the
                term Anthropocene.</p>
            <p>In loving, honoring, caring for, and accepting our past histories and texts, and in
                seeking to understand them in relation to our present and future in the
                Anthropocene, contemporary materials help with the crucial task of privileging and
                supporting the voices of nonnormative, oppressed, disadvantaged, or otherwise
                unjustly treated peoples. In the political arena we need to align climate advocacy
                with broader social justice issues; as Naomi Klein points out in <title level="m">This 
                    Changes Everything</title>, those on the front lines of the climate fight,
                those inhabiting what she calls “Blockadia,” are often indigenous peoples who’ve
                been systematically oppressed and abused while not experiencing the benefits that
                the extractive industries have afforded to those of us removed from the front lines.
                We need to do the same in the cultural realm. With respect to pedagogy and living in
                the Anthropocene, queer and trans theory in particular offer poignant perspectives
                (that Anohni released <title level="m">Hopelessness</title> as her first album
                publicly announcing her trans identity while also engaging deeply with issues around
                climate change strikes me as a fitting congruence). The knowledges afforded by queer
                and trans perspectives teach us, among other things, what it means to inhabit
                realities, environments, and embodiments that do not conform to normative scripts of
                various kinds.</p>
            <p>In her book <title level="m">Strange Natures</title>, Nicole Seymour offers a
                compelling union of queer theory and environmental criticism, using the former’s
                means for resisting “the natural” to help us see more clearly the world around us in
                all its nonnormative brilliance. Significantly, Seymour departs from strains of
                queer theory that reject futurity outright.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Seymour 
                    writes that while “queer theoretical work has tended to characterize futurity and 
                    future-thinking as heteronormative and pro-capitalist,” she maintains instead that 
                    “a queer ecological focus on futurity can highlight the fact that <emph>lack</emph> 
                    of concern for the future more accurately characterizes regimes such as 
                    heteronormativity and global capitalism” (183).</note> She insists that queer ecology 
                must make room for thinking the future, but instead of a triumphalist, masculinist approach 
                to environmentalism, she advocates for “a specifically queer ecological ethic of care:
                a care not rooted in stable or essentialized identity categories, a care that is not
                just a means of solving human-specific problems, a care that does not operate out of
                expectation for recompense” (184). In both <title level="m">Strange Natures</title>
                (particularly in her chapter on Shelley Jackson’s <title level="m">Half Life</title>)
                and in her more recent work, Seymour insists on the value of adopting ironic,
                irreverent, and humorous forms of engagement with ecological issues.<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">Seymour explores more fully a wide range of irreverent takes on 
                    environmentalism in her recent book <title level="m">Bad Environmentalism</title> (U of
                            Minnesota P, 2018).</note> Jack Halberstam writes at the end of
                <title level="m">The Queer Art of Failure</title> that “to live is to fail, to
                bungle, to disappoint, and ultimately to die; rather than searching for ways around
                death and disappointment, the queer art of failure involves the acceptance of the
                finite, the embrace of the absurd, the silly, and the hopelessly goofy” (187).
                Seymour works with a similar insight and ports it into the realm of ecological
                thinking, feeling, and action. Writing about ecocinema, she argues that “unserious
                affective modes can do serious work, sometimes even more successfully than serious
                ones” (<title level="a">Irony and Contemporary Ecocinema</title> 73). That does not mean 
                that serious affects have no place in discourses concerning ecology, nor does it mean 
                that we ought to stop seriously searching for ways to prevent ecological catastrophe from
                getting worse. But it does mean that we ought to accept that it’s already happened,
                that we’ve made it happen, and that as we fight against the forces that brought us
                here, we ought to do so precisely by continuing to fail, by reveling in our own
                absurdity, and by examining ourselves with irony, humor, and care. To do so is a
                collective endeavor (“Failure loves company,” writes Halberstam), and if we fail
                together, if we <emph>co</emph>-llapse, then “all our failures combined
                might just be enough, if we practice them well, to bring down the winner” (121,
                120).</p>
            <p>Romanticism is arguably a failed project, but it’s one that continues. We hear it
                when listening to the minimalist techno of <ref rend="new"

                pairing their relentless looping patterns with Wordsworth’s poetics of repetition in
                <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>. We see it when gazing at the lush <ref rend="new"

                    Anatsui</ref>, who takes the detritus of global capitalism and converts it to
                sensuous excess, not dissimilar to Keats’s translations of the materials of his
                belated literary inheritance into something entirely richer, fairer, brighter than
                what came before him (all the while failing more spectacularly than he ever could
                have succeeded). We sense and feel it in the system-creating work of saxophonist
                    <ref rend="new" target="https://colinstetson.bandcamp.com/">Colin Stetson</ref> (after
                seeing him perform in between two days of reading Blake with my students, I
                enthusiastically related to them that I had an epiphany: at a particularly intense
                moment of his consistently visceral performance, a massive glob of spit fell from
                his mouth to the floor; meanwhile his alien soundscapes continued to flow throughout
                the room, and I realized that the saliva was a latter day “corroding fire,”
                stripping away the surface of things to reveal the substance of his art as material
                all the way down, but infinite nevertheless). And we think through it when we
                attempt to contemplate the spatiotemporal vastness of climate change.<note place="foot"

                Maria Williams’s mental time-travel reflections on the French Revolution anticipates

                though we might replace Williams’s enthusiasm with our melancholy (which, we need
                always to remind ourselves, shares an abode with joy):

                . . . I think I hear them exclaim, “Here the Federation was held! here an assembled
                nation devoted themselves to freedom!” I fancy I see them pointing out the spot on
                which the altar of the country stood. I see them eagerly searching for the place
                where they have heard it recorded, that the National Assembly were seated! I think
                of these things, and then repeat to myself with transport, “<hi rend="italic">I</hi>

            It is difficult, but we do get back again to present times, where we recall our
                failures, as Williams would do in her later volumes of the <title level="m">Letters
                    Written in France</title>, as her enthusiasm about the revolution waned, even as
                she ultimately remained optimistic. Perhaps now that our own ruin is so apparent to
                us, optimism is the wrong affect. Let us adopt instead, modifying Lauren Berlant’s
                “cruel optimism,” a <emph>kind pessimism</emph>. Optimistic triumphalism
                in the realm of the Anthropocene would merely reinscribe the same ideologies that
                got us here. “<ref rend="new"
                    target="https://store.other-people.net/release/76126-nicolas-jaar-sirens"
                    >History Lesson</ref>,” the closing track on Nicholas Jaar’s album <hi
                    rend="italic">Sirens</hi>, sums up the Anthropocene well: “Chapter one: we
                fucked up. / Chapter two: we did it again, and again, and again, and again.” Let’s
                accept it, admit it, and do what we can with love and care to move into a future
                that we cannot possibly know.</p>
            <p>Contemporary fiction, music, and art are crucial for helping us to imagine new worlds
                with the kindness needed to accompany our pessimism. That means empathy, love, and
                humor in the place of the nihilistic despair we find in popular postapocalyptic
                fictions like <title level="m">The Walking Dead</title>, which compulsively repeats
                hypermasculinist fantasies of pure capitalist competition wherein the currency is
                life and success means taking someone else’s before they take yours. Instead we need
                works like Kim Stanley Robinson’s <title level="m">New York 2140</title>, in which
                most of Manhattan is underwater, but where new social and political forms
                nevertheless take shape, and where the possibilities for the future are not simply
                echoes of past moribund systems. We need music like Austra’s 
                <title level="m">Future Politics</title>, which refuses to accede to the stagnant politics 
                of despair, hypocrisy, and moral decrepitude embodied so horrifyingly by the current
                American president, and instead creates a musical and lyrical vocabulary for
                sincerely envisioning a future of love, empathy, and radical alterity. We need
                novels like Margaret Atwood’s <title level="m">MaddAddam</title>, the final entry in
                the trilogy of the same name, in which we find humans, pigoons (genetically
                engineered pigs designed to have their organs harvested), and Crakers (a new species
                of human abandoned by their creator) forging solidarity across species lines in the
                aftermath of ecological disaster and the death of most of the Earth’s human
                population. Atwood’s novel manages uproariously funny moments throughout, even as it
                also consistently reminds readers of the unimaginable suffering humans have visited
                upon one another in its world.</p>
            <p>To conclude, then, where might we find humor in Romanticism? And more importantly,
                where do we find the right kind of humor, one appropriate to confronting the
                Anthropocene? As I so often do, I find answers to these questions through John
                Keats. Although he might often be seen as an emblematically serious poet of High
                Romanticism, Keats is also ridiculously funny, even in his darkest moments of
                despair. My friend and colleague Michael Theune has pointed out (in many
                conversations with me over the years, and recently in print) that when Keats writes
                of feeling like he is “leading a posthumous existence”
                (<title level="m">Letters</title> 359)—a phrase that becomes
                deeply entwined with narratives about Keats’s deathly seriousness—he is making a
                pun! When he comes up with that phrase, Keats has arrived in Italy, separated from
                his love and increasingly resigned to his imminent death. As if dying from
                tuberculosis apart from all his loved ones weren’t bad enough, he also had to endure
                a vicious journey by ship, and upon finally arriving in Naples, he still could not
                go ashore for another 10 days, needing first to survive a quarantine period. Writing
                from Rome a month later, Keats tells his friend Charles Brown about using punning as
                a response to his horrific circumstances: “at my worst, even in Quarantine, [I]
                summoned up more puns, in a sort of desperation, in one week than in any year of my
                life” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 360). It’s in this same
                letter that Keats reflects on the feeling of “leading a posthumous existence.” Now,
                Keats loves to pun; we know this. Keats loves Shakespeare; we know this as well.
                What we tend to miss with “posthumous existence” is that it combines these two
                loves. As Theune explains, “Keats, exiled to Italy, away from his beloved Fanny
                Brawne, is leading a life like that of Posthumus, the character from Shakespeare’s
                <title level="m">Cymbeline</title>, who is exiled to Italy and so separated from
                his beloved Imogen” (48). If Keats can find space for humor in his grim personal
                circumstances, then surely we can do so in the face of collective global doom.</p>
            <p>But there remain more ways to learn humor from Keats. If humor and irony (and maybe
                even acceptance) emerge out of failure, then Keats ought to be able to teach us a
                thing or two. The critical discourse around Keats from his day to our own rests on
                the idea that he begins his career with (mostly) embarrassing failures which he
                manages to transform into affirmative successes a few years later. While this
                narrative certainly has merit, I suggest that one under-regarded area of 
                <emph>late</emph> failure, and <emph>late</emph> humor, is
                Keats’s final, long but unfinished poem, <title level="m">The Cap and Bells; or The
                    Jealousies</title>, or as Keats himself referred to it, <title level="a">Lucy 
                        Vaughan Lloyd,</title> so
                named for the moniker under which he planned to publish it. One imagines that as
                Keats was travelling to Rome with the knowledge that he was surely to die there,
                perhaps still feeling, as he had in February 1820, that he had “left no immortal
                work behind” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 263), he might
                have thought to himself, with a bit of gallows laughter, “And 
                'Lucy Vaughan Lloyd' was the last thing I worked on?!” 
                I don’t have the space here to develop a full reading of the poem, but for 
                the purposes of putting its humor into the context of affective response to 
                the Anthropocene, consider two things: the poem narrates a
                civilization of fairies who seem to have a better understanding of the vast spaces
                of the globe and their interrelations than do humans, even as the main fairy
                characters desire to flee to the human realm and be with their human lovers; and at
                the same time, the poem subtly gestures toward the defining global climate
                catastrophe of the Romantic period, the eruption of Mount Tambora.<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">The poem includes Crafticant’s diary recollections from traveling 
                    with Bellanaine across the world, in which he recalls the following sight:<quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                            <l>Beheld afar off, in the hooded shade</l>
                            <l>Of darkness, a great mountain (strange to speak),</l>
                            <l>Spitting, from forth its sulphur-baken peak,</l>
                            <l>A fan-shaped burst of blood-red, arrowy fire,</l>
                            <l>Turban’d with smoke, which still away did reek,</l>
                            <l>Solid and black from that eternal pyre,</l>
                            <l>Upon the laden winds that scantly could respire. (660–66)</l>
                        </lg></quote></note> The fairies understand the global environment, 
                but they desire to inhabit an insouciant and unknowing human perspective 
                in which erotic desire is all that matters. At the same time, during their 
                journey the fairies Crafticant and Bellanaine conquer space and time with more
                mastery than humans, given that they travel through the Gobi desert to Afghanistan
                and arrive in western India, even though their journey began in Nepal. Perhaps the
                imprecise or impossible aerial navigation results from Keats’s lack of knowledge or
                interest in such matters. But if that is the case, it only supports the poem’s
                broader satire, which demonstrates that the fairies who know too much simply want to
                be silly like us and not worry about the broader world. The Anthropocene shows us
                that we can’t afford to not know, but if we are to survive it, we also need to laugh
                at, critique, and ironize the bases upon which our knowledges rest, particularly now
                that the reigning political discourse in the United States treats knowledge with
                such disdain. To do so is an affective challenge that will permeate all aspects of
                cultural life; the classroom enables the possibility that such affective poses could
                radiate outward, gathering strength and spreading to other people and spaces as we
                all move into the future.</p>
