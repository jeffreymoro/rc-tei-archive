                           A Tragedy. Cain, A Mystery (London, 1821), p. 328, Byron had cautioned: ‘I am not

                           had visited Switzerland in his continental tour of May–August 1817. The ‘calumnies’
                           Byron believed Southey to have later spread were rumours that Byron and Shelley had
                           engaged in a ‘League of Incest’ during their residence in Switzerland in 1816.</span></div>
