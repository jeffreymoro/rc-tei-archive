                  of faith, politics, philosophy &amp; taste. The Q R. is orthodox &amp; loyal; farther than
                  this it has no pretension to consistency. I believe that I have never advanced a single <span class="ital">principle</span> in it, which has not at some time or other (sometimes in the same number) &amp; sometimes
                  certainly with marked design, received a point blank contradiction in its pages.</p>

            <p class="indent1">I send you herewith a few passages of censure which may be inserted in perfect consistency
               with the intent &amp; tenour of the paper. As for <span class="ital">sobering down</span> the praise, I am a loss to discover where the praise is, &amp; so will you when you <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> reconsider it. For I take it for granted there can be no wish that the approbation
               bestowed upon him for his love of literature &amp; the fine arts, &amp; the generous terms
               upon which he lived with <span class="strikethrough">the most eminent</span> &lt;some&gt; of his contemporaries should be either withdrawn or abated.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You are afraid that the paper might do a great disservice to literature &amp; morals.
               I should think my character a sufficient guarantee &lt;against&gt; any such danger. But
               I pray you put it into <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turners</a> hands, – &amp; if he <span class="strikethrough">points out</span> &lt;finds&gt; any thing in it which could in his judgement possibly be injurious to morals,
               – let him strike &lt;it&gt; out.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You ask as a favour to yourself that I would make alterations. I shall make all the
               alteration of which the paper will admit; &lt;That is, against the scruples of commendation
               in one scale, I will throw a few grains of censure into the other.&gt; But if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">M<sup>r</sup> Gifford</a> is no longer capable of conducting the Review (which I hear from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Sir Walter Scott</a> is his own account) I think you should acquaint me who those friends are by whose
               advice it is conducted. No future Editor, be he who he may, must expect to exercise
               the same discretion over my papers which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">M<sup>r</sup> Gifford</a> has done. I will at any time curtail what may be deemed too long, &amp; consider any
               objections that may be made with a disposition <span class="strikethrough">always</span> to defer to them where it can be done without sacrificing my own judgement upon <span class="strikethrough">a</span> points which may seem to me important. But my age, &amp; (I may add without <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> arrogance) the rank which I hold in literature entitle me to say, that I will never
               again write under the correction of any one.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have never spared time, research or pains of any kind, in any thing that I have
                  written for you. This I am sure you know. And nothing of mine has ever brought disgrace
                  upon the Review, or involved you in any difficulty as the Publisher. On the contrary
                  the &lt;QR&gt; would sometimes have been saved from merited obloquy, if it had taken the
                  bias which I would have given it. The events of life are uncertain, – life itself
                  still more so. How much or how little I may contribute to that Journal in future depends
                  upon circumstances which no one can foresee. But whenever such of my papers as are
                  worthy of preservation shall be collected (– whether you permit <span class="strikethrough">to xxx</span> it to be done while am able to do it, &lt;to restore them where they have been mutilated,&gt;
                  &amp; to incorporate other matter with them, – or whether it be done after my decease)
                  I shall be well content that posterity should judge of my &lt;opinions&gt; by what will
                  there be found.
