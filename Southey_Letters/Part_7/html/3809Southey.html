               the unauthorised publication of Southey’s early radical play, <em>Wat Tyler</em>, in 1817. The first letter appeared in <em>The Times</em>, 25 January 1822, and was signed ‘THE EDITOR OF WAT TYLER’ and dated 23 January 1822.
               It claimed to be from one of the people instrumental in arranging for the publication
               of Southey’s play in 1817; see Daniel E. White, ‘The Case of the Nocturnal Amanuenses:
               New Evidence in the <em>Wat Tyler</em> Affair’, <em>Modern Philology</em>, 118/2 (2020), 277–303. The second letter appeared in the <em>New Times</em>, 12 February 1822, unsigned and dated 6 February 1822. It contained a detailed defence
               of Southey and, in particular, the change in his political opinions from early radicalism
               to his own, later, idiosyncratic brand of conservatism.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
