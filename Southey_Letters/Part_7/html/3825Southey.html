            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I was this day preparing to return your papers,

                           (1823–1832). He lived at 23 Upper Wimpole Street.</span></div>
                  </div> when I perceived that your address as given in your letter did not specify the number
                  of your house. And it seems better to retain them till you have the goodness to let
                  me know this, than to dispatch them with an imperfect direction</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>These papers have given me great light; upon some points they have confirmed the opinion
                  which I had previously been led to entertain, – upon others they have imparted information
                  altogether new to me. Unfortunately the chapter in which the first transactions in
                  Andalusia are comprized was printed before I received them. They will render it necessary
                  to alter a few passages, &amp; to add others;

                           War, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), I, pp. 382–386. On pp. 389–390, Southey inserted
                           material concerning Dalrymple’s role in the attempts of Spanish commanders to change
                           the terms of surrender of the French army, but it did not have to appear as ‘Corrections’.</span></div>

                  part of the chapter. What cannot be done in this way, must be inserted as corrections
                  at the end of the volume.</p>
