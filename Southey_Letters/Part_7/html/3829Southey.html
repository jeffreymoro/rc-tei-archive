               <p>I heard lately, upon your authority, a very singular story of the horses belonging
                  to Romanas troops, which were left behind when the men were brought off by the British
                  ships.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Pedro Caro y Sureda, 3rd Marquis of La Romana (1761–1811), a Spanish general. He commanded
                           the Army of the North and ensured its evacuation to Spain in 1808, where he was one
                           of the more successful Spanish commanders. History of the Peninsular War, 3 vols (London,
                           1823–1832), I, pp. 663–664, related that the horses belonging to the Spanish troops
                           were set free on the Danish shore and most of them killed each other in a ‘dreadful
                           work of mutual destruction’.</span></div>
                  </div> Will you oblige me with the facts? I am just coming to the escape of that army, &amp;
                  being richly provided with accounts both Spanish &amp; English from persons concerned
                  in the adventure, shall be very glad to add an anecdote so curious as a fact in natural
                  history.</p>

                  </div> seeing, as he does, that the detestable license of the press, of which both parties
                  avail themselves without scruple, must make the practise more frequent than it already
                  is. It is my opinion that it might easily be put a stop to, if it were seriously regarded
                  as a breach of the laws, &amp; rendered liable to such a punishment as Juries would not
                  shrink from inflicting; – fine, for example, imprisonment &amp; banishment for the parties
                  &amp; seconds, – according to circumstances. If such a law was past, &amp; it were made known
                  at the same that any Officer in army or navy should be dismissed the service, if he
                  engaged in an affair of this kind, I am persuaded that the object would be at once
                  effected. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilberforceWilliam">M<sup>r</sup> Wilberforce</a> sees greater difficulty, tho entirely agreeing in the wish: – but he is thinking about
