        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter was a relief to me, &#8211; for I was afraid illness had been the cause of your silence, &#8211; &amp; it brought news of your amendment. &#8211; These hasty lines accompany a few more stanzas<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was beginning &#8216;Robin Hood&#8217;.

With Other Fragments and Poems By R.S. and C.S.</title> (London, 1847), pp. [1]&#8211;36.</note> &#8211; When next you write, speak of the poem on a slip of paper by itself, &amp; let your letter have no allusion to it. I expect much amusement from keeping the secret, &amp; some advantage from it. What I write generally receives a good deal of amendment before it passes thro the press, &#8211; wherever you can mend a passage, do so. I shall soon finish the canto. &#8211; Do you describe how the <del>infant</del> &lt;boy&gt; like a pet lamb that had lost its mother &#8211; was fondled &amp; spoilt.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline Bowles did not include these lines in &#8216;Robin Hood&#8217;.</note>
