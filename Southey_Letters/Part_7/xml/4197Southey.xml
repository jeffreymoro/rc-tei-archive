        <p rend="indent1">I am much obliged to you for your little volume,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Edwin Atherstone, <title>A Midsummer Day&#8217;s Dream. A Poem</title> (1824), no. 13 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> which not having such locomotive powers as you possessed in your dream, had to wait a month in <ref type="m" target="places.html#PaternosterRow">Paternoster Row</ref>, &amp; then travel patiently in the Waggon.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">There is as much power in the poem as I had expected to find in it, &#8211; &amp; this is saying much. I do not enter upon any task of verbal criticism because highly useful as it is to a youth who is making his first essay, &amp; serving as it were his apprenticeship in the art, &#8211; it must be superfluous to those who know the proper use of language &amp; have obtained a command of it. &#8211; The only remark which seems worth making is that there appears to be some confusion of time in the prelude: p. 26. The sun an hour ago, Went down &#8211; &amp; p. 31. it is again noon.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Edwin Atherstone, <title>A Midsummer Day&#8217;s Dream. A Poem</title> (London, 1824), p. 26, &#8216;The sun an hour ago/ Went down without a cloud;&#8217; compared to p. 31: &#8216;It was the hour of noon&#8217;.</note> You I believe mean first to describe the whole day, &amp; then return to speak of your noon day dream: but this produces an apparent confusion.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">  I can say nothing of your design, because it is in its very nature lawless as well as boundless. A dream it is, &amp; the effect upon the reader is like that of a dream, before the impression is shaken off. But a more durable impression is made by what more resembles reality, &amp; a poet I should think is more likely to be popular by keeping to this low earth, than by taking flight thro the Universe. But I heartily wish you success both in your mundane &amp; extra-mundane flights, &amp; remain with much respect</p>
        <p>
          Dear Sir<lb/>
            Yrs faithfully<lb/>
            Robert Southey.
