        <p rend="indent1">  You will have to indorse this draft for 40 &#163; &#8211; which <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">your Uncle</ref> I dare say will get converted into cash for you.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had sent Edith May Southey a banker&#8217;s draft for &#163;40 made out to her. By endorsing (signing) it, she could transfer it to a third party. Southey suggests she do so by giving the endorsed note to Henry Herbert Southey, so that he could provide her with cash in return.</note> And out of it you will settle your accounts with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fielding,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">There were four Fielding brothers, all fashionable painters of watercolours: Theodore Henry Adolphus Fielding (1781&#8211;1851; <title>DNB</title>); Anthony Vandyke Copley Fielding (1787&#8211;1855; <title>DNB</title>); Thales Fielding (1793&#8211;1837; <title>DNB</title>) and Newton Smith Fielding (1799&#8211;1856; <title>DNB</title>). One of them had been giving lessons to Edith May Southey.</note> &#8211; or he will do it for you. When that is done, say something &lt;civil&gt; on my part, &amp; particularly that I shall be very glad to see him if ever he comes into this country.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is not stated in your letters whether you received 25 &#163; from Bedford[GrosvenorC], which I requested him to send you, about a month ago,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to Charles Grosvenor Bedford, 24 May 1824, Letter 4189.</note> &#8211; &amp; I have not heard from him since. If you have had it, the present supply will set you up well for awhile, &amp; if you have not you may look for it. &#8211; I give you full credit for proper economy in the use of money, &amp; &#8211; you shall not want it while you are away.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As you like the Longmans,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Thomas Longman</ref> and his family.</note> if they invite you again to spend a day or two there when you return to London, I should like you to accept the invitation.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is so late that my dispatches must be made up without farther delay. Make my acknowledgements for the bride cake, &#8211; &amp; with them my best wishes to the young married people.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Gonne (1800&#8211;1877), a merchant and the brother of Henry Herbert Southey&#8217;s wife, Louisa, married Susanna Beale (d. 1843) on 10 June 1824. Southey had been sent a slice of the wedding cake.</note> Love to <ref type="m" target="people.html#GonneMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Gonne</ref>, &#8211; I am glad the bride is M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>
          <hi rend="ital">Ch.</hi> Gonne, &#8211; for I do not think I could like any second M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> G.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">  The M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Egerton whom you are likely to visit tho a schoolfellow, is no acquaintance of mine. His name was Hayter when he was at Westminster<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Francis Thomas Hayter (1771&#8211;1861), of Roche Court, Salisbury. He changed his surname name to Egerton in 1792 as the heir of his great-uncle, Dodington Egerton (d. 1773). He was admitted to Westminster School in 1782, leaving to go up to Corpus Christi, Oxford, in 1789, so he and Southey only overlapped at Westminster for a year.</note> We were in the same boarding house, but probably never spoke to each other, as he was three or four years my senior. I remember him merely as a gentlemanly inoffensive boy, whom nobody disliked, &amp; of whom I never heard any ill.</p>
