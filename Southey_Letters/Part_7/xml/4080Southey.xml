        <p rend="indent1">I once declared in a poem that I never put out the eye of a Cyclops;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s unpublished &#8216;Ode&#8217;, line 15; see Southey to Daniel Stuart, 19 December 1799, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Two</title>, Letter 464. In Greek mythology the Cyclops were a race of one-eyed giants.</note> &amp; I now declare with equal sincerity that I never offered any outrage to the nose of Sir Cloudesly Shovel.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">In the south aisle of Westminster Abbey there is a huge marble monument to Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell (1650&#8211;1707; <title>DNB</title>). Its nose is intact. However, in &#8216;Letter of Elia to Robert Southey, Esquire&#8217;, <title>London Magazine</title>, 8 (October 1823), 406&#8211;407, Lamb had mischievously asked Southey whether he knew anything about the mutilation of the monument, in the nave of Westminster Abbey, of Major John Andr&#233; (1751&#8211;1780; <title>DNB</title>), a British officer hanged as a spy by the American revolutionaries. Lamb alleged that the nose was broken off a figure on the monument at the time that Southey was at Westminster School (1788&#8211;1792).</note>

        <p rend="indent1">You have a good heart, &amp; it stands you in good stead. Would that some of my family had a portion of your courage. But the truth is that your Job&#8217;s comforters<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">From the <title>Book of Job</title>, where Job is afflicted by God, but the comfort provided by his friends only makes him feel worse.</note> are as unwise in entertaining their fears as they are in communicating them.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline Bowles&#8217;s outhouses had been robbed and she was worried about the prospect of prosecuting the offenders at Winchester Assizes.</note> There is danger in acting against smugglers &amp; poachers, because smugglers &amp; poachers think they have natural justice on their side, &amp; have some show of reason for thinking so: they therefore think themselves aggrieved when they are prosecuted for their illicit practises, &amp; feel as if they had a right to revenge themselves upon any one who has taken part against them. But this is not the case with those who have committed a breach of the moral law: they are self-convicted of a known sin, &amp; here in England not even a Bow Street Officer<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Professional police officers based at Bow Street magistrates court since 1753.</note> has ever suffered the slightest injury from after-revenge, &#8211; tho some times very serious ones in the discharge of their duty. &#8211; You may therefore sleep in peace. &#8211; Perhaps it <del>may</del> &lt;would&gt; lessen in some little degree the unpleasantness of your appearance at Winchester, if you had any acquaintance there; &#8211; &amp; I can very well introduce you to <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillCatherine">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Hill&#8217;s</ref> sisters<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Elizabeth Heathcote (1773&#8211;1855) and Alethea Bigg (1777&#8211;1847), two sisters of Catherine Hill, who shared a house at 12 Cathedral Close, Winchester.</note> who reside in that city. But I shall see you before that time; &amp; persuade you, I hope, not only <hi rend="ital">almost</hi>, but wholly, that there are yet hopes &amp; enjoyments in store for you in this world.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">Before this reaches you I shall be far on my journey. I am now in all the disquiet &amp; discomfort of preparing for it. We depart on Monday, &amp; if the weather permit us to see all we purpose seeing on the way, it will be just a week before we arrive at Cole Orton. Direct to me at <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brothers</ref> in <ref type="m" target="places.html#QueenAnneSt">Q Anne Street</ref>, &amp; remember that a letter from you will always be a pleasure to me. Tell me what stages pass thro Lymington by which I can find my way from the West: I shall be coming from Exeter, most likely just after Xmas, &#8211; but of course you shall be acquainted with my movements. My time <hi rend="ital">must</hi> be short, &#8211; &amp; yet I am sure you will believe me when I say that were inclination alone to be consulted I know not how long it might prove. The work which I carry with me in an unfinished state,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> &#8211; or rather which I have to do must be done at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</ref> before my departure <del>xxx</del> for the West, because it will be wanted for the press. And if this were not the case what inclination should I have to spend <del>my</del> &lt;that&gt; time in composition, which is to be past with you? To be put in the call of silence then would be to endure penance indeed.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">This has remained unfinished till the last minute. It is now Sunday night, &#8211; my table sadly disfurnished, every thing packed, &amp; my last dispatches on the wing. God bless you</p>
