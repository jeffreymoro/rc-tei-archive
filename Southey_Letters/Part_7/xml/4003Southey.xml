Southey. Illustrated with Engravings from the Designs of R. W.</title> (1824), nos 2627&#8211;2628 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. These drawings were published by Longman and could be inserted into Southey&#8217;s <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> He may be found either at N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 9 <ref type="m" target="places.html#StaffordRow">Stafford Row</ref> Buckingham Gate, &#8211; or any time after breakfast &#8211; at the Exchequer.</p>

        <p rend="indent1">I will write shortly at more length. Would that I could see the end of the work upon which I am employed.
