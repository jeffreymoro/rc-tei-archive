                           in Upper Canada. Sir Robert Wilmot-Horton (1784–1841; DNB), Under-Secretary of State
                           for War and the Colonies 1821–1828 was eager to extend this idea and produced ‘An
                           Outline of a Plan of Emigration to Upper Canada’ in January 1823. He proposed that
                           parishes all over the United Kingdom should be able to mortgage their poor rates in
                           order to repay loans from the government, which would finance sending the parishes’
                           paupers to Canada. Each family would receive 100 acres of land.</span></div>
                  </div> last summer, with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ClarksonThomas">Clarkson</a>, who had shipt off two or three families to Canada at the parish expence, from his
                  own parish – Playford near Ipswich. The parish were convinced that it was good economy
                  to rid themselves by an immediate outlay of an increasing expence. This is a proof
                  that the plan is practicable &amp; likely to <span class="strikethrough">be an</span> succeed. And in this case the parties went without any promise of land, to seek their
                  own maintenance, where industry is sure to find it.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Is not the proposed grant of 100 acres too large for this class of persons? <span class="strikethrough">In xxx offering that xx too large are become</span> This is boon enough for a farmer, a discretionary power of allotment up to that amount
               might perhaps be vested in the Commissioners, according to the character of the emigrants.</p>

               <p>An outcry will be raised against it as a scheme for <span class="ital">transporting</span> the poor: but it is not likely to do much harm.

                  for age &amp; infirmity more ought to be done than our poor laws ever have provided, –
                  if the <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> country is compelled to feed able bodied paupers, it thereby acquires the right of <span class="strikethrough">xxxxding</span> &lt;transporting&gt; them to any place where that can be done at the easiest rate, or when
                  the necessity for doing it may be removed.
