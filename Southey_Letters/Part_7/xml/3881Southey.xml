          <salute>My dear Sir</salute>

        <p rend="indent1">You would have suffered no disappointment on the present occasion, if your friends had known &#8211; I will not say as much of what is called the World as I do (for they may easily know more) but as much of natural causes &amp; probable effects.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Bernard Barton, <title>Napoleon, and Other Poems</title> (London, 1822), p. [v], was dedicated to George IV. Barton may have been offended not to receive any acknowledgement of his dedication.</note> My advice to you had I been on the spot to have given it, would have been, after writing as you have written, to dedicate as you intended &amp; have done &#8211; to <del>sen</del> present the book tho the regular channel of the Librarian,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Sumner (1790&#8211;1874; <title>DNB</title>) was domestic chaplain and librarian to George IV 1821&#8211;1826, Bishop of Llandaff 1826&#8211;1827, Bishop of Winchester 1827&#8211;1869. Barton wished to place a copy of his book in the Royal Library at Windsor.</note> &amp; then to leave it to its fate, hoping nothing &amp; expecting nothing. Nothing was to be gained by showing any solicitude concerning the event, &#8211; but something might be lost.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">  I am not acquainted with the Librarian, &amp; could be of no use to you in that quarter. &#8211; Your views should be directed to this Literary Academy,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The Royal Society of Literature, founded in 1820.</note> &#8211; of which I know nothing more than what the newspapers tell me, &#8211; but which proposes (if I understand its meaning) to grant honorary annuities, as well as to offer premiums.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">The first opportunity which I shall have of noticing your writings, will be in an account of <del>the Xxxx</del> Gregoires Histoire des Sectes Religieuses, which will be my next article in the QR.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of Henri Gr&#233;goire (1750&#8211;1831), <title>Histoire des Sectes Religieuse, qui, Depuis de Commencement du Siecle Dernier Jusqu&#8217;a l&#8217;Epoque Actuelle, sont N&#233;es, se sont Modifi&#233;es, se sont &#201;teintes dans le Quatre Parties du Monde</title> (1814), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 28 (October 1822), 1&#8211;46, published 15 February 1823. (The book was no. 2838 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.) On pp. 4&#8211;5 of his review, Southey included a lengthy recommendation of Barton&#8217;s poetry for its &#8216;pure and religious spirit&#8217; and quoted Barton&#8217;s poem &#8216;The Pool of Bethesda&#8217;, from <title>Napoleon, and Other Poems</title> (London, 1822), pp. [182]&#8211;185 in its entirety.</note> &#8211; Be assured that I shall not omit any opportunity which I can find</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> When you sent a copy to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>, for himself, &#8211; you did not call to mind the old proverb about sending coals to Newcastle. In all likelihood he looked <del>at</del> upon it as intended for the QR.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">i.e. that Murray supposed Barton wished his poem to be reviewed in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note> &amp; did not suppose that it required an acknowledgement.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">I have been very unwell, but am now thank God recovered. At this season I am more occupied by friends, &amp; chance visitors, than even by my own arduous pursuits during the rest of the year. And the busiest man in England cannot have less time to himself.</p>
        <p>
           farewell &#8211; &amp; believe me<lb/>
           Yours truly<lb/>
          R Southey.
