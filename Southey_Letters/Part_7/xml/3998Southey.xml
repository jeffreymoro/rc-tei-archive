He was considering emigrating to Canada.</note> The Captain<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> carries them both, &amp; gives them such fare as he has for himself, for the very small sum of 15&#163;, &#8211; they take their own cots, &amp; such extra fare, solid &amp; liquid, as they please. So far economy has been well consulted. &#8211; If we can obtain any farther introductions they must be sent after him, to the care of Matthew Bell Esq<hi rend="sup">re</hi> Quebec.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Matthew Bell (1769&#8211;1849), a wealthy merchant, iron manufacturer and land speculator in Quebec, originally from Berwick-upon-Tweed.

He was Secretary and Superintendent of the new Lanark settlement on the Clyde river in Eastern Ontario from its foundation in 1820 until 1830.</note> who has the distribution of lands upon the Clyde at a settlement called Lanark. If we can get one to the naval Captain<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> whom you mention, so much the better, &#8211; but he does not know him. On the whole however, he goes well fortified with letters.</p>

I am sorry to say that <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">E May</ref> is not well, &amp; that I am somewhat uneasy concerning her. She complains of pain in the chest, always produced by walking, &amp; felt not unfrequently when in inaction, &#8211; like a weight which oppresses her.

        <p rend="indent1">I wish to hear how you are going on, &#8211; &amp; how <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">Edward</ref> stands in the challenge.
