							In 1810-1811 he was in London as secretary to the Duke of Albuquerque, the Cortes&#8217;s representative in the United Kingdom.
							At this time, Southey (who had been given an introduction to Abella by Henry Crabb Robinson) wrote to him requesting
							documents that might help with accounts of the Peninsular War Southey was producing for the <title>Edinburgh Annual
								Register</title>. Abella obliged and continued to send Southey material after he returned to Cadiz in 1811. The two
							men became friendly, despite never meeting. Southey offered Abella advice on where his son might attend school in England
							and Abella arranged for Southey to become a Fellow of the Royal Spanish Academy and the Royal Academy of History. After
							the restoration of royal absolutism in 1814 Southey lost contact with Abella.</ref>

							which would otherwise have passed in the destructive daydreams of solitude&#8217;. Allen wrote poetry and, in Oxford in June
							1794, introduced Southey to Coleridge. In 1794&#8211;1795, Allen was possibly a convert to Pantisocracy. In 1796, he enrolled at
							the Westminster Hospital and married a wealthy widow, Catherine, daughter of Nathaniel Forster (1726&#8211;1790; <title level="m">DNB</title>). She died within a year. In 1797, with the encouragement of Anthony Carlisle, he became deputy

            <anchor xml:id="#AttersollAnn"> Daughter of Thomas Holmes (1751&#8211;1827), a wealthy East India merchant, who changed his
							name to Hunter on inheriting the Gobions estate in Hertfordshire in 1802 from his wife&#8217;s grandfather. The same year, Ann
							Holmes eloped, aged sixteen, with Hugh Doherty, an impecunious thirty-year-old Irishman and officer in the Light Dragoons.
							Their marriage soon broke down, and Doherty published his account of events in <title>The Discovery</title> (1807). This
							revealed how, in an attempt to prevent the elopement, Ann had been confined by her parents in a &#8216;madhouse&#8217;, from which he
							had helped her escape. After her separation from her husband, Ann Doherty (as she was then known) published a number of
							novels, including <title>Ronaldsha</title> (1808), <title>The Castles of Wolfnorth and Mont Eagle</title> (1812) and
								<title>The Knight of the Glen</title> (1815). Her personal life remained complex. In 1811 Hugh Doherty successfully
							sued the architect Philip William Wyatt (d. 1835) for &#8216;criminal conversation&#8217; with his wife. Her relationship with Wyatt
							did not last and by 1818 she was referring to herself as Ann Attersoll, probably because she was living with John
							Attersoll (c. 1784&#8211;1822), a wealthy merchant, banker and MP for Wootton Bassett 1812&#8211;1813. At this time she corresponded
							with Southey, sending him a copy of her <title>Peter the Cruel King of Castile and Leon: An Historical Play in Five
								Acts</title> (1818). By 1820 (possibly earlier) she was living in France and had dropped the name of Attersoll and
							adopted that of Madame St Anne Holmes (much to Southey&#8217;s confusion). A French translation of <title>Roderick, the Last of
								the Goths</title>, published in 1821 by Pierre Hippolyte Amillet de Sagrie (1785&#8211;1830), was dedicated to her. She
							remained in France and was later known by the surname de la Pigueliere. </anchor>

							historical material for the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title>, issued by the related publishing firm in which
							Ballantyne, Scott and Ballantyne&#8217;s younger brother John were partners. Southey wrote the historical section of the
								<title>Register</title> between 1810&#8211;1813, though as the <title>Register</title> was issued two years in arrears, this
							covered the period 1808&#8211;1811. Southey was persuaded to invest his first year&#8217;s salary of &#163;209 in the

							lost his investment. As a result, Southey became increasingly hostile to Ballantyne, describing him as shifty and
							incompetent (a &#8216;sad shuffler&#8217;). Although the <title>Register</title>&#8217;s failure owed much to its attempt to compete in an

							badger Southey for public support; after his death Southey, as his literary executor, worked on his biography. Completed
							by Caroline Bowles and Charles Cuthbert Southey, this was published in 1844 as <title>The Life of the Rev. Andrew

							family&#8217;s finances was reflected in their move from Buckland Manor, Bowles&#8217;s birthplace, to the more modest Buckland
							Cottage. In 1818, Bowles, fearing that she would lose her home due to the mismanagement of her guardian, wrote to Southey
							asking his advice about publishing her poetry with the aim of earning much-needed cash. This initiated a correspondence
							that developed into close friendship and literary collaboration, and culminated in marriage on 4 June 1839. Although
							Bowles&#8217;s finances were in the event stabilised by an annuity from a Colonel Bruce, the &#8216;adopted&#8217; son of her father, she
							did pursue a literary career. She contributed to <title>Blackwood&#8217;s Edinburgh Magazine</title>, and published poetry and
							prose, including <title>Ellen Fitzarthur</title> (1820), <title>Solitary Hours</title> (1826), <title>Chapters on

								<title>The Birth&#8211;Day</title> (1836). She also collaborated with Southey on an unfinished poem on &#8216;Robin Hood&#8217;, which
							applied the metre of the oriental romance <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801) to an English subject. Bowles&#8217;s
							relationship with Southey has been the subject of recent debate, though the destruction of part of their correspondence,
							especially for the crucial period leading up to their marriage, makes it impossible to determine. Certainly their marriage
							proved unpalatable to three of Southey&#8217;s surviving children (Bertha, Kate and Cuthbert), and to some of his friends,
							including the Wordsworths. Edith May Southey, her husband John Wood Warter, and other friends, such as Landor, took
							Bowles&#8217;s side. Life at Greta Hall during Southey&#8217;s final years was uncomfortable, with the house divided between the
							warring factions. Southey&#8217;s ill health and memory loss meant that he was largely oblivious to what was going on around
							him. The feud continued after Southey&#8217;s death in 1843 and ensured the collapse of plans for Henry Taylor to produce a
							tombstone life of the Poet Laureate. Bowles returned to Hampshire, where in 1847 she published the fragmentary &#8216;Robin
							Hood&#8217;. She was awarded a pension from the civil list in 1852. On her death in 1854 she left her papers to Edith May and

							his field in the Regency era. Chantrey was the son of a small farmer from Derbyshire and started his career as a portrait
							painter, concentrating on sculpture from 1807 onwards. In 1809 he married a wealthy cousin, Mary Ann Wale (1787&#8211;1875),
							enabling him to move into a house and studio in Pimlico. From 1811&#8211;1812 onwards he was immensely successful and by 1822
							could charge 200 guineas for a bust. Southey greatly admired Chantrey&#8217;s <title>Sleeping Children</title>, which he saw at
							the Royal Academy in 1817, and Chantrey sent Southey a copy of his bust of Wordsworth in 1822. Another connection between
							the two men was Allan Cunningham, who was Chantrey&#8217;s Clerk of Works and had written to Southey for advice on his poetry in
							1819, the two men later becoming friends. Chantrey asked Southey to sit for him as early as 1823 and Southey did so in
							1828, when John Murray, his publisher, commissioned Chantrey to produce a bust of Southey. However, both Chantrey and
							Southey were dissatisfied with the outcome. The bust remained at Chantrey&#8217;s studio, though it was exhibited at the Royal
							Academy in 1837. It was bought by the National Portrait Gallery in 1955.</anchor>

							my morals were of the sternest Stoicism ... that same feeling which made me a poet kept me pure ... Our meeting was

							to come north and live at Greta Hall in 1803. In 1804 he left Keswick for Malta and Italy for the sake of his health,
							returning in 1806, after which he separated from his wife, leaving her and his daughter Sara at Greta Hall and taking his

							was in London, lecturing and writing for the <title>Courier</title>, which duly puffed Southey&#8217;s work. In 1808 he planned,

							he was found under a booksellers counter wrapped in Felix Farley&#8217;s newspaper&#8217;, Joseph was in fact the second child of
							Robert and Sarah Cottle. He was educated at the school run by Richard Henderson (1736/7&#8211;1792) at Hanham, near Bristol. In
							1791 he opened a shop as a printseller, stationer, binder and bookseller in Bristol. Cottle abandoned bookselling in 1798
							but continued publishing. Between 1791 and 1800, he sold, printed or published 114 works, in congeries with Joseph
							Johnson, Benjamin Flower, H. D. Symons and others. In 1800 he began to sell his copyrights to the London firm of Longman.
							A poet and prose writer, his works included: <title>Poems</title> (1795), <title>Malvern Hills</title> (1798; with a
							prefatory poem by Southey), <title>Alfred</title> (1800), <title>The Fall of Cambria</title> (1808), <title>Early
								Recollections, Chiefly Relating to the Late Samuel Taylor Coleridge, During his Long Residence in Bristol</title>
							(1837) and <title>Reminiscences of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey</title> (1847). Cottle and Southey were
							introduced by Robert Lovell in 1794. Although not wealthy, Cottle provided generous financial help to Southey throughout
							the 1790s, even lending him money for his wedding ring. He published <title>Joan of Arc</title> and the majority of
							Southey&#8217;s earliest works, including <title>Poems</title> (1797) and <title>Letters Written During a Short Residence in

							contempt. The two men met less frequently after Southey&#8217;s move to Keswick in 1803, but maintained their correspondence.
							Southey&#8217;s final tour of the West Country in 1836&#8211;1837 included a visit to Cottle in Bristol. After Southey&#8217;s death, Cottle
							was a central figure in the successful campaign to erect a monument to his memory in Bristol cathedral. He recorded his

							and the project was abandoned in 1793. In 1795 Croft was arrested for debt and fled to Hamburg, only returning to England

							Mango Capac, the first Inca, after Southey had failed in his plan to identify Madoc with the Inca ruler. In January 1801
							Davy moved to London, and Southey saw much less of him. Davy worked at the Royal Institution, where he became a Professor
							in 1802. In 1807 he made a series of experiments there, using the Voltaic pile to isolate previously unknown elements
							including potassium and sodium. This work was regarded as a brilliant contribution to Britain&#8217;s scientific reputation;
							Southey, while recognising Davy&#8217;s genius, thought that he became vain and over-assiduous to win the approval of polite
							society. Davy was elected President of the Royal Society in 1820.</anchor>

							Dusautoy&#8217;s career ensued. He took Southey&#8217;s advice and was admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1813. In 1814 he
							entered an ode, in Spenserian stanzas, for a university prize in English poetry. He did not win, but did very well in
							examinations and seemed to have a promising future. However, in 1815 he fell victim to an epidemic sweeping Cambridge.
							Southey blamed himself, noting that without his encouragement Dusautoy would never have been at the university and would
							therefore have not contracted the fatal disease. As a tribute, he proposed publishing a selection of Dusautoy&#8217;s writing.
							However, when he obtained the manuscripts, Southey felt they would not suit public taste: &#8216;To me &#8230; the most obvious faults
							&#8230; are the most unequivocal proofs of genius in the author, as being efforts of a mind conscious of a strength which it had
							not yet learnt to use &#8230; But common readers read only to be amused, and to them these pieces would appear crude and
							extravagant, because they would only see what <hi rend="ital">is</hi>, without any reference to what might have been&#8217;. The

							extremely bad terms with his older half-brother. Hill was educated at Christ Church, Oxford (BA 1772, MA 1774). From
							1782&#8211;1807, he was chaplain to the British factory at Lisbon. Hill took a paternal interest in his nephews, and helped
							finance Southey&#8217;s education. Hill&#8217;s concern about Southey&#8217;s refusal to take the path mapped out for him (a path leading to
							ordination), his relationship with Edith Fricker, and his politics, led him to visit England in 1795. He returned to
							Portugal with Southey in tow. Oblivious to the fact that his nephew had married Edith the day before their departure, Hill
							used every opportunity to introduce Southey to more suitable women. Nevertheless, the time Southey spent with his uncle in
							1795&#8211;1796 greatly strengthened their relationship, which remained close until Hill&#8217;s death in 1828. Hill encouraged his
							nephew&#8217;s interests in Spanish and Portuguese history and literature &#8211; the <title>History of Brazil</title> and the
							unfinished <title>History of Portugal</title> were projects prompted by Hill, who supplied books and manuscripts for them.

							detailed to go to Hill&#8217;s parish of Staunton-on-Wye, Herefordshire and investigate the mismanagement of tithe income. Hill
							returned to this living in November 1807 and was the incumbent there until 1810, when the Duke of Bedford presented him to
							a parish in Streatham, near London. In 1808 Hill had married a woman twenty-five years his junior, Catherine Bigg-Wither,

							Hawkesbury, a future Prime Minister. Lamb was private secretary to Hawkesbury, then Secretary of State for Foreign

							matriculated at Caius College, Cambridge in 1798 but did not take his degree. He married Sophia Pemberton in 1799 and they
							moved to Ambleside in 1800. His works included: contributions to Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#8217;s <title>Poems</title> (1797),
								<title>Blank Verse</title> (1798) (co-authored with Charles Lamb), the controversial roman-&#224;-clef <title level="m">Edmund Oliver</title> (1798), <title>Nugae Canorae</title> (1819), <title>Desultory Thoughts in London</title>
							(1821), <title>Poetical Essays on the Character of Pope</title> (1821), and <title>The Duke d&#8217;Ormond</title> (1822). Lloyd
							met Southey at Burton in August 1797, when he and Charles Lamb unexpectedly turned up on Southey&#8217;s doorstep. Lloyd
							remained with Southey and his family for several months. Southey recognised in him a fellow man of strong emotions, a
							kindred &#8212; yet also unlike &#8212; spirit, and worried that Lloyd&#8217;s &#8216;feelings ... are not so blunt as we could wish them &#8212; or as
							they should be for his own happiness&#8217;. Indeed Lloyd&#8217;s continued presence was increasingly unwelcome and in 1798 his
							tale-telling led to a major quarrel between Southey and Coleridge which was not healed until 1799. After Southey moved to
							Keswick in 1803, he and his family saw Lloyd, who lived at Low Brathay near Ambleside, regularly. Lloyd&#8217;s later life was
							clouded by mental illness. He was briefly confined in the Quaker-run asylum The Retreat, York, and died in a sanatorium
							near Versailles. In his edition of Cowper (1836&#8211;1837), Southey made his final public observations on Lloyd&#8217;s tragic
							history: &#8216;[his] intellectual powers were of a very high order ... when in company with persons who were not informed of
							his condition, no one could descry in him the slightest appearance of a deranged mind.&#8217;</anchor>

            <anchor xml:id="#LovellRobert"> Poet. Born in Bristol, the son of a wealthy Quaker manufacturer (initially of
							cabinets and later of pins), and his first wife Edith Bourne, a Quaker minister. Lovell possibly entered the manufacturing
							business (on his death he was described as a pin manufacturer) but was ill at ease in the commercial world. In 1794 he
							married Mary Fricker. His family disapproved of the match because she was not a Quaker and had worked as an actress. Their
							son, also named Robert, was born in 1795. Lovell died at Bristol on 3 May 1796 of a fever contracted on a trip to
							Salisbury and exacerbated by refusing to take medical advice before returning home. One of his final letters to his wife
							is in the Huntington Library, San Marino, another in Bristol Reference Library. Lovell&#8217;s father was reluctant to provide
							regular financial support for Mary Lovell and her child, and both became part of Southey&#8217;s extended household. Lovell and
							Southey were introduced by Sarah Fricker in Bristol in late 1793. Lovell was also a poet, his <title>Bristol: A
								Satire</title> appeared in 1794, and he and Southey embarked on a period of collaboration: planning two co-authored
							collections, only one of which was published under the pseudonyms &#8216;Bion&#8217; [Southey] and &#8216;Moschus&#8217; [Lovell] in late 1794.
							Lovell was also involved in the 1794 revisions to Southey&#8217;s <title>Joan of Arc</title>. The advent of Coleridge in
							summer&#8211;autumn 1794 seems to have led (at least temporarily) to a reorientation of literary relationships. Lovell was
							pushed to the margins. His contribution to <title level="m">The Fall of Robespierre</title> was dropped and Coleridge was
							openly critical of his poetry. Lovell was, however, involved in Pantisocracy and it was through him that Southey and
							Coleridge were introduced to Joseph Cottle. After Lovell&#8217;s death, Southey tried &#8212; and failed &#8212; to produce a subscription
							edition of his poems, to raise money for his widow and child. However, Lovell&#8217;s writings were included in the
								<title>Annual Anthology</title> (1799 and 1800) and <title>Specimens of the Later English Poets</title> (1807). In a
							notice published in <title>Literary Memoirs of Living Authors of Great Britain</title> (1798), David Rivers described
							Lovell&#8217;s poetry as being &#8216;entitled to considerable distinction&#8217;. Southey described receiving the news of Lovell&#8217;s death as
							&#8216;the most sudden check I ever experienced&#8217;. The full extent of their relationship is difficult to gauge because of the
							survival of only two letters from what must have been an extensive correspondence.</anchor>

							get Robert Lovell Junior into Christ&#8217;s Hospital. They failed. The boy was apprenticed to a London printer and effectively
							separated from his mother, who lived with the Southeys in Keswick. The impact of this on his character seems to have been
							profound. In 1836 his first cousin Sara Coleridge described his lack of social skills: &#8216;From nine years old he has had to
							shift and scramble a good deal for himself, to bear up against a hard world which would have crushed &lt;or injured&gt;

							interest in chivalric romances brought them together. Scott reviewed Southey&#8217;s <title>Amadis of Gaul</title> in the
								<title>Annual Review</title>, and <title>The Chronicle of the Cid</title> and <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> in
							the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, while Southey reviewed Scott&#8217;s <title>Sir Tristram</title> in the
								<title>Annual</title>. Privately envious of the enormous sales Scott achieved with his own chivalric poems, Southey
							was nevertheless a ready correspondent, persuading Scott of Wordsworth&#8217;s claims to greatness. For his part Scott, as his
							fame and influence increased, did not forget Southey: he arranged for Southey to write for the <title>Edinburgh
								Review</title> in 1807, and when Southey declined, disapproving of its anti-war politics and personal attacks on
							authors, helped him to a position reviewing for the new journal set up to counter the <title>Edinburgh</title> &#8211; the
								<title>Quarterly</title>. Scott also sought preferment for Southey via his connections in government: Canning was
							approached to see whether a diplomatic place might be found; Melville was requested to grant the post of Historiographer
							Royal. Southey also sought Scott&#8217;s help as he pursued the sinecure of Steward of the Derwentwater estates (which had
							passed to the Crown). None of these attempts having succeeded, Scott recommended in 1813 that Southey should be offered
							the Laureateship, after refusing it himself. Scott had also been influential behind the scenes in securing Southey the
							invitation from the Ballantynes&#8217; publishing house (in which he was, unbeknownst to Southey, a silent partner) to write the
							historical section of the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title> (1808&#8211;1811). Here Scott was disingenuous: Southey was
							offered a share in the venture and so deferred payments owing to him to take up the offer; Scott, however, did not reveal
							his own financial involvement in the firm even when, as it faced insolvency in 1813, he promised to help Southey retrieve

							(1784). Walter Scott edited her <title>Poetical Works</title> for Ballantyne in 1810; her voluminous correspondence was
							published in 1811. Seward was quick to recognise Southey as a poet to be watched: her 1797 &#8216;Philippic on a Modern Epic&#8217;
							condemned the &#8216;Baneful&#8217; politics of his <title>Joan of Arc</title>, but simultaneously heralded it as the work of
							&#8216;sun-born Genius&#8217;. She continued to follow Southey&#8217;s career with some interest. In 1802 she wrote to the <title>Poetical

							her high opinion, he wrote to her. This initiated a correspondence that lasted until Seward&#8217;s death and that led to their
							one meeting in Lichfield in summer 1808. Late in life, Southey provided a comic account of the &#8216;jubilant but appalling
							solemnity&#8217; of this encounter. However, his attitude to Seward was more ambivalent than this suggests. He was keenly aware

							Southcott to publish her prophecies of a coming millennium in England, in numerous pamphlets &#8211; many of them bought and
							collated by Southey in the course of his work on <title>Letters from England</title>, then the best-researched and most
							detailed account to have been published. Southcott also embarked on a preaching tour and attracted many thousands of
							followers, whom she confirmed as adherents by issuing with seals, bearing her symbol and signature and the believer&#8217;s.
							Many of her followers were women, for Southcott empowered the female, suggesting that she herself fulfilled the
							predictions in <title>Genesis</title> 3, that the woman&#8217;s seed shall bruise the serpent&#8217;s head, and
								<title>Revelation</title> 12, that the woman clothed in the sun will precipitate a millennium. Southey&#8217;s sceptical
							distrust of Southcott and her movement came to a head in 1814, when she announced that she, a virgin of sixty-four, was
							pregnant with Shiloh, the returning saviour. She died, without issue, on 27 December, although William Sharp believed that
							her body might only be in a trance and be resuscitated and the Shiloh discovered. She left behind her a &#8216;great box&#8217;, made
							by Sharp, containing sealed prophecies, to be opened by the bishops of the Church of England.</anchor>

							West Country, and, in 1838, was one of the party on Southey&#8217;s final foreign journey, to France. Southey raised the money
							to send him to Queen&#8217;s College, Oxford (1837&#8211;1841), but Cuthbert did not display the precocious intellectual talent of his
							elder brother, Herbert. Cuthbert entered the Church and pursued a solid, if unspectacular, career, including terms as

							Davies (b. 1841) in 1871. Cuthbert was deeply opposed to Southey&#8217;s marriage to Caroline Bowles and edited one of the rival
							posthumous versions of Southey&#8217;s letters, <title>Life and Correspondence </title> (1849&#8211;1850). Cuthbert was embarrassed by
							many of his father&#8217;s views, including his religious unorthodoxy, enthusiasm for wine and virulent condemnation of some
							public figures. All of these aspects of Southey&#8217;s life were suppressed or explained away in Cuthbert&#8217;s edition.</anchor>

							remained capable of occasional literary work. Walker had become a close friend of Derwent Coleridge&#8217;s during the latter&#8217;s

							(Bengal) and undermining the nawab of Oudh&#8217;s authority there during the years 1801&#8211;1802. This challenge kept Wellesley out
							of political office until 1809. In that year Wellesley was appointed Ambassador to Spain, and he arrived in Seville in
							August 1809 to negotiate with the embattled Supreme Central Junta. Here, he found himself once again in the same theatre
							of military and diplomatic activity as his brother Sir Arthur Wellesley (Duke of Wellington), his main aim being to
							support his brother&#8217;s army in the Peninsula. The Junta&#8217;s unwillingness to organise supplies for the British Army while
							urging a policy of attack led Wellesley (and Southey) to suspect some of the Junta of co-operating with the French.
							Southey was suspicious of Wellesley&#8217;s role in the Cabinet as Foreign Secretary 1809&#8211;1812, because he knew Wellesley
							favoured Catholic Emancipation. Nevertheless, he had some hopes that Wellesley&#8217;s appointment as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland

							preached to his congregation. Winterbotham passed most of his incarceration in Newgate prison and spent his time in
							writing &#8211; he published an account of his trial, sermons and works of divinity and geography. On his release he returned to
							preach in Plymouth, moving to Newmarket in 1808. Winterbotham&#8217;s and Southey&#8217;s lives intersected when Southey visited
							Newgate in January 1795 to see the radical publisher James Ridgway, to whom his brother-in-law, Robert Lovell, had
							delivered a copy of Southey&#8217;s play, <title>Wat Tyler</title>. Southey stated that Ridgway promised to publish the play,
							but he heard no more about the matter. However, when <title>Wat Tyler</title> finally saw the light of day in 1817,
							Winterbotham swore to an entirely different version of events in an affidavit. He claimed that Southey had visited Newgate
							on a number of occasions in late 1795 or early 1796. Furthermore, Winterbotham asserted that on one of these visits
							Southey was accompanied by the radical journalist Daniel Isaac Eaton (c. 1753&#8211;1814; <title>DNB</title>) and that Southey
							gave Winterbotham the manuscript of, and copyright to, <title>Wat Tyler</title>, asking him to publish it as a pamphlet.
							Winterbotham claimed to have no knowledge of how the play had come to be published in 1817 and to still possess the
							manuscript of <title>Wat Tyler</title>. This dispute over the copyright of <title>Wat Tyler</title> meant Southey lost his
							application for an injunction to prevent its publication. Moreover, it opened the floodgates to a series of cheap
							editions, none of which paid Southey a penny. Ironically, the play became Southey&#8217;s bestselling work. Southey was
							convinced that Winterbotham had perjured himself, though he admitted there might be a possibility that Winterbotham had
							confused Southey with Lovell. The circumstances surrounding the publication of <title>Wat Tyler</title> remain something
							of a mystery. Further confusion was added to the picture by the essayist John Foster (1770&#8211;1843; <title>DNB</title>) who
							claimed in a letter to Joseph Cottle that two unknown people in Worcester had copied the play from Winterbotham&#8217;s
							manuscript without his knowledge and provided it to the publishers in 1817.</anchor>
