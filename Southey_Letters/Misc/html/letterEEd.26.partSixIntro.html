            <p><em>Part Six</em> collects together, in one place, for the first time, the surviving letters written
               by Robert Southey between 1819 and 1821. It follows the editorial conventions described
               in About this Edition and presents newly transcribed, fully annotated texts of 546
               letters written by Southey in this three year period; 314 letters are published here
               for the first time and an additional 76 are published here in full for the first time.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The letters brought together in this edition commence on 1 January 1819 with Southey
               the Poet Laureate in forceful mood, condemning as fit only to be ‘bum-fiddled’ his
               latest New Year’s Ode and promising to return to his public quarrel with the politician
               Henry Brougham (Letter 3228). <em>Part Six</em> concludes with two letters that reveal other aspects of Southey’s temperament, career
               and interests: his mid-life turn – or possibly return – to retrospection, and his
               desire to write a biography of George Fox, the controversial founder of the Society
               of Friends (Quakers) (Letters 3772 and 3773). The letters in between – those authored
               from early January 1819 to late December 1821 – cover a uniquely diverse range of
               subjects, including: local, national and international culture, politics, religion
               and society; textual production and exchange; and family life, friendships and feuds.
               They deal also with: alterations to the Lake District landscape by over-zealous clergymen
               and absentee landlords (Letters 3707 and 3411); the early careers of Sara Coleridge
               (Southey’s niece) and other ambitious authors; and the efforts of Lady Isabella King
               and her supporters to improve the lives of distressed gentlewomen (Letter 3333). They
               include Southey's controversial ideas for treating men who acted ‘unlawfully (especially
               in mobs)’ as wild ‘beasts’, ‘if they cannot be taken &amp; pounded with little difficulty
               … no questions [should be] asked if they are put to death upon the spot’ (Letter 3721).
               They provide information on actual and potential modes of transport, such as the new-fangled
               ‘German Horse’, a predecessor of the bicycle, and the rhinoceros (Letters 3260 and
               3754); lottery tickets bought with the aim of winning a ‘castle in Bohemia’ (Letter
               3727), an activity that provides an unexpected link between Southey and Byron; and
               an error in an expensively produced map of Brazil that turned the settlement name
               ‘<em>Silves</em>’ into ‘<em>St Ives</em>’ (Letter 3281). The correspondence also includes accounts of dining on locally caught
               rat, which tasted ‘more like roasted-pig than any thing else’, and Lake District owl,
               best served ‘boiled &amp; smothered with onions’, and of drinking a bottle of tokay that
               had once belonged to Stanislaw II August, the King of Poland (Letters 3289, 3747 and
               3722). It has lots to say too about the antics of the Zombi and other members of the
               exotically named feline population of Southey’s home, Greta Hall (Letter 3662).</p>
            <p class="indent1">The 546 letters published here bear testimony to the tremendous vigour and immense
               labour that underpinned Southey’s correspondence in middle age. In the years 1819–1821,
               a still-growing network of correspondents ensured that he continued to receive a host
               of letters – some welcome, others not. Replying to them was a formidable commitment
               and as Southey himself admitted, ‘letter writing … consumes far too great a portion
               of my time’ (Letter 3516). The surviving letters show his ability both to tailor correspondence
               to its recipient and to extract any information he required from them. In 1819–1821,
               the physician Henry Herbert Southey was sent explicit descriptions of the health of
               the assorted members of Southey’s household and asked to diagnose their ailments (for
               example, Letters 3324 and 3676). In contrast, the London-based Grosvenor Bedford was
               given instructions to pay bills and purchase household goods from shops, and reminded
               to ask for a discount (Letters 3424 and 3587). </p>
            <p class="indent1"><em>Part Six</em> sees the continuation of long-established, personal correspondences with Grosvenor
               Bedford, John Rickman and Charles Wynn, among others. It also confirms that Southey’s
               habit of sending public letters to newspapers did not abate in middle age. In 1819,
               for example, he intervened in the controversy following the ‘Peterloo’ Massacre by
               dispatching letters to two local newspapers, the <em>Cumberland Pacquet</em> (Letter 3370) and the <em>Westmorland Gazette</em> (Letter 3381). Published under the pseudonyms ‘AB’ and ‘VINDEX’ respectively, these
               supported the magistrates’ actions in Manchester and called for curbs on the radical
               press. Indeed, Southey’s belief that he had the right to participate in public life
               and that his opinions were listened to only grew in the late 1810s. He corresponded
               increasingly with influential individuals, including Sir Robert Harry Inglis and William
               Wilberforce, and used his letters to record both his meetings with eminent figures
               and what they had to say to him. ‘You will’, he informed Neville White in 1820, ‘be
               glad to hear that Lord Liverpool … when I met him at Mr. Canning’s’, said that the
               <em>Life of Wesley</em> ‘could not fail of doing a great deal of good’ (Letter 3507). At the time, Liverpool
               was the Prime Minister and Canning was President of the Board of Control.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Political engagement, and the networking and name-dropping that came with it, was
               one aspect of Southey’s life, his role as a leading author another. In 1819–1821,
               Southey continued to correspond with important figures in the literary and publishing
               worlds, including James Hogg, Walter Savage Landor, John Murray, Thomas Longman, Walter
               Scott and William Wordsworth. In addition, these years marked the gradual intensification
               of his exchange of letters with a new generation of ambitious authors who sought his
               advice and his patronage, including Bernard Barton, Caroline Bowles, Ebenezer Elliott
               and Chauncy Hare Townshend. Other correspondents in the period 1819–1821 indicate
               his range of interests and contacts, including Isaac D’Israeli, the Earl of Lonsdale,
               Mary Anne Watts Hughes, George Ticknor, David Laing, Edward Hawke Locker, Percy Shelley,
               William Shield (Master of the King’s Music), Baron de Sorsum (the translator of <em>Roderick</em> into French), and Christopher Wordsworth. In addition, letter fragments and references
               to correspondence that no longer survives are reminders of the inevitable selectiveness
               of any ‘Collected Letters’. <em>Part Six</em> thus contains the remnants, substantial though those are, of an even larger output,
               traces of letters that have been lost in the two centuries since their composition
               and evidence of other relationships that may, or may not, have been of significance
               to Southey as he entered mid-life and mid-career.</p>
            <p class="indent1">By January 1819, the forty-three-year-old Southey had established a name for himself
               as a significant, prolific writer who worked across a number of genres: poetry and
               prose; history and commentary on current affairs; biography and travelogue; translation
               and original composition. He had fathered seven children (four of whom were still
               living), and his wife was heavily pregnant with their eighth (and last) child, Charles
               Cuthbert, born 24 February 1819 (Letters 3250–3253). Since autumn 1803, the Southeys
               had rented Greta Hall, on the outskirts of the Lake District market town of Keswick.
               The property was also home to Edith Southey’s sisters Mary Lovell and Sarah Coleridge,
               to the latter’s daughter, Sara, and to Elizabeth Wilson, the elderly housekeeper.
               Life at Greta Hall had, by 1819, fallen into a fairly regular routine. The warmer
               summer months were the ‘idle season’, punctuated by ‘a series of interruptions’ (Letter
               3333). They saw a stream of friends and tourists beating their way to the house, and
               Southey and his family occasionally leaving it on visits to Lake District neighbours.
               The latter included members of the landed classes, such as the Earl of Lonsdale, who
               supplied Southey with game for his table, and Humphrey Senhouse, whose home at Netherhall
               provided ‘sea bathing’, a ‘beneficial’ ‘Change of air’ and plenty of ‘good books’
               for Southey to devour (Letters 3761 and 3710). As winter set in, the front door bell
               was ‘seldom disturbed’, and Southey retreated to his desk and to the labour demanded
               of a professional writer (Letter 3452). </p>
            <p class="indent1">Southey’s life had its set rhythms and routines, but these were not immune to subtle
               changes in wider society. A notable development in the late 1810s, for example, was
               the increasing number of Cambridge undergraduates entertained at Greta Hall. The young
               men were, Southey noted, following ‘a late fashion’ and visiting the Lakes ‘in flights
               to study during the long vacation’ (Letter 3715). This was itself a sign of the increasing
               seriousness with which ambitious young men were taking the demands of the mathematics-dominated
               Cambridge degree course. Southey’s letters record their visits and the strange appellation
               given to them by the locals – ‘Cathedrals’ – the result of ‘a comical confusion, first
               between Collegian &amp; College, &amp; then between College &amp; Cathedral’. This led to some
               amusing incidents, such as when an undergraduate who ‘lodged at Clarke the Gardners’
               was sent a bill addressed to ‘Mr Clarke’s Cathedral’ (Letter 3715). </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Southey’s letters reveal the relish with which he related anecdotes about his guests.
                  However, the exchange cut both ways and some of his visitors had their say about him,
                  publishing accounts of their meetings. They included Samuel Heinrich Spiker, Librarian
                  to the King of Prussia, whose recollections of his 1816 visit to Greta Hall appeared
                  in an English translation in 1820.

                  </div> Not all such tales were to be relied on. January 1819 saw the publication of ‘Letters
                  from the Lakes’ ‘Translated from the German of Philip Kempferhausen’. The second of
                  these purported to describe a visit to Greta Hall and the Poet Laureate, ‘a man at
                  all times master of himself’, who ‘sees before him a series of duties which high intellect
                  alone can perform’.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> Southey, informed of this by a friend, suspected from the first that the account could
                  not be ‘genuine’ (Letter 3243). His suspicions were later confirmed. The writer was
                  not a German tourist, but the Scot John Wilson, who had derived his information at
                  second hand, constructed a fantasy of intimacy from it and made it available to a
                  wider audience (Letter 3255). This was, moreover, evidence of a public appetite for
                  personality and personal revelation to which Southey himself adopted an increasingly
                  ambivalent attitude.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Although Southey’s established reputation, extensive correspondence and vast library
               brought the world – welcome or not – within the walls of Greta Hall, he continued
               to make the occasional extended visit from home. From August to September 1819 he
               toured Scotland with John Rickman and Thomas Telford, who were travelling as part
               of their work for the government Commissions charged with building the Caledonian
               Canal and new roads and bridges in the Highlands. The trip allowed Southey to buy
               rare books in Edinburgh; to see ‘some of the greatest works which were ever undertaken
               by any Government for the improvement of its dominions’; to be made ‘an honorary member
               of the Literary Society of – Banff’; and to lose a night’s sleep thanks to an initiation
               ceremony conducted in the room above his bedchamber by the ‘Free masons of Nairn’
               (Letter 3350). It also led to some rather nerve-racking encounters with local doctors,
               when an ‘excrescence’ on his scalp ‘became troublesome the day … [he] left Edinburgh,
               &amp; suppurated shortly after’ (Letter 3352). Southey consulted a number of medical men
               in Perth, Aberdeen and Inverness to varying effect, and Telford, who was sharing a
               room with him, was given the unpleasant task of dressing the wound every ‘morning
               &amp; evening’ (Letters 3352 and 3350). Southey’s correspondence reveals that although
               he sometimes made light of his condition, nicknaming the ‘excrescence’ ‘Skiddaw’,
               after the Lake District mountain, at other times, he was ‘perplexed &amp; uneasy’, wishing
               he ‘were either at home, or in London’ (Letter 3346). Significantly, although he kept
               some correspondents informed of ‘Skiddaw’s’ progress, he gave ‘no intimation’ in his
               ‘letters home’ to his wife and family, presumably because he did not want to worry
               them (Letter 3349). </p>
            <p class="indent1">A second major trip of the period was made between April and June 1820, when Southey
               visited his old friends Wynn (at Llangedwin) and Wade Browne (at Ludlow) before heading
               to London and the south of England. He arrived in the capital too late for one appointment
               (dinner at the Royal Academy); nevertheless the plethora of engagements that ensued
               was ‘such indeed as almost to make me dizzy’ (Letter 3478). The frenetic pace was
               captured in a letter to his wife, describing ‘how my time has been past’: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">Friday last I breakfasted with Miss Wordsworth at her brothers, &amp; dined at Marianne’s
               – a large party. Saturday at Harry Inglis’s where I slept. Sunday Mrs Gonnes. Monday

            <p>This exhaustive, and exhausting, list provides invaluable information about the larger
               circles within which Southey was moving and contributes to a more refined sense of
               how Romantic period social networking functioned. Southey’s letters also provide important
               insights into more intimate, enclosed spaces and sets of relationships, including
               the dynamics of the extended family that lived together at Greta Hall, known to some
               as the ‘Aunt hill’. During his 1820 journey from home, Southey – styling himself ‘comical
               Pappa’ – wrote home regularly to his younger daughters, Bertha, Kate and Isabel, providing
               vignettes of people he had met and of his own ‘ell-ell-deeing’, the grand occasion
               during which he ‘was made a Doctor of Laws at Oxford’, and promising to return laden
               with prosaic, but vital, items such as toys, books and jars of pickle (Letters 3499
               and 3483). </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Southey’s visit to Oxford after an absence of ‘six-and-twenty years’ gave him a fund
                  of amusing anecdotes, a certain pride at his honorary degree, and abundant memories
                  of his own youth and of those friends from his university days who were now ‘in their
                  graves’ (Letters 3507). Southey believed in ghosts, ‘that the spirits of the dead
                  have sometimes been permitted &lt;to&gt; appear’ (Letter 3256). By 1819, his own ‘dead’
                  included friends, his parents, several siblings and three of his own children. In
                  the three years covered by <em>Part Six</em> he became increasingly concerned with ageing and prone to speculating about his own
                  potential longevity, or lack of longevity. Comments such as ‘if it please God that
                  I should live &amp; preserve my faculties so long’, ‘if it please God that I live ten
                  years &amp; continue to do well’ and ‘If I live to bring out my own history of Portugal’
                  punctuate his letters (Letters 3305, 3560 and 3745). The need to keep in good health,
                  and the fear that he might not, was not just the concern of a man in his forties.
                  It was also grounded in financial necessity, in the knowledge that ‘the greater part
                  of my yearly expences must still be supplied by the years labour, &amp; is therefore wholly
                  contingent upon the continuance of health, eye sight &amp; the use of my faculties, –
                  either of which may fail me at any moment’ (Letter 3237). With an eye on the future,
                  Southey had taken out a life assurance policy that he hoped would mitigate the impact
                  of his demise on his family.

                  </div> However, for a moment in 1819–1820 the possibility opened up that this might not be
                  necessary and that his financial status might change for the better. The death of
                  John Southey Somerville, a third cousin whom Southey had never met, raised the prospect
                  of Southey inheriting a number of properties in Somerset that had once belonged to
                  his and Somerville’s relative, John Cannon Southey. This hope was short-lived. Somerville
                  died in October 1819, and by late March 1820 Southey had received legal advice that
                  any court case he might bring was hopeless (Letter 3458). Southey, who had already
                  ‘twice been disinherited of an ample property’, when his two wealthy paternal uncles
                  had died and left nothing to him, found himself once again ‘frustrated’ (Letter 3560).
                  This had implications for his career. As Southey admitted, gaining the Somerville
                  properties would have allowed him ‘never more [to] write a single line with a view
                  to profit’ (Letter 3384). Not obtaining them ensured that the Poet Laureate remained
                  tied to his desk.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The detailed investigations into his family history prompted by Somerville’s death,
               and the possibility of a lawsuit and an inheritance had an unexpected result. Southey
               decided to ‘live again in remembrance with the dead’ and in July 1820 began the first
               of a series of long letters setting out his own and his family’s histories. These
               autobiographical writings provide a unique and invaluable record, one whose accuracy
               Southey tried to improve by taking advice from his elderly aunt, Mary Southey, who
               had known many of the individuals and lived through some of the events he described
               (Letter 3526). The autobiographical letters also had another purpose. They looked
               forward as well as back in an attempt to secure a different kind of legacy to himself
               and his heirs. Southey did not usually make copies of his correspondence. These were
               different. With an eye upon their ‘post-obit value’, Southey made a copy of them which
               he kept ‘among … [his] papers’, as a document on which a future biographer could draw
               (Letter 3561). </p>
            <p class="indent1">The movement to personal and familial retrospect found in the autobiographical letters
               is one side of Southey’s vast and complex correspondence. At the same time as he was
               writing detailed accounts of long dead ancestors, he retained a close interest in
               public affairs, and he continued to comment on developments in politics and society
               extensively through his letters and his published writings, particularly in the pages
               of the <em>Quarterly Review</em>. His message did not change from the views he had powerfully expressed in the immediate
               post-war period of 1816–1818: the country was undergoing fundamental changes and was
               threatened by revolutionary outbreaks that would plunge it into chaos and a new dark
               age. However, as his correspondence shows, in 1819–1821 his ever-expanding network
               of local and national contacts drew him into more active support of the State’s institutions.
               When his neighbour, William Calvert, brought him an address to the Prince Regent that
               local Whigs were circulating to protest about the local authorities’ actions over
               the ‘Peterloo’ Massacre, Southey responded by drafting a conservative counter-address,
               attacking the Whigs and demanding censorship of the radical press. The address won
               the support of Lord Lonsdale, the Lake District’s most powerful landowner and government
               supporter, even though it was not proceeded with when other government supporters
               protested it was too extreme in its views (Letters 3361, 3364, 3366, and 3385).</p>
            <p class="indent1">At the national level, Southey’s correspondence charts his continuing interactions
               with political figures such as William Wilberforce and John Wilson Croker. Increasingly,
               as these letters show, Southey felt no inhibitions about bombarding them in private
               with his advice, especially about the need to curb the radical press, as well as addressing
               national politics in his Laureate odes. He also began to meet some of the Church of
               England’s bishops. William Howley, the Bishop of London, for example, visited Southey
               in 1819 after the two men had corresponded over Southey’s attempt to help his friend
               Henry Koster find a chaplain for the expatriate community at Pernambuco, Brazil. Moreover,
               the Anglican hierarchy believed that Southey’s criticism of the founder of Methodism
               in his <em>Life of Wesley</em> had ‘rendered an important service’ and increasingly saw Southey as a useful public
               defender of the Church’s privileged role in national life (Letter 3484). Young men
               on the threshold of a career in the Church were particularly numerous among Southey’s
               summer visitors in the Lakes and he was increasingly identified as an Anglican sage
               for his times. Jeremy Bentham even parodied him as ‘St Southey’ (Letter 3419).</p>
            <p class="indent1">Southey’s relationship with the monarchy also became closer in these years. He had
               only met George IV once – in 1813 – and he had always been careful not to heap unctuous
               praise on the King in his Laureate poems. However, his brother, Henry Herbert Southey,
               was a close friend of Sir William Knighton, the King’s physician and, effectively,
               his private secretary. In 1821 Knighton presented Southey’s <em>A Vision of Judgement</em> to the King, and Southey received glowing reports of the monarch’s views of a highly
               controversial and experimental production (Letter 3661). Southey also developed a
               violent antipathy to ‘the modern Messalina’, George IV’s estranged wife, Caroline
               of Brunswick, and supported the government’s attempt to dissolve the royal couple’s
               marriage in 1820–1821 (Letter 3524). Southey undoubtedly disliked Caroline’s association
               with radicals and Whigs, but his views were also coloured by the lurid gossip Landor
               had fed him about her activities in Italy (Letter 3579). He refused to light his windows
               in Keswick on the night of 15 November 1820 to celebrate the withdrawal of the government’s
               proposals against Caroline, determined if necessary to confront an enraged radical
               crowd, though in the event the night passed off peacefully (Letter 3593). Southey’s
               actions were a sign of his increasing sympathy for the King as a beleaguered object
               of radical hostility and his own willingness to ‘wear the Kings colours’ and publicly
               identify himself with the conservative totems of Crown as well as Church (Letter 3587).
               They thus anticipate many of the works on Church and State he was to write and publish
               in the 1820s.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>As his letters reveal, in 1819–1821 Southey remained as busy and engaged with the
                  literary world as he had ever been. He continued to be involved in disputes with contemporaries
                  whose views he did not share, including Hazlitt, Leigh Hunt, Shelley, Byron and Cobbett.
                  His correspondence sheds new light on these feuds, on the gradations of wickedness
                  he assigned to individual authors (Shelley’s ‘obscure’ poetry made him less ‘flagitious’
                  than Byron, Letter 3611) and on his advocacy of censorship of the press. It makes
                  it possible, for example, to track how Southey discovered that Byron’s <em>Don Juan </em>had been ‘prefaced with a very hostile dedication to me’, a dedication that Murray
                  had suppressed (Letter 3338). Not all younger writers saw Southey in such a negative
                  light. Many, indeed, sought out his guidance and patronage. They included Bernard
                  Barton (whom Southey advised on how to write an appropriate dedication to George IV),
                  Caroline Bowles (to whom he sent advice on publishing), and John Abraham Heraud (whose
                  unpublished writings Southey read). In turn, these younger poets made public their
                  indebtedness to Southey, Heraud, for example, lauding him as a ‘Prolific Mind – spontaneous
                  Muse – bright Star’.

            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Southey himself continued to be a prolific author and, indeed, expressed the hope
               that he would ‘add many volumes’ to the shelves and ‘do good service both to the Church
               and State’ (Letters 3560 and 3507). In 1819–1821 he published a third, and final,
               volume of his <em>History of Brazil</em> (1819), a two-volume<em>Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of Methodism</em> (1820), an introduction to William Westall’s <em>Views of the Lake and of the Vale of Keswick</em> (1820), a second edition of his early Laureate poems <em>Carmen Triumphale</em> and <em>Congratulatory Odes</em> (1821), a prose account of <em>The Expedition of Orsua</em> (1821) and several unsigned articles in the <em>Quarterly Review</em>. He also worked on a three-volume <em>History of the Peninsular War</em> (1823–1832), a two-volume <em>Book of the Church</em> (1824), a two-volume <em>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</em> (1829) and a poem set in seventeenth-century New England, ‘Oliver Newman’. In his
               capacity as Poet Laureate he wrote New Year’s Odes for 1820, 1821 and 1822, Birthday
               Odes for the new King’s official birthday in 1820 and 1821, and a poem in hexameters
               prompted by the death of George III, <em>A Vision of Judgement</em> (1821).</p>
            <p class="indent1">The letters shed important new light on these writings, showing their origins, their
               development and (in some cases) their progress to publication and beyond. They also
               allow for a more refined understanding of Southey’s methods and responses when faced
               with a potentially tricky situation. In 1820 he published a <em>Life of Wesley</em>. This was, as Southey had expected, controversial. It also generated a great deal
               of new correspondence, some of it extremely hostile. Southey found himself, for example,
               defending his portrayal of Moravians in the <em>Life</em> against accusations of bias (Letter 3491). One correspondent gave Southey access
               to some new, potentially inflammatory information about Wesley’s ‘character’ (Letter
               3596). This took the form of a copy of a letter supposedly sent to Wesley by one of
               his female followers, Elizabeth Briggs,</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">… remonstrating with him upon the improper liberties which he had taken with her,
               – it is in a strain of the warmest affection, &amp; the most unbounded reverence; &amp; yet
               at the same time shows that she was a virtuous woman, &amp; was alarmed at his conduct.
               He must then have been about sixty five years of age. (Letter 3603)</blockquote>
            <p>Although the Dean of Worcester, who had sent him the copy of Miss Briggs’s letter,
               attested to its authenticity, Southey needed more proof before he could include it
               in a second edition of the <em>Life</em>. He wrote to Glocester Wilson, the owner of the incriminating document, and discovered
               that Wilson did not possess the original manuscript, but only ‘a copy of it given
               by Mrs Wesley to his mother’ (Letter 3596). Lacking the degree of authentication he
               needed and harbouring a lingering suspicion that the letter was not from Miss Briggs,
               but rather forged by Wesley’s estranged wife, Southey decided against publishing it
               (Letter 3626).</p>
            <p class="indent1">Southey lived at a time when public interest in the lives of individuals was on the
               rise. Although he could – and did – protest about intrusion into his own private life,
               he loved ‘the rich veins of gossip and garrulity’ (Letter 3526). He was, moreover,
               not averse to including personal information about others in his own works – for example,
               in his 1813 biography of Horatio Nelson. However, the Wesley–Briggs incident, recovered
               here for the first time, says much about the principles and methods that governed
               his work as a biographer and the priority he placed upon authenticating his sources
               before committing information to the public sphere. It also provides a tantalising
               link between Southey’s belief in the necessity for press censorship, given the susceptibility
               of the public to believing all they read, and his refusal as a biographer to further
               corrupt the minds of his readers with unverified information. </p>
            <p class="indent1">As well as shedding new light on the practice of someone already recognised as an
               important Romantic period biographer, Southey’s correspondence has much to say about
               areas of his writing life that are much less familiar, or, indeed, not known at all.
               These include a planned edition of the writings of the suicide Elton Hamond that was
               abandoned on the grounds that it would be dangerous to send ‘abroad opinions which
               no antidote can prevent from infecting minds predisposed to … receive the … morbid
               matter’ (Letter 3443). Other potential projects revealed here include a second volume
               of <em>Letters from England</em>, a ‘life of Warren Hastings’, a biography of Oliver Cromwell, a ‘Life of George Fox,
               upon the scale of that of Wesley’, and ‘the Moral &amp; Literary History of England’ (Letters
               3237, 3521, 3675 and 3521). Southey prophesied the latter would become his ‘favourite
               work (Letter 3521). He was wrong because it, like the second volume of <em>Letters from England</em>, and the lives of Hastings, Fox and Cromwell, was never written.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Some of Southey’s unknown or overlooked works of the late 1810s and early 1820s did
                  make it beyond the drawing board. They include a privately commissioned biography
                  of the wealthy wine merchant, philanthropist and educationalist David Pike Watts,
                  composed at the ‘desire’ of his daughter and heiress Mary Watts-Russell ‘for her children,
                  &amp; perhaps for private circulation’ (Letter 3544). (It did not, in fact, appear in
                  print until 1841, when it was privately published.) This was not the first such project
                  Southey had undertaken. In 1813 he had written a defence of Sir George Barlow’s conduct
                  while Governor of Madras. Commissioned by Barlow’s brother, William, this had been
                  published anonymously.

                  </div> Southey’s motivation for taking on the life of David Pike Watts was purely financial:
                  the project was to bring in £400. However, this particular venture into the economy
                  of commission and private publication caused Southey considerable embarrassment when
                  a bill of exchange for the wrong amount (£500 rather than the £400 agreed as payment
                  for the volume) was erroneously presented to Mary Watts-Russell’s bank. The bank refused
                  to pay it, and Southey, whose ‘character’ was thus ‘brought into question’, had to
                  act quickly, asking Andrew Bell to intervene on his behalf and plead his case (Letter
                  3555). It was a warning of the perils of writing to a private commission and of the
                  fragile nature of reputation.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The economics of publishing were, indeed, to the fore in 1819–1821. As his letters
               show, Southey was increasingly conscious of the declining sales of his most financially
               successful poem, <em>Roderick</em>, and of how crucial those had been in sustaining him and his dependants (Letter 3371).
               He even tried to increase the readership for earlier works such as <em>Thalaba the Destroyer</em> by encouraging Longman to try the ‘experiment’ of publishing them in ‘a small cheap
               form’ (Letter 3426). Longman did not take the bait. Southey’s attempt to drum up interest
               in his older works was underpinned by the awareness that he was not getting as good
               a deal for new poetical works as other contemporaries. He compared, for example, the
               £1,500 Longman offered for a ‘long poem which has been long in hand’ with the £3,000
               given by the same publisher to Tom Moore (Letter 3560). Southey’s worries about needing
               to earn as much as possible were exacerbated by an anxious wife, young children and
               ceaseless demands from his extended family, especially his brother Tom, a former naval
               officer who was now an unsuccessful farmer. Tom was ‘a heavy burthen, &amp; a sore grief’,
               and his waistline and brood of ‘absolute Killcrops’ (Southey’s nieces and nephews)
               were expanding at the expense of the Poet Laureate, or so the latter felt (Letters
               3498 and 3319). Southey’s only hope was that Tom and his family would ‘leave the kingdom,
               &amp; remove … to the Cape’ (Letter 3498). They did not oblige him.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The need – actual or perceived – for money underpinned Southey’s formidable work ethic
               and his decision to take on more projects than he could possibly complete (see, for
               example, Letter 3745). It also made him tenacious in his attempts to protect his name
               and to ensure that others did not benefit from it. Such efforts had, of course, extra
               piquancy after the debacle over <em>Wat Tyler</em>, the best-selling play from whose pirated publication in 1817 Southey had earned
               not one penny. In 1820 he went on the offensive against a new book, <em>Authentic Memoirs of Our Late Venerable and Beloved Monarch, George the Third</em>, whose supposed author was one ‘<em>Robert Southy, Esq.</em>’. Advertisements for this urged members of the public to ‘order Southys Life of the
               King to avoid imposition’ (Letter 3434). Southey was enraged. He investigated the
               possibility of legal action and also sent a paragraph about the matter to a local
               newspaper, the <em>Westmorland Gazette</em>, where the following appeared on 12 February 1820:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">Some memoirs of the late King are now publishing in sixpenny numbers, and stated on
               the cover to be written by Robert Southy, Esq., with this farther notice, “observe

               our readers that this is an impudent imposition; in which Mr. Southey’s name is used

               insert this notice as an act of justice to the individual on whose reputation the
               fraud is practiced; and as one means of checking a species of swindling which is now
               become frequent.

            <p>The fraudster’s attempt to cash in played on the idea that, as Poet Laureate, Southey
               might well be expected to write something upon the death of the King. (It also called
               on public awareness of Southey as a biographer, at a point when his <em>Life of Wesley</em> was also being advertised.) George III’s death had, in fact, caused Southey some
               anxiety, because it opened up the prospect of his having to do more to earn the Poet
               Laureate’s salary. His Laureateship was, he noted, ‘not … a sinecure’ (Letter 3582).
               As well as the New Year’s ode he had produced on an annual basis since late 1813,
               Southey feared that ‘Alas the [King’s] birth days will now be kept’, and that he would
               be expected to write something for them (Letter 3448). In practice, this did not happen.
               Southey wrote just two birthday poems for George IV, in 1820 and 1821, and neither
               of these was performed at court. In addition, although George IV’s Coronation on 19
               July 1821 was notable for its extravagant pageantry, it was not commemorated in verse
               by the King’s poet. Southey’s ideas for a Coronation ode went no further than some
               notebook jottings. Instead, as his correspondence reveals, as 1820 and 1821 progressed,
               he increasingly developed plans for a poem that emerged out of the death of George
               III – <em>A Vision of Judgement</em>, published in March 1821. This new work, he claimed, would ‘attract some notice’
               and ‘provoke some abuse’; exactly how much ‘abuse’ Southey was to discover later (Letter
               3582).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Southey’s letters provide important new information about the development and publication
                  of, and the initial response to, one of the most controversial and damaging of his
                  poetical works. They also reveal tantalising connections between the poet of 1821
                  and the poet of the 1790s. <em>A</em> <em>Vision’s</em> use of English hexameters, for example, harked back to some of Southey’s earlier metrical
                  experiments and plans for a poem on ‘The Deluge … for which I formed a plan drawn
                  from the state of the present world, … to have been executed in hexameters as far
                  back as the year 1799’ (Letter 3653). Although Southey claimed that his correspondent
                  would be ‘struck by this coincidence’ between <em>A Vision </em>and the unwritten poem on the Flood, there was one important difference between them.
                  The earlier poem was, as the notes for it in Southey’s <em>Common-Place Book</em> make clear, intended to engage with ‘the present world’ in a coded, rather than an
                  explicit, fashion.

                  </div> As such, it followed the pattern of Southey’s poetry of the 1790s and 1800s. <em>A Vision</em> took the opposite tack, dealing directly with contemporary events and engaging explicitly
                  in contemporary controversies. It was therefore a large-scale and public consolidation
                  of Southey’s mid-career turn to the present. Moreover, it was produced and published
                  at a time when Southey regarded society as imperilled as never before by the productions
                  of the radical press whose suppression he urged. This edition makes it possible for
                  the first time to trace how and why these shifts in Southey’s poetry and opinions
                  happened, and how and why <em>A Vision of Judgement </em> and other writings either came into being or were abandoned for good.</p>
