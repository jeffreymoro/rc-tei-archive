            <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Introduction</span></p>
            <p><em>Part Five</em> collects, in one place for the first time, the surviving letters written by Robert
               Southey between 1816 and 1818. It follows the editorial conventions described in About
               this Edition and contains newly transcribed, fully annotated texts of 537 letters
               drawn from archives in the United Kingdom, Europe and North America. Of these, 341
               are published for the first time, with a further 51 published here in full for the
               first time.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The letters brought together in this edition begin on 2 January 1816 with an account
               of Southey’s latest task as Poet Laureate (the composition of a New Year’s Ode) and
               his progress on a topical new poem, <em>The Poet’s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</em> (Letter 2690). They conclude on New Year’s Eve 1818 with a letter that combines news
               of Southey’s family and friends in the Lake District with a description of his labours
               for the <em>Quarterly Review</em> (Letter 3227). The letters in between contain reflections on a massive variety of
               subjects – literary and non-literary, public and private, local and global. They make
               available a great deal of new information about Southey’s views on literature, politics,
               religion and society; his work as Poet Laureate and engagement in public life and
               public controversy; his relationships with his contemporaries; his domestic life in
               Keswick; his extended family and social networks; his extensive reading; his working
               practices; his prolific output of poetry and prose; and his interactions with publishers
               and negotiation of the literary marketplace. They reveal Southey’s agonised response
               to the death of his son in April 1816: ‘how large a part of my hopes &amp; happiness will
               be laid in the grave with Herbert’ (Letter 2757). They show how the announcement,
               in autumn 1818, of Edith Southey’s eighth, and final, pregnancy only confirmed Southey
               in his conviction that his loss was ‘irreparable’ and the new baby could not replace
               ‘that incomparable boy’ (Letters 3203). They demonstrate how Southey used his influence
               to assist the careers of others, recruiting William Wilberforce’s help in an attempt
               to gain a consulship at Maranhão, Brazil, for Henry Koster (Letter 3168), for example,
               and providing £10 from his own purse and raising money from Samuel Rogers and Earl
               Spencer to fund the impoverished young poet Herbert Knowles’s studies at Cambridge
               University (Letters 2855, 2858, 2866, 2879 and 2887). The letters also touch on other
               matters of interest and concern to Southey, including tea drinking (Letter 3030);
               cats (Letter 3031); the impact of the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora on the world’s
               climate, fauna and flora (Letter 3056); the outbreak of typhus in the town of Keswick
               (Letter 3115); the discovery, by one of the Southey daughters, of an ancient bronze
               spear head on the slopes of Skiddaw (Letter 3117); the offer of the post of Librarian
               at the Society of Advocates, which Southey refused (Letter 3148); the chaotic relationship
               between William Wilberforce and his servants (Letter 3204); and the increasing rarity
               of bitterns in the Lake District, a scarcity not helped by the actions of a visiting
               Cambridge undergraduate, who shot, killed and ate one (Letter 3033).</p>
            <p class="indent1">The 537 letters published here are proof that Southey remained a vigorous and indefatigable
               correspondent in mid life, even though the demands on his time were increasing apace.
               <em>Part Five</em> sees the continuation of established correspondences with friends and colleagues,
               including Mary Barker, Grosvenor Bedford, Andrew Bell, Joseph Cottle, John Wilson
               Croker, James Montgomery, John Murray, John Rickman, William Wilberforce, William
               Wordsworth and Charles Wynn. It provides compelling evidence of how the number and
               range of networks in which Southey was involved continued to expand in tandem with
               his personal and professional commitments. In 1817, for example, he wrote to the Prime
               Minister, Lord Liverpool (Letter 2947). Other new correspondents in this period include
               the ambitious young writers Caroline Bowles, Herbert Knowles and Chauncey Hare Townshend;
               the churchman John Jebb; the antiquarian Dawson Turner; the American inventor Horatio
               Gates Spafford; and, last but not least, Samuel Rogers and Helen Maria Williams, both
               established figures in the literary world. Moreover, although 537 letters by Southey
               survive from this period, letter fragments and references within surviving letters
               to ones that are now lost are reminders of the selective nature of any edition such
               as this and of the contingencies of literary history. What we have here are the remains
               of a much larger output. Southey’s letters to Coleridge, Peter Elmsley, Charles Lamb,
               Sharon Turner and William Wordsworth exist only in part, while other correspondences
               have been lost entirely and can now only be glimpsed in letters sent to others.</p>
            <p class="indent1">In January 1816 Southey was forty-one years old and an established, though controversial,
               writer. He had been married since 1795 and fathered seven children, five of whom were
               still living – Edith May, Herbert, Bertha, Kate and Isabel. He had been resident at
               Greta Hall, on the outskirts of the market town of Keswick, since autumn 1803, though
               he had made occasional forays from home, touring the continent, for example, in autumn
               1815. This pattern of Lake District residence punctuated by periods of travel was
               to continue throughout the later 1810s. His longest and most ambitious tour of the
               period took place in May–August 1817, when Southey journeyed through France, Switzerland,
               Italy, Germany and the Low Countries, accompanied by his friends, the artist Edward
               Nash and the landowner Humphrey Senhouse. Southey’s life was not, however, as ‘regular’
               and ‘monotonous’ an existence as this might suggest (Letter 3088). His 1817 continental
               tour, though a private undertaking, generated public controversy over what Southey
               had seen – or not seen – written in the visitors’ book at Montanvert, and the resulting
               row over the so-called ‘Atheist’ inscription inflamed his already antagonistic relationship
               with Percy Shelley (Letter 3004). Moreover, family tragedy and economic changes were
               to make Southey’s residence at Greta Hall less than secure. The death of his nine-year-old
               son in April 1816 made Southey long to escape from a house and landscape haunted by
               the child’s presence: the ‘wound will never close while I remain’ in ‘this country’
               (Letter 2757). Although he eventually decided to stay put, the bankruptcy of his landlord
               in 1817 and uncertainty over the future ownership of the property threatened Southey’s
               continued tenancy of his home (Letter 2961). </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In 1816–1818 Southey was concerned – as he had been earlier in his career – with the
                  local, national and international. His travels, documented in long letters to family
                  and friends and in a journal, opened up new places, led to meetings with, amongst
                  others, the writer and expert on Latin America Alexander Humboldt, and the educational
                  reformer Johann Pestalozzi, and supplied fresh gossip about Princess Caroline, estranged
                  wife of the Prince Regent, whose ‘infamous’ conduct bore comparison ‘in history with
                  Messalina and Joan of Naples’ (Letter 3003). Foreign journeys also allowed Southey
                  to indulge his book-buying habit and to enrich further the shelves of his substantial
                  library. His letters anxiously track the progress of the volumes purchased on his
                  1817 tour and reveal that Southey enlisted the help of the London banker Nathan Meyer
                  Rothschild to ensure they were safely conveyed back to Britain (Letter 3003). Moreover,
                  even when he was at home in Keswick and hard at work, Southey was not cut off from
                  the wider world. His voracious and wide reading in multiple languages, and his writing
                  on a huge range of topics (from the history of Brazil to poems for his children) brought
                  the world within the walls of his study. In the hours not spent at his desk, he socialised
                  with prominent Keswick families, such as the Speddings of Mirehouse, and with local
                  magnates such as the Earl of Lonsdale. In addition, Southey’s professional reputation
                  brought an increasing stream of visitors, national and international, welcome and
                  unwelcome, to his door. Between 1816 and 1818 these included the publishers John Murray
                  and William Blackwood, who arrived together in Murray’s carriage. Southey could not
                  afford such a vehicle and he commented waspishly on this as yet another indication
                  of ‘Maximus Murray’s’ increasingly grand manner (Letter 3187). It also, of course,
                  said much about the publisher’s financial standing and professional success. Overseas
                  visitors included Samuel Heinrich Spiker, Librarian to the King of Prussia. Spiker,
                  in his account of the meeting, marvelled at Southey’s library of ‘between 3 and 4000
                  volumes of the most select works in the Spanish and Portuguese languages, in the departments
                  of history, statistics, and voyages, and travels’ and described ‘the pleasant evening
                  I passed in Mr. Southey’s family, as one of the most happy sections’ of his tour of
                  the United Kingdom.

                  </div> Other welcome guests included, in 1817, the factory owner and social reformer Robert
                  Owen, ‘a very interesting personage … full of plans for the poor’, and the Harvard
                  professor Edward Everett, the ‘most interesting person whom we have as yet seen this
                  summer’ (Letters 2859, 2908, 3191). Southey’s letters do more than just describe these
                  occasions and individuals. Many of the links he forged with his visitors had been
                  initiated, and were to be sustained in the future, via letter writing. His letters
                  are thus evidence of the central role played by correspondence in Romantic period
                  social networking.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Southey often expressed relief when the ‘succession of company’ was over, when he
               could settle, as he explained in November 1817: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">… to my winters work, with the probability of as few interruptions from without, as
               Bruin has when he rolls himself up in his cave, &amp; trusts to his paws till the spring.
               (Letter 3034)</blockquote>
            <p>As his letters reveal, Southey was as busy as ever in 1816–1818. His literary output
               continued to be prolific and diverse, covering domestic and international subjects,
               current affairs and the recent and the distant past. He contributed regularly to the
               <em>Quarterly Review</em> and laboured on the <em>History of Brazil</em>, the second volume of which appeared in 1817. He produced an edition of Malory’s
               <em>Morte d’ Arthur</em>, entitled <em>The Byrth, Lyf, and Actes of Kyng Arthur</em> (1817), and brought out fresh editions of his long poems <em>The Curse of Kehama</em> and <em>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</em>. He continued to compose new poems, including the annual odes required of him as
               Poet Laureate and topical longer pieces such as <em>The Poet’s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</em> and <em>The Lay of the Laureate</em>, both published in 1816. Southey also accepted occasional commissions to write poems,
               including, in 1818, an epitaph for Ralph Broome, the nephew of his old friend James
               Burney and the novelist Fanny Burney (Letter 3070). He refused, however, numerous
               uninvited solicitations for verses. These included one of 1817 from an individual
               identified only as ‘N.T.P.’, who had importuned Southey to</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">… compose an acrostic for the writer to express his passion for Rebecca, a rival having
               lately got a head of him in consequence of having addressed some verses to the object
               of their affections … (Letter 3016)</blockquote>
            <p>‘N.T.P.’s request was accompanied by 20 shillings, which Southey gave to charity.
               </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>A high profile figure since the mid 1790s, Southey retained his appetite for controversy
                  and, in his writings, engaged with acutely topical and contentious issues, including
                  the need for effective censorship of the radical press, which attracted the opprobrium
                  and ridicule of contemporaries such as Leigh Hunt and William Hazlitt. His letters
                  reflect and provide new information about the disputes in which he was embroiled.
                  They make it possible, for example, to track in detail Southey’s reaction to the <em>Wat Tyler</em> furore, including his attempt to seek restitution by recourse to the law. They also
                  refine current understanding of Southey’s reaction to being confronted, publicly,
                  with the ghost of his radical youth. It has long been assumed that in spring 1817
                  Southey responded to the <em>Wat Tyler</em> affair by publishing a letter in the <em>Courier</em> on 17 March 1817.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>This belief almost certainly arose because of Cuthbert Southey’s handling of the letter
                           to the Editor of the Courier, which he misdated 17 March 1817 (see Letter 2946 of
                           our edition). Cuthbert published this in the main run of letters dealing with the
                           furore over Wat Tyler and while he did not explicitly indicate the letter had appeared
                           in the Courier, he did not say it had not. See Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey,
                           6 vols (London, 1849–1850), IV, pp. 252–255.</span></div>
                  </div> He did in fact write two letters for the newspaper: one addressed to William Smith,
                  the radical MP who had used parliamentary privilege to attack Southey in a speech
                  delivered in the House of Commons on 14 March 1817 (Letter 2943), and a second letter
                  addressed to the <em>Courier’s</em> editor (Letter 2946). They were sent by Southey to Charles Wynn, on 17 and 19 March
                  respectively, with instructions to forward them to the <em>Courier</em> (Letters 2944 and 2948). However, as revealed here for the first time, Wynn was away
                  and did not receive the letters and Southey’s instructions until his return. By then
                  public interest had moved on and the moment for publishing either or both in a newspaper
                  had passed. Neither letter appeared in the <em>Courier</em>. Instead, Southey reworked both into his pamphlet <em>A Letter to William Smith</em>, which appeared at the end of April 1817. New light, too, is cast here on the controversial
                  memorandum sent by Southey to Lord Liverpool (dated 19 March 1817), which advocated
                  the suppression of the radical press. It has hitherto never been published in full
                  and we restore here a final paragraph omitted in the previously published version
                  (Letter 2947). This reveals that Southey urged the Prime Minister both to censor the
                  press, and to implement Robert Owen’s plans to tackle unemployment. It thus complicates
                  understanding of Southey’s mid-life politics, suggesting that he was far from being
                  a straightforward reactionary, however much he proclaimed his detestation of radicals
                  and Whigs. By shedding fresh light on these and other controversies, the letters we
                  publish here demonstrate that although the years 1816–1818 were important ones in
                  Southey’s career and impacted on his longer-term reputation, they are yet to be fully
                  documented or completely understood.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">While writing to the moment – be it to the Prime Minister, to newspapers or in the
               pages of the <em>Quarterly Review</em> – remained important to Southey, he also had an eye ever on posterity. In an unpublished
               draft of <em>A Letter to William Smith</em>, he described himself in the third person and predicted how generations to come would
               perceive him as one who ‘in an age of personality … abstained from satire’ (Letter
               2966). Many of his contemporaries would have disagreed. Yet confidence in his posthumous
               fame led Southey to plan for the future. In 1816–1818 he continued work on earlier
               uncompleted writings such as a sequence of inscriptions on the Peninsular War, and
               the longer poems <em>A Tale of Paraguay</em>, and ‘Oliver Newman’. He also laid the foundations for a series of major projects
               that he believed would underpin his reputation. These included a biography of John
               Wesley, which emerged out of an 1817 essay for the short-lived conservative journal
               the <em>Correspondent</em>; a full-scale <em>History of the Peninsular War</em>, for which Southey both sought out and was offered the papers of a series of eminent
               participants; and a project, inspired by Boethius, that mixed verse and ‘prose … in
               colloquy between Sir T More &amp; Meipsum’, and which eventually became <em>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</em> (1829) (Letter 3042). The quest for fame sometimes took a wrong turn. Other projects
               planned in this period – notably a ‘desultory poem in blank verse’ occasioned by the
               death of his son – were never finished (Letter 2969). The letters published here provide
               fresh evidence on how these and other writings did or did not come about and the reasons
               for this.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Key to Southey’s career in 1816–1818 was the importance that he placed upon his role
               as a writer and on the capacity of his poetry and prose to influence public life for
               the better, as he thought, both in the present and the future. This belief had been
               given fresh impetus by his appointment in 1813 as Poet Laureate and his determination
               to revitalise the post. The Laureateship had precipitated Southey’s return not just
               to poetry but to verses that engaged explicitly (rather than, as previously, in a
               coded fashion) with current affairs. This impacted on obviously topical pieces such
               as <em>The Poet’s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</em> and <em>The Lay of the Laureate</em> (written to celebrate the marriage of the Princess Charlotte). It also inflected
               his other writings. As he explained, the ‘main object’ of his Boethian-inspired, poetry-prose
               hybrid was ‘to show that we are rapidly approaching a <span class="ital">crisis</span> in society’ (Letter 3042). His prose, too, was galvanised and shaped by a similar
               preoccupation. He was, he explained, in writing on issues of current public concern
               for the <em>Quarterly Review</em>, ‘giving my whole time and thought to these great subjects’ in order to ‘take the
               lead in preparing &amp; informing the public’ (Letter 3066).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>However, Southey did not have things his own way and contemporaries did not always
                  agree with the information he wished to put before them. His ambitions for the Poet
                  Laureateship were consistently thwarted by attacks from all sides and by the compromises
                  forced on him. These included being obliged to continue producing annual odes, though
                  he had taken the post in the belief that this custom had been abolished. His hatred
                  of the task and growing overall discontent with the Poet Laureateship was encapsulated
                  in the description of his New Year’s Ode for January 1819, on the death of Queen Charlotte,
                  as ‘fitter to be bum-fiddled’ (Letter 3221). Such relative powerlessness was also
                  reflected in the titles given to Southey’s published works. In 1815–1816 he wanted
                  to use ‘Belle-Alliance’, ‘anything but Waterloo’, in the title of his new, battlefield-visit
                  poem in an attempt to expose the self-serving actions of the Duke of Wellington, who
                  had given ‘the name of Waterloo … to the battle … in a spirit of the lowest &amp; vilest
                  jealousy’.

                  </div> Politically well-connected friends and acquaintances cautioned against this, concerned
                  that using the Prussian name for the battle would offend Wellington and lead to trouble.
                  Southey eventually, not without considerable protest, caved in and the volume duly
                  appeared in 1816 as <em>The Poet’s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</em>.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Southey made a great deal of noise in his correspondence about wishing to publicly
               expose and humiliate individuals, such as William Smith, Henry Brougham, Leigh Hunt,
               Francis Jeffrey and the Duke of Wellington, whom he detested. Yet, in practice, his
               polemics were often moderated. William Gifford, for example, censored many of Southey’s
               contributions to the <em>Quarterly Review</em>, a practice Southey loathed, railed against and was powerless to do anything about.
               Friends, whose advice Southey often asked, accepted and acted on, also impacted on
               his writing, though Southey tended to take their interventions with a grace not reserved
               for Gifford and his ilk. ‘I would’, he informed one of his oldest friends, Charles
               Wynn</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">… take reproof from you as a dog does blows from his master; – which same dog if he
               were struck by a stranger would make his teeth meet in the calf of his leg. (Letter
               2976)</blockquote>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It was friends who, in 1817, urged him to remove any reference to duelling from <em>A Letter to William Smith</em>, on the grounds that Smith might be provoked to challenge the Poet Laureate (e.g.
                  Letter 2976). Southey acted on their advice. The following year he began work on a
                  public letter, a ‘Tender epistle’, prompted by Henry Brougham’s attack from the hustings
                  on both himself and Wordsworth. Southey’s plan was to chastise publicly ‘a man who
                  has … slandered me in the face of my neighbours’ and to expose him ‘as he deserves
                  to be exposed’ (Letter 3167). Friends again dissuaded him. The ‘epistle’ was abandoned
                  and remained unpublished until 1821 when sections – with Brougham’s name removed –
                  appeared in the second edition of the Laureate ode <em>Carmen Triumphale</em>.

                  </div> Southey’s letters thus reveal a significant difference between what he proclaimed
                  he would do and what he actually ended up publishing. In so doing, they show how even
                  the most combative of writers had to negotiate the transition of their writings into
                  a hostile, potentially fatal, public sphere.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The letters we publish here make available important new information about Southey’s
               writing life and his intersections with contemporaries drawn from many different walks
               of life, including literature, politics and religion. They show his career in progress,
               reveal that it was more complex than has previously been thought, and provide compelling
               evidence about how his works were shaped and reshaped by external pressures that he
               could not always control or defeat. They thus refine our understanding both of Southey
               and of the ways in which individual writers came to terms with the complex and contentious
               culture of the late 1810s.</p>
