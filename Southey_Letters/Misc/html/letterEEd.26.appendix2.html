            </header>
            <p>We here reproduce for the first time Southey’s light-hearted – but unsent – 1818 response
               to an anticipated challenge to a duel from Henry Brougham. Southey suggests that such
               a challenge would be provoked by the appearance of his own ‘Tender Epistle’, which
               had been written in reaction to Brougham’s reported criticism of Southey during the
               Westmorland election of 1818. In fact, the ‘Tender Epistle’ was not completed and
               only part of it was ever published as an Appendix (without mentioning Brougham’s name)
               to the second edition of Southey’s <em>Carmen Triumphale</em> (London, 1821), pp. 45–53.</p><br><div class="letter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1">
