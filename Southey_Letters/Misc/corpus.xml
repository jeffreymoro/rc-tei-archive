               </p>
               <p>
                  <title>Part Six</title> collects together, in one place, for the first time, the surviving letters written by
					Robert Southey between 1819 and 1821. It follows the editorial conventions described in About this Edition and
					presents newly transcribed, fully annotated texts of 546 letters written by Southey in this three year period; 314
					letters are published here for the first time and an additional 76 are published here in full for the first time. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">The letters brought together in this edition commence on 1 January 1819 with Southey the Poet
					Laureate in forceful mood, condemning as fit only to be ‘bum-fiddled’ his latest New Year’s Ode and promising to
					return to his public quarrel with the politician Henry Brougham (Letter 3228). <title>Part Six</title> concludes
					with two letters that reveal other aspects of Southey’s temperament, career and interests: his mid-life turn – or
					possibly return – to retrospection, and his desire to write a biography of George Fox, the controversial founder of
					the Society of Friends (Quakers) (Letters 3772 and 3773). The letters in between – those authored from early
					January 1819 to late December 1821 – cover a uniquely diverse range of subjects, including: local, national and
					international culture, politics, religion and society; textual production and exchange; and family life,
					friendships and feuds. They deal also with: alterations to the Lake District landscape by over-zealous clergymen
					and absentee landlords (Letters 3707 and 3411); the early careers of Sara Coleridge (Southey’s niece) and other
					ambitious authors; and the efforts of Lady Isabella King and her supporters to improve the lives of distressed
					gentlewomen (Letter 3333). They include Southey's controversial ideas for treating men who acted ‘unlawfully
					(especially in mobs)’ as wild ‘beasts’, ‘if they cannot be taken &amp; pounded with little difficulty … no
					questions [should be] asked if they are put to death upon the spot’ (Letter 3721). They provide information on
					actual and potential modes of transport, such as the new-fangled ‘German Horse’, a predecessor of the bicycle, and
					the rhinoceros (Letters 3260 and 3754); lottery tickets bought with the aim of winning a ‘castle in Bohemia’
					(Letter 3727), an activity that provides an unexpected link between Southey and Byron; and an error in an
					expensively produced map of Brazil that turned the settlement name ‘<title>Silves</title>’ into ‘<title>St
						Ives</title>’ (Letter 3281). The correspondence also includes accounts of dining on locally caught rat, which
					tasted ‘more like roasted-pig than any thing else’, and Lake District owl, best served ‘boiled &amp; smothered with
					onions’, and of drinking a bottle of tokay that had once belonged to Stanislaw II August, the King of Poland
					(Letters 3289, 3747 and 3722). It has lots to say too about the antics of the Zombi and other members of the
					exotically named feline population of Southey’s home, Greta Hall (Letter 3662). </p>
               <p rend="indent1">The 546 letters published here bear testimony to the tremendous vigour and immense labour that
					underpinned Southey’s correspondence in middle age. In the years 1819–1821, a still-growing network of
					correspondents ensured that he continued to receive a host of letters – some welcome, others not. Replying to them
					was a formidable commitment and as Southey himself admitted, ‘letter writing … consumes far too great a portion of
					my time’ (Letter 3516). The surviving letters show his ability both to tailor correspondence to its recipient and
					to extract any information he required from them. In 1819–1821, the physician Henry Herbert Southey was sent
					explicit descriptions of the health of the assorted members of Southey’s household and asked to diagnose their
					ailments (for example, Letters 3324 and 3676). In contrast, the London-based Grosvenor Bedford was given
					instructions to pay bills and purchase household goods from shops, and reminded to ask for a discount (Letters 3424
					and 3587). </p>
               <p rend="indent1">
                  <title>Part Six</title> sees the continuation of long-established, personal correspondences with
					Grosvenor Bedford, John Rickman and Charles Wynn, among others. It also confirms that Southey’s habit of sending
					public letters to newspapers did not abate in middle age. In 1819, for example, he intervened in the controversy
					following the ‘Peterloo’ Massacre by dispatching letters to two local newspapers, the <title>Cumberland
						Pacquet</title> (Letter 3370) and the <title>Westmorland Gazette</title> (Letter 3381). Published under the
					pseudonyms ‘AB’ and ‘VINDEX’ respectively, these supported the magistrates’ actions in Manchester and called for
					curbs on the radical press. Indeed, Southey’s belief that he had the right to participate in public life and that
					his opinions were listened to only grew in the late 1810s. He corresponded increasingly with influential
					individuals, including Sir Robert Harry Inglis and William Wilberforce, and used his letters to record both his
					meetings with eminent figures and what they had to say to him. ‘You will’, he informed Neville White in 1820, ‘be
					glad to hear that Lord Liverpool … when I met him at Mr. Canning’s’, said that the <title>Life of Wesley</title>
					‘could not fail of doing a great deal of good’ (Letter 3507). At the time, Liverpool was the Prime Minister and
					Canning was President of the Board of Control. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">Political engagement, and the networking and name-dropping that came with it, was one aspect of
					Southey’s life, his role as a leading author another. In 1819–1821, Southey continued to correspond with important
					figures in the literary and publishing worlds, including James Hogg, Walter Savage Landor, John Murray, Thomas
					Longman, Walter Scott and William Wordsworth. In addition, these years marked the gradual intensification of his
					exchange of letters with a new generation of ambitious authors who sought his advice and his patronage, including
					Bernard Barton, Caroline Bowles, Ebenezer Elliott and Chauncy Hare Townshend. Other correspondents in the period
					1819–1821 indicate his range of interests and contacts, including Isaac D’Israeli, the Earl of Lonsdale, Mary Anne
					Watts Hughes, George Ticknor, David Laing, Edward Hawke Locker, Percy Shelley, William Shield (Master of the King’s
					Music), Baron de Sorsum (the translator of <title>Roderick</title> into French), and Christopher Wordsworth. In
					addition, letter fragments and references to correspondence that no longer survives are reminders of the inevitable
					selectiveness of any ‘Collected Letters’. <title>Part Six</title> thus contains the remnants, substantial though
					those are, of an even larger output, traces of letters that have been lost in the two centuries since their
					composition and evidence of other relationships that may, or may not, have been of significance to Southey as he
					entered mid-life and mid-career. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">By January 1819, the forty-three-year-old Southey had established a name for himself as a
					significant, prolific writer who worked across a number of genres: poetry and prose; history and commentary on
					current affairs; biography and travelogue; translation and original composition. He had fathered seven children
					(four of whom were still living), and his wife was heavily pregnant with their eighth (and last) child, Charles
					Cuthbert, born 24 February 1819 (Letters 3250–3253). Since autumn 1803, the Southeys had rented Greta Hall, on the
					outskirts of the Lake District market town of Keswick. The property was also home to Edith Southey’s sisters Mary
					Lovell and Sarah Coleridge, to the latter’s daughter, Sara, and to Elizabeth Wilson, the elderly housekeeper. Life
					at Greta Hall had, by 1819, fallen into a fairly regular routine. The warmer summer months were the ‘idle season’,
					punctuated by ‘a series of interruptions’ (Letter 3333). They saw a stream of friends and tourists beating their
					way to the house, and Southey and his family occasionally leaving it on visits to Lake District neighbours. The
					latter included members of the landed classes, such as the Earl of Lonsdale, who supplied Southey with game for his
					table, and Humphrey Senhouse, whose home at Netherhall provided ‘sea bathing’, a ‘beneficial’ ‘Change of air’ and
					plenty of ‘good books’ for Southey to devour (Letters 3761 and 3710). As winter set in, the front door bell was
					‘seldom disturbed’, and Southey retreated to his desk and to the labour demanded of a professional writer (Letter
					3452). </p>
               <p rend="indent1">Southey’s life had its set rhythms and routines, but these were not immune to subtle changes in
					wider society. A notable development in the late 1810s, for example, was the increasing number of Cambridge
					undergraduates entertained at Greta Hall. The young men were, Southey noted, following ‘a late fashion’ and
					visiting the Lakes ‘in flights to study during the long vacation’ (Letter 3715). This was itself a sign of the
					increasing seriousness with which ambitious young men were taking the demands of the mathematics-dominated
					Cambridge degree course. Southey’s letters record their visits and the strange appellation given to them by the
					locals – ‘Cathedrals’ – the result of ‘a comical confusion, first between Collegian &amp; College, &amp; then
					between College &amp; Cathedral’. This led to some amusing incidents, such as when an undergraduate who ‘lodged at
					Clarke the Gardners’ was sent a bill addressed to ‘Mr Clarke’s Cathedral’ (Letter 3715). </p>
               <p rend="indent1">Southey’s letters reveal the relish with which he related anecdotes about his guests. However, the
					exchange cut both ways and some of his visitors had their say about him, publishing accounts of their meetings.
					They included Samuel Heinrich Spiker, Librarian to the King of Prussia, whose recollections of his 1816 visit to
					Greta Hall appeared in an English translation in 1820.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Samuel Heinrich
						Spiker, <title>Travels through England, Wales, &amp; Scotland, in the Year 1816</title>, 2 vols (London, 1820), I,
						pp. 269–272.</note> Not all such tales were to be relied on. January 1819 saw the publication of ‘Letters from the
					Lakes’ ‘Translated from the German of Philip Kempferhausen’. The second of these purported to describe a visit to
					Greta Hall and the Poet Laureate, ‘a man at all times master of himself’, who ‘sees before him a series of duties
					which high intellect alone can perform’.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title>Blackwood’s Edinburgh
							Magazine</title>, 4 (January 1819), 400–404 (403).</note> Southey, informed of this by a friend, suspected from
					the first that the account could not be ‘genuine’ (Letter 3243). His suspicions were later confirmed. The writer
					was not a German tourist, but the Scot John Wilson, who had derived his information at second hand, constructed a
					fantasy of intimacy from it and made it available to a wider audience (Letter 3255). This was, moreover, evidence
					of a public appetite for personality and personal revelation to which Southey himself adopted an increasingly
					ambivalent attitude. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">Although Southey’s established reputation, extensive correspondence and vast library brought the
					world – welcome or not – within the walls of Greta Hall, he continued to make the occasional extended visit from
					home. From August to September 1819 he toured Scotland with John Rickman and Thomas Telford, who were travelling as
					part of their work for the government Commissions charged with building the Caledonian Canal and new roads and
					bridges in the Highlands. The trip allowed Southey to buy rare books in Edinburgh; to see ‘some of the greatest
					works which were ever undertaken by any Government for the improvement of its dominions’; to be made ‘an honorary
					member of the Literary Society of – Banff’; and to lose a night’s sleep thanks to an initiation ceremony conducted
					in the room above his bedchamber by the ‘Free masons of Nairn’ (Letter 3350). It also led to some rather
					nerve-racking encounters with local doctors, when an ‘excrescence’ on his scalp ‘became troublesome the day … [he]
					left Edinburgh, &amp; suppurated shortly after’ (Letter 3352). Southey consulted a number of medical men in Perth,
					Aberdeen and Inverness to varying effect, and Telford, who was sharing a room with him, was given the unpleasant
					task of dressing the wound every ‘morning &amp; evening’ (Letters 3352 and 3350). Southey’s correspondence reveals
					that although he sometimes made light of his condition, nicknaming the ‘excrescence’ ‘Skiddaw’, after the Lake
					District mountain, at other times, he was ‘perplexed &amp; uneasy’, wishing he ‘were either at home, or in London’
					(Letter 3346). Significantly, although he kept some correspondents informed of ‘Skiddaw’s’ progress, he gave ‘no
					intimation’ in his ‘letters home’ to his wife and family, presumably because he did not want to worry them (Letter
					3349). </p>
               <p rend="indent1">A second major trip of the period was made between April and June 1820, when Southey visited his
					old friends Wynn (at Llangedwin) and Wade Browne (at Ludlow) before heading to London and the south of England. He
					arrived in the capital too late for one appointment (dinner at the Royal Academy); nevertheless the plethora of
					engagements that ensued was ‘such indeed as almost to make me dizzy’ (Letter 3478). The frenetic pace was captured
					in a letter to his wife, describing ‘how my time has been past’: </p>
               <quote>Friday last I breakfasted with Miss Wordsworth at her brothers, &amp; dined at Marianne’s – a large party.

					the Levee with Wynn, then to dinner at Murraylemagnes. Thursday breakfast with Dr Wordsworth, worked all the

               <p>This exhaustive, and exhausting, list provides invaluable information about the larger circles within which
					Southey was moving and contributes to a more refined sense of how Romantic period social networking functioned.
					Southey’s letters also provide important insights into more intimate, enclosed spaces and sets of relationships,
					including the dynamics of the extended family that lived together at Greta Hall, known to some as the ‘Aunt hill’.
					During his 1820 journey from home, Southey – styling himself ‘comical Pappa’ – wrote home regularly to his younger
					daughters, Bertha, Kate and Isabel, providing vignettes of people he had met and of his own ‘ell-ell-deeing’, the
					grand occasion during which he ‘was made a Doctor of Laws at Oxford’, and promising to return laden with prosaic,
					but vital, items such as toys, books and jars of pickle (Letters 3499 and 3483). </p>
               <p rend="indent1">Southey’s visit to Oxford after an absence of ‘six-and-twenty years’ gave him a fund of amusing
					anecdotes, a certain pride at his honorary degree, and abundant memories of his own youth and of those friends from
					his university days who were now ‘in their graves’ (Letters 3507). Southey believed in ghosts, ‘that the spirits of
					the dead have sometimes been permitted &lt;to&gt; appear’ (Letter 3256). By 1819, his own ‘dead’ included friends,
					his parents, several siblings and three of his own children. In the three years covered by <title>Part Six</title>
					he became increasingly concerned with ageing and prone to speculating about his own potential longevity, or lack of
					longevity. Comments such as ‘if it please God that I should live &amp; preserve my faculties so long’, ‘if it
					please God that I live ten years &amp; continue to do well’ and ‘If I live to bring out my own history of Portugal’
					punctuate his letters (Letters 3305, 3560 and 3745). The need to keep in good health, and the fear that he might
					not, was not just the concern of a man in his forties. It was also grounded in financial necessity, in the
					knowledge that ‘the greater part of my yearly expences must still be supplied by the years labour, &amp; is
					therefore wholly contingent upon the continuance of health, eye sight &amp; the use of my faculties, – either of
					which may fail me at any moment’ (Letter 3237). With an eye on the future, Southey had taken out a life assurance
					policy that he hoped would mitigate the impact of his demise on his family.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">See Michael Gamer, ‘Laureate Policy’, <title>The Wordsworth Circle</title>, 42 (2011), 42–45.</note> However, for
					a moment in 1819–1820 the possibility opened up that this might not be necessary and that his financial status
					might change for the better. The death of John Southey Somerville, a third cousin whom Southey had never met,
					raised the prospect of Southey inheriting a number of properties in Somerset that had once belonged to his and
					Somerville’s relative, John Cannon Southey. This hope was short-lived. Somerville died in October 1819, and by late
					March 1820 Southey had received legal advice that any court case he might bring was hopeless (Letter 3458).
					Southey, who had already ‘twice been disinherited of an ample property’, when his two wealthy paternal uncles had
					died and left nothing to him, found himself once again ‘frustrated’ (Letter 3560). This had implications for his
					career. As Southey admitted, gaining the Somerville properties would have allowed him ‘never more [to] write a
					single line with a view to profit’ (Letter 3384). Not obtaining them ensured that the Poet Laureate remained tied
					to his desk. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">The detailed investigations into his family history prompted by Somerville’s death, and the
					possibility of a lawsuit and an inheritance had an unexpected result. Southey decided to ‘live again in remembrance
					with the dead’ and in July 1820 began the first of a series of long letters setting out his own and his family’s
					histories. These autobiographical writings provide a unique and invaluable record, one whose accuracy Southey tried
					to improve by taking advice from his elderly aunt, Mary Southey, who had known many of the individuals and lived
					through some of the events he described (Letter 3526). The autobiographical letters also had another purpose. They
					looked forward as well as back in an attempt to secure a different kind of legacy to himself and his heirs. Southey
					did not usually make copies of his correspondence. These were different. With an eye upon their ‘post-obit value’,
					Southey made a copy of them which he kept ‘among … [his] papers’, as a document on which a future biographer could
					draw (Letter 3561). </p>
               <p rend="indent1">The movement to personal and familial retrospect found in the autobiographical letters is one side
					of Southey’s vast and complex correspondence. At the same time as he was writing detailed accounts of long dead
					ancestors, he retained a close interest in public affairs, and he continued to comment on developments in politics
					and society extensively through his letters and his published writings, particularly in the pages of the
						<title>Quarterly Review</title>. His message did not change from the views he had powerfully expressed in the
					immediate post-war period of 1816–1818: the country was undergoing fundamental changes and was threatened by
					revolutionary outbreaks that would plunge it into chaos and a new dark age. However, as his correspondence shows,
					in 1819–1821 his ever-expanding network of local and national contacts drew him into more active support of the
					State’s institutions. When his neighbour, William Calvert, brought him an address to the Prince Regent that local
					Whigs were circulating to protest about the local authorities’ actions over the ‘Peterloo’ Massacre, Southey
					responded by drafting a conservative counter-address, attacking the Whigs and demanding censorship of the radical
					press. The address won the support of Lord Lonsdale, the Lake District’s most powerful landowner and government
					supporter, even though it was not proceeded with when other government supporters protested it was too extreme in
					its views (Letters 3361, 3364, 3366, and 3385). </p>
               <p rend="indent1">At the national level, Southey’s correspondence charts his continuing interactions with political
					figures such as William Wilberforce and John Wilson Croker. Increasingly, as these letters show, Southey felt no
					inhibitions about bombarding them in private with his advice, especially about the need to curb the radical press,
					as well as addressing national politics in his Laureate odes. He also began to meet some of the Church of England’s
					bishops. William Howley, the Bishop of London, for example, visited Southey in 1819 after the two men had
					corresponded over Southey’s attempt to help his friend Henry Koster find a chaplain for the expatriate community at
					Pernambuco, Brazil. Moreover, the Anglican hierarchy believed that Southey’s criticism of the founder of Methodism
					in his <title>Life of Wesley</title> had ‘rendered an important service’ and increasingly saw Southey as a useful
					public defender of the Church’s privileged role in national life (Letter 3484). Young men on the threshold of a
					career in the Church were particularly numerous among Southey’s summer visitors in the Lakes and he was
					increasingly identified as an Anglican sage for his times. Jeremy Bentham even parodied him as ‘St Southey’ (Letter
					3419). </p>
               <p rend="indent1">Southey’s relationship with the monarchy also became closer in these years. He had only met George
					IV once – in 1813 – and he had always been careful not to heap unctuous praise on the King in his Laureate poems.
					However, his brother, Henry Herbert Southey, was a close friend of Sir William Knighton, the King’s physician and,
					effectively, his private secretary. In 1821 Knighton presented Southey’s <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> to
					the King, and Southey received glowing reports of the monarch’s views of a highly controversial and experimental
					production (Letter 3661). Southey also developed a violent antipathy to ‘the modern Messalina’, George IV’s
					estranged wife, Caroline of Brunswick, and supported the government’s attempt to dissolve the royal couple’s
					marriage in 1820–1821 (Letter 3524). Southey undoubtedly disliked Caroline’s association with radicals and Whigs,
					but his views were also coloured by the lurid gossip Landor had fed him about her activities in Italy (Letter
					3579). He refused to light his windows in Keswick on the night of 15 November 1820 to celebrate the withdrawal of
					the government’s proposals against Caroline, determined if necessary to confront an enraged radical crowd, though
					in the event the night passed off peacefully (Letter 3593). Southey’s actions were a sign of his increasing
					sympathy for the King as a beleaguered object of radical hostility and his own willingness to ‘wear the Kings
					colours’ and publicly identify himself with the conservative totems of Crown as well as Church (Letter 3587). They
					thus anticipate many of the works on Church and State he was to write and publish in the 1820s. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">As his letters reveal, in 1819–1821 Southey remained as busy and engaged with the literary world
					as he had ever been. He continued to be involved in disputes with contemporaries whose views he did not share,
					including Hazlitt, Leigh Hunt, Shelley, Byron and Cobbett. His correspondence sheds new light on these feuds, on
					the gradations of wickedness he assigned to individual authors (Shelley’s ‘obscure’ poetry made him less
					‘flagitious’ than Byron, Letter 3611) and on his advocacy of censorship of the press. It makes it possible, for
					example, to track how Southey discovered that Byron’s <title>Don Juan </title>had been ‘prefaced with a very
					hostile dedication to me’, a dedication that Murray had suppressed (Letter 3338). Not all younger writers saw
					Southey in such a negative light. Many, indeed, sought out his guidance and patronage. They included Bernard Barton
					(whom Southey advised on how to write an appropriate dedication to George IV), Caroline Bowles (to whom he sent
					advice on publishing), and John Abraham Heraud (whose unpublished writings Southey read). In turn, these younger
					poets made public their indebtedness to Southey, Heraud, for example, lauding him as a ‘Prolific Mind – spontaneous
					Muse – bright Star’.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">John Abraham Heraud, <title>The Legend of St Loy, with
							Other Poems </title>(London, 1820), p. 223.</note>
               </p>
               <p rend="indent1">Southey himself continued to be a prolific author and, indeed, expressed the hope that he would
					‘add many volumes’ to the shelves and ‘do good service both to the Church and State’ (Letters 3560 and 3507). In
					1819–1821 he published a third, and final, volume of his <title>History of Brazil</title> (1819), a
						two-volume<title> Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of Methodism</title> (1820), an introduction to
					William Westall’s <title>Views of the Lake and of the Vale of Keswick</title> (1820), a second edition of his early
					Laureate poems <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> and <title>Congratulatory Odes</title> (1821), a prose account of
						<title>The Expedition of Orsua</title> (1821) and several unsigned articles in the <title>Quarterly
					Review</title>. He also worked on a three-volume <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832), a
					two-volume <title>Book of the Church</title> (1824), a two-volume <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the
						Progress and Prospects of Society</title> (1829) and a poem set in seventeenth-century New England, ‘Oliver
					Newman’. In his capacity as Poet Laureate he wrote New Year’s Odes for 1820, 1821 and 1822, Birthday Odes for the
					new King’s official birthday in 1820 and 1821, and a poem in hexameters prompted by the death of George III,
						<title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821). </p>
               <p rend="indent1">The letters shed important new light on these writings, showing their origins, their development
					and (in some cases) their progress to publication and beyond. They also allow for a more refined understanding of
					Southey’s methods and responses when faced with a potentially tricky situation. In 1820 he published a <title>Life
						of Wesley</title>. This was, as Southey had expected, controversial. It also generated a great deal of new
					correspondence, some of it extremely hostile. Southey found himself, for example, defending his portrayal of
					Moravians in the <title>Life</title> against accusations of bias (Letter 3491). One correspondent gave Southey
					access to some new, potentially inflammatory information about Wesley’s ‘character’ (Letter 3596). This took the
					form of a copy of a letter supposedly sent to Wesley by one of his female followers, Elizabeth Briggs, </p>
               <quote>… remonstrating with him upon the improper liberties which he had taken with her, – it is in a strain of the
					warmest affection, &amp; the most unbounded reverence; &amp; yet at the same time shows that she was a virtuous
					woman, &amp; was alarmed at his conduct. He must then have been about sixty five years of age. (Letter
					3603)</quote>
               <p>Although the Dean of Worcester, who had sent him the copy of Miss Briggs’s letter, attested to its authenticity,
					Southey needed more proof before he could include it in a second edition of the <title>Life</title>. He wrote to
					Glocester Wilson, the owner of the incriminating document, and discovered that Wilson did not possess the original
					manuscript, but only ‘a copy of it given by Mrs Wesley to his mother’ (Letter 3596). Lacking the degree of
					authentication he needed and harbouring a lingering suspicion that the letter was not from Miss Briggs, but rather
					forged by Wesley’s estranged wife, Southey decided against publishing it (Letter 3626).</p>
               <p rend="indent1">Southey lived at a time when public interest in the lives of individuals was on the rise. Although
					he could – and did – protest about intrusion into his own private life, he loved ‘the rich veins of gossip and
					garrulity’ (Letter 3526). He was, moreover, not averse to including personal information about others in his own
					works – for example, in his 1813 biography of Horatio Nelson. However, the Wesley–Briggs incident, recovered here
					for the first time, says much about the principles and methods that governed his work as a biographer and the
					priority he placed upon authenticating his sources before committing information to the public sphere. It also
					provides a tantalising link between Southey’s belief in the necessity for press censorship, given the
					susceptibility of the public to believing all they read, and his refusal as a biographer to further corrupt the
					minds of his readers with unverified information. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">As well as shedding new light on the practice of someone already recognised as an important
					Romantic period biographer, Southey’s correspondence has much to say about areas of his writing life that are much
					less familiar, or, indeed, not known at all. These include a planned edition of the writings of the suicide Elton
					Hamond that was abandoned on the grounds that it would be dangerous to send ‘abroad opinions which no antidote can
					prevent from infecting minds predisposed to … receive the … morbid matter’ (Letter 3443). Other potential projects
					revealed here include a second volume of <title>Letters from England</title>, a ‘life of Warren Hastings’, a
					biography of Oliver Cromwell, a ‘Life of George Fox, upon the scale of that of Wesley’, and ‘the Moral &amp;
					Literary History of England’ (Letters 3237, 3521, 3675 and 3521). Southey prophesied the latter would become his
					‘favourite work (Letter 3521). He was wrong because it, like the second volume of <title>Letters from
						England</title>, and the lives of Hastings, Fox and Cromwell, was never written. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">Some of Southey’s unknown or overlooked works of the late 1810s and early 1820s did make it beyond
					the drawing board. They include a privately commissioned biography of the wealthy wine merchant, philanthropist and
					educationalist David Pike Watts, composed at the ‘desire’ of his daughter and heiress Mary Watts-Russell ‘for her
					children, &amp; perhaps for private circulation’ (Letter 3544). (It did not, in fact, appear in print until 1841,
					when it was privately published.) This was not the first such project Southey had undertaken. In 1813 he had
					written a defence of Sir George Barlow’s conduct while Governor of Madras. Commissioned by Barlow’s brother,
					William, this had been published anonymously.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">

					Watts was purely financial: the project was to bring in £400. However, this particular venture into the economy of
					commission and private publication caused Southey considerable embarrassment when a bill of exchange for the wrong
					amount (£500 rather than the £400 agreed as payment for the volume) was erroneously presented to Mary
					Watts-Russell’s bank. The bank refused to pay it, and Southey, whose ‘character’ was thus ‘brought into question’,
					had to act quickly, asking Andrew Bell to intervene on his behalf and plead his case (Letter 3555). It was a
					warning of the perils of writing to a private commission and of the fragile nature of reputation. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">The economics of publishing were, indeed, to the fore in 1819–1821. As his letters show, Southey
					was increasingly conscious of the declining sales of his most financially successful poem, <title>Roderick</title>,
					and of how crucial those had been in sustaining him and his dependants (Letter 3371). He even tried to increase the
					readership for earlier works such as <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> by encouraging Longman to try the
					‘experiment’ of publishing them in ‘a small cheap form’ (Letter 3426). Longman did not take the bait. Southey’s
					attempt to drum up interest in his older works was underpinned by the awareness that he was not getting as good a
					deal for new poetical works as other contemporaries. He compared, for example, the £1,500 Longman offered for a
					‘long poem which has been long in hand’ with the £3,000 given by the same publisher to Tom Moore (Letter 3560).
					Southey’s worries about needing to earn as much as possible were exacerbated by an anxious wife, young children and
					ceaseless demands from his extended family, especially his brother Tom, a former naval officer who was now an
					unsuccessful farmer. Tom was ‘a heavy burthen, &amp; a sore grief’, and his waistline and brood of ‘absolute
					Killcrops’ (Southey’s nieces and nephews) were expanding at the expense of the Poet Laureate, or so the latter felt
					(Letters 3498 and 3319). Southey’s only hope was that Tom and his family would ‘leave the kingdom, &amp; remove …
					to the Cape’ (Letter 3498). They did not oblige him. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">The need – actual or perceived – for money underpinned Southey’s formidable work ethic and his
					decision to take on more projects than he could possibly complete (see, for example, Letter 3745). It also made him
					tenacious in his attempts to protect his name and to ensure that others did not benefit from it. Such efforts had,
					of course, extra piquancy after the debacle over <title>Wat Tyler</title>, the best-selling play from whose pirated
					publication in 1817 Southey had earned not one penny. In 1820 he went on the offensive against a new book,
						<title>Authentic Memoirs of Our Late Venerable and Beloved Monarch, George the Third</title>, whose supposed
					author was one ‘<title>Robert Southy, Esq.</title>’. Advertisements for this urged members of the public to ‘order
					Southys Life of the King to avoid imposition’ (Letter 3434). Southey was enraged. He investigated the possibility
					of legal action and also sent a paragraph about the matter to a local newspaper, the <title>Westmorland
						Gazette</title>, where the following appeared on 12 February 1820:</p>
               <quote>Some memoirs of the late King are now publishing in sixpenny numbers, and stated on the cover to be written
					by Robert Southy, Esq., with this farther notice, “observe to order Southy’s Life of the King to avoid imposition.”
					We are authorized to assure our readers that this is an impudent imposition; in which Mr. Southey’s name is used
					for the purpose of deceiving country purchasers, and misspelled in the hope that the fraudulent publisher may be
					enabled to evade the law. Other newspapers, we trust will insert this notice as an act of justice to the individual
					on whose reputation the fraud is practiced; and as one means of checking a species of swindling which is now become
						frequent.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">

					1820.</note>
               </quote>
               <p>The fraudster’s attempt to cash in played on the idea that, as Poet Laureate, Southey might well be expected to
					write something upon the death of the King. (It also called on public awareness of Southey as a biographer, at a
					point when his <title>Life of Wesley</title> was also being advertised.) George III’s death had, in fact, caused
					Southey some anxiety, because it opened up the prospect of his having to do more to earn the Poet Laureate’s
					salary. His Laureateship was, he noted, ‘not … a sinecure’ (Letter 3582). As well as the New Year’s ode he had
					produced on an annual basis since late 1813, Southey feared that ‘Alas the [King’s] birth days will now be kept’,
					and that he would be expected to write something for them (Letter 3448). In practice, this did not happen. Southey
					wrote just two birthday poems for George IV, in 1820 and 1821, and neither of these was performed at court. In
					addition, although George IV’s Coronation on 19 July 1821 was notable for its extravagant pageantry, it was not
					commemorated in verse by the King’s poet. Southey’s ideas for a Coronation ode went no further than some notebook
					jottings. Instead, as his correspondence reveals, as 1820 and 1821 progressed, he increasingly developed plans for
					a poem that emerged out of the death of George III – <title>A Vision of Judgement</title>, published in March 1821.
					This new work, he claimed, would ‘attract some notice’ and ‘provoke some abuse’; exactly how much ‘abuse’ Southey
					was to discover later (Letter 3582).</p>
               <p rend="indent1">Southey’s letters provide important new information about the development and publication of, and
					the initial response to, one of the most controversial and damaging of his poetical works. They also reveal
					tantalising connections between the poet of 1821 and the poet of the 1790s. <title>A</title>
                  <title>Vision’s</title> use of English hexameters, for example, harked back to some of Southey’s earlier metrical
					experiments and plans for a poem on ‘The Deluge … for which I formed a plan drawn from the state of the present
					world, … to have been executed in hexameters as far back as the year 1799’ (Letter 3653). Although Southey claimed
					that his correspondent would be ‘struck by this coincidence’ between <title>A Vision </title>and the unwritten poem
					on the Flood, there was one important difference between them. The earlier poem was, as the notes for it in
					Southey’s <title>Common-Place Book</title> make clear, intended to engage with ‘the present world’ in a coded,
					rather than an explicit, fashion.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title>Common-Place Book</title>, ed. John
						Wood Warter, 4 series (London, 1849–1850), IV, pp. 2–3.</note> As such, it followed the pattern of Southey’s
					poetry of the 1790s and 1800s. <title>A Vision</title> took the opposite tack, dealing directly with contemporary
					events and engaging explicitly in contemporary controversies. It was therefore a large-scale and public
					consolidation of Southey’s mid-career turn to the present. Moreover, it was produced and published at a time when
					Southey regarded society as imperilled as never before by the productions of the radical press whose suppression he
					urged. This edition makes it possible for the first time to trace how and why these shifts in Southey’s poetry and
					opinions happened, and how and why <title>A Vision of Judgement </title> and other writings either came into being
					or were abandoned for good.</p>

               <head>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey: Part Four</head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">Introduction</hi> by Ian Packer and Lynda Pratt</p>
               <p>
                  <title>Part Four</title> collects together in one place for the first time the surviving letters written by Southey between 1810
                    and 1815. The letters we publish here commence in January 1810 with Southey returning proofing corrections for the
                        <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title> (Letter 1729). They end on 28 December 1815 with a letter to Henry Koster that
                    juxtaposes a description of Christmas in Keswick with Southey’s on-going labours on three major projects, <title>The Poet’s
                        Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title>, <title>The History of Brazil</title> and <title>The History of the Peninsular War</title>
                    (Letter 2689). <title>Part Four</title> follows the editorial conventions described in About this Edition, bringing together in
                    one place correspondence scattered between archives in the United Kingdom, Europe, Australasia and North and South America. It
                    comprises newly transcribed, fully annotated texts of 969 letters. Of these, 585 are published for the first time, with a further
                    94 published here in full for the first time.</p>
               <p rend="indent1"> Southey’s correspondence was characterised by its extent and its diversity. The letters in <title>Part Four</title>
                    were written to nearly ninety individuals from a wide spectrum of society and engage with regional, national and international
                    affairs. They range from bibliographical information sent to Lord Holland, who shared Southey’s passion for Hispanic culture and
                    allowed him to use his extensive library, to playful epistles to the Southey children (Letters 1812 and 2304). <title>Part
                        Four</title> sees the continuation of long-established correspondences, such as those with Mary Barker, Grosvenor Bedford,
                    Joseph Cottle, John Rickman and Charles Wynn. It also bears witness to the start of a series of important new epistolary
                    relationships, including ones with the educationalist Andrew Bell, the politician and man of letters John Wilson Croker, the poet
                    and journalist James Montgomery and the abolitionist and evangelical William Wilberforce. Although over 900 letters survive from
                    this period, letter fragments and references within surviving letters to ones that have been lost are reminders of the selective
                    nature of what has come down to us and of the contingencies of literary history. They bear witness that what we have is part, but
                    not all, of a much larger output. Southey’s letters to, for example, Manuel Abella, Coleridge, Peter Elmsley, Charles Lamb, and
                    Sharon Turner exist only in part; whilst some correspondences have been lost entirely and can now only be glimpsed in letters sent
                    to other people.</p>
               <p rend="indent1">In January 1810 Southey was thirty-five years old. He had been married for fifteen years and had fathered five
                    children, three of whom were still living. Two more daughters – Kate and Isabel – were born in 1811 and 1812. The rootlessness and
                    displacement of his early life, when he had moved frequently between London and South West England, were in the past. By 1810 he
                    had been living at Greta Hall, on the outskirts of the market town of Keswick, since autumn 1803. Although he made occasional
                    forays from the Lakes, most notably on extended visits to London in autumn 1813 and to the continent in autumn 1815, where he
                    toured the battlefield of Waterloo, Southey spent most of the period covered by <title>Part Four</title> labouring in his study.
                    Geographically distant from both London and the South West, where he had forged his literary career, Southey’s Lake District home
                    was not isolated or cut off from the rest of the world. He was by 1810 increasingly embedded in local society: socialising not
                    just with fellow writers such as Wordsworth and Charles Lloyd, but also with local landowners and worthies, such as the Senhouses,
                    Speddings and Stangers. He was later to add the Cumbrian magnate the Earl of Lonsdale to his list. Moreover, his established
                    professional reputation meant that numerous literary and non-literary visitors from Britain and elsewhere also found their way to
                    his door. Some were welcome, others less so, and one brought Southey face to face with his own younger self. In early 1812
                    Shelley, who was staying in Keswick, visited Greta Hall. Southey, who recounted the younger man’s history at length to friends,
                    was struck by their strange kinship. Shelley, he told Grosvenor Bedford, ‘acts upon me as my own Ghost would do’ and was ‘just
                    what I was in 1794’ (Letter 2012).</p>
               <p rend="indent1">Personal contact was one thing, but, as his letters show, Southey also maintained touch with the wider world via
                    newspapers and by reading and reviewing recently published books, the latter often lent to him by friends, acquaintances and the
                    metropolitan-based publisher John Murray. Southey remained interested in and attentive to a huge range of subjects – literature,
                    politics, religion, education, and social reform, to name but a few. For example, he followed the progress of the allies’
                    campaigns against Bonaparte, and mapped the careers of poetry-writing contemporaries and rivals, tracking with some interest the
                    decline in popularity of Walter Scott’s poems (Letters 2208, 2215). Moreover, the global reach of Southey’s own research and
                    writing led to some surprising exchanges between Keswick and the outside world. On more than one occasion he was sent or requested
                    unpublished accounts written by individuals who had witnessed at first hand recent events in the Iberian Peninsula or Spanish
                    America, using these to inform his essays in the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title>. These included a manuscript journal
                    kept by the British merchant Thomas Kinder who had been present in the Rio de la Plata during the revolution of 1808–1810 (Letter
                    2163). At other times, he was sent unsolicited copies of the rare volumes needed for his history writing. In 1812, for example,
                    Southey received a parcel from Frederick Lindeman, the British consul in Bahia, Brazil. It contained a copy of Anchieta’s
                        <title>Arte de Grammatica</title>, which Southey had listed amongst the books he would love to acquire in the preface to the
                    first volume of his <title>History of Brazil</title>, published in 1810. The Conde dos Arcos, the Governor General and the
                    Director of the newly founded public library at Bahia had learned of this and sent the copy of Anchieta to Southey via the
                    diplomat Lindeman. Southey used the book for the second and third volumes of his Brazilian history and kept it. In return, he sent
                    the Conde dos Arcos a specially bound copy of the 1805 quarto of his Welsh-American epic <title>Madoc</title>: ‘as a specimen of
                    fine typography, &amp; in proof of the sense I entertain of their liberality’ to ‘an English &amp; heretical author’ (Letters
                    2137, 2143). <title>Part Four</title> allows this exchange of books, manuscripts and information – Anchieta sent to Keswick and
                        <title>Madoc</title> to Brazil – to be tracked for the first time. It thus enhances our understanding of the circulation of
                    material objects and abstract ideas and also reinforces the global, as well as provincial and national, composition of
                    intellectual networks in the early nineteenth century. Southey’s letters show Romantic period international exchange in action and
                    bear witness to the transmission of knowledge and information between individuals of different cultural, political and religious
                    backgrounds and sympathies. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">Southey was, then, far from alone during the long days and nights he spent working in his Lakeland library. His
                    letters, sent to correspondents in the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, France, Holland, Brussels, North America and Brazil, are
                    testimony to his inveterate and adept use of correspondence networks and indeed of the postal system itself. In the 1810s he
                    continued his practice of exploiting the franking privileges of Parliamentary friends and associates, including the Chancellor of
                    the Exchequer, and even used contacts in the post office to get the charges on heavy parcels reduced. On one notable occasion, he
                    lost his temper when Charles Stuart, the British consul in Lisbon, sent a copy of Calado’s <title>Valeroso Lucideno</title> from
                    Portugal to the London offices of Longman, Southey’s publisher, asking him to forward it to Keswick. The book was extremely heavy
                    and the postal charge was correspondingly large, sixteen guineas. Longman, who as the recipient was expected to pay the fee on
                    Southey’s behalf, protested and contacted Francis Freeling, head of the British postal service. Freeling, an old friend of
                    Southey’s, stretched ‘the laws of the office to the utmost’ and had the charge reduced to just one guinea. In spite of benefitting
                    from this rule bending, Southey was displeased, grumbling that ‘I am thus to pay for the use of a book the prime cost of which
                    cannot exceed half a moidore. I hope Mr Stuart manages the affairs of two nations better than he has done mine’ (Letter 1914).
                        <title>Part Four</title> thus demonstrates the crucial roles played by the postal service and the exchange of letters, books
                    and manuscripts in promoting and sustaining Romantic intellectual networks. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">
                  <title>Part Four</title> covers 1810–1815, a key period in Southey’s career. It is, however, one that has yet to be fully
                    documented or fully understood. His output over these six years was, even by his own standards, prodigious and diverse and the
                    letters published here provide new information on how those works came into being. During this time Southey produced hundreds of
                    pages of reviews for the <title>Quarterly</title>; yearly chronicles of contemporary world events for the <title>Edinburgh Annual
                        Register</title>; a history of Brazil; a biography of Horatio Nelson; a volume championing the educational theory and practice
                    of the Reverend Andrew Bell, pioneer of the Madras system; odes on current affairs; inscriptions on the war in the Iberian
                    Peninsular; an epic set in Visigothic Spain; a Hindu romance; an <title>Omniana</title> of miscellaneous information and anecdote
                    drawn from his and Coleridge’s commonplace books; and an anonymously published defence of Sir George Barlow, a colonial official
                    at Madras. Some of his labours caused Southey greater trouble than others. His writing for the <title>Quarterly Review</title>
                    brought him into direct conflict with government policy and into a fierce dispute with the Duke of Wellington (Letter 2671).
                    Whilst his work for the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title>, for which he wrote the historical section covering the years
                    1808–1811, absorbed far more of his time than he had originally intended, precipitated increasingly querulous exchanges with John
                    Ballantyne, the ‘Shuffler’ who published the <title>Register</title>, and led to an unwise investment which cost Southey £209,
                    money he could ill afford to lose (Letters 2212, 2284). </p>
               <p rend="indent1">Often one hated but essential literary task generated another – sometimes more pleasurable – one or led to a new
                    direction in Southey’s writing. For example, his work for the <title>Register</title> obliged him to engage directly with
                    contemporary events in the United Kingdom, mainland Europe, and the rest of the world. It thus marked a change from his earlier
                    history writing, which had chronicled early modern Brazil and medieval Portugal. Although Southey increasingly loathed his work
                    for the <title>Register</title>, his turn to and investment in the contemporary, allowed him in the early-mid 1810s to lay the
                    foundations for a series of major new prose works. These included a three volume <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>
                    (published in 1823–1832), which relied heavily on Southey’s <title>Register</title> accounts, a <title>Book of the Church</title>
                    (published in 1824) and two planned, but unexecuted, histories ‘of the World’ and ‘of the age of George III’ (Letter 2238).</p>
               <p rend="indent1">Yet prose was not Southey’s only outlet. He remained, in Byron’s ambiguous phrase, an ‘entire man of letters’. <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Quoted in Lionel Madden (ed.), <title>Robert Southey: The Critical Heritage</title>
                        (London, 1972), p. 105.</note> Indeed, these years saw him return to poetry with renewed vigour and enthusiasm. Between
                    1810–1815 Southey published two new long poems: <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810) and <title>Roderick, the Last of the
                        Goths</title> (1814). The latter went into three editions in the eighteen months after its publication, making it the fastest
                    selling of his epics and romances. He did not neglect his earlier writings. Between 1810–1815 he revised <title>Joan of
                        Arc</title> for a fourth edition, and <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> and <title>Madoc</title> for third editions and
                    issued a three-volume collection of his selected, self-styled <title>Minor Poems</title>. He also invested significant amounts of
                    time in new poetic projects. ‘Oliver Newman’, a romance set in seventeenth-century New England against the backdrop of King
                    Phillips’ War, followed Southey’s earlier pattern of deploying historical settings. Other initiatives echoed the shift in his
                    history writing. As the letters published here reveal, during 1810–1815 poetry became for Southey a way of recording contemporary
                    events. His productions included a <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> celebrating the defeat of Bonaparte in 1813; a series of three
                        <title>Congratulatory Odes</title>, which commemorated the 1814 visit to Britain of Alexander I of Russia and Frederick
                    William of Prussia; an ode cautioning those who counselled ‘peace at this momentous hour’; an ode reflecting on the 1812–1814 war
                    between the United Kingdom and the United States of America; a <title>Carmen Nuptiale</title>, initially intended for the marriage
                    of Princess Charlotte of Wales to the Prince of Orange, and later revised to celebrate her union with Leopold of Saxe Coburg; and
                        <title>The Poet’s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title>, which combined an account of Southey’s visit to the battlefield with a
                    dream-vision exhorting his countrymen to ‘pursue the course of righteousness’. <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">‘The Poet’s
                        Pilgrimage to Waterloo’, Part II, line 336; Robert Southey, <title>Later Poetical Works</title>, gen. eds Tim Fulford and
                        Lynda Pratt, 4 vols (London, 2012), III, p. 373.</note> In addition, another major, though never-completed, poetic project of
                    the period was ‘a series of inscriptions, recording the achievements of our army in the Peninsula, — triumphal for the battles won
                    and fortresses taken, and monumental for the more distinguished persons who have fallen’ (Letter 2345). It is important to
                    recognise that this direct poetic investment in current affairs was a major new departure for Southey. It was a movement away from
                    the allegorisation of contemporary politics in his longer poems, including <title>Kehama</title> and <title>Roderick</title>, and
                    in his earlier shorter works. Whilst the shift echoed that occurring in Southey’s history writing, it was also motivated by a very
                    specific cause – his appointment as Poet Laureate in autumn 1813.</p>
               <p rend="indent1">Southey’s acceptance of the Poet Laureateship in autumn 1813 and the consequences and repercussions of that action
                    loom large in <title>Part Four</title>. <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> For a full account of events see Lynda Pratt’s
                        introduction to <title>Later Poetical Works</title>, III, pp. xi–xxviii.</note> The invitation came after Walter Scott had
                    rejected the post and recommended Southey for it, even though he was ‘uncertain if … [Southey] would like it’ (Letter 2299).
                    Southey himself was unsure if he would like it, but he took it anyway. He assumed the Laureateship at a low point in its history.
                    The status of the office and its previous holder Henry James Pye were neatly encapsulated in ‘A Pun’, published in late 1813:</p>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l rend="indent2">Our Poet Laureat lived so long,</l>
                  <l rend="indent3">He dream’d at last he should not die;</l>
                  <l rend="indent2">Till, deaf to all his powers of song,</l>
                  <l rend="indent3">

                        <title>Mirror of Fashion</title> (13 September 1813).</note>
                  </l>
               </lg>
               <p>Southey would not have dissented from this, sharing his contemporaries’ view that the Laureateship had long ‘ranked proverbially
                    high’ in the list of ‘departments, in which a sleepy torpor seemed established by precedent’. <note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title>British Review</title>, 6 (November 1815), 287–8.</note> Indeed, when he was offered the post he said he would accept
                    it only if its terms and conditions could be changed. Moreover, he did so in language that would have disqualified him from many
                    twenty-first century appointment processes: ‘certain it is’, he told Croker, ‘that the office could give’ no credit ‘to me’
                    (Letter 2298). Southey’s sense of the post as problematic and potentially degrading did not abate. Shortly after accepting the
                    Laureateship he wrote to John King, a medical friend from his Bristol days. ‘You will’, he told King, ‘please to congratulate,
                    &amp; not condole with me’ (Letter 2303). It was a sentiment repeated to others: ‘you know me well enough to smile at the
                    apprehensions of anyone who fears I may degraded myself’ (Letter 3235); and ‘Your feelings respecting this appointment will very
                    soon be changed. In me, of all men, it would have been at once gross folly &amp; rank cowardice to have refused it’ (Letter 2329).
                    When Southey took on the Laureateship in autumn 1813 he was, then, a man with a mission. He intended to do something with the
                    post, to ‘make’ it ‘an honour’, ‘for such it will be to him who shall be thought worthy to wear it after me’. He was also aware
                    that he was taking it at a time of ‘great events’, at a particularly crucial moment in national and international history (Letter
                    2307). </p>
               <p rend="indent1">Assuming the Laureateship marked a decisive moment in Southey’s career. It generated a series of official and
                    semi-official poems on current affairs, including his first Laureate ode <title>Carmen Triumphale</title>, published in book form
                    by Longman in January 1814. However, it proved to be more problematic and damaging than he had allowed for. The transformation of
                    the former radical into a government hireling attracted the censure, and satire, of contemporaries. His political opponents saw
                    Southey as an odd choice and took a gleeful, and discomforting, pleasure in the disjunction between the old radical poet and the
                    new Laureate. Hazlitt, for example, cautioned that ‘To <hi rend="ital">have been</hi> the poet of the people, may not render Mr.
                    Southey less a court favourite; and one of his old Sonnets to Liberty must give a peculiar zest to his new Birth-day Odes’. <note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title>Morning Chronicle</title> (18 September 1813).</note> He also drew attention to the ‘inconsistency between some of Mr.
                    Southey’s former writings, and his becoming the hired panegyrist of the court’. <note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title>Morning Chronicle</title> (20 September 1813).</note> Others expressed their concerns in verse. In the anonymously
                    published ‘Robert Southey, the Poet Laureat. A Rhapsody in Four Parts’, the new Laureate was condemned by characters of his own
                    invention: Joan of Arc, Thalaba, Madoc and Kehama:</p>
               <lg type="stanza">

               </lg>
               <p rend="indent1">Southey expected to be attacked by his political opponents, what he did not anticipate was the official reaction to
                    his productions. When in 1814 he described the process of writing the annual odes demanded of the Laureate as an ‘od<hi rend="ital">e</hi>ous job’, he was not joking (Letter 2521). The actual composition of his Laureate poems proved to be an
                    extremely fraught process, one that revealed the difficulties, ambiguities and limitations of his position. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">At the time he accepted the Laureateship Southey believed he had brokered an unprecedented, though unwritten,
                    agreement that he would be allowed ‘to write upon great events, or … be silent, according as the spirit moved’ (Letter 2298). It
                    soon emerged that no such agreement had been reached and that he was expected to follow in the footsteps of his predecessors and
                    produce at least annual New Year odes. As he embarked on writing such poems it further became clear that his post brought with it
                    official responsibilities and that far from being free to write ‘as the spirit moved’, he was in fact circumscribed. What those
                    responsibilities and restrictions were was initially brought home to him in late 1813 when he sat down to compose his first
                    Laureate poem. This was a New Year’s ode, whose theme was ‘down with the Tyrant’ (Bonaparte) and ‘Vengeance’ for his victims.
                    Happily pursuing his theme, Southey’s draft ode concluded with three stanzas that called on the French to rise up and assassinate
                    Bonaparte and by so doing ‘Take vengeance’ for themselves and for mankind. This was, of course, against the policy of the British
                    government. Southey was forced to cut the offending stanzas from the final version of the ode published as <title>Carmen
                        Triumphale</title> in January 1814. He was enraged by the intervention and by the censoring of his poem, so much so that he
                    privately renamed it the ‘Carmen Castratum’ (Letter 2355). Furious he may have been, but he still made the required changes. This
                    was not a unique occurrence. One year later Southey was told he must cut out complimentary references to George Washington from
                    his New Year’s ode for 1815 as these were seen as highly inappropriate and unpatriotic at a time when Britain was at war with
                    America (Letter 2531). <note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> For full accounts of the compositional histories of <title>Carmen
                            Triumphale</title> and the New Year’s ode for 1815 see Ian Packer and Lynda Pratt’s introductions to both poems,
                            <title>Later Poetical Works</title>, III, pp. 1–14, 77–82.</note> This edition makes it possible to track the development
                    of Southey’s Laureate poems via the early versions, enforced revisions and comments on those revisions he sent to friends.
                    Moreover, it shows how the choices he made in autumn 1813 involved him in a series of disputes and exchanges that impacted
                    massively, and negatively, on his short and longer-term reputation. The letters published here make it possible to map for the
                    first time how and why those choices were made, how those disputes were ignited, and how Southey responded to them. In so doing
                    they show how his high hopes of the Laureateship foundered on the rocks of reality and thus provide new insight into the
                    relationship between Romantic writers and the public sphere. </p>

               <head>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey: Part One</head>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">Part One</title> is the first-ever collected edition of the letters written during the earliest period of Southey’s
               career. It begins with Southey as a rebellious pupil at Westminster School and ends with him attempting to balance his writing life
               with the legal career forced on him by his patron, Charles Wynn. Part One follows the editorial conventions described in About this
               Edition and publishes newly transcribed, annotated texts of all the surviving letters written by him between 1791 and 1797, bringing
               together in one place correspondence scattered between 28 archives in North America and the United Kingdom. <title level="m">Part
                  One</title> comprises 280 letters, of which 92 are published for the first time, and 68 are published in full for the first time. In
               addition, 6 letters that appeared pseudonymously in the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> are here newly attributed to Southey. </p>
               <p rend="indent1"> Southey’s surviving letters from 1791-1797 are written to some 25 extremely diverse individuals, some familiar from
               literary history, others not. They include friends from childhood (John James Morgan, Charles Danvers, Sarah and Edith Fricker); from
               school (Grosvenor Charles Bedford and Charles Watkin Williams Wynn); from university (John Horseman); and from professional life (John
               Aikin and William Owen Pughe). Some correspondents – such as Charles Collins –would rapidly disappear from Southey’s orbit; others
               (notably Bedford and Wynn) would remain lifelong friends. A third group, including Joseph Cottle and Robert Lovell, are reminders of
               the inevitable overlap in the letters between his personal and professional, private and public lives. The letters Southey sent to
               Cottle, who from 1795 was simultaneously his friend and his publisher, combine gossip about mutual acquaintances with literary
               business, returning proofing corrections, detailing financial concerns, and complaining about incompetent printers. They also provide
               evidence of his response to other writers, including his admiration for Bowles and Sayers and his reaction to controversial novels like
               Matthew Lewis’s <title level="m">The Monk</title>: ‘I do not think the Monk can be praised too highly, or blamed too severely’ (Letter
               195). Further, though different, less personal, evidence of Southey’s engagement in a cultural public sphere can be seen in the letters
               he contributed from 1796 to the pages of the newly-founded <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>. Some signed, others pseudonymous,
               these reveal that from the very earliest stages of his career Southey disseminated his views on larger national stages, participating
               in wider, sometimes highly controversial, debates. </p>
               <p rend="indent1"> The correspondence on Spanish and Portuguese literature, Chatterton, the Welsh language and the treatment of English
               prisoners of war, sent by Southey to the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> in 1796 and 1797 may, in fact, not have been his
               first appearance in the metropolitan periodical press. Letter 124 suggests that he sent earlier, politically driven correspondence
               signed with the republican pseudonym ‘Harrington’ to the short-lived London radical newspaper <title level="j">The Telegraph</title>.
               The absence of any surviving copies of the newspaper from the period in question makes it impossible to prove his claim. The traces of
               these earlier, radical, public communications draws attention to another feature of the letters published here: that Southey’s
               surviving correspondence provides important information about the letters that have not come down to us. ‘Missing’ letters revealed by
               Part One of include those from Southey to Joseph Cottle between late 1794 and November 1795; any correspondence exchanged before 1798
               by Southey and the metropolitan radical George Dyer; and all of Southey’s letters to his parents, to his fellow Pantisocrat George
                  Burnett,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">For evidence of the Southey-Burnett correspondence see Letter 266, ‘I hear from him
                  [Burnett] frequently.’</note> to the radical surgeon Anthony Carlisle,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">See Letter 260, ‘Give
                  my love to Carlisle &amp; tell him I never received the letter he mentions relative to poor Mary Godwin!’</note> to Robert Allen
               (who introduced him to Coleridge in 1794), and to the would-be emigrant Robert Favell.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">For
                  evidence of the correspondences with Allen and Favell see: an unpublished letter from Allen to Southey, 23 April 1795, National
                  Library of Scotland, MS 2528, fols 2-3; an undated, [c. 1794-1795?], letter from Favell to Southey, National Library of Scotland, MS
                  2529, fol. 45.</note>
               </p>
               <p rend="indent1"> The most conspicuous absences are the letters sent by Southey to two key individuals in his early literary career:
               Coleridge and Robert Lovell. Coleridge and Southey met in Oxford in summer 1794 and subsequently corresponded. Whilst several of Coleridge’s letters to Southey from 1794-1797 survive, only one from Southey to Coleridge has come down to us, and that only in the fragmentary version published by Cuthbert Southey (Letter 229.1). <note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">For Coleridge’s letters to Southey from 1794-1797, see Earl Leslie Griggs (ed.), <title level="m">The Collected
                     Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge</title>, 6 vols (1956-1971), I, pp. 82-90; 97-100; 101-106; 109-110; 112-120; 121-124;
                  132-143; 145-150; 157-159; 163-173; 248; 290-292; 332-337; 345-346; 358-359. [Hereafter Griggs.]</note> The result is an imbalance
               of information. Coleridge’s letters to Southey give us his views on crucial events such as the collapse of Pantisocracy, making a
               powerful case for Southey as ‘lost to Virtue’, as ‘one who had <hi rend="ital">fallen back into the Ranks</hi>’.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Samuel Taylor Coleridge to Robert Southey, [13] November 1795, Griggs, I, pp. 163, 166.</note> This
               incomplete correspondence has led to assumptions that Coleridge was the more energetic partner in the enterprise, and that he was badly
               let down. The latter’s lost replies might have shown another, equally compelling, side to the argument. The one-sided nature of the
               surviving letters also impacts on our sense of Southey as a writer. Coleridge’s letters create an image of Southey that has proved,
               until recently, to be surprisingly resiliant and unquestioned:</p>
               <quote>You sate down and wrote – I used to saunter about and think what I should write. And we ought to appreciate our comparative
               Industry by the quantum of mental exertion, not the particular mode of it. By the number of Thoughts collected, not by the number of
               Lines, thro’ which these Thoughts are diffused.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Samuel Taylor Coleridge to Robert Southey, [13]
                  November 1795, Griggs, I, p. 172.</note>
               </quote>
               <p>Coleridge constructs an image of Southey’s writing as prolix, unreflective, radically different and, by implication, inferior to his
               own. His rhetoric was calculatedly one-sided, designed to suit his own agenda, to combat his own fears and demons. Yet his relationship
               with Southey was a two-way exchange between equals – something that the absence of Southey’s replies makes it easy to overlook. We can
               use Coleridge’s part of the correspondence to guess at what Southey had said or written, but we cannot be certain. The most detailed
               picture of Southey’s views on Coleridge in the mid 1790s has to emerge, then, not from the intimacy and immediacy of their one-to-one
               exchanges, but from what Southey had to say in letters to others. It is here that we can map his movement from enchantment to
               disillusionment. We can follow his excitement at meeting ‘one whom I very much esteem &amp; admire’ (Letter 94), ‘a man of the first
               genius &amp; abilities, &amp; ... my friend’ (Letter 100). As relationships between the two soured, we can also chart Southey’s growing
               disillusionment and determination to sever their connections, including creative links. We learn of his decision to ‘expunge every line
               of Coleridges ... all he <hi rend="ital">wrote</hi> not all he <hi rend="ital">claims</hi>’ from the second edition of <title level="m">Joan of Arc</title> (Letter 148). We also discover that by 1797 Southey had reached a point where he could describe Coleridge
               as</p>
               <quote>one who has neither the feelings nor habits of honest independance, &amp; who always indulges himself careless of consequences ...
               it is not possible to think too highly[MS torn] Coleridges abilities, or too despicably of him in every other character. (Letter
               250)</quote>
               <p>His opinion was not to alter radically in the coming years.</p>
               <p rend="indent1"> Another less familiar, but equally central literary relationship of the 1790s can also only be glimpsed in part: that
               between Southey and Robert Lovell. The two Bristol-born poets met in late 1793, introduced by their mutual friends the Fricker sisters.
               (Lovell, like Southey and Coleridge, was to marry one of the Frickers.) Their relationship was ended by Lovell’s premature and sudden
               death in 1796. Only a tiny fraction of what was probably a substantial correspondence survives, consisting of one complete (Letter 85)
               and one fragmentary letter (Letter 147) from Southey to Lovell; none from Lovell to Southey is extant. This gap in the correspondence
               means that it is easy to underestimate the importance of their friendship. The letters published here – both those sent to Lovell and
               those written about him – allow his importance to Southey, particularly in the period 1793-4, to emerge for the first time. Letter 85,
               the only complete one from Southey to Lovell extant, offers a tantalising glimpse of their friendship. Lovell emerges as a sharer in
               Southey’s politics and literary ambition, someone with whom he could exchange political news, a recently completed radical elegy ‘To
               the Exiled Patriots’, a series of sonnets and information about projected works, including the earliest summary of the Welsh-American
               epic <title level="m">Madoc</title>. Lovell’s importance to Southey as a man of ‘very great abilities’, one who ‘writes well’ (Letter
               73), emerges from other letters. It was Lovell who Southey praised in late 1793 as: </p>
               <quote> ... a poet in some walks I do not know his equal — in the plaintive &amp; soft kinds — elegy &amp; sonnet for instance but this is
               not his only merit — epistles &amp; various other species he has handled with peculiar delicacy. I do not scruple to say that for
               elegance &amp; simplicity of versification I know no Author in our language that surpasses him. most probably we shall soon publish
               together. (Letter 76)</quote>
               <p>Lovell was, to Southey, more than an example of a good, modern poet. His presence seems to have spurred on Southey’s own literary
               ambitions. At the time of their meeting Lovell’s career was slightly more advanced – he was author of the soon-to-be-published <title level="m">Bristol, a Satire</title> – whereas Southey was barely recovering from the debacle of <title level="j">The
                  Flagellant</title> and the bankruptcy and death of his father. In 1794 it was Lovell who was pivotal in helping Southey establish
               links with publishers and booksellers in Bath and Bristol. It was Lovell who accompanied Southey to Bath on a visit to Richard
               Cruttwell, in order to ask him he if would publish their joint collection.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Cruttwell was also
                  the publisher of William Lisle Bowles, to whom he related the visit, see William Lisle Bowles, <title level="m">Scenes and Shadows
                     of Days Departed; a Narrative, Accompanied with Poems of Youth and Some Other Poems of Melancholy and Fancy In the Journey of
                     Life from Youth to Age</title> (London, 1837), p. xlv.</note> Moreover it was that ‘clever young man’ Lovell, who later in the
               same year, went to see Joseph Cottle and attempted to convert the publisher to Pantisocracy.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Cottle, <title level="m">Reminiscences of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey</title> (London, 1847), p. 2.
                  [Hereafter <title level="m">Reminiscences</title>.]</note> According to Cottle’s later account, Lovell seized the opportunity to
               read aloud from ‘the MS. poems of his two unknown friends, which at once established their genius in my estimation’.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title level="m">Reminiscences</title>, p. 4.</note> The ‘two ... friends’ were Southey and Coleridge; within weeks Lovell had
               brought them to Cottle’s shop and a crucial relationship in early Romanticism had been forged, one which led directly to the
               publication of Southey’s <title level="m">Joan of Arc</title>, to Coleridge’s collections of 1796 and 1797 and – eventually – to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>. </p>
               <p rend="indent1"> Southey’s creative partnership with Lovell was short-lived but important, a precursor to his more troubled relationship
               with Coleridge. The arrival of Coleridge in Bristol in summer 1794 marked a turning-point, and Lovell’s position as Southey’s
               first-choice collaborator was gradually eroded. His increasing lack of status was demonstrated in Coleridge and Southey’s decision to
               exclude his one-act contribution from the topical drama <title level="m">The Fall of Robespierre</title>. Coleridge was openly critical
               of Lovell’s abilities, informing Southey that he had ‘no <hi rend="ital">taste</hi> – or <hi rend="ital">simplicity</hi> of
                  feeling’.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Samuel Taylor Coleridge to Robert Southey, 11 December 1794, Griggs, I, p.
                  134.</note> In turn, Lovell did his best to undermine Coleridge’s standing, telling Southey that Coleridge had claimed a substantial
               share in writing <title level="m">Joan of Arc</title> (1796) (Letters 148 and 149). On hearing of his death in May 1796, Southey
               recorded that Lovell ‘had sunk much in my esteem’ (Letter 156). However, as his correspondence shows, in the coming years Southey tried
               to secure the financial positions of his widow and child, proposing a memorial edition, including his poems in the <title level="m">Annual Anthology</title> (1799) and <title level="m">Specimens of the Later English Poets</title>, and negotiating with Lovell’s
               family (for example, Letter 155). In spite of Southey’s growing disenchantment with Lovell, the evidence provided here indicates that
               at least in 1793-1794 Lovell was a crucial figure in making Southey realise his ambitions. </p>
               <lb/>
               <p>Lovell’s death in 1796 was but one of a series of losses. The years 1791-1797 were turbulent, as well as formative, for Southey. The
               letters published in Part One cover traumatic experiences such as his expulsion from Westminster School in 1792 and failure to gain
               admission to Christ Church, Oxford; the imprisonment of his father, for a friend’s debt, and his subsequent release and death; and
               Southey’s struggle between duty to his family, who expected him to follow a suitable profession, and his desire to be a poet. Key
               personal events in this period include his total estrangement from his formidable maiden aunt Elizabeth Tyler, who disapproved of
               Southey’s relationship with Edith Fricker; his secret marriage to Edith in November 1795; his first visit to Spain and Portugal in
               1795-1796; his friendship and alienation from Coleridge; the appearance of his earliest publications (including <title level="m">Poems</title> (1795) and <title level="m">Joan of Arc</title> (1796)); and the beginning in 1797 of his legal studies. The letters
               show Southey’s development into an adult and reveal patterns of behaviour that were to dominate his later life. In 1791 Southey was a
               boy, dependent on the financial good will of his bachelor uncle (Herbert Hill), by 1797 he was a married man, increasingly assuming the
               financial burdens of an extended family. </p>
               <p rend="indent1"> As the letters disclose, Southey was unsettled personally and professionally during 1791-1797. After the debacle of
                  <title level="j">The Flagellant</title> and his expulsion from school, he was shunned by erstwhile friends as if, he later
               explained, he were a ‘scabby sheep’.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 11 April 1805,
                  Kenneth Curry (ed.), <title level="m">New Letters of Robert Southey</title>, 2 vols (London and New York, 1965), I, p. 381.</note>
               The extreme sense of emotional dislocation engendered by this and by the near-disintegration of his family was matched by geographical
               rootlessness. The surviving letters from 1791-1797 reveal the beginning of a series of moves and relocations – particularly in the West
               Country and London - that only ceased when Southey and his family moved, reluctantly at first, to Greta Hall on the outskirts of
               Keswick in 1803. Southey’s lack of a settled home is balanced in his correspondence by friendship. The letters published here show the
               forging of lifelong connections with Grosvenor Charles Bedford, Charles Watkin Williams Wynn and Joseph Cottle. They chart the progress
               of an intense, but brief, relationship with Edmund Seward (who died suddenly in 1795), and trace the origins of his equally influential
               - but more troubled - relationship with Coleridge.</p>
               <p rend="indent1"> Southey’s letters map his personal and domestic upheaval onto a period of political turbulence. They provide crucial
               new insights into his early radicalism, and responses to major contemporary events such as the executions of Louis XVI, Marie
               Antoinette and Robespierre, the outbreak and progress of the war between England and France, and the repressive regime of William Pitt.
               They also make available fresh information about his friendships with individuals who did not share his radical beliefs, notably the
               rotten-borough monger Thomas Phillipps Lamb and Southey’s well-connected patron Charles Wynn, nephew of the foreign secretary Lord
               Grenville. A would-be poet from his earliest youth, it is not surprising that Southey’s political views translated into verse. The
               letters published here provide important poetic manifestations of his radicalism. Southey’s hatred of penal laws can be seen in the
               earliest surviving version of the ‘Botany-Bay Eclogue’ ‘Elinor’ (Letter 127); his love of political protest in ‘The Soldier’s Wife’ and
               the sonnet ‘Poor Wanderer of the Night!’ (Letter 127); his hatred of tyranny in the monodrama ‘Aristodemus’ (Letter 92); his disdain
               for the ‘spaniel fool’ ‘Man’, who ‘crouches down &amp; licks his tyrants hand/ And courts oppression’ in ‘To a College Cat’ (Letter
               181); and his rediscovery of the political inscription in ‘For a Column at Truxillo’ (Letter 170). The letters also draw attention to
               new additions to the Southey canon. They highlight the radical poems he published in newspapers: including ‘a seditious ode in the
               ludicrous stile addressed to the Cannibals’ which appeared under the republican pseudonym ‘Caius Gracchus’ (Letter 162).</p>
               <p rend="indent1"> As the sonnets, eclogues, monodramas, elegies, epic fragments and hundreds of lines of political and humorous verse
               sent to friends suggest, the letters published here show the coming into being of a literary career marked by eclecticism and
               experimentation. In 1791, Southey was a schoolboy versifier and imitator on a large scale. The classical models favoured at Westminster
               jostle for space in his correspondence with adaptations of Pope, Gray and Shenstone. However, as he moves beyond school and university
               days, classical allusions and adaptations fall away, and are replaced by other models, including Bowles and Akenside, and a significant
               new interest in comparative, post-Renaissance and contemporary European literature. Southey’s first visit to Spain and Portugal in
               1795-1796 emerges from his surviving correspondence as a turning-point. It allowed him to acquire two new languages (he became fluent
               in Spanish and Portuguese) and opened up to him new cultural territories. Southey’s linguistic and cultural encounter with the Iberian
               Peninsula was to shape the remainder of his working life. It mapped out textual lands that he was to colonise and exploit throughout
               his career, as poet, historian and translator. In so doing, it laid the foundations of Southey’s interest in international cultures and
               his participation in – and shaping of – British Romanticism as a globalised enterprise.</p>
               <p rend="indent1"> As well as providing important information about Southey’s developing literary preoccupations, the letters also contain
               significant new details on the writing and publication of <title level="m">Poems</title> (1795), <title level="m">Joan of Arc</title>
               (1796), <title level="m">Poems</title> (1797), <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</title>
               (1797), and his magazine and newspaper contributions. They allow us to date individual poems and collections more precisely and to
               learn more about the process of composition and revision. We discover that Southey routinely circulated drafts of his poems to close
               friends, including Grosvenor Charles Bedford and Robert Lovell, and that he also distributed writings by other members of his circle,
               including poems by Coleridge (Letter 96). Moreover, we learn that from the earliest stages of his career, Southey was a concerned
               professional, haggling over terms with and complaining about the work of slow and careless printers and typesetters (for example,
               Letter 278). He cared about the physical appearance of his writing, and was interested in the aesthetics of publication. He took an
               interest in typography and the quality of paper, and had special large copies of his works struck off for friends by Cottle (Letter
               252). He also had a strong visual sense. Convinced that ‘if a man<hi rend="strikethrough">s</hi> loves prints you have an excellent
               clue to his character’, Southey’s room at Balliol was adorned with engravings of the mythical Theban queen Niobe, the ‘Ruins of Rome’,
               the Byzantine general Belisarius, unfairly imprisoned by the Emperor Justinian, and Charles James Fox, a more contemporary political
               hero (Letter 189). He was well-acquainted with the works of the leading book illustrators and engravers of the time and was keen to
               have his earliest publications illustrated, suggesting Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg be approached for a frontispiece to the first
               edition of <title level="m">Joan of Arc</title> (Letter 132). The expense involved in commissioning artists proved prohibitive, and the
               illustrated editions did not materialise. </p>
               <p rend="indent1"> Southey’s published works were, though, to be illuminated in another way: by notes derived from his wide reading in
               world literatures. The letters published here shed light on his practice of annotation. They manifest in embryonic form the delight in
               antiquarian excavation and the collection of anecdotal information that were to be refined throughout his writing life, in particular
               in the notes to <title level="m">Joan of Arc</title>, <title level="m">Madoc</title>, <title level="m">Thalaba the Destroyer</title>
               (1801), <title level="m">The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810) and <title level="m">Roderick, The Last of the Goths</title> (1814).
               Letters 196 and 197 provide ‘authentic’ accounts of Southey’s visit to Aveline’s Hole, a cavern full of skeletons discovered near
               Burrington Combe, Somerset. In true antiquarian spirit, Letter 196 requests the readers of the <title level="j">Monthly
                  Magazine</title> write back, to ‘inform me, at what period these modes of sepulture were common’. Others record anecdotes about
               Richard Glover (Letter 179), or engage in public debates on the Welsh language (Letters 175, 185, 194). The letters also allow us for
               the first time to trace Southey’s reading, the researches that laid the foundations of his published writings. They show him buying
               books, often rare Spanish and Portuguese volumes, for his own growing collection (for example, Letters 229 and 240) and making use of
               libraries close to hand. The private collections he used included some ‘curious books’ belonging to the scandalous Lady Strathmore,
               Eleanor Bowes, caricatured by Gillray in c.1786 as suckling her cats in preference to her son (Letter 237). Other encounters were less
               esoteric. Here is Southey’s response to a visit to Dr Williams’s Library in London, 1797. His reason for going there was to hunt out
               books he regarded as essential for his revisions to the second edition of <title level="m">Joan of Arc</title>:</p>
               <quote>a hackney coach horse turned into a field of grass falls not more eagerly to a breakfast which lasts the whole day, than I attacked
               the <hi rend="strikethrough">fol</hi> old folios so respectably covered with dust. I begin to like dirty rotten binding, &amp; whenever
               I get among books pass by the gilt coxcombs &amp; <hi rend="strikethrough">yet</hi> disturb the spiders. — But you shall hear what I
               have got ... there are more treasures in this library — &amp; I go there again on Monday next. (Letter 278)</quote>
               <p>His account gives a sense of the excitement he found in research and of the prodigious labours that went into the notes that adorned
               many of his poems. </p>
               <p>This first part of <title level="m">The Collected Letters of Robert Southey</title> therefore makes available important new information
               about the early career, relationships and opinions of a writer who was to become one of the most controversial, high-profile and
               important figures in Romantic period culture. In doing so, it presses Southey’s claims as an author crucial to an understanding of the
               Romantic period and of the discourses of Romanticism – as a correspondent and commentator on the times, as an initiator of new genres,
               and as a participant in regional, national and global cultures. </p>

               <p>Robert Southey was born in Bristol in 1774 and died at his home on the outskirts of Keswick in 1843. The son of a bankrupt
					linen-draper, he was educated at Westminster School and Balliol College, Oxford, which he left without taking a degree. He
					published his first collection of poems in 1795 and in 1813 became Poet Laureate, a post he held until his death. Southey was a
					prolific and influential poet, essayist, historian, travel-writer, biographer, translator and polemicist, a dominant and
					controversial figure in British culture from the mid-1790s through to the mid-1830s. His highly experimental poetry, including the
					Islamic romance <title level="m">Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801), paved the way for writers such as Byron, Shelley, Thomas
					Moore and – later in the nineteenth century – Browning and Tennyson. His essays, histories and reviews articulated the issues
					confronting a period dominated by nascent imperialism and industrialisation, and his biographies, including the best-selling
						<title level="m">The Life of Nelson</title> (1813), participated in and helped to form a culture increasingly concerned with
					celebrity. Southey was, throughout his career, someone his contemporaries found impossible to ignore. His ambition and ability
					were widely acknowledged, with <title level="m">Madoc</title> (1805) praised as ‘the second heroic production in the English
					language’, the first being <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title>.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Anon., untitled review,
						<title level="j">Imperial Review</title>, 5 (1805), 465–73; reprinted in <title level="m">Robert Southey: the Critical
							Heritage</title>, ed. Lionel Madden (London, 1972), pp. 104–105 (p. 105).</note> Yet Southey was also the butt of satire and
					invective, his politics, poetry and prose attacked by opponents as diverse the <title level="j">Anti-Jacobin</title>, Byron,
					Hazlitt and Macaulay. <title level="m">The Collected Letters of Robert Southey</title> makes available for the first time
					complete, annotated, fully-searchable texts of all of the surviving correspondence of this complex individual. In so doing, it
					allows us to look anew at the writer described by Byron as ‘the only existing entire man of letters’.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Byron, <title level="j">Journal</title>, 22 November 1813; reprinted in Madden, p. 157.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Writing letters was an important part of Southey’s life. It was an activity that linked the youthful radical leader of the ‘New
					School’ with the older conservative Poet Laureate. Between 1791 and 1839 he corresponded with leading figures in cultural,
					political, and religious life in Britain, Europe and North America. About 7000 of his letters are extant, and of these just under
					3000 have never before been published. The surviving manuscripts are dispersed amongst over 200 individual, international
					archives: letters can be found in New York, London, Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), and Tomsk (Siberia), testimony both to the global
					reach of his correspondence and to Southey as an active participant in cosmopolitan, international cultural exchange. </p>
               <p rend="indent1"> The surviving letters written by Southey between 1791 and 1839 are immensely varied. They range from short notes of
					a couple of lines to huge epistles of several thousand words. Several early letters are entirely or largely in verse, whilst
					letters from all periods of his career include transcripts of his poems and other writings. Southey was a talented modern
					linguist: fluent in French, Spanish and Portuguese, and able to read German and Dutch. Most of his surviving letters are in
					English. However, a handful of letters written in French and Portuguese, and the liberal scattering throughout the correspondence
					of foreign languages, are evidence of his internationalism, his involvement in and shaping of a global Romanticism.</p>
               <p rend="indent1"> Southey’s earliest surviving letter dates from 1791, his last from 1839. In 1791 he was sixteen years old, a pupil
					at Westminster School in the heart of London. Southey’s time at Westminster brought him into contact with boys from radically
					different backgrounds, scions of rich, powerful families. The first letter in this edition provides evidence of the elite circles
					into which school friendships drew the young Southey. It was sent in 1791 to Thomas Phillipps Lamb, the father of a fellow
					Westminster pupil, Thomas Davis Lamb. Written in the aftermath of a vacation visit to the Lambs home in the Sussex town of Rye,
					the letter testifies to both Southey’s high regard for his hosts and the relative ease with which he was assimilated into a
					wealthy, politically influential, family. It is also evidence of the complexity of his connections. In 1791, Southey was a
					discontented schoolboy, eager to rebel against the established order. In contrast, Thomas Phillipps Lamb, his correspondent, was
					an establishment figure, MP for the town of Rye and supporter of the Prime Minister, William Pitt. </p>
               <p rend="indent1"> Southey’s final extant letter, to be published in Part Eight of this edition, also looks back to his youth – and to
					the enduring nature of some of his earliest friendships. It was sent on 6 September 1839 to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, younger
					brother of a Baronet and scion of an Anglo-Welsh, Whig political dynasty. Southey and Wynn had been friends since their schooldays
					at Westminster. This final letter is a poignant close to Southey’s epistolary career. Brief, written in an uncharacteristic,
					poorly-formed hand and accompanied by an apologetic note from his second wife Caroline, it provides eloquent testimony to the
					dementia that made letter writing or letter reading impossible for the final years of Southey’s life.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey and Caroline Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 6 September 1839¸ National Library of
						Wales, MS 4813D.</note> Its confusion is shared by other late letters, including one to the poet and civil servant Henry
					Taylor, which part-way through forgets the name and gender of its addressee and concludes with a salutation to Bertha, Southey’s
						daughter.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Henry Taylor, 27 July 1839¸ Bodleian Library, Oxford, Eng
						Lett d. 9, fol. 206.</note> No letters survive after late 1839 and by the time he died on 21 March 1843, Southey had long been
					dead to his correspondents.</p>
               <p rend="indent1"> The abrupt, tragic closing down of his correspondence in 1839 only throws into sharper relief the vitality and
					diversity of a lifetime of communication. Southey’s correspondents reflect his eclecticism and internationalism. They included
					family, friends, fellow writers, publishers, review editors, landlords, antiquarians, scientists, politicians, bishops,
					wine-merchants, people he had never met and – at times to his great irritation – autograph hunters. He exchanged letters and
					debated crucial issues of the day with prominent, sometimes equally controversial, figures, including: William Wilberforce, Thomas
					Clarkson, Humphry Davy, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, William Taylor, Percy Shelley, Walter Savage Landor, John
					Rickman, George Ticknor, Walter Scott, James Montgomery, Robert Bloomfield, Bernard Barton, Sir Robert Peel and the factory
					reformer Lord Shaftesbury. An active admirer of Mary Wollstonecraft and promoter of female literary endeavours, Southey
					corresponded with many women writers, including Caroline Bowles (who became his second wife), Anna Seward, Anna Eliza Bray,
					Margaret Holford Hodson, Maria Gowan Brooks, Mary Anne Watts Hughes, Amelia Opie, Mary Hays, and, most notoriously, Charlotte
					Brontë. Southey was a busy man, and the wide range of men and women he found the time to write to indicates what might be
					described as the promiscuous nature of his correspondence – his ability to write a letter to virtually anyone and everyone, on
					virtually every subject. It is also compelling evidence of the diversity of Romantic period letter-writing. </p>
               <p rend="indent1"> Southey wrote to individuals from very different walks of life and unsurprisingly the subject matter of his letters
					is extremely varied. It covers his domestic and professional lives, local matters and international affairs. It includes
					complaints about a difficult younger brother, tough financial negotiations with a publisher, regional events in Bristol or
					Keswick, and details of atrocities committed in Spain and Portugal during the Peninsular War. The letters give us access to the
					whole gamut of Southey’s experience, as we see him live through and respond to years of domestic, local, national and
					international upheaval. Here, for example, is Southey writing in December 1831 on the dangers to national well-being of a cholera
					epidemic:</p>
               <quote>What I look to with most apprehension is the moral effect that this pestilence may produce when it gets to such places as
					Carlisle, - still more in Manchester &amp; <hi rend="strikethrough">other such</hi> wherever there are such tremendous assemblages
					of human creatures in the most loathsome &lt;&amp; pitiable&gt; condition both as to their state of body &amp; of mind. It will
					spread far more rapidly among them, than it has done at Sunderland; &amp; in former visitations of pestilence – we know<del>
						xx</del> that the populace, seeing death before their eyes, &amp; by that present fear emancipated from all fear of human
					laws, have broken loose, set about plundering, &amp; taken their full swing in excesses of every kind.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Margaret Holford Hodson, 23 December 1831, Huntington Library, HM 2895.</note>
               </quote>
               <p>We see here the moralist and polemicist, the preacher against the evils of modernity and the sickness spread by industrialisation,
					urbanisation and democracy, a Southey familiar to the readers of both his <title level="m">Colloquies</title> and his essays in
					the <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title>. This is the man condemned by Macaulay as possessing in extraordinary measure ‘the
					faculty of believing without a reason, and the faculty of hating without a provocation.’<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Review of <title level="m">Sir Thomas More; or Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title> (1829), in <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title>, 50 (January 1830), 528.</note> Yet Southey is, as David Simpson has recently observed, fundamentally more ‘elusive’ and less given to
					‘wholeness’ than his peers.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">David Simpson, ‘Locating Southey’, <title level="j">Eighteenth-Century Studies</title>, 41.4 (2008), 566.</note> The stern moraliser is just one side of a complex character.
					Other letters disclose a playful friend or fond, anxious parent. Here is Southey writing in 1803 about his delight in his first
					child, born after nearly seven years of marriage:</p>
               <quote>Margaret in spite of a snub snout is grown out of her ugliness. &amp; has as good a face as one could wish for a child of 7
					months. take my last poems upon her. N.B. I call them all Effusions of a Father. </quote>
               <quote rend="indent3"> D.D. stands for Daughter Drivel</quote>
               <quote rend="indent4"> M.S. for Margaret Snivel.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 3
						April 1803; see Part 1, Letter 770.</note>
               </quote>
               <p>And here, is his anguished response, only some 4 months later, to Margaret’s death from hydrocephalus:</p>
               <quote>all is over &amp; poor Margaret in heaven ... I have forced myself to great &amp; unremitting exertions but the blow has gone
					to my very heart, &amp; made me often think those the happiest who have none but themselves to care for.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Thomas Southey, 29 August [1803]; see Part 2, Letter 832.</note>
               </quote>
               <p>Margaret’s death was a milestone. Southey and his wife immediately left their house in Bristol for Greta Hall, Keswick, then
					occupied by Edith’s sister Sara, her husband Samuel Taylor Coleridge and their three children. It was to become the Southeys’ home
					for the remainder of their lives. In exchanging Bristol for the Lakes, Southey left behind the city in which he had been born and
					spent much of his first three decades, a city which by 1803 had become a spectral place, haunted by the ghosts of a dead daughter,
					mother, cousin and father, and by the monitory shade of Thomas Chatterton, summoned up by the teenaged Southey in ‘Bristol
					Church-Yard’, one of his earliest surviving poems.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Bodleian Library, Oxford, MS Eng. Poet.
						e. 10.</note> In heading for the Lake District, Southey also left the city and the wider geographical region which had been at
					the very centre of his literary life, both as subject and as professional hub for his dealings with other writers, publishers,
					printers and booksellers. He literally put himself on the road to being tagged by his contemporaries as a member of the ‘Lake’
					school.</p>
               <p rend="indent1"> Southey’s correspondence brings him into sharper focus. It charts his reading, maps his changing views on politics
					and society, and describes his activities as a professional man of letters, including drafts of poems and prose works. The letters
					published here contain important evidence of the labour involved in writing. They remind us that extensive planning, research and
					writing lay behind many of Southey’s published works and contain ideas for ambitious projects (such as a tragedy on the martyrdom
					of Joan of Arc, poems on all the major world religions and multi-volume history of Portugal) that never materialised. As his
					‘cholera’ letter of 1831 reveals, in his private and public lives, Southey rarely pulled his punches. The letters contain violent
					denunciations of opponents, including Byron and Hazlitt, and a disturbingly detailed description of Shelley’s corpse, washed
					ashore in Italy. It was, Southey noted, ‘much mutilated ... [t]he fish had half devoured it’.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to Bernard Barton, 26 November 1822, Kenneth Curry (ed.), <title level="m">New Letters of Robert

               </p>
               <p>Southey’s peripatetic early life ensured that he did not establish regular habits of letter writing. He seems to have adapted the
					composition of letters to suit his circumstances, writing both in solitude and in company and, on occasions, jointly composing a
					letter with a family member or friend. This irregularity did not last. After his move to Keswick in 1803, letter writing became a
					more regularised, solitary occupation, pursued in Southey’s study at Greta Hall. Yet the impossibility of entirely separating his
					correspondence from the rest of the household is witnessed by the traces left, on the manuscripts that survive, by other people
					and other aspects of his life. These include playful deletions or insertions in the hand of his first wife Edith; and even the
					paw-prints of a kitten walking over a letter before the ink had dried. Southey was, fortunately for the kitten, very fond of cats,
					in a letter of 1801 decrying the nefarious conduct of a ‘Cat eater’, a man who had recently devoured ‘a large Tom Cat alive’.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, [29 September 1801]; see Part 2, Letter 609.</note>

					whole of the hours after that meal being dedicated to his correspondence ... At that period, the post ... reached Keswick about
					six or seven in the evening. And so pointedly regular was Southey in all his habits, that, short as the time was, all letters were
					answered on the same evening which brought them.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Lake Reminiscences, from 1807 to 1830. By the English

               </quote>
               <p>The manuscripts of his letters bear inevitable traces of these evening sessions: those from the 1820s and 1830s are often written
					in a cramped hand and stained by wax or tallow from dripping candles. </p>
               <p rend="indent1"> In spite of the pressure of time, Southey took great pains over what was an important channel of communication with
					friends, family and professional associates. This was a quality recognised by Thackeray, who praised the ‘goodness and purity’ of
					Southey’s ‘private letters’.<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">‘The Four Georges. Sketches of Manners, Morals, Court, and Town Life.  IV.
						George the Fourth’, <title level="j">Cornhill Magazine</title>, 2 (October 1860), 401–2.</note> Yet it is important to remember that Southey was the product of an
					epistolary culture and that for him letter writing had private and public, domestic and professional dimensions. His letters could
					be private documents, sent to friends and family and intended to be read by the recipient and perhaps a close family circle. Yet
					they could also be public texts, available for wider consumption. From the outset of his career, Southey was keen to ‘correspond
					with the world’.<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to Horace Walpole Bedford, 12 June 1796, see Part 1, Letter
						160.</note> He wrote to newspapers and periodicals, sometimes, though not always, adopting a pseudonym, and commenting on
					politics and culture. His signed newspaper letters could spark public controversy. In 1799, for example, he became entangled in a
					debate with Sir Herbert Croft over the latter’s exploitation of the papers of Thomas Chatterton. On 5 January 1822, he took on an
					even more formidable opponent, Byron, in the pages of <title level="j">The Courier</title>. His advice to Byron ‘When he attacks
					me again let it be in rhyme’, did not quite have the effect intended.<note n="17" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to

               </p>
               <p rend="indent1"> For Southey, though, the public letter was not just restricted to ephemeral publications such as periodicals and
					newspapers. His first published prose work, <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and
						Portugal</title> (1797), exploited the public, literary potential of correspondence. It made use of letters Southey had
					written to friends during his time in the Iberian peninsula, blurring the boundaries between private and public
						correspondence.<note n="19" place="foot" resp="editors">For example, compare Robert Southey to Joseph Cottle, [February-March
						1796?], Part 1, Letter 148, with Robert Southey, <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and
							Portugal</title> (Bristol, 1797), pp. 317, 368-370.</note>
                  <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence</title> went into two revised editions, in 1799 and 1808, though
					Southey’s plan to write a sequel based on his second visit to Portugal in 1800-1801 came to nothing. In 1807 he returned to the
					epistolary travel book in a slightly different guise, publishing <title level="m">Letters from England</title> under the pseudonym
					of Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella. <title level="m">Letters from England</title>, which tapped into literary fashion, and into a
					culture keen to consume correspondence, was one of Southey’s best-selling publications.</p>
               <p rend="indent1"> As he grew older, Southey’s sense of his own letters, including those intended only for private consumption, as
					potentially public documents and as an integral part of his legacy to posterity increased. It was a complex realisation. It could
					provide him with the – somewhat self-righteous – solace that his political and cultural judgements would be vindicated in the long
					term. As Southey explained to Caroline Bowles, his correspondence with Shelley would, when published, expose Byron and his
					biographer Thomas Medwin as ‘impudent’ liars.<note n="20" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Caroline Bowles, 26
						November 1824, Edward Dowden (ed.), <title level="m">The Correspondence of Robert Southey with Caroline Bowles</title> (Dublin
						and London, 1881), p. 75. [Hereafter Dowden.]</note> Yet his letters, especially their potential for manipulation by the
					unscrupulous, could also be a cause of anxiety.</p>
               <p rend="indent1"> Southey was well aware of his contemporaries’ fascination with the lives of others, acknowledging that anyone who
					wanted to keep their private life private was fighting a losing battle and that ‘in these days nothing can be kept from the joint
					demands of cupidity and curiosity’.<note n="21" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Joseph Cottle, 30 September 1836,
							<title level="m">New Letters</title>, II, p. 457.</note> Yet his own relationship to this culture of consumption was
					deeply ambiguous. He was, after all, both a ‘personality’ and an editor of the correspondence of others. In particular, his work
					on a biography and edition of William Cowper, brought him face to face with how a writer’s correspondence could be manipulated.
					Southey was proud that his life of Cowper had made extensive use of the poet’s ‘unpublished letters’ and in so doing ‘brought much
					to life which Hayley was not allowed to make known, and of which none of his biographers knew any thing’. He not merely published
					new information about Cowper, he also reinstated passages in individual letters that had ‘formerly been withheld’.<note n="22" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to William Peachey, 16 May 1836, <title level="m">New Letters</title>, II, p. 454.
						Not all of Southey’s contemporaries agreed with his treatment of Cowper. An anonymous reviewer in <title level="j">The
							Christian Observer</title>, 429 (1837), p. 610 described his ‘detailed account of Cowper’s attempted suicide’ as
						‘revolting’ and accused Southey of lacking ‘good taste and right feeling’ and ‘thinking of little but of literature and
						entertainment’.</note> Yet any sense of him as a modern scholarly editor needs to be tempered with the realisation that
					Southey believed not everything in a writer’s life could be revealed – that some information needed to be suppressed and that
					editorial intervention was necessary. In the case of Cowper, this included correspondence relating to the poet’s belief that he
					was an androgyne.<note n="23" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 6 November 1835, <title level="m">New Letters</title>, II, pp. 430–431.</note>
               </p>
               <p rend="indent1"> Southey lived long enough to be in the potentially uncomfortable position of having both his own private letters
					and letters written to or about him appear in print during his own lifetime. In the 1830s, his concerns surfaced over the handling
					of the correspondence and literary remains of Coleridge, who had died in 1834. Southey knew that Coleridge had frequently attacked
					him in letters, both to himself and to others. The possible publication of Coleridge’s correspondence was therefore of
					considerable concern to him. He cautioned Coleridgean memoirists such as Joseph Cottle against publishing all they knew and also
					kept in reserve copies of Coleridge’s letters and his own to use ‘for my own vindication’ if the need arose.<note n="24" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Joseph Cottle, 26 February 1836, <title level="m">New Letters</title>, II, pp.
						442-443. See also, Lynda Pratt, ‘The Media of Friends or Foes? Unpublished Letters from Joseph Cottle to Robert Southey,
						1834-1837’, <title level="j">Modern Language Review</title>, 98 (2003), 545-562.</note> His ultimate powerlessness in the case
					of Coleridge was reflected in the treatment meted out to other Southeyan correspondences. In 1838 Robert and Samuel Wilberforce
					published a life of their father, which contained tactlessly edited versions of Southey’s letters to the abolitionist.<note n="25" place="foot" resp="editors">R.I. Wilberforce and S. Wilberforce, <title level="m">The Life of William Wilberforce</title>
						(London, 1838).</note> The Poet Laureate was not amused. As he explained to Henry Crabb Robinson:</p>
               <quote> So little consideration is shewn in publications of this kind, that no one knows what mischief may arise from trusting any
					letters out of his own keeping. The Wilberforces have printed an extract from a letter of mine to their father in which the last
					Vicar of this place is spoken of in terms of great disparagement. His daughters are our next door neighbours, and we are of
					necessity and of good will also upon neighbourly terms with them. Now they will be very much wounded if they happen to see this
					book, which but for this circumstance, I should as a matter of course have lent them – yet it is hardly possible that they should
					not see it. And tho I have said nothing but what was perfectly true, they will be very much wounded, and I am as much annoyed as I
					can allow myself to be by any thing in which I do not feel myself to blame.<note n="26" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey
						to Henry Crabb Robinson, 17 June 1838, <title level="m">New Letters</title>, II, pp. 475-476.</note>
               </quote>
               <p>As his reaction to the Wilberforces’ book reveals, by the late 1830s, Southey was aware that it was impossible to control the
					public’s appetite for consuming his life and letters. He resolved to manage his own posterity. In the case of his poems, Southey
					took charge , ‘setting ... [his literary] house in order’ and publishing a ten-volume collected edition.<note n="27" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Mrs Septimus Hodson, 1 March 1837, <title level="m">New Letters</title>, II, p. 466.</note>
					His letters presented a different dilemma. The future editing and publication of his massive correspondence was entrusted to a
					friend and disciple, the poet and civil servant Henry Taylor, whom Southey named as his literary executor and official biographer.
					The intention was that Taylor would supervise the construction of Southey’s posthumous reputation, collecting letters and
					recollections from family and friends and writing an authorized life. However, all this careful planning came to nothing. On 4
					June 1839 Southey married Caroline Bowles. Shortly afterwards, his health, which had been declining for some time, completely
					collapsed. As a result, a train of events was set in motion that ruined these well-laid plans, wrecking Southey’s attempts to
					manage his posterity. </p>

               </p>
               <p>Southey’s union with Bowles proved to be extremely controversial, splitting his children and friends into bitterly opposed
					factions. Hostilities did not cease with the Poet Laureate’s death on 21 March 1843. In the period immediately following, the
					feuding between the pro- and anti-Bowles camps intensified to an extent that Henry Taylor’s position soon became untenable. Having
					tried and failed to get cooperation from the warring factions, Taylor resigned his post. With his departure went any plans for an
					official life of the late Poet Laureate.<note n="28" place="foot" resp="editors">For the impact of family feuding on Southey’s
						posthumous remains and his reputation see Lynda Pratt, ‘Family Misfortunes? The Posthumous Editing of Robert Southey’, in
							<title level="m">Robert Southey and the Contexts of English Romanticism</title>, ed. Lynda Pratt (Aldershot, 2006), pp.
						219-238.</note> The result was textual chaos: competing editions of poetry, prose and correspondence produced by family
					members who were often not on speaking terms with one another. The poetical remains were divided between Southey’s son-in-law
					Herbert Hill and widow. In 1845 Hill published an edition of the unfinished North American tale <title level="m">Oliver Newman and
						Other Poems</title>, which pointedly failed to mention the second Mrs Southey. Caroline Bowles responded with <title level="m">Robin Hood: A Fragment</title> (1847), emphasising her ‘intellectual union’ with the late Poet Laureate.<note n="29" place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline Southey and Robert Southey, <title level="m">Robin Hood: A Fragment</title> (London,
						1847), p. viii.</note> The mammoth task of collecting, selecting and publishing the surviving letters split along similarly
					factional lines: divided between John Wood Warter, Southey’s son-in-law and Bowles’s chief supporter, and Cuthbert Southey, the
					Poet Laureate’s only surviving son and bastion of the anti-Bowles faction.</p>
               <p rend="indent1"> In 1849-1850, Cuthbert published a six volume <title level="m">Life and Correspondence</title> of his father,
					linking selections from Southey’s letters with a biographical commentary. It is a highly problematic edition. Cuthbert not only
					misdated many letters, but in order to sanitise what he believed to be the less palatable aspects of his father’s career and
					opinions, he, as was customary practice at the time, censored his source materials. His silent deletions covered Southey’s private
					and public lives, his views on politics and on literature. For example, he passed over Southey’s marriage to Bowles, whom Cuthbert
					loathed, and removed personal observations about friends and family, including incautious comments on the ‘crazy humours’ of
					Charles Lamb and a description of Wordworth’s letter to Mathetes as ‘a ... {mouthful} of moonshine’.<note n="30" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to John Rickman, 17-21 January 1810; see Part 4, Letter 1734.</note> He also
					silently removed passages indicative of political extremism, censoring both Southey’s earlier radicalism and his later unguarded
					comments against the freedom of the press. A letter to John Rickman of 11 February 1806 was published by Cuthbert without its
					opening paragraph, describing Southey’s response to the death in office of the Prime Minister and the proposal to erect a public
					monument to him:</p>
               <quote>If it had pleased God to send William Pitt to the Devil in the year 1790 – but better late than never. And so the wise people
					of England are going to record their own infatuation upon marble – as if paper &amp; printers-ink would not sufficiently preserve
					the memory of it to posterity!<note n="31" place="foot" resp="editors">See Part 3, Letter 1155.</note>
               </quote>
               <p>Cuthbert similarly glossed over cultural politics, omitting a description of the ‘lyer’ Byron and his sharking biographer Thomas
					Medwin from a letter of 1824: ‘In his Lordship there were the motives of envy, hatred &amp; malice at work. Evil passions
					possessed him. But this fellow [ie. Medwin] has no other impulse than the desire of gain’.<note n="32" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to John Rickman, 9 November 1824, Huntington Library, HM RS 454.</note>
               </p>
               <p rend="indent1"> Cuthbert’s edition is partial in other ways. Circumscribed by the family feud, he had access only to a fraction of
					the voluminous surviving correspondence, and could see only the letters sent to individuals who were on his side of the dispute.
					This meant that whilst he was able to call on letters sent to John Rickman, Sharon Turner, Walter Scott, Coleridge, Wordsworth,
					and the family of Henry Kirke White, he could not use those to other important figures in Southey’s life and career such as
					Charles Danvers, John King, Mary Barker and Anna Eliza Bray. The result was an incomplete sense of the range of Southey’s contacts
					– the sense of a part rather than a whole life.</p>
               <p rend="indent1"> The same problem also affected a second, rival edition: John Wood Warter’s four-volume <title level="m">Selections
						from the Letters of Robert Southey</title>, published in 1856. Warter was able to draw upon some of the major correspondences
					that Cuthbert had been refused access to, including those with Danvers and Mary Barker. Warter’s edition did not overlap with
					Cuthbert’s, rather it set out to be different: providing a completely new selection of Southey letters, minus any of Cuthbert’s
					biographical interpolations. By the time he came to work on the <title level="m">Selections</title>, Warter was, in fact, an old
					hand at editing Southey, having produced editions in 1847 of the final two volumes of <title level="m">The Doctor</title> and in
					1849-1850 of the <title level="m">Common-Place Books</title>. His experience showed. His text is, as a rule, more accurate and
					reliable than Cuthbert’s. However, this does not mean that he reproduced everything he saw on the manuscript page. Even Warter was
					capable of editorial intervention and he made countless minor, cosmetic changes to Southey’s prose, altering punctuation and word
					order at will. More seriously, he occasionally - and silently - removed passages from letters. Most of his omissions were
					connected to family matters, or to persons still living. A letter of 25 October 1834 was published without a section describing
					the mental health of Southey’s first wife, Edith, then confined in The Retreat at York:</p>
               <quote>The accounts from York are hopeful. But a considerable time must elapse before bodily functions which have been very long
					deranged can be set right by any curative treatment. <hi rend="strikethrough">xxx</hi> such treatment being necessarily slow in
					producing any perceptible effect.<note n="33" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to John Rickman, 25 October 1834,
						Huntington Library, HM RS 674.</note>
               </quote>
               <p>The omission was not surprising, given that Warter was married to Edith’s eldest daughter. Nevertheless, it undermined the textual
					integrity of Southey’s original letter.</p>
               <p rend="indent1"> Warter was a vocal and capable supporter of Caroline Bowles. He inherited her papers after her death in 1854 and
					his commitment to her reputation was such that he planned to edit a selection of the correspondence exchanged by her and
						Southey.<note n="34" place="foot" resp="editors">John Wood Warter (ed.), <title level="m">Selections from the Letters of Robert Southey</title>, 4 vols (London, 1856), I, p. [v].</note> He died before this could be completed, and the project was taken up by
					Edward Dowden, author of the biography of Southey in the ‘English Men of Letters’ series. In 1881 Dowden published a selected
					edition of <title level="m">The Correspondence of Robert Southey and Caroline Anne Bowles</title>, some 199 letters exchanged
					between April 1818 and January 1838. A further five letters between Southey and Shelley were included in an Appendix. Dowden’s
					edition is unique, as the only attempt so far to see a Southeyan correspondence in the round by publishing both sides. It also
					made a case for Bowles’s own writing as ‘worthy of remembrance’ and for the importance to Southey of their creative exchange.
						<note n="35" place="foot" resp="editors">Dowden, p. xiii.</note> Dowden was, though, highly selective. He included about
					‘half’ of the surviving letters and displayed sensitivity to surviving participants in the family feud by excluding entirely any
					letters exchanged during the controversial period of Southey and Bowles’s courtship and engagement. It was not that he had no
					letters to select from – evidence of the letters Southey wrote to Bowles during this key period in their relationship can be found
					in an account sent by Bowles to Anna Eliza Bray – but rather that he chose not to include any.<note n="36" place="foot" resp="editors">Bowles’ account survives only as a copy in another hand, West Sussex Record Office, Bray Papers, Box 3, ‘Copy
						of Autobiographical Narrative of Mrs. Southey’.</note>
               </p>
               <p rend="indent1"> The publication of Southey’s correspondence was not limited to the editions of Cuthbert, Warter or Dowden. From the
					mid-nineteenth century onwards, individual or groups of Southey letters appeared on a fairly regular basis, scattered amongst
					autobiographies, biographies, memoirs and accounts of his contemporaries, including Charlotte Brontë, Anna Eliza Bray, Humphry
					Davy, Charles Lloyd, James Montgomery, Henry Taylor, William Taylor and Alaric Watts. Letters, or fragments of letters, also found
					their way into the footnotes of editions of the letters of Coleridge.<note n="37" place="foot" resp="editors">For example,

               </p>
               <p rend="indent1"> This dispersal of the published correspondence continued into the twentieth century. The importance of the letters
					of Southey’s direct contemporaries Coleridge and Wordsworth was recognised and enshrined with the appearance of major scholarly
					editions. There was, however, no attempt to do the same for Southey and to publish all his correspondence in one place. This does
					not mean that the letters were neglected entirely, rather that Southey’s liminal position in the twentieth century Romantic canon
					was seen not as justifying a collected edition. Instead, letters continued to appear in scattered publications. In 1960 Adolfo
					Cabral included 63 letters in his edition of Southey’s <title level="m">Journals of a Residence in Portugal 1800-1801 and a Visit
						to France 1838</title>. Only 22 of these had previously been unpublished, the remaining 41 were reprinted directly from the
					problematic editions of Cuthbert Southey and Warter. A more substantial attempt to fill in the blanks left by unpublished or
					bowdlerised letters was made in 1965, when Kenneth Curry published a two-volume <title level="m">New Letters of Robert
						Southey</title>. This comprised 497 letters covering Southey’s entire writing life – beginning in 1792 and ending in 1838. It
					included both letters published for the first time and complete versions of ones previously censored by interventionist editors
					such as Joseph Cottle or Cuthbert Southey. Curry, the leading Southey scholar of the mid-twentieth century, also stated the case
					for the centrality of the correspondence for an understanding of the man and his writing, arguing ‘it is there that [one] will
					find the whole range of Southey’s life and career’.<note n="38" place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title level="m">New Letters</title>, I, p. [xi].</note> Another new edition followed in 1976, when Charles Ramos edited a
					group of 170 letters sent by Southey to his friend John May. Both Curry and Ramos’s editions added to knowledge of Southey, but
					they were also both highly selective. Ramos used only the collection of letters from Southey to May held in the University of
					Texas, Austin, and not the parts of their correspondence scattered in other archives throughout the world. Curry, meanwhile,
					admitted that at least 2000 Southey letters still remained unpublished and that several hundreds more were available only in
					unreliable texts. <note n="39" place="foot" resp="editors">Kenneth Curry, ‘The Published Letters of Robert Southey: A Checklist’,
							<title level="j">Bulletin of the New York Public Library</title>, 71.1 (1967), pp. 158-164.</note> This selectivity was
					undoubtedly dictated by Southey’s non-canonical status and it continued for the remainder of the twentieth century. In the three
					decades since the publication of Ramos, further letters have appeared in isolated journal articles, including essays by Lynda
					Pratt, Elisa Beshero-Bondar, and Martine Braekman.<note n="40" place="foot" resp="editors">See for example, Elisa Beshero-Bondar,

							Southey and the Contexts of English Romanticism</title> (2007).</note> Alongside the stirrings of this Southeyan critical
					renaissance has come the acknowledgement of the need for scholarly editions of Southey’s poetry, prose and correspondence. Those
					editions are now being produced and it is becoming once more possible to read him. The nine-volume <title level="m">Poetical
						Works</title> is helping to revolutionise understanding of Southey the poet.<note n="43" place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <title level="m">Robert Southey: Poetical Works, 1793-1810</title>, gen. ed. Lynda Pratt, 5 vols
						(London, 2004); and Robert Southey <title level="m">Later Poetical Works, 1811-1838</title>, gen. eds Tim Fulford
						and Lynda Pratt, 4 vols (London, 2012).</note> We hope that the <title level="m">Collected Letters</title>
					will do the same for the correspondence. The letters published here restore wholeness to this most fragmented of Romantic period
					writers, providing accurate texts of letters that were previously unpublished or available only in censored versions. Taken
					individually and as a whole, the letters reveal a more complete picture of Southey’s life, literary relationships, opinions on
					politics and society and development as a writer. Southey emerges from his correspondence as a consummate – even an ‘entire’ – man
					of letters, intimately involved in the culture of his time. <title level="m">The Collected Letters</title> therefore both
					contributes to what can be called the new Southey criticism and provides the primary material by which future scholars can take
					that criticism in important fresh directions. </p>

                  <hi rend="bold">Introduction</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <title>Part Five</title> collects, in one place for the first time, the surviving letters written by Robert Southey between 1816 and
               1818. It follows the editorial conventions described in About this Edition and contains newly transcribed, fully annotated texts of 537
               letters drawn from archives in the United Kingdom, Europe and North America. Of these, 341 are published for the first time, with a
               further 51 published here in full for the first time. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">The letters brought together in this edition begin on 2 January 1816 with an account of Southey’s latest task as Poet
               Laureate (the composition of a New Year’s Ode) and his progress on a topical new poem, <title>The Poet’s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title>
               (Letter 2690). They conclude on New Year’s Eve 1818 with a letter that combines news of Southey’s family and friends in the Lake
               District with a description of his labours for the <title>Quarterly Review</title> (Letter 3227). The letters in between contain
               reflections on a massive variety of subjects – literary and non-literary, public and private, local and global. They make available a
               great deal of new information about Southey’s views on literature, politics, religion and society; his work as Poet Laureate and
               engagement in public life and public controversy; his relationships with his contemporaries; his domestic life in Keswick; his extended
               family and social networks; his extensive reading; his working practices; his prolific output of poetry and prose; and his interactions
               with publishers and negotiation of the literary marketplace. They reveal Southey’s agonised response to the death of his son in April
               1816: ‘how large a part of my hopes &amp; happiness will be laid in the grave with Herbert’ (Letter 2757). They show how the
               announcement, in autumn 1818, of Edith Southey’s eighth, and final, pregnancy only confirmed Southey in his conviction that his loss
               was ‘irreparable’ and the new baby could not replace ‘that incomparable boy’ (Letters 3203). They demonstrate how Southey used his
               influence to assist the careers of others, recruiting William Wilberforce’s help in an attempt to gain a consulship at Maranhão,
               Brazil, for Henry Koster (Letter 3168), for example, and providing £10 from his own purse and raising money from Samuel Rogers and Earl
               Spencer to fund the impoverished young poet Herbert Knowles’s studies at Cambridge University (Letters 2855, 2858, 2866, 2879 and
               2887). The letters also touch on other matters of interest and concern to Southey, including tea drinking (Letter 3030); cats (Letter
               3031); the impact of the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora on the world’s climate, fauna and flora (Letter 3056); the outbreak of typhus
               in the town of Keswick (Letter 3115); the discovery, by one of the Southey daughters, of an ancient bronze spear head on the slopes of
               Skiddaw (Letter 3117); the offer of the post of Librarian at the Society of Advocates, which Southey refused (Letter 3148); the chaotic
               relationship between William Wilberforce and his servants (Letter 3204); and the increasing rarity of bitterns in the Lake District, a
               scarcity not helped by the actions of a visiting Cambridge undergraduate, who shot, killed and ate one (Letter 3033). </p>
               <p rend="indent1">The 537 letters published here are proof that Southey remained a vigorous and indefatigable correspondent in mid life,
               even though the demands on his time were increasing apace. <title>Part Five</title> sees the continuation of established
               correspondences with friends and colleagues, including Mary Barker, Grosvenor Bedford, Andrew Bell, Joseph Cottle, John Wilson Croker,
               James Montgomery, John Murray, John Rickman, William Wilberforce, William Wordsworth and Charles Wynn. It provides compelling evidence
               of how the number and range of networks in which Southey was involved continued to expand in tandem with his personal and professional
               commitments. In 1817, for example, he wrote to the Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool (Letter 2947). Other new correspondents in this
               period include the ambitious young writers Caroline Bowles, Herbert Knowles and Chauncey Hare Townshend; the churchman John Jebb; the
               antiquarian Dawson Turner; the American inventor Horatio Gates Spafford; and, last but not least, Samuel Rogers and Helen Maria
               Williams, both established figures in the literary world. Moreover, although 537 letters by Southey survive from this period, letter
               fragments and references within surviving letters to ones that are now lost are reminders of the selective nature of any edition such
               as this and of the contingencies of literary history. What we have here are the remains of a much larger output. Southey’s letters to
               Coleridge, Peter Elmsley, Charles Lamb, Sharon Turner and William Wordsworth exist only in part, while other correspondences have been
               lost entirely and can now only be glimpsed in letters sent to others. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">In January 1816 Southey was forty-one years old and an established, though controversial, writer. He had been married
               since 1795 and fathered seven children, five of whom were still living – Edith May, Herbert, Bertha, Kate and Isabel. He had been
               resident at Greta Hall, on the outskirts of the market town of Keswick, since autumn 1803, though he had made occasional forays from
               home, touring the continent, for example, in autumn 1815. This pattern of Lake District residence punctuated by periods of travel was
               to continue throughout the later 1810s. His longest and most ambitious tour of the period took place in May–August 1817, when Southey
               journeyed through France, Switzerland, Italy, Germany and the Low Countries, accompanied by his friends, the artist Edward Nash and the
               landowner Humphrey Senhouse. Southey’s life was not, however, as ‘regular’ and ‘monotonous’ an existence as this might suggest (Letter
               3088). His 1817 continental tour, though a private undertaking, generated public controversy over what Southey had seen – or not seen –
               written in the visitors’ book at Montanvert, and the resulting row over the so-called ‘Atheist’ inscription inflamed his already
               antagonistic relationship with Percy Shelley (Letter 3004). Moreover, family tragedy and economic changes were to make Southey’s
               residence at Greta Hall less than secure. The death of his nine-year-old son in April 1816 made Southey long to escape from a house and
               landscape haunted by the child’s presence: the ‘wound will never close while I remain’ in ‘this country’ (Letter 2757). Although he
               eventually decided to stay put, the bankruptcy of his landlord in 1817 and uncertainty over the future ownership of the property
               threatened Southey’s continued tenancy of his home (Letter 2961). </p>
               <p rend="indent1">In 1816–1818 Southey was concerned – as he had been earlier in his career – with the local, national and international.
               His travels, documented in long letters to family and friends and in a journal, opened up new places, led to meetings with, amongst
               others, the writer and expert on Latin America Alexander Humboldt, and the educational reformer Johann Pestalozzi, and supplied fresh
               gossip about Princess Caroline, estranged wife of the Prince Regent, whose ‘infamous’ conduct bore comparison ‘in history with
               Messalina and Joan of Naples’ (Letter 3003). Foreign journeys also allowed Southey to indulge his book-buying habit and to enrich
               further the shelves of his substantial library. His letters anxiously track the progress of the volumes purchased on his 1817 tour and
               reveal that Southey enlisted the help of the London banker Nathan Meyer Rothschild to ensure they were safely conveyed back to Britain
               (Letter 3003). Moreover, even when he was at home in Keswick and hard at work, Southey was not cut off from the wider world. His
               voracious and wide reading in multiple languages, and his writing on a huge range of topics (from the history of Brazil to poems for
               his children) brought the world within the walls of his study. In the hours not spent at his desk, he socialised with prominent Keswick
               families, such as the Speddings of Mirehouse, and with local magnates such as the Earl of Lonsdale. In addition, Southey’s professional
               reputation brought an increasing stream of visitors, national and international, welcome and unwelcome, to his door. Between 1816 and
               1818 these included the publishers John Murray and William Blackwood, who arrived together in Murray’s carriage. Southey could not
               afford such a vehicle and he commented waspishly on this as yet another indication of ‘Maximus Murray’s’ increasingly grand manner
               (Letter 3187). It also, of course, said much about the publisher’s financial standing and professional success. Overseas visitors
               included Samuel Heinrich Spiker, Librarian to the King of Prussia. Spiker, in his account of the meeting, marvelled at Southey’s
               library of ‘between 3 and 4000 volumes of the most select works in the Spanish and Portuguese languages, in the departments of history,
               statistics, and voyages, and travels’ and described ‘the pleasant evening I passed in Mr. Southey’s family, as one of the most happy
               sections’ of his tour of the United Kingdom.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Samuel Heinrich Spiker (1786–1858), <title>Travels
                     in England, Wales, and Scotland in the Year 1816</title>, 2 vols (London, 1820), I, pp. 270, 272.</note> Other welcome guests
               included, in 1817, the factory owner and social reformer Robert Owen, ‘a very interesting personage … full of plans for the poor’, and
               the Harvard professor Edward Everett, the ‘most interesting person whom we have as yet seen this summer’ (Letters 2859, 2908, 3191).
               Southey’s letters do more than just describe these occasions and individuals. Many of the links he forged with his visitors had been
               initiated, and were to be sustained in the future, via letter writing. His letters are thus evidence of the central role played by
               correspondence in Romantic period social networking. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">Southey often expressed relief when the ‘succession of company’ was over, when he could settle, as he explained in
               November 1817: </p>
               <quote>… to my winters work, with the probability of as few interruptions from without, as Bruin has when he rolls himself up in his cave,
               &amp; trusts to his paws till the spring. (Letter 3034)</quote>
               <p>As his letters reveal, Southey was as busy as ever in 1816–1818. His literary output continued to be prolific and diverse, covering
               domestic and international subjects, current affairs and the recent and the distant past. He contributed regularly to the
                  <title>Quarterly Review</title> and laboured on the <title>History of Brazil</title>, the second volume of which appeared in 1817.
               He produced an edition of Malory’s <title>Morte d’ Arthur</title>, entitled <title>The Byrth, Lyf, and Actes of Kyng Arthur</title>
               (1817), and brought out fresh editions of his long poems <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> and <title>Roderick, the Last of the
                  Goths</title>. He continued to compose new poems, including the annual odes required of him as Poet Laureate and topical longer
               pieces such as <title>The Poet’s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> and <title>The Lay of the Laureate</title>, both published in 1816.
               Southey also accepted occasional commissions to write poems, including, in 1818, an epitaph for Ralph Broome, the nephew of his old
               friend James Burney and the novelist Fanny Burney (Letter 3070). He refused, however, numerous uninvited solicitations for verses.
               These included one of 1817 from an individual identified only as ‘N.T.P.’, who had importuned Southey to </p>
               <quote>… compose an acrostic for the writer to express his passion for Rebecca, a rival having lately got a head of him in consequence of
               having addressed some verses to the object of their affections … (Letter 3016)</quote>
               <p>‘N.T.P.’s request was accompanied by 20 shillings, which Southey gave to charity. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">A high profile figure since the mid 1790s, Southey retained his appetite for controversy and, in his writings, engaged
               with acutely topical and contentious issues, including the need for effective censorship of the radical press, which attracted the
               opprobrium and ridicule of contemporaries such as Leigh Hunt and William Hazlitt. His letters reflect and provide new information about
               the disputes in which he was embroiled. They make it possible, for example, to track in detail Southey’s reaction to the <title>Wat
                  Tyler</title> furore, including his attempt to seek restitution by recourse to the law. They also refine current understanding of
               Southey’s reaction to being confronted, publicly, with the ghost of his radical youth. It has long been assumed that in spring 1817
               Southey responded to the <title>Wat Tyler</title> affair by publishing a letter in the <title>Courier</title> on 17 March 1817.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">This belief almost certainly arose because of Cuthbert Southey’s handling of the letter to the
                  Editor of the <title>Courier</title>, which he misdated 17 March 1817 (see Letter 2946 of our edition). Cuthbert published this in
                  the main run of letters dealing with the furore over <title>Wat Tyler</title> and while he did not explicitly indicate the letter
                  had appeared in the <title>Courier</title>, he did not say it had not. See <title>Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey</title>,
                  6 vols (London, 1849–1850), IV, pp. 252–255. </note> He did in fact write two letters for the newspaper: one addressed to William
               Smith, the radical MP who had used parliamentary privilege to attack Southey in a speech delivered in the House of Commons on 14 March
               1817 (Letter 2943), and a second letter addressed to the <title>Courier’s</title> editor (Letter 2946). They were sent by Southey to
               Charles Wynn, on 17 and 19 March respectively, with instructions to forward them to the <title>Courier</title> (Letters 2944 and 2948).
               However, as revealed here for the first time, Wynn was away and did not receive the letters and Southey’s instructions until his
               return. By then public interest had moved on and the moment for publishing either or both in a newspaper had passed. Neither letter
               appeared in the <title>Courier</title>. Instead, Southey reworked both into his pamphlet <title>A Letter to William Smith</title>,
               which appeared at the end of April 1817. New light, too, is cast here on the controversial memorandum sent by Southey to Lord Liverpool
               (dated 19 March 1817), which advocated the suppression of the radical press. It has hitherto never been published in full and we
               restore here a final paragraph omitted in the previously published version (Letter 2947). This reveals that Southey urged the Prime
               Minister both to censor the press, and to implement Robert Owen’s plans to tackle unemployment. It thus complicates understanding of
               Southey’s mid-life politics, suggesting that he was far from being a straightforward reactionary, however much he proclaimed his
               detestation of radicals and Whigs. By shedding fresh light on these and other controversies, the letters we publish here demonstrate
               that although the years 1816–1818 were important ones in Southey’s career and impacted on his longer-term reputation, they are yet to
               be fully documented or completely understood. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">While writing to the moment – be it to the Prime Minister, to newspapers or in the pages of the <title>Quarterly
                  Review</title> – remained important to Southey, he also had an eye ever on posterity. In an unpublished draft of <title>A Letter to
                  William Smith</title>, he described himself in the third person and predicted how generations to come would perceive him as one who
               ‘in an age of personality … abstained from satire’ (Letter 2966). Many of his contemporaries would have disagreed. Yet confidence in
               his posthumous fame led Southey to plan for the future. In 1816–1818 he continued work on earlier uncompleted writings such as a
               sequence of inscriptions on the Peninsular War, and the longer poems <title>A Tale of Paraguay</title>, and ‘Oliver Newman’. He also
               laid the foundations for a series of major projects that he believed would underpin his reputation. These included a biography of John
               Wesley, which emerged out of an 1817 essay for the short-lived conservative journal the <title>Correspondent</title>; a full-scale
                  <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, for which Southey both sought out and was offered the papers of a series of eminent
               participants; and a project, inspired by Boethius, that mixed verse and ‘prose … in colloquy between Sir T More &amp; Meipsum’, and
               which eventually became <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title> (1829) (Letter 3042).
               The quest for fame sometimes took a wrong turn. Other projects planned in this period – notably a ‘desultory poem in blank verse’
               occasioned by the death of his son – were never finished (Letter 2969). The letters published here provide fresh evidence on how these
               and other writings did or did not come about and the reasons for this. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">Key to Southey’s career in 1816–1818 was the importance that he placed upon his role as a writer and on the capacity of
               his poetry and prose to influence public life for the better, as he thought, both in the present and the future. This belief had been
               given fresh impetus by his appointment in 1813 as Poet Laureate and his determination to revitalise the post. The Laureateship had
               precipitated Southey’s return not just to poetry but to verses that engaged explicitly (rather than, as previously, in a coded fashion)
               with current affairs. This impacted on obviously topical pieces such as <title>The Poet’s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> and <title>The
                  Lay of the Laureate</title> (written to celebrate the marriage of the Princess Charlotte). It also inflected his other writings. As
               he explained, the ‘main object’ of his Boethian-inspired, poetry-prose hybrid was ‘to show that we are rapidly approaching a <hi rend="ital">crisis</hi> in society’ (Letter 3042). His prose, too, was galvanised and shaped by a similar preoccupation. He was, he
               explained, in writing on issues of current public concern for the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, ‘giving my whole time and thought to
               these great subjects’ in order to ‘take the lead in preparing &amp; informing the public’ (Letter 3066). </p>
               <p rend="indent1">However, Southey did not have things his own way and contemporaries did not always agree with the information he wished
               to put before them. His ambitions for the Poet Laureateship were consistently thwarted by attacks from all sides and by the compromises
               forced on him. These included being obliged to continue producing annual odes, though he had taken the post in the belief that this
               custom had been abolished. His hatred of the task and growing overall discontent with the Poet Laureateship was encapsulated in the
               description of his New Year’s Ode for January 1819, on the death of Queen Charlotte, as ‘fitter to be bum-fiddled’ (Letter 3221). Such
               relative powerlessness was also reflected in the titles given to Southey’s published works. In 1815–1816 he wanted to use
               ‘Belle-Alliance’, ‘anything but Waterloo’, in the title of his new, battlefield-visit poem in an attempt to expose the self-serving
               actions of the Duke of Wellington, who had given ‘the name of Waterloo … to the battle … in a spirit of the lowest &amp; vilest
               jealousy’. <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to Thomas Southey, 17 December 1815, <title>The Collected Letters of
                     Robert Southey. Part Four</title>, Letter 2684.</note> Politically well-connected friends and acquaintances cautioned against
               this, concerned that using the Prussian name for the battle would offend Wellington and lead to trouble. Southey eventually, not
               without considerable protest, caved in and the volume duly appeared in 1816 as <title>The Poet’s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title>. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">Southey made a great deal of noise in his correspondence about wishing to publicly expose and humiliate individuals,
               such as William Smith, Henry Brougham, Leigh Hunt, Francis Jeffrey and the Duke of Wellington, whom he detested. Yet, in practice, his
               polemics were often moderated. William Gifford, for example, censored many of Southey’s contributions to the <title>Quarterly
                  Review</title>, a practice Southey loathed, railed against and was powerless to do anything about. Friends, whose advice Southey
               often asked, accepted and acted on, also impacted on his writing, though Southey tended to take their interventions with a grace not
               reserved for Gifford and his ilk. ‘I would’, he informed one of his oldest friends, Charles Wynn</p>
               <quote>… take reproof from you as a dog does blows from his master; – which same dog if he were struck by a stranger would make his teeth
               meet in the calf of his leg. (Letter 2976)</quote>
               <p>It was friends who, in 1817, urged him to remove any reference to duelling from <title>A Letter to William Smith</title>, on the
               grounds that Smith might be provoked to challenge the Poet Laureate (e.g. Letter 2976). Southey acted on their advice. The following
               year he began work on a public letter, a ‘Tender epistle’, prompted by Henry Brougham’s attack from the hustings on both himself and
               Wordsworth. Southey’s plan was to chastise publicly ‘a man who has … slandered me in the face of my neighbours’ and to expose him ‘as
               he deserves to be exposed’ (Letter 3167). Friends again dissuaded him. The ‘epistle’ was abandoned and remained unpublished until 1821
               when sections – with Brougham’s name removed – appeared in the second edition of the Laureate ode <title>Carmen
                  Triumphale</title>.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey, <title>Carmen Triumphale, For the Commencement of the Year
                     1814</title>, 2nd edn (London, 1821), pp. 45–53.</note> Southey’s letters thus reveal a significant difference between what he
               proclaimed he would do and what he actually ended up publishing. In so doing, they show how even the most combative of writers had to
               negotiate the transition of their writings into a hostile, potentially fatal, public sphere. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">The letters we publish here make available important new information about Southey’s writing life and his intersections
               with contemporaries drawn from many different walks of life, including literature, politics and religion. They show his career in
               progress, reveal that it was more complex than has previously been thought, and provide compelling evidence about how his works were
               shaped and reshaped by external pressures that he could not always control or defeat. They thus refine our understanding both of
               Southey and of the ways in which individual writers came to terms with the complex and contentious culture of the late 1810s.</p>

                     <title>Part Two</title> is dedicated to our
                        parents, May and John Packer, June Osborn and Colin Pratt, in loving
                        memory.</note>

               <p rend="indent1">
                  <title>Part Two</title> is the first-ever collected edition of the
                    surviving letters written by Southey between 1798 and 1803. The letters
                    published here begin with Southey writing to the <title>Monthly Magazine</title>
                    in January 1798 about Spanish and Portuguese poetry, a subject of lifelong
                    interest; and end on New Year’s Eve 1803 with him anticipating a return to
                        <title>Madoc</title>, his intended transatlantic poetic magnum opus.
                        <title>Part Two</title> follows the editorial conventions described in About
                    this Edition and publishes newly transcribed, fully annotated texts, bringing
                    together in one place correspondence scattered between 37 archives in North
                    America and the United Kingdom. It comprises 596 letters, of which 199 are
                    published for the first time, and 107 are published in full for the first time.
                    In addition, 5 letters that appeared pseudonymously in the <title>Monthly
                        Magazine</title> are here newly attributed to Southey.</p>
               <p rend="indent1">The letters in <title>Part Two</title> were sent to some 40 very
                    diverse individuals: including friends from childhood and school (Charles
                    Danvers, Grosvenor Bedford and Charles Wynn), from university (Nicholas
                    Lightfoot), from radical youth (Samuel Taylor Coleridge and George Dyer) and
                    from professional life (Joseph Cottle and Daniel Stuart). The years 1798-1803
                    saw the emergence of important new Southeyan relationships and correspondences,
                    notably with the statistician John Rickman, the translator William Taylor, the
                    scientist and poet Humphry Davy, and the writer Mary Barker. Whilst some of
                    Southey’s epistolary interactions, notably those with Bedford, Cottle and Wynn,
                    were to be of lifelong duration, others in this period were the product of
                    temporary expediency. For example, a letter sent in 1798 to the Liverpudlian man
                    of letters and social campaigner William Roscoe in a vain attempt to track down
                    the maverick, poet William Gilbert (Letter 339); and one in 1803 to the
                    bibliographer and antiquary Joseph Haslewood on a matter connected to Southey
                    and Joseph Cottle’s three-volume edition of Chatterton (Letter 694). Although
                    nearly 600 letters survive, letter-fragments and references within surviving
                    letters to ones now lost remind us of the fragile, selective nature of what has
                    come down to us. It is clear from this edition, that some important
                    correspondences now exist only in part, notably with Coleridge, George Dyer,
                    Stuart and Cottle.</p>
               <p rend="indent1">The six years covered by <title>Part Two</title> were a turbulent
                    and crucial time for Southey. They are also a period of his career that has been
                    relatively neglected, when he was neither the incendiary radical of his youth or
                    the combustible Tory of his middle and old age. In 1798 Southey was a restless
                    creature. Unsettled personally and professionally, he moved between a series of
                    rented houses in the South West of England and London, and was torn between the
                    conflicting options of a legal or a literary career. By the end of 1803 his life
                    was beginning to assume, outwardly at least, a more settled appearance. He had
                    opted decisively for a literary career and in September of that year taken up
                    residence at Greta Hall, Keswick. His relocation, reluctant and temporary at
                    first, proved permanent and additionally set him on the road to being a ‘Lake’
                    poet, a label Southey loathed. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">The letters published here allow for a more accurate, detailed,
                    and nuanced mapping of Southey’s life, works and interactions with and impact
                    upon his contemporaries during these years than has previously been possible.
                    The events they encompass include his reconciliation with Coleridge in 1799; his
                    public and private responses to <title>Lyrical Ballads</title> (1798); his
                    reaction to the rise of Napoleon and the continuing conflict between Britain and
                    revolutionary France; his second and final visit to Portugal in 1800-1801, and
                    the resultant hardening of his anti-Catholicism; his unhappy stint as a
                    secretary to the Irish Chancellor Isaac Corry in 1801-1802; his reaction to the
                    execution of the United Irishman Robert Emmett in 1803; and his emotional
                    bludgeoning by the deaths in relentless succession between 1801-1803 of three
                    Margarets, his cousin, mother and first child. His correspondence also records
                    the increasing emergence of Southey as a literary professional. Between 1798 and
                    1803, he wrote for the <title>Morning Post</title>, <title>Critical
                        Review</title>, and <title>Monthly Magazine</title>. His major book
                    publications included the annotated Islamic romance <title>Thalaba the
                        Destroyer</title> (1801), a new volume of <title>Poems</title> (1799), two
                    volumes of the <title>Annual Anthology</title> (1799 and 1800), and revised
                    versions of his 1797 verse collection, <title>Joan of Arc</title> and
                        <title>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and
                        Portugal</title>. He edited the works of his fellow Bristolian Thomas
                    Chatterton and translated the romance <title>Amadis of Gaul</title>. In
                    addition, he completed a fifteen-book version of the revisionist transatlantic
                    epic <title>Madoc</title>, produced early drafts of what became <title>The Curse
                        of Kehama</title>, and embarked on a planned prose magnum opus, a ‘History
                    of Portugal’. This rather terrifying list does not include projected but
                    unexecuted projects such as an epic on the flood, a literary history of
                    Portugal, a hexametrical epic on Mohammed (to be co-written with Coleridge) and
                    numerous shorter poems sketched out in his correspondence and in his
                        <title>Common-Place Books</title>. The letters published in <title>Part
                        Two</title> provide crucial new information about all these projects,
                    including early drafts of <title>Thalaba</title>, <title>Madoc</title>, gothic
                    ballads, revisionist ‘English Eclogues’ and numerous other shorter poems. In so
                    doing <title>Part Two</title> supplies fresh evidence for how Southey the
                    ‘entire man of letters’ and one of the most prolific authors of his age came
                    into being.</p>
               <p rend="indent1">We hope that by making annotated, scholarly texts of the letters
                    from 1798-1803 available for the first time, this edition will contribute to a
                    richer, more complex, understanding of this crucial period for Southey and for
                    British Romanticism as a whole.</p>

               <p>We here reproduce for the first time Southey’s light-hearted – but unsent – 1818 response to an anticipated challenge to a duel from
               Henry Brougham. Southey suggests that such a challenge would be provoked by the appearance of his own ‘Tender Epistle’, which had been
               written in reaction to Brougham’s reported criticism of Southey during the Westmorland election of 1818. In fact, the ‘Tender Epistle’
               was not completed and only part of it was ever published as an Appendix (without mentioning Brougham’s name) to the second edition of
               Southey’s <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> (London, 1821), pp. 45–53. </p>

                  <p rend="indent1">I have the honour of acknowledging the receipt of your letter, &amp; do myself the pleasure of replying to it without
                  delay.</p>
                  <p rend="indent1">In affairs of this kind, the parties ought to meet upon equal terms. But to establish such an equality between you
                  &amp; me, there are three things which must be previously done; &amp; then a fourth also becomes necessary, before I can meet you in
                  the field.</p>
                  <p rend="indent1">First, you must marry &amp; have four children. Please to be particular in having them all girls.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s only children alive at this time were <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kate</ref> and <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Isabel

                  </p>
                  <p rend="indent1">Secondly you <del>can</del> must prove that the greater part of the provision which you make for them depends upon
                  your life: &amp; you must be under a bond of 4000£ not to be hanged, not to commit suicide, &amp; not to be killed in a duel, which
                  are the conditions upon which I have effected an insurance on my own life, for the benefit of <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">my wife</ref> &amp; children.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s life was insured
                     for £4000 – he had invested his salary as Poet Laureate in increasing the coverage to this sum.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p rend="indent1">Thirdly, I must tell three direct falsehoods concerning you, upon the hustings, or in some other not less public
                     assembly.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">A reference to the newspaper reports of what Brougham had said about Southey
                     from the hustings at Appleby on 30 June 1818.</note> And I shall never be able to do this, nor to meet you afterwards in the
                  manner you propose, unless you can perform the fourth thing, which is, ––</p>
                  <p rend="indent1">That you must convert me from the Christian religion.</p>
                  <p rend="indent1">Till all this be accomplished, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Brougham, our disputes must be carried on without the use of
                  any more iron than is necessary for blackening our ink &amp; mending our pens, – or of any more lead than enters into the

               <head>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey: Part Three</head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">Introduction</hi> by Tim Fulford and Carol Bolton</p>
               <p>Part Three is the first-ever collected edition of the surviving letters written by Southey between 1804 and 1809. The letters
                    published here begin with Southey writing to his brother with a draft of his epic poem <title>Madoc</title>; they end on New
                    Year’s Eve 1809, with him discussing Coleridge’s <title>The Friend</title> and his own new writing in the <title>Quarterly
                        Review</title> and <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (published in 1810). Part Three follows the editorial conventions
                    described in ‘About this Edition’ and publishes newly transcribed, fully annotated texts, bringing together in one place
                    correspondence scattered between archives in North and South America and the United Kingdom. It comprises 850 letters, many of
                    which are published for the first time or published in full for the first time.</p>
               <p rend="indent1">The letters in Part Three were sent to over 50 very diverse individuals including friends from childhood and school
                    (Charles Danvers, Grosvenor Charles Bedford and Charles Watkin Williams Wynn), from university (Nicholas Lightfoot), from radical
                    youth (Samuel Taylor Coleridge) and from professional life (Joseph Cottle and Daniel Stuart). The years 1804–1809 saw the
                    consolidation of important relationships and correspondences, notably with the statistician John Rickman, the translator William
                    Taylor, and the writer Mary Barker. New correspondences of lasting significance were begun: with Neville White, brother of Henry
                    Kirke White, leading to Southey’s editing of Henry’s <title>Remains</title>; with Matilda Betham, who would paint Southey’s and
                    his family’s portraits in London and Keswick; with Anna Seward, who would support his poetry in the press and to whom he would
                    make an hilarious visit; with Walter Savage Landor, whose enthusiasm for his poetry inspired him to return to writing verse in
                        <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> and <title>Roderick Last of the Goths</title> (1814); with Walter Scott, whose good offices
                    led Southey to a new career writing for the <title>Quarterly Review</title> and the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title>, and
                    to the Laureateship. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">Writing for the journals produced much official correspondence: Part Three shows the beginnings of Southey’s
                    relationships with his editor William Gifford, and his publishers John Murray and James Ballantyne. It also reveals him as an
                    advisor of other writers: his reputation, if not his remuneration, was beginning to burgeon and he found himself sought out for
                    advice by budding poets. Letters to Ebenezer Elliott show Southey’s pragmatic support of a young writer in whom he recognised
                    talent. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">The six years covered by Part Three were a time of gradual settlement into a way of life and a home. In the
                    beginning of 1804 Southey was newly resident at Greta Hall, Keswick, which Coleridge had just left. By the end of 1809 he was an
                    established family man there, with three children and many friendships – including the anti-slavery campaigner Thomas Clarkson,
                    his old acolyte Charles Lloyd (in Ambleside), the landowner Humphrey Senhouse and Wordsworth, whose poetry he came to value very
                    highly, even while bemused by his personal vanity. But it was not until 1807 that he had ceased hankering to move south – perhaps
                    to Bristol or Bath, or to Portugal – and accepted that the Lake District would remain his home. By then he had established a
                    pattern of intense literary work during the winter months, and fellwalking and boating in the summer. Visits to friends in London
                    and Bristol punctuated the ‘bookmaking’ routine biennially. Constantly short of money in these years, and having to provide for
                    Coleridge’s family and for Robert Lovell’s widow, child and mother, Southey drove his pen with unending determination. Each day
                    was divided: verse writing came before breakfast because it paid too little to be done during the day, which was devoted to more
                    lucrative work – writing reviews, translating medieval chronicles and romances, compiling anthologies, editing literary remains
                    and labouring on his large-scale histories of Portugal and Brazil. After a break for dinner, letters were written in the evening,
                    and were vital links to the world of literary gossip and publishing opportunities in London and Edinburgh. Southey used them to
                    propose new literary schemes and to forge alliances; he also depended on them to maintain friendships that sustained him
                    financially: both John May and Wynn loaned and gave him much needed money. With sales of his poems meagre, and rates for reviewing
                    in London journals low, it was only when the opportunities to write for the <title>Quarterly Review</title> and <title>Edinburgh
                        Annual Register</title> arose that financial security seemed possible. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">Southey’s output in these years was phenomenal: two epic poems, two translations of medieval books, an anthology,
                    two travel narratives, an edition of another writer’s works, the first volume of a major history, new revised editions of his
                    poems, and over a hundred reviews and articles. He sent these works in manuscript through the post, availing himself of Wynn’s and
                    Rickman’s parliamentary privileges to frank mail gratis. With these friends, he discussed his changing political views: by 1809
                    the once Jacobinical, pro-French Revolution radical was arguing that no peace with France was possible until Napoleon was
                    overthrown. His pro-war politics were defined by his sympathy for the people of Portugal and Spain, where he had twice lived, in
                    their struggle to liberate themselves from French imperial rule. It led him to despise the Whigs who argued for peace and to
                    refuse to write for their main journal – the <title>Edinburgh Review</title>. Yet at the same time the ministry’s toadying to the
                    corrupt princes and pusillanimity over sending soldiers to fight in Europe left him disgusted at the Tories: in 1808 he was
                    alienated from all parties and declared that either a reform must happen, or revolution would occur. Given this revulsion at
                    political infighting and corruption, it is bewildering to see him accepting a pension from the government in 1807, and in 1809
                    requesting Tory power-brokers, whose influence he had formerly resented, to gain him a sinecure. Poverty was a motive, as was a
                    desire for recognition that remained unfulfilled when his books were badly reviewed, but Southey believed, inexplicably, that his
                    independence would not be compromised. Gradually however, it was compromised: although in late 1808 he wrote to several friends
                    declaring that he would stop writing for the <title>Quarterly</title> if it toed the government line, he remained a contributor
                    even when the editor cut his trenchant criticisms of church and state from his contributions. Reporting plaintively to friends the
                    hand-writing of excised passages back into the margins of his own copies of the journal was his limited response to these
                    editorial interventions. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">Journalism changed Southey in the years 1804–1809; it did not, however, define him. Encouraged by Landor, he
                    returned to epic poetry; inspired by his uncle, he took on himself the mantle of historian of Portugal and Brazil, perceiving his
                    poems and histories as great works on which posterity would judge him. Journalism compromised his independence, but it supported
                    him and his families, allowing him to pursue the higher callings of poet and historian. If this was a sometimes uneasy and divided
                    conception of himself as a writer, it motivated him to pursue these callings with great thoroughness. The <title>History of
                        Brazil</title> emerged from meticulous research in Spanish, Portuguese and Latin sources, carried on assiduously from 1806
                    onwards – and bringing books galore to Greta Hall by mail coach, ship and wagon. The correspondence of these years reveals Southey
                    as a bibliophile in the making, assembling a fine collection of rare books and manuscripts on Iberia and its colonies; books he
                    read thoroughly but also loved as objects. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">By 1809, established in his study with its commanding view of Borrowdale, Derwentwater and the Newlands valley,
                    surrounded by his library, harnessed to his multiple literary endeavours, supported by the families for whom he provided, he was a
                    man at the centre of a world of his own making. If it seemed marginal to outsiders – a remote country retreat – to him it was a
                    place of strength from which, by dint of his correspondence, his immense industry could influence both the present and the future.
                    The coming years, in which his reputation reached its peak, would prove him at least partially right. They would see him develop
                    influential networks of communication, as his reputation as a poet and journalist made him a public figure. Aspiring young authors
                    (Elliott and Kirke White) depended on his advice and support, and experienced literary figures (Scott, Richard Duppa and Taylor)
                    respected his archival knowledge, his expertise on Hispanic literature, and his ambitious works of historiography. At the hub of
                    his literary operations in Keswick, and through an ever-growing network of correspondence, Southey was never cut off from the
                    wider world around him. Yet the peace and stability of his home enabled his productive engagement in many literary forms and
                    subjects of interest. The letters he wrote during the early years of the nineteenth-century see him forging relationships with
                    politicians, social reformers, writers and publishers. His opinions on colonial ventures, the social problems created by
                    industrialisation, events in the war with France, were just some of the topics that he tested his ideas on privately in his
                    correspondence, and expanded on publicly, in books and review articles. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">Southey’s networking abilities have had consequences for the modern period in more ways than through his own publication of poems, histories and biographies. Tracing the transfer of information from private letters to the public
                    sphere reveals unexpected consequences. For instance, Southey was persistent in seeking information on the West
                    Indian plantocracy from his sailor brother, which frequently appeared in his review articles. The material Thomas gleaned from his
                    Caribbean voyages became the subject of a book by him that was eventually seen through the press by Southey in 1827. Another
                    enthusiasm that is mentioned frequently in the correspondence during these years is medieval romance. The publication of
                        <title>Amadis of Gaul</title> (1803) corrected the historical records in asserting that the source for this work was
                    Portuguese, and he disseminated this belief in his letters to fellow authors and the pages of the <title>Monthly Magazine</title>.
                    It was his reputation in this field that led to the discovery through one of his correspondents of a previously unlocated,
                    fifteenth-century metrical manuscript. Purchased through his connections with Scott, this is now housed in the archives of the
                    National Library of Scotland. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">Reading the letters, the only medium of communication available to Southey and his contemporaries, reinforces our
                    understanding of the processes by which knowledge circulated in the Romantic period. It also reveals the increasing influence of
                    middle-class morality as he became more settled in his profession, and reflects the values of like-minded members of his circle.
                    Commenting on topical issues, Southey’s letters report his strong feelings on Catholic reform, and the mutual disgust of many at
                    the corrupt practices of notable figures such as Lord Melville and the Duke of York. They also remind us of how events that had
                    national consequences were viewed outside the centres of power in Westminster. The speed at which such information is communicated
                    and commented on in Southey’s correspondence, belies assumptions that those in the provinces were isolated from the metropolis, or
                    that geographical remoteness inculcated political apathy. </p>
               <p rend="indent1">Correspondence may have been Southey’s lifeline and network of influence, but it was fragile. Letters got lost, or
                    never arrived – even in his own time. He discovered that messages his brother Tom threw overboard in bottles were as likely to
                    reach him as his letters to Tom, sent by post, were to arrive at his ship. And although inland post was reliable, many
                    correspondents of this period did not keep Southey’s letters. Although over 800 survive, references within surviving letters to
                    ones now lost remind us of the fragile, selective nature of what has come down to us. It is clear from this edition, that some
                    important correspondences now exist only in part, or not at all, notably with Coleridge, George Dyer, Stuart, Cottle and Charles
                    Lamb. Nevertheless, we are able to present here previously unpublished letters containing assessments of such luminaries as
                    Wordsworth, Coleridge, Scott and Davy. Southey’s understanding of the writing of his peers and his centrality to Romantic literary
                    culture are both on display as never before.</p>

                  <p rend="indent1"> Sober prose, my dear sir, will best account for my not visiting <ref target="places.html#MountsfieldRye">Rye</ref>, and acquaint you with what I have seen. Our vacation barely consists of three weeks, out of which, in going
						and returning, five days must have been spent, and time flies so rapidly at <ref target="places.html#MountsfieldRye">Rye</ref>, that it is needless to shorten his career. One evening <ref target="people.html#SewardEdmund">Seward</ref> asked
						me to walk into Worcester with him. You know I love walking, as it is the only exercise I excel in; you likewise know how
						little time my wise brain gives to consideration. I accepted the offer, and off we set. We breakfasted at Woodstock, seven
						miles from Oxford, and passed the environs of Blenheim<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Blenheim Palace had been funded
							by the public purse in gratitude for the victory of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (1650–1722; <title level="m">DNB</title>), at the battle of Blenheim in 1704.</note> without entering. Of this stoicism I fear I should not have
						been guilty, but for the remembrance that <ref target="people.html#CombeEdward">Coombe</ref> intended to go with me early in
						the summer. The day, too, looked uncertain, and we had eleven miles to Chipping Norton, where we proposed dining. At Enstone,
						however, Henrietta’s waterworks<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Water features erected by Thomas Bushell (bef.
							1600–1674; <title level="m">DNB</title>) on his estate at Enstone, Oxfordshire. Charles I (1600–1649; reigned 1625–1649;
								<title level="m">DNB</title>) and his wife Henrietta Maria (1609–1669; <title level="m">DNB</title>) visited them in
							1636.</note> attracted us, made about some 150 years back by some fantastic esquire who had water on his brain like a
						friend of yours. They are very pretty, but it is <hi rend="ital">so</hi> unnatural to imagine moss-clad rocks and springs in a
						room, that fancy could not so far blind the eyes of reason as to dress it with probability. The old woman who conducted us
						(for the man had lately broken his leg) was contented with showing it without wetting us, — the wit of the place. Ladies are
						desired to look at this and that; and the ground spouts up water — it rains — and, in short, you get completely sluiced for
						curiosity and amusement.</p>
                  <p rend="indent1"> The time we spent there we did not think by any means thrown away. I shall know the practical jokes at
							Chatsworth,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The ancestral home of the Dukes of Devonshire.</note> and have
						discovered that the hydromania is almost as bad as the hydrophobia. Lord Shrewsbury has a pleasant seat, Heythorp,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Heythrop House was the ancestral home of the Earls of Shrewsbury. The owner in 1793 was
							Charles Talbot, 15th Earl of Shrewsbury (1753–1827).</note> near the village; but the situation is vile: and indeed the
						road from Oxford to Chipping Norton is very uninteresting. Some good cold beef, cold tongue, sallad, and a bottle of cider
						were productive of much entertainment: we deserved an appetite, and we had one. But Moreton lay eight miles on, and we soon
						proceeded.</p>
                  <p rend="indent1"> The village of Salford is very pleasant, and the country mends much as you approach the four-shire stone — the
						boundary-mark of Gloucester, Worcester, Oxford, and Warwick shires. It is a neat stone, handsomer than even the Romans made
							Terminus,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Roman god of boundaries. His statue was kept in his temple on the
							Tarpeian rock.</note> and yet not sufficiently so to tempt me to fall down, and worship it. Moreton-in-the-Marsh we
						reached to tea, — a vile, unhealthy, horrible town. Early the next morning we rose, after a curious division of the bed, — for
						we slept together. He took all the bed and I took all the clothes; but we did not need rocking. Over Camden Downs to Broadway.
						The hill above the town presented me with a most delightful view.</p>
                  <p rend="indent1"> Equally rich, and far more extensive, than that from Madamescourt Hill, yet not so beautifully diversified, you
						see the fertile vale of Evesham, the town of the same name, Broadway just below, and at a distance the smoke of Pershore and
						Worcester, Malvern Hills melting into distance. A man of Exeter<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified, perhaps
							an undergraduate at Exeter College, Oxford.</note> breakfasted with us at Broadway, who, in walking twenty miles in boots
						once, had lost his two toe-nails. He was mounted, but though we left Oxford together, we kept up with him, even into
						Worcester. The Abbey of Evesham is wonderfully grand; in a very different stile from Battle, but equally beautiful. A tower, a
						perfect sample of the simple Gothic, fronts the skeleton of the church, whose roof, in many places fallen in, affords light
						enough to show distinctly the inside, and casts a shade in many places. The grass grows in the high arched windows. Desolation
						makes it more striking; but unless some lover of antiquity gives assistance very shortly, it will, I fear, fall entirely. We
						reached Worcester to dinner, having never rested for twenty-one miles. Here, as you may easily imagine, we were not sorry to
						rest. To proceed twelve miles through a very clayey, wet country, was, though not impossible, very unpleasant. We remained
						that night, and the next morning being wet breakfasted with a clergyman. The day cleared up. I bought a trusty stick, drew on
						my Old Bear*<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">*: Warter adds footnote: ‘His great coat, to which there is an ode in a
							MS. letter to G.C. Bedford, December 14. 1793.’</note> (the luggage having arrived), and on we proceeded. The country had
						been pleasant before; it now became romantically beautiful, and I rejoiced in having journeyed to it; but the wet grounds and
						roads, such as in Sussex would be deemed impassible, made the travelling not good. It was a trifle, not worth consideration;
						but we grew hungry, for speed was impossible. ....<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">....: Warter adds footnote: ‘MS.
							illegible, and part torn out.’</note> The bread and cheese, cold pig’s face, tongue, and tarts, and cider, were most
						agreeable. It may seem strange, but I never found such pleasure in travelling as in this expedition. The highest pride is
						couched under humility, and in truth I was proud of travelling so humbly.</p>
                  <p rend="indent1"> I have since visited Abberley, Bewdley, Kidderminster, and Malvern, each well worth seeing; but it is difficult
						to describe so many assemblies of houses in a different manner. Since our arrival here the snow has fallen; and I am inclined
						to hope, from the aspect, that we shall be weather-bound till the last moment. Arthur Young’s<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Arthur Young (1741–1820; <title level="m">DNB</title>), <title level="m">Travels During the Years 1787,

						is the fate of travellers just to visit persons whom we could wish to be acquainted with, and then part.” Thanks be to the

						company of all men is at all times bad; here it is abominable. His plan of study is hard, but it deserves more praise than I
						can give. I hope Mrs. L. will come; but, in any case, <ref target="people.html#LambThomasDavis">Tom</ref> must. The state of
						French affairs pleases <hi rend="ital">you</hi> I hope. Peace! Peace! is all I wish for. But why should I give my sentiments?

						Time may alter my opinions: I do not much think it will. Let those opinions be what they will, you will not despise me for

						suppressed. My best respects and wishes to all friends at <ref target="places.html#MountsfieldRye">Rye</ref>. Will you once

						easy matter, to write half a dozen different ones, upon the same subject. I am at Lisbon, and therefore all my friends expect
						some account of Portugal; but it is not pleasant to reiterate terms of abuse, and continually to present to my own mind
						objects of filth and deformity. By way of improving your English cookery, take the Portuguese receipt for dressing rabbits.
						The spit is placed either above the fire, below the fire, by the side of the fire, or in the fire; (this is when they have a
						spit, and that is little better than an iron skewer, for they <hi rend="ital">roast</hi> meat in a <hi rend="ital">jug</hi>,
						and <hi rend="ital">boil</hi> it in a frying-pan;) to know if it is done they crack the joints with their fingers, and then
						lay it aside till it cools, then they seize the rabbit, tear it piecemeal with their fingers into rags, and fry it up with
						oil, garlic, and aniseed. I have attempted sausages made of nothing but garlic and aniseed; they cut off the rump of a bird
						always because they dress it, and neither prayers nor entreaties can save a woodcock from being drawn and quartered. R——<note n="17" place="foot" resp="editors">Mr Raynsford (first name and dates unknown), a companion of Southey’s during some of

						toasted cheese — to the no small amusement of those who knew he could get neither, and to his no small disappointment when he

							Foreign Secretary 1791–1801, Prime Minister 1806–1807.</note> on the subject, and proposed damping the corn previous to
						grinding it, so as to prevent the bran from pulverising. Lord G. has even sent for grindstones to Lisbon, in hopes they might
						succeed better. It is melancholy to reflect on what a race possesses the fertile coasts of Barbary! Yet are these Portuguese
						not a degree above them. You may form some idea how things are managed in this country from the history of the present war: by
						treaty the Portuguese were to furnish the English with a certain number of ships, or a certain sum of money; and the Spaniards
						with troops or money; the money was expected, but the Secretary of State, Mello,<note n="21" place="foot" resp="editors">Martinho de Melo e Castro (1716–1795), Secretary for the Navy and Overseas Affairs 1773–1795.</note> argued that it was
						more politic to lay it out among their own countrymen, and make soldiers and sailors. The old boy’s measures were vigorous; he
						sent for the general of one of the provinces, appointed him commander in Brazil, and ordered him to be ready at an hour’s
						notice; but old Mello fell ill, and the general, after remaining three months at Lisbon (for during Mello’s illness the other
						party managed affairs,) he found no more probability of departing than on the first day, and he accordingly sent for his
						furniture, wife, and family to Lisbon. Soon after they arrived the secretary recovered, — every thing was hurried for the
						expedition, — and the wife, family and furniture, sent home again. Mello fell ill again, every thing was at a stand, and the
						general once more called his family to Lisbon. The old fellow recovered; sent them all home again; put everything in
						readiness, fell ill again, and died. The measures of the government have ever since been uniformly languid; and, though the
						stupid hounds sent ships to England, and troops to Spain, they never believed themselves at war with France till the French
						took their ships at the mouth of the river!</p>

						Portugal into an alliance with France: they, however, parted on bad terms. War with Spain is not improbable, and, if our
						minister knew how to conduct it, would amply repay the expenses of the execrable contest. The Spanish settlements could not
						resist a well-ordered expedition, and humanity would be benefited by the delivery of that country from so heavy a yoke. There
						is a very seditious Spaniard there now, preaching Atheism and Isocracy; one of Godwin’s school; for <ref target="people.html#GodwinWilliam">Godwin</ref> has his pupils in Spain.</p>
