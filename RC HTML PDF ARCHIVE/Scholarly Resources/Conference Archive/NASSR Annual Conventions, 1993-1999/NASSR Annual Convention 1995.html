    <p class="c9">Plenary Session:</p>
    <p>"Living With the Weather" (Jonathan Bate, U. Liverpool) (LHV)</p>
    <p>The eruption of Tambora volcano on the island of Sumbawa, Indonesia, in 1815 caused a three year period of major climatic disruption which had drastic social consequences: beginning in 1816, known as 'the year without a summer', crop failure led to food riots in nearly every country of Europe. Only in 1819 were there good harvests again. John Keats wrote his ode 'To Autumn' to celebrate them. I shall open with a reading of that poem as a meditation on the inter-relations between climatic change/stability, social conditions and the self. This will then lead to a questioning of the assumption of much recent criticism that Romanticism begins with ideology: I shall argue instead that Romanticism begins with the weather. My reading of Romantic Weather is, however, more material and socialized than that of Arden Reed in his book of that title. Reed is interested in cloud vapors as a deconstructive trope; I am interested in Montesquieu's claim that ideology is determined by the weather.</p>
    <p>Verbal echoes demonstrate that a major source for 'To Autumn' was Coleridge's 'Frost at Midnight'. I wish to pursue this connection with respect to the fact that both texts are weather poems. I shall argue that weather is in each case the means of linking spatiality and temporality. Le temps means both the time and the weather. Our identities are always constituted in both time and space, are always shaped by both memory and environment. I shall suggest that Romantic poetry is especially concerned with these two constitutions. It is both a mnemonic and an ecologic. A Romantic poem is a model of a certain kind of being and of dwelling; it is weather that mediates between the temporal nature of being and the environmental nature of dwelling.</p>
    <p>The paper is about the 'legacy' of Romanticism in that it offers a reading conditioned by our dwelling in a moment of climatic instability (an alternative title might have been 'Romanticism and Global Warming'). but, if there is time, 'legacy' will be demonstrated in another respect in a closing section, which would reveal that Keatsian influence upon the climates of Wallace Stevens.</p>

    <p>"Romanticism, Postmodernism, and the Local Knowledge Myth" (David Simpson, U. Colorado-Boulder) (LHV)</p>
    <p>Abstract: Part of a project on The Academic Postmodern. I will briefly illustrate the (familiar) incidence of the localist imperative in the rhetoric of postmodernity (with Geertz as a skeptical but still affirmative example), situating this paradigm in relation to the new theorization of local/national/global interactions, and in the context of an argued disaggregation of what Gouldner called the "new class".</p>
    <p>I will then discuss the tension between the localist component of Romanticism and the 'theory project' also prominent (e.g. as explained by Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy). The political analogues and ideologies that went along with this tension will be briefly sketched in relation to a crisis in the national self-image (French Wars, Irish Union) vis a vis empire and community.</p>
    <p>I'll go on to analyze the localist emphasis of (some) Romantic pastoral, with remarks on Cobbett and on the localization of women, before presenting a more extended reading of Coleridge's 'This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison' in relation to the postmodern fantasy of particularity (represented here by a Borges story). If there is time, I'll also discuss Wordsworth.</p>
    <p>Finally, I'll try to sketch the localist foundations of literature and literary aesthetics, in relation to the ethical/aesthetic methodologies offered by such figures as Rorty, Geertz and Tyler. I am not so much interested in offering any revisionary chronology for the postmodern (the dating game) as in articulating, through some Romantic instances, a sharper inquiry into the ethical assurances offered by the rhetoric of (academic) postmodernity, which I see as tied in rather uncritically with the assumptions and procedures of an institutionalized literature and literary criticism.</p>

    <p class="c9">Plenary Session:</p>
    <p>"The Romantic Origins of the Modern University" (Theodore Ziolkowski, Princeton U.) (LHV)</p>
    <p>It is commonly known that the modern American research university had its model in the 19th century German university. What is not fully appreciated, in the current debate over higher education, is the fact that the Humboldtian ideal f research (Forschung) and teaching (Lehre) did not begin in Berlin with Humboldt's reforms but in a series of lectures held in the 1790s in Jena by a group of Romantic intellectuals.</p>
    <p>A reappraisal of the university as it was being shaped in Romantic Germany (1789-1815) reveals that it shared not only many of the ideals but also most of the problems of the American university in the 1990s, including the conflict between teaching and research, affirmative action, political correctness, student unrest, faculty discontent, elitist and populist criticism of the institution, increasing professionalism of the student body, and the vagaries of government funding.</p>
    <p>Jena was an unlikely site for the radical reform of an institution that had, by the end of the 18th century, fallen into general contempt. For among German universities Jena, the home of the archetypal student drinking sony Gaudeamus igitur, was widely reputed to be the rowdiest. But owing to a number of unusual factors -- including, paradoxically, notoriously low faculty salaries and the nearby presence of Goethe in Weimar--Jena was able to attract a constellation of rising academic stars: Schiller, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, and others. These intellectuals formulated in their inaugural lectures the theory upon which Humboldt's university in Berlin was later based.</p>
    <p>First, all of these theorists presented knowledge as a unified whole in contrast to the encyclopedic view of the Enlightenment. Second, they understood the universe of knowledge not merely as a synchronic whole but as a diachronic process -- as a history in which each individual wins his place through the act of creative scholarship. Third, their view of the university led all three to distinguish rigorously between the rightful citizens of the world of knowledge and those who do not belong in such lofty surroundings. All three, finally, locate philosophy at the center of the curriculum in an effort to provide the unified view that would bring together the previously disparate fields of the arts and sciences as well as the professions of law, medicine, and theology.</p>
    <p>Through an equally improbable set of circumstances Berlin turned out to be the place where this Romantic ideal of the university was first realized. That is was soon torn apart by tensions familiar on our campuses today is a sobering lesson for the present.</p>

    <p class="c9">Plenary Session:</p>
    <p>"The Failure of Romanticism" (Jerome McGann, U. Virginia) (LHV)</p>
    <p>Loss, failure, unsuccess: no subject or emotional constellation consumes greater attention or imaginative energy among Romantic poets, their precursors, and their inheritors. this talk centers in the deeply problematic character of those subjects as they are taken up by the poets. It traces out the Romantic representation of the theme of loss and failure, in particular the failure of (Romantic) art both as a cultural ideal and as a set of particular cultural practices. It begins by considering three types of Romantic loss: Wordsworthian, Byronic, and Keatsian. It then retreats to consider the context in which these formations developed -- specifically, within the discourses of sentimentality and sensibility. The final part of the discussion takes up certain late-romantic appropriations of these subjects by Hemans and Landon in particular. Here, it is argued, the thematic and emotional constellation receives its fullest and most reflexive form of expression.</p>

    <p class="c9">Plenary Session:</p>
    <p>"Jeremy Bentham and How to Do Things with People"</p>
    <p>(Frances Ferguson, Johns Hopkins U.) (LHV)</p>
    <p>This paper discusses Bentham's attempt to reorient government by focusing on how groups may help to shape individual action. It particularly treats the differences between the appeal to tradition (which recommends actions because of their effects in the past) and Bentham's Romantic liberalism (which tries to redefine individuals through artificial environments). It concludes by talking about why visibility becomes particularly important to such artificial environments and suggests a relationship between the current debates about pornography and the implications of Bentham's account for our understanding of individuality.</p>
