<h2 class="c4">NASSR Annual Conventions, 1993-1999</h2>
<blockquote><span class="c5">This page features program copy from the NASSR (North American Sociey for the Study of Romanticism) annual conventions since its inception in 1993. Program copy was taken variously from printed programs, conference websites, and assorted computer files, all of which were generously provided by the relevant conference organizers. Special thanks go to Julia Wright, who helped facilitate this section of the archive on behalf of NASSR.</span>
