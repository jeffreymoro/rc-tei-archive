<h2 align="center">About the Concordance
</h2>
<p class="big">This is a concordance to <em>The Poems of John Keats</em>, edited by Jack Stillinger. The Electronic Concordance was edited by <a href="mailto:comet@ucla.edu">Noah Comet</a> with the editorial assistance of Noelle Chao and Arlene Comet. This resource was compiled using <a href="http://www.concordancesoftware.co.uk/" target="_self">Concordance 3.0</a>, software designed by R. J. C. Watt, which is capable of Web publication. This is commercial software but a version is available to download for personal evaluation. </p>

<p class="big">101 common words have been omitted from the concordance and listed on a separate <a href="/reference/keatsconcordance/omitted.html">page</a>. These are words with over 100 entries, which the editor has deemed unlikely search targets (articles, conjunctions, interjections, ubiquitous verbs and adverbs, etc). Five of these words&#8212;&quot;like,&quot; &quot;May,&quot; &quot;still,&quot; &quot;well,&quot; and &quot;will&quot;&#8212;have alternative definitions that are significant to the meaning of Keats's poetry. For that reason, they have been given their own entries separate from the concordance, accessible as links on the list of omitted words. For &quot;like,&quot; &quot;May,&quot; and &quot;will,&quot; only the alternative uses have been indexed. For &quot;still&quot; and &quot;well,&quot; entire entries are provided. </p>

<p class="big"> Like all academic resources, this concordance has limitations. In particular, Keats's tendency to use abbreviated and archaic forms of words cannot be taken into account by HTML-generating software, as it can be by a human concordance editor. For that reason, &quot;perhaps&quot; and &quot;p'rhaps&rdquo; (for example) are not indexed together or even contiguously. Furthermore, homonymous words such as &quot;art&quot; (meaning both an aesthetic object and an archaism for &quot;are&quot;) are indexed together in an undifferentiated entry. Users should also be mindful of Keats's occasional idiosyncrasies as a speller: for instance, &quot;panel&quot; and &quot;pannel&quot;; the standard and non-standard spelling of the same word are not indexed together or contiguously. Following Stillinger's text exactly, the source text for this concordance maintains these peculiarities, and the concordance does not include double-entries for alternative spellings. </p>
