    <h2>About this Resource</h2>
    </div>
    <p>During the summer of 1999,&#160;with the help of grants from <a href="http://www.lycoming.edu">Lycoming College</a>, we traveled through England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales; in 2000, accompanied by Jennifer Gray, we visited Switzerland, France, and Italy.&#160; Using Richard Holmes&#8217;s <i>Shelley: The Pursuit</i> (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1974) as our <em>Guide Michelin</em>, the three of us attempted to document the current condition of places where Shelley spent the rather hectic three decades of his life&#8212;from his birth at Field Place to his burial in the Protestant cemetery in Rome.</p>
    <p>We had been told that very few British sites familiar to Shelley had survived the onslaught of Victorian urban renewal, and were happily surprised when we found a good deal more than we expected. Even more encouraging was the generosity of the owners and custodians of the sites. There were, of course, blind alleys, tremendous amounts of wasted effort, and frustrating missed attempts, but we were able to document photographically a tremendous number of historical buildings.&#160;</p>
    <p>Italian sites were for the most part intact, although idiosyncratic street numbering systems, Shelley's penchant for isolated sites, and our linguistic deficiencies often made many of them all but impossible to track down. At some point in time, we hope to acquire whatever missing images still linger out there&#8212;this Website is, of course, still a work in progress, and we would be most grateful for any additional information or photographs.</p>
    <p>The pages are arranged chronologically, and whenever possible, we have included contact information: names, snail mail addresses, email addresses, and Websites.</p>
