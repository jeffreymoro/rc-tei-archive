    <p>Poland Street, where Shelley fled to in April 1811 after his expulsion from Oxford, still stands, now decorated with a tremendous mural of which Shelley probably would have heartily approved. His first-floor (second floor to Americans) rooms were for rent in June 1999, and the street-level storefront housed a very good Italian restaurant. There had been a plaque designating the historical importance of the site, but the building&#8217;s residents told me it had been stolen by American tourists.</p>
    <p>However, most London Shelley sites have fallen victim to the Victorian passion for urban renewal and the twentieth century need for vertical space. Lewis&#8217;s Hotel on St. James&#8217; Street, and Cook&#8217;s Hotel on Abermarle Street no longer exist, nor were we able to locate the lodgings Shelley took at Half Moon Street, the Kentish town 5 Church Terrace address, Hans Place, 13 Arabella Road, Norfolk Street, or the Hunts&#8217; houses in the Vale of Health and Lisson Grove.</p>
