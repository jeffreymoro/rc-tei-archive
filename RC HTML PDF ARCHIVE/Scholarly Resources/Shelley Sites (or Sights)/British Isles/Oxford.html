    <p>The rear of the rooms overlooked what is now the Fellows&#8217; Garden.</p>
    <p>Nearby, off staircase three, one can find the small mausoleum that houses Basil Champney&#8217;s Shelley Memorial. It was originally designed for the Protestant Cemetery in Rome, but was politely&#8212;and firmly&#8212;declined. Critics have lambasted the sculpture, asserting that the poet resembles nothing so much a slice of turbot laid out on a fishmonger&#8217;s scale. Others suggested that the figure was insufficiently manly&#8212;not surprising, considering that the model was supposedly a young girl. (<i>Image courtesy James Jayo</i>).</p>

    <p>Slatter and Munday&#8217;s Printing Office at 2-3 High Street, which published Shelley&#8217;s notorious <i>Necessity of Atheism</i>, is no longer standing; the site is now occupied by the Lloyd&#8217;s Bank at the corner of High and Carfax. An early engraving of the establishment can be found in the New Oxford Guide (Oxford, 1818), however.</p>
    <p>Those wishing to research Shelley&#8217;s stay in Oxford should contact Robin Darwall-Smith, the University College archivist (phone: 0865 27695, email: <a href="mailto:robin.darwall-smith@univ.ox.ac.uk">robin.darwall-smith@univ.ox.ac.uk</a> ). Access to the rooms can be arranged through the Domestic Bursar&#8217;s office (phone: 0865 27625). A wonderful guide to the Bodleian Library&#8217;s collection of Shelley materials can be found in B.C. Barker-Benfield&#8217;s catalogue <i>Shelley&#8217;s Guitar: A Bicentenary Exhibition of Manuscripts, First Editions and Relics of Percy Bysshe Shelley</i> (Oxford: Bodleian Library, 1992).</p>
