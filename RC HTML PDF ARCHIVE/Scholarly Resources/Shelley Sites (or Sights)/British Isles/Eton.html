In the area where the "Wall Game" (a sort of penny-pitch using a small ball) was played, two sections of the wall come together on a high rise of lawn that forms a natural amphitheater. This is where Eton students used to engage in a sort of trial by combat, working out their differences through fisticuffs (so rough that at least one child, a Shaftsbury heir, later died).</td>
