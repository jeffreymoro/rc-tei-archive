The biases were often those of the magazines: the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, for example, was a Tory and Anglican and conservative periodical. Almost all of the reviews at the time were published anonymously, but three of the reviewers below may be identified: the famous Walter Scott, the infamous John Wilson Croker, and even the husband Percy Bysshe Shelley, whose review of his own wife&#39;s novel was written in 1817 or 1818 but not published until 1832.</p><p>The reviews reproduced below, all but one responding to the first edition of 1818, are printed with the spelling and the punctuation of the original publications (with a few errors corrected and/or identified within square brackets). The long reviews offer detailed summaries of the plot and/or extended quotations from the text (a typical practice at the time), but these extended quotations are not reproduced (although square brackets note their omission).</p></div><h4><a id="frank" name="frank"> </a><b>Frankenstein: Or, The Modern Prometheus (London: Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mavor, and Jones, 1818)</b></h4><ul><li><a href="/reference/chronologies/mschronology/reviews/barev.html">The Belle Assemblée, or Bell&#39;s Court and Fashionable Magazine</a>,&nbsp;2d Series,&nbsp;17 (March 1818): 139-142.</li><li><a href="/reference/chronologies/mschronology/reviews/emrev.html">The Edinburgh Magazine and Literary Miscellany;&nbsp;A New Series of &quot;The Scots Magazine&quot;</a> 2 (March 1818): 249-253.</li><li><a href="/reference/chronologies/mschronology/reviews/bemrev.html">Blackwood&#39;s Edinburgh Magazine</a> 2 (March&nbsp;1818): 613-620&mdash;by Walter Scott.</li><li><a href="/reference/chronologies/mschronology/reviews/bcrev.html">The British Critic,</a> N.S., 9 (April 1818): 432-38; also rpt. in <em>The Port Folio</em> [Philadelphia] 6 (September 1818): 200-07.</li><li><a href="/reference/chronologies/mschronology/reviews/lprev.html">The Literary Panorama and National Register,</a> N.S., 8 (1 June 1818): 411-414.</li><li><a href="/reference/chronologies/mschronology/reviews/qrrev.html">The Quarterly Review</a> 18 (January [delayed until 12 June] 1818): 379-385&mdash;by John Wilson Croker.</li><li><a href="http://www.rc.umd.edu/reference/chronologies/mschronology/reviews/gentlemansmag">The Gentleman&#39;s Magazine</a> 88&nbsp;(April 1818): 334-35.</li><li><a href="http://www.rc.umd.edu/reference/chronologies/mschronology/reviews/monthlyrev">The Monthly Review</a>, N.S., 85 (April 1818): 439.</li><li><a href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/reference/chronologies/mschronology/reviews/londonlit">The Athenæum</a>, 10 November 1832, p. 730 [review of 1818 edition, written in either 1817 or 1818]&mdash;by Percy Bysshe Shelley.</li><li><a href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/reference/chronologies/mschronology/reviews/athenaeum">The London Literary Gazette</a>, 19 November 1831, p, 740 [review of 1831 edition].</li></ul><h4><a id="Pres" name="Pres"> </a> <b>Presumption; or The Fate of Frankenstein</b> (Richard Brinsly Peake&#39;s adaptation of <i>Frankenstein</i>):</h4><ul><li><a href="/reference/chronologies/mschronology/reviews/mprev.html">The London Morning Post</a>: Tuesday, 29 July, and Wednesday, 30 July, 1823.</li></ul><h4><a id="valp" name="valp"> </a> <b>Valperga: Or, the Life and Adventures of Castruccio, Prince of Lucca</b> (London: G and W.B.
