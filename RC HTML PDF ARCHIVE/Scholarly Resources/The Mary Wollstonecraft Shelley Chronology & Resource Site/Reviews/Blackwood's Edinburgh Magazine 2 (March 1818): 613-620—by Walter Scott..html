</blockquote>
<p>This is a novel, or more properly a romantic fiction, of a nature so peculiar, that we
    ought to describe the species before attempting any account of the individual
    production.</p>
<div class="indent30">
    <p>The first general division of works of fiction, into such as bound the events they
        narrate by the actual laws of nature, and such as, passing these limits, are managed
        by marvellous and supernatural machinery, is sufficiently obvious and decided. But
        the class of marvellous romances admits of several subdivisions. In the earlier
        productions of imagination, the poet or tale-teller does not, in his own opinion,
        transgress the laws of credibility, when he introduces into his narration the
        witches, goblins, and magicians, in the existence of which he himself, as well as
        his hearers, is a firm believer. This good faith, however, passes away, and works
        turning upon the marvellous are written and read merely on account of the exercise
        which they afford to the imagination of those who, like the poet Collins, love to
        riot in the luxuriance of oriental fiction, to rove through the meanders of
        enchantment, to gaze on the magnificence of golden palaces, and to repose by the
        water-falls of Elysian gardens. In this species of composition, the marvellous is
        itself the principal and most important object both to the author and reader. To
        describe its effect upon the mind of the human personages engaged in its wonders,
        and dragged along by its machinery, is comparatively an inferior object. The hero
        and heroine, partakers of the supernatural character which belongs to their
        adventures, walk the maze of enchantment with a firm and undaunted step, and appear
        as much at their ease, amid the wonders around them, as the young fellow described
        by the Spectator, who was discovered taking a snuff with great composure in the
        midst of a stormy ocean, represented on the stage of the Opera.</p>
    <p>A more philosophical and refined use of the supernatural in works of fiction, is
        proper to that class in which the laws of nature are represented as altered, not for
        the purpose of pampering the imagination with wonders, but in order to shew the
        probable effect which the supposed miracles would produce on those who witnessed
        them. In this case, the pleasure ordinarily derived from the marvellous incidents is
        secondary to that which we extract from observing how mortals like ourselves would
        be affected, <blockquote>By scenes like these which, daring to depart<br/>
            From sober
        truth, are still to nature true.</p></blockquote>
    <p>Even in the description of his marvels, however, the author, who manages this stile
        of composition with address, gives them an indirect importance with the reader, when
        he is able to describe, with nature and with truth, the effects which they are
        calculated to produce upon his dramatis person&aelig;. It will be remembered, that
        the sapient Partridge was too wise to be terrified at the mere appearance of the
        ghost of Hamlet, whom he knew to be a man dressed up in pasteboard armour for the
        nonce: it was when he saw the "little man," as he called Garrick, so frightened,
        that a sympathetic horror took hold of him. Of this we shall presently produce some
        examples from the narrative before us. But success in this point is still
        subordinate to the author's principal object, which is less to produce an effect by
        means of the marvels of the narrations, than to open new trains and channels of
        thought, by placing men in supposed situations of an extraordinary and preternatural
        character, and then describing the mode of feeling and conduct which they are most
        likely to adopt. </p>
    <p>To make more clear the distinction we have endeavoured to draw between the marvellous
        and the effects of the marvellous, considered as separate objects, we may briefly
        invite our readers to compare the common tale of Tom Thumb with Gulliver's Voyage to
        Brobdingnag; one of the most childish fictions, with one which is pregnant with wit
        and satire, yet both turning upon the same assumed possibility of the existence of a
        pigmy among a race of giants. In the former case, when the imagination of the
        story-teller has exhausted itself in every species of hyperbole, in order to
        describe the diminutive size of his hero, the interest of the tale is at an end; but
        in the romance of the Dean of St Patrick's, the exquisite humour with which the
        natural consequences of so strange and unusual a situation is detailed, has a
        canvass on which to expand itself, as broad as the luxuriance even of the author's
        talents could desire. Gulliver stuck into a marrow bone, and Master Thomas Thumb's
        disastrous fall into the bowl of hasty-pudding, are, in the general outline, kindred
        incidents; but the jest is exhausted in the latter case, when the accident is told;
        whereas in the former, it lies not so much in the comparatively pigmy size which
        subjected Gulliver to such a ludicrous misfortune, as in the tone of grave and
        dignified feeling with which he resents the disgrace of the incident. </p>
    <p>In the class of fictitious narrations to which we allude, the author opens a sort of
        account-current with the reader; drawing upon him, in the first place, for credit to
        that degree of the marvellous which he proposes to employ; and becoming virtually
        bound, in consequence of this indulgence, that his personages shall conduct
        themselves, in the extraordinary circumstances in which they are placed, according
        to the rules of probability, and the nature of the human heart. In this view, the
            <i>probable </i>is far from being laid out of sight even amid the wildest freaks
        of imagination; on the contrary, we grant the extraordinary postulates which the
        author demands as the foundation of his narrative, only on condition of his deducing
        the consequences with logical precision. </p>
    <p>We have only to add, that this class of fiction has been sometimes applied to the
        purposes of political satire, and sometimes to the general illustration of the
        powers and workings of the human mind. Swift, Bergerac, and others, have employed it
        for the former purpose, and a good illustration of the latter is the well known
        Saint Leon of William Godwin. In this latter work, assuming the possibility of the
        transmutation of metals and of the <i>elixir vit&aelig;</i>, the author has deduced,
        in the course of his narrative, the probable consequences of the possession of such
        secrets upon the fortunes and mind of him who might enjoy them. Frankenstein is a
        novel upon the same plan with Saint Leon; it is said to be written by Mr Percy
        Bysshe Shelley, who, if we are rightly informed, is son-in-law to Mr Godwin; and it
        is inscribed to that ingenious author. </p>
    <p>In the preface, the author lays claim to rank his work among the class which we have
        endeavoured to describe. <blockquote><p>"The event on which this fiction is founded has been
            supposed by Dr. Darwin, and some of the physiological writers of Germany, as not
            of impossible occurrence. I shall not be supposed as according the remotest
            degree of serious faith to such an imagination; yet, in assuming it as the basis
            of a work of fancy, I have not considered myself as merely weaving a series of
            supernatural terrors. The event on which the interest of the story depends is
            exempt from the disadvantages of a mere tale of spectres or enchantment. It was
            recommended by the novelty of the situations which it developes; and, however
            impossible as a physical fact, affords a point of view to the imagination for
            the delineating of human passions more comprehensive and commanding than any
            which the ordinary relations of existing events can yield.</p>  <p>"I have thus
        endeavoured to preserve the truth of the elementary principles of human nature,
        while I have not scrupled to innovate upon their combinations. The <i>Iliad, </i>
        the tragic poetry of Greece,&mdash;Shakespeare, in the <i>Tempest</i> and
            <i>Midsummer Night's Dream,&mdash;</i>and most especially Milton, in <i>Paradise
            Lost</i>, conform to this rule; and the most humble novellist, who seeks to
        confer or receive amusement from his labours, may, without presumption, apply to
        prose fiction a license, or rather a rule, from the adoption of which so many
        exquisite combinations of human feeling have resulted in the highest specimens of
        poetry."</p></blockquote>
    <p>We shall, without farther preface, detail the particulars of the singular story,
        which is thus introduced. </p>
    <p>A vessel, engaged in a voyage of discovery to the North Pole, having become embayed
        among the ice at a very high latitude, the crew, and particularly the captain or
        owner of the ship, are surprised at perceiving a gigantic form pass at some distance
        from them, on a car drawn by dogs, in a place where they conceived no mortal could
        exist. While they are speculating on this singular apparition, a thaw commences, and
        disengages them from their precarious situation. On the next morning they pick up,
        upon a floating fragment of the broken ice, a sledge like that they had before seen,
        with a human being in the act of perishing. He is with difficulty recalled to life,
        and proves to be a young man of the most amiable manners and extended acquirements,
        but, extenuated by fatigue, wrapped in dejection and gloom of the darkest kind. The
        captain of the ship, a gentleman whose ardent love of science had engaged him on an
        expedition so dangerous, becomes attached to the stranger, and at length extorts
        from him the wonderful tale of his misery, which he thus attains the means of
        preserving from oblivion. </p>
    <p>Frankenstein describes himself as a native of Geneva, born and bred up in the bosom
        of domestic love and affection. His father&mdash;his friend Henry
        Clerval&mdash;Elizabeth, an orphan of extreme beauty and talent, bred up in the same
        house with him, are possessed of all the qualifications which could render him happy
        as a son, a friend, and a lover. In the course of his studies he becomes acquainted
        with the works of Cornelius Agrippa, and other authors treating of occult
        philosophy, on whose venerable tomes modern neglect has scattered no slight portion
        of dust. Frankenstein remains ignorant of the contempt in which his favourites are
        held, until he is separated from his family to pursue his studies at the university
        of Ingolstadt. Here he is introduced to the wonders of modern chemistry, as well as
        of natural philosophy, in all its branches. Prosecuting these sciences into their
        innermost and most abstruse recesses, with unusual talent and unexampled success, he
        at length makes that discovery on which the marvellous part of the work is grounded.
        His attention had been especially bound to the structure of the human frame and of
        the principle of life. He engaged in physiological researches of the most recondite
        and abstruse nature, searching among charnel vaults and in dissection rooms, and the
        objects most insupportable to the delicacy of human feelings, in order to trace the
        minute chain of causation which takes place in the change from life to death, and
        from death to life. In the midst of this darkness a light broke in upon him.</p>
    <blockquote>"Remember," says his narrative, "I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun
        does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is true.
        Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct
        and probable. After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in
        discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of
        bestowing animation upon lifeless matter." </blockquote>
    <p>This wonderful discovery impelled Frankenstein to avail himself of his art, by the
        creation (if we dare to call it so) or formation of a living and sentient being. As
        the minuteness of the parts formed a great difficulty, he constructed the figure
        which he proposed to animate of a gigantic size, that is, about eight feet high, and
        strong and large in proportion. The feverish anxiety with which the young
        philosopher toils through the horrors of his secret task, now dabbling among the
        unhallowed reliques of the grave, and now torturing the living animal to animate the
        lifeless clay, are described generally, but with great vigour of language. Although
        supported by the hope of producing a new species that should bless him as his
        creator and source, he nearly sinks under the protracted labour, and loathsome
        details, of the work he had undertaken; and scarcely is his fatal enthusiasm
        sufficient to support his nerves, or animate his resolution. The result of this
        extraordinary discovery it would be unjust to give in any words save those of the
        author. We shall give it at length, as an excellent specimen of the style and manner
        of the work.</p>
    <blockquote><p>"It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils.
        With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life
        around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at
        my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the
        panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the
        half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed
        hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.</p>
    <p>"How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom
        with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in
        proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful!&mdash;Great
        God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his
        hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but
        these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that
        seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set,
        his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips. </p>
    <p>"The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human
        nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing
        life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I
        had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had
        finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled
        my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of
        the room, and continued a long time traversing my bedchamber, unable to compose my
        mind to sleep. At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured; and
        I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of
        forgetfulness. But it was in vain: I slept indeed, but I was disturbed by the
        wildest dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the
        streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her; but as I imprinted
        the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features
        appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my
        arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds
        of the flannel. I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead,
        my teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow
        light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters, I beheld the
        wretch&mdash;the miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the
        bed and; his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened,
        and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might
        have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me,
        but I escaped, and rushed down stairs. I took refuge in the court-yard belonging to
        the house which I inhabited; where I remained during the rest of the night, walking
        up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing
        each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which
        I had so miserably given life. </p>
    <p>"Oh! no mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy again endued
        with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had gazed on him while
        unfinished; he was ugly then; but when those muscles and joints were rendered
        capable of motion, it became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived. </p>
    <p>"I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly, that I
        felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly sank to the ground through
        languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of
        disappointment: dreams, that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space,
        were now become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so
        complete! </p>
    <p>"Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned, and discovered to my sleepless and aching
        eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which indicated the
        sixth hour. The porter opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my
        asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought
        to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my
        view. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to
        hurry on, although wetted by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky.
    </p>
<p>"I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring, by bodily exercise, to
    ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the streets without any clear
    conception of where I was or what I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of
    fear; and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me: </p>
<p>Like one who, on a lonely road, <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;Doth walk in fear and dread, <br />
    And, having once turn'd round, walks on, <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;And turns no more his head;
    <br /> Because he knows a frightful fiend <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;Doth close behind him
    tread.*" *Coleridge's "Ancient Mariner" </p></blockquote>
<div class="indent30">
    <p>He is relieved by the arrival of the diligence from Geneva, out of which jumps his
        friend Henry Clerval, who had come to spend a season at the college. Compelled to
        carry Clerval to his lodgings, which, he supposed, must still contain the prodigious
        and hideous specimen of his Promethean art, his feelings are again admirably
        described, allowing always for the extraordinary cause supposed to give them birth. </p>
    <blockquote>"I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to allude to,
        the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a quick pace, and we soon
        arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver, that the
        creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive, and walking
        about. I dreaded to behold this monster; but I feared still more that Henry should
        see him. Entreating him therefore to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the
        stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the lock of the door
        before I recollected myself. I then paused; and a cold shivering came over me. I
        threw the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a
        spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I
        stepped fearfully in: the apartment was empty; and my bed-room was also freed from
        its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have
        befallen me; but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my
        hands for joy, and ran down to Clerval." </blockquote>
    <p>The animated monster is heard of no more for a season. Frankenstein pays the penalty
        of his rash researches into the <i>arcana </i>of human nature, in a long illness,
        after which the two friends prosecute their studies for two years in uninterrupted
        quiet. Frankenstein, as may be supposed, abstaining, with a sort of abhorrence, from
        those in which he had once so greatly delighted. At the lapse of this period, he is
        made acquainted with a dreadful misfortune which has befallen his family, by the
        violent death of his youngest brother, an interesting child, who, while straying
        from his keeper, had been murdered by some villain in the walks of Plainpalais. The
        marks of strangling were distinct on the neck of the unfortunate infant, and a gold
        ornament which it wore, and which was amissing, was supposed to have been the
        murderer's motive for perpetrating the crime. </p>
    <p>At this dismal intelligence, Frankenstein flies to Geneva, and impelled by fraternal
        affection, visits the spot where this horrid accident had happened. In the midst of
        a thunder-storm, with which the evening had closed, and just as he had attained the
        fatal spot on which Victor[sic] had been murdered, a flash of lightning displays to
        him the hideous demon to which he had given life, gliding towards a neighbouring
        precipice. Another flash shews him hanging among the cliffs, up which he scrambles
        with far more mortal agility, and is seen no more. The inference, that this being
        was the murderer of his brother, flashed on Frankenstein's mind as irresistibly as
        the lightning itself, and he was tempted to consider the creature whom he had cast
        among mankind to work, it would seem, acts of horror and depravity, nearly in the
        light of his own vampire let loose from the grave, and destined to destroy all that
        was dear to him. </p>
    <p>Frankenstein was right in his apprehensions. Justine, the maid to whom the youthful
        Victor had been intrusted, is found to be in possession of the golden trinket which
        had been taken from the child's person; and, by a variety of combining circumstances
        of combined evidence, she is concluded to be the murtheress, and as such condemned
        to death, and executed. It does not appear that Frankenstein attempted to avert her
        fate, by communicating his horrible secret; but, indeed, who would have given him
        credit, or in what manner could he have supported his tale? </p>
    <p>In a solitary expedition to the top of Mount Aveyron, undertaken to dispel the
        melancholy which clouded his mind, Frankenstein unexpectedly meets with the monster
        he had animated, who compels him to a conference and a parley. The material demon
        gives an account, at great length, of his history since his animation, of the mode
        in which he acquired various points of knowledge, and of the disasters which befell
        him, when, full of benevolence and philanthropy, he endeavoured to introduce himself
        into human society. The most material part of his education was acquired in a
        ruinous pig-stye&mdash;a Lyceum which this strange student occupied, he assures us,
        for a good many months undiscovered, and in constant observance of the motions of an
        amiable family, from imitating whom he learns the use of language, and other
        accomplishments, much more successfully than Caliban, though the latter had a
        conjuror to his tutor. This detail is not only highly improbable, but it is
        injudicious, as its unnecessary minuteness tends rather too much to familiarize us
        with the being whom it regards, and who loses, by this <i>lengthy </i>oration, some
        part of the mysterious sublimity annexed to his first appearance. The result is,
        this monster, who was at first, according to his own account, but a harmless
        monster, becomes ferocious and malignant, in consequence of finding all his
        approaches to human society repelled with injurious violence and offensive marks of
        disgust. Some papers concealed in his dress acquainted him with the circumstances
        and person to whom he owed his origin; and the hate which he felt towards the whole
        human race was now concentrated in resentment against Frankenstein. In this humour
        he murdered the child, and disposed the picture so as to induce a belief of
        Justine's guilt. The last is an inartificial circumstance: this indirect mode of
        mischief was not likely to occur to the being the narrative presents to us. The
        conclusion of this strange narrative is a peremptory demand on the part of the
        demon, as he is usually termed, that Frankenstein should renew his fearful
        experiment, and create for him an helpmate hideous as himself, who should have no
        pretense for shunning his society. On this condition he promises to withdraw to some
        distant desert, and shun the human race for ever. If his creator shall refuse him
        this consolation, he vows the prosecution of the most frightful vengeance.
        Frankenstein, after a long pause of reflection, imagines he sees that the justice
        due to the miserable being, as well as to mankind, who might be exposed to so much
        misery, from the power and evil dispositions of a creature who could climb
        perpendicular cliffs and exist among glaciers, demanded that he should comply with
        the request; and granted his promise accordingly. </p>
    <p>Frankenstein retreats to one of the distant islands of the Orcades, that in secrecy
        and solitude he might resume his detestable and ill-omened labours, which now were
        doubly hideous, since he was deprived of the enthusiasm with which he formerly
        prosecuted them. As he is sitting one night in his laboratory, and recollecting the
        consequences of his first essay in the Promethean art, he beings to hesitate
        concerning the right he had to form another being as malignant and bloodthirsty as
        that he had unfortunately already animated. It is evident that he would thereby give
        the demon the means of propagating a hideous race, superior to mankind in strength
        and hardihood, who might render the very existence of the present human race a
        condition precarious and full of terror. Just as these reflections lead him to the
        conclusion that his promise was criminal, and ought not to be kept, he looks up, and
        sees, by the light of the moon, the demon at the casement. 
    <blockquote><p>"A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task
        which he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered
        in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; and he
        now came to mark my progress, and claim the fulfillment of my promise. </p>
    <p>"As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and
        treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another
        like to him, and, trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on which I was
        engaged. The wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he
        depended for happiness, and, with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew." </p></blockquote>
    At a subsequent interview, described with the same wild energy, all treaty is broken
        off betwixt Frankenstein and the work of his hands, and they part on terms of open
        and declared hatred and defiance. Our limits do not allow us to trace in detail the
        progress of the demon's vengeance. Clerval falls its first victim, and under
        circumstances which had very nearly conducted the new Prometheus to the gallows as
        his supposed murderer. Elizabeth, his bride, is next strangled on her wedding-night;
        his father dies of grief; and at length Frankenstein, driven to despair and
        distraction, sees nothing left for him in life but vengeance on the singular cause
        of his misery. With this purpose he pursues the monster from clime to clime,
        receiving only such intimations of his being on the right scent, as served to shew
        that the demon delighted in thus protracting his fury and his sufferings. At length,
        after the flight and pursuit had terminated among the frost-fogs, and icy islands of
        the northern oceans, and just when he had a glimpse of his adversary, the ground sea
        was heard, the ice gave way, and Frankenstein was placed in the perilous situation
        in which he is first introduced to the reader. </p>
    <p>Exhausted by his sufferings, but still breathing vengeance against the being which
        was at once his creature and his persecutor, this unhappy victim to physiological
        discovery expires just as the clearing away of the ice permits Captain Walton's
        vessel to hoist sail for the return to Britain. At midnight, the daemon, who had
        been his destroyer, is discovered in the cabin, lamenting over the corpse of the
        person who gave him being. To Walton he attempts to justify his resentment towards
        the human race, while, at the same time, he acknowledges himself a wretch who had
        murdered the lovely and the helpless, and pursued to irremediably ruin his creator,
        the select specimen of all that was worthy of love and admiration. </p>
    <blockquote><p>"Fear not," he continues, addressing the astonished Walton, "that I shall be the
        instrument of future mischief. My work is nearly complete. Neither yours nor any
        man's death is needed to consummate the series of my being, and accomplish that
        which must be done; but it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to
        perform this sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice-raft which brought me
        hither, and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my
        funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford
        no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch, who would create such another as I
        have been.&mdash;"</p>
    <p>"He sprung from the cabin-window, as he said this, upon the ice-raft which lay close
        to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves, and lost in darkness and
        distance." </p></blockquote>
    Whether this singular being executed his purpose or no must necessarily remain an
        uncertainty, unless the voyage of discovery to the north pole should throw any light
        on the subject. </p>
    <p>So concludes this extraordinary tale, in which the author seems to us to disclose
        uncommon powers of poetic imagination. The feeling with which we perused the
        unexpected and fearful, yet, allowing the possibility of the event, very natural
        conclusion of Frankenstein's experiment, shook a little even our firm nerves;
        although such and so numerous have been the expedients for exciting terror employed
        by the romantic writers of the age, that the reader may adopt Macbeth's words with a
        slight alteration: 

        <blockquote><l>"We have supp'd full with horrors:<br/> 
            Direness, familiar to our "callous" thoughts,<br/>
     Cannot once startle us." </blockquote>
<div class="indent30">
    It is no slight merit in our eyes, that the tale, though wild in incident, is written
        in plain and forcible English, without exhibiting that mixture of hyperbolical
        Germanisms with which tales of wonder are usually told, as if it were necessary that
        the language should be as extravagant as the fiction. The ideas of the author are
        always clearly as well as forcibly expressed; and his descriptions of landscape have
        in them the choice requisites of truth, freshness, precision, and beauty. The
        self-education of the monster, considering the slender opportunities of acquiring
        knowledge that he possessed, we have already noticed as improbable and overstrained.
        That he should have not only learned to speak, but to read, and, for aught we know,
        to write&mdash;that he should have become acquainted with Werter, with Plutarch's
        Lives, and with Paradise Lost, by listening through a hole in a wall, seems as
        unlikely as that he should have acquired, in the same way, the problems of Euclid,
        or the art of book-keeping by single and double entry. The author has however two
        apologies&mdash;the first, the necessity that his monster should acquire those
        endowments, and the other, that his neighbours were engaged in teaching the language
        of the country to a young foreigner. His progress in self-knowledge, and the
        acquisition of information, is, after all, more wonderful than that of Hai Eben
        Yokhdan, or Automathes, or the hero of the little romance called The Child of
        Nature, one of which works might perhaps suggest the train of ideas followed by the
        author of Frankenstein. We should also be disposed, in support of the principles
        with which we set out, to question whether the monster, how tall, agile, and strong
        however, could have perpetrated so much mischief undiscovered, or passed through so
        many countries without being secured, either on account of his crimes, or for the
        benefit of some such speculator as Mr Polito, who would have been happy to have
        added to his museum so curious a specimen of natural history. But as we have
        consented to admit the leading incident of the work, perhaps some of our readers may
        be of opinion, that to stickle upon lesser improbabilities, is to incur the censure
        bestowed by the Scottish proverb on those who start at straws after swallowing
            <i>windlings </i>. </p>
    <p>The following lines, which occur in the second volume, mark, we think, that the
        author possesses the same facility in expressing himself in verse as in prose. 

        <blockquote><p>We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.<br/>
     We rise; one wand'ring
    thought pollutes
    the day. 
    We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh, or weep,<br/>
            Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;<br/>
    It is the same: for, be it
    joy or sorrow,<br/>
            The path of its departure still is free.<br/>
    Man's
    yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;<br/>
    Nought may endure but
    mutability!</p></blockquote>
<div class="indent30">Upon the whole, the work impresses us with a high idea of the
        author's original genius and happy power of expression. We shall be delighted to
        hear that he has aspired to the <i>paullo majora</i>; and, in the meantime,
        congratulate our readers upon a novel which excites new reflections and untried
        sources of emotion. If Gray's definition of Paradise, to lie on a couch, namely, and
        read new novels, come any thing near truth, no small praise is due to him, who, like
        the author of Frankenstein, has enlarged the sphere of that fascinating enjoyment.
