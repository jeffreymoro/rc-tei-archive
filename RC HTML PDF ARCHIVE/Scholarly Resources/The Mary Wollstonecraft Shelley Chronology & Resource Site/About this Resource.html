    <h2><i>About This Site</i></h2>
    </center>
    The main purpose of this site is to provide information on Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, especially material that might not be readily available or accessible in every library. Currently we offer a chronology of Mary Shelley's life and work and several contemporary reviews of her novels, as well as reviews of the plays inspired by <i>Frankenstein</i>. As with most of the web, this page is continuously developing, and I continue to check and refine the dates in the chronology. Please keep checking this page for further notes, reviews, and information on MWS.
