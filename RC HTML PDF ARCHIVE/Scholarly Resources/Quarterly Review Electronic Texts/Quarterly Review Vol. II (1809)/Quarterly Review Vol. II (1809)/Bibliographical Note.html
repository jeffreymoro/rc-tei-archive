    <p align="left"><b>Editorial Practice</b></p>
    <p align="left">NB Different texts were used for the OCR process and for editorial correction. Text in the Roman alphabet was corrected to the copy text described above, but the images used to represent non-Roman text were taken from the original scans, which have been used to produce the PDF version.</p>
    <p align="left">Spelling and punctuation have been lightly modernized.</p>
    <p align="left">Page numbers of the copy text are reproduced in square brackets at the end of the page to which they refer.</p>
    <p align="left">The PDF file does not reproduce the copy text used.</p>
    <p align="left">The etext was prepared by Dr David Jenkins-Handy and Dr Gavin Budge, School of English, University of Central England, Birmingham, B42 2SU, UK. Scanned images were made by the staff of UCE Electronic Library (UCEEL).</p>
