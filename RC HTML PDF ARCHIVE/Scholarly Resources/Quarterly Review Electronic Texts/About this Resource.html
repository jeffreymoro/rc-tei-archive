    About This Resource</h3>
    <p align="left">This resource aims to make electronic texts of the <i>Quarterly Review</i> available from its inception in 1809 up till 1822, when the involvement of William Gifford, its first editor, ceased. The <i>Quarterly Review</i> in particular was chosen for digitization partly because of its cultural centrality, and partly because of its close ties to literary Romanticism through the involvement of Walter Scott and Robert Southey. It was preferred to its main rival, the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, because, whilst there have been a number of studies of the early days of the <i>Edinburgh</i>, very little work on the <i>Quarterly</i> during the period of Gifford's editorship has so far been undertaken. For a more in-depth discussion of the importance of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, please consult the <a href="/reference/qr_budge/intro.html">introduction</a>.</p>
    <p align="left">Early issues of the <i>Quarterly Review</i> were kept in type, and reprinted with alterations over a period of several years, without listing any details of these new impressions. In the absence of a critical recension of the text, bibliographical notes for each volume of the <i>Quarterly Review</i> have been included to give as many details as possible about the copy text, and the relationship to it of the etext here published. See the individual contents pages for each volume to access the biliographical notes.</p>
