    <h2>The Contents of Shelley's<br/>
    Notebooks in the Bodleian Library<br/>
    <br/></h2>
    <b>Compiled by Tatsuo Tokoo</b><br/>
    Mark-up by Melissa Sites<br/>
    <br/></center>
    <p>There are altogether 22 Shelley notebooks in the Bodleian Library: i.e. MSS. Shelley d. 1 through d. 3 and e. 1 through e. 4; and MSS. Shelley adds. e. 6 through e. 20. The following list of their contents is the result of page-by-page examination of each notebook. The list is primarily intended as a tool for studying the relationship, chronological and otherwise, of Shelley's works to each other and to his reading. It will also afford some clue for dating them. I exclude from this list the contents of MS. Shelley d. 2 and MS. Shelley adds. e. 13, since they contain none in Shelley's handwriting. MS. Shelley d. 2 is occupied by Mary's mythological dramas Proserpine and Midas, into which are inserted two lyrics each by Shelley.* MS. Shelley adds. e. 13 is occupied by an account in Mary's hand of the death of the Cenci family.**</p>
    <p>The titles of Shelley's works are those adopted in The Complete Poetical Works of P. B. Shelley, ed. T. Hutchinson (1905) for poetical works and in The Complete Works of P. B. Shelley, ed. R. Ingpen and W. Peck (1926-30), Julian edition, for prose works (and for a few poetical works not included in Hutchinson's edition). All entries are rough drafts and in pen unless otherwise stated. I use the term "fair draft" in the sense of a MS. much neater than a rough draft but still in an intermediate stage in the evolution of the work and "fair copy" in the sense of a completed MS. ready for publication or presentation. Cancelled words or phrases are surrounded by square brackets ([ ]) and undecipherable words by angle brackets (&lt; &gt;). Line division is shown by a virgule (/). Manuscripts are quoted by permission of the Bodleian Library, Oxford.</p>
    <p>I have tried to be as accurate as possible, but errors both of commission and of omission should inevitably have crept in.</p>

    <p>NOTE: This is a revised version of my article originally published in Humanities: Bulletin of the Faculty of Letters, Kyoto Prefectural University [ISSN 0075-7381], No. 36 (December 1984), pp. 1-32. I have incorporated corrections for Bodleian MS. Shelley adds. e. 17 suggested by Nora Crook of Anglia Polytechnic University, Cambridge. An added feature of this revised version is an Appendix in which I list the contents of Bodleian MS. Shelley adds. c. 4 -- a box containing loose sheets of Shelley's verse and prose. I was assisted by Dr. Bruce Barker-Benfield of the Bodleian Library in describing folders in which those sheets are kept. [Tatsuo Tokoo, 28 Nov. 1996]</p>

    ** This is probably the "translation of the Italian Mss." to which Shelley refers in his letter to T. L. Peacock, c. 20 July 1819.
