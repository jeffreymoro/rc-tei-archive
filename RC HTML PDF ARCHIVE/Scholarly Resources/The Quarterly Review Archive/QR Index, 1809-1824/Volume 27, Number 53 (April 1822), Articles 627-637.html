    <p class="smallprint">[Booksellers' notes on <em>Views of
    Society and Manners in America</em>: 'The author and her sister
    visited America in 1819-1820: she put down a record of her tour
    in a series of letters home to Scotland, later published in
    order to "awaken European reformers to the great principles
    laid down in American government." Wright later made her home
    in the United States and played a large part in the social
    causes of her day.' 'Fanny Wright was born in Scotland in 1795
    and came to the U.S. in 1818, spending her adult life here
    working for women's suffrage and the abolition of slavery.
    Notable among her endeavours was the establishment of Nashoba,
    a colony outside Memphis, Tennessee, to work for the education
    and freedom of slaves.']</p>

    <p class="smallprint">The following evidence is published here
    for the first time. On p.115 of the article, the author states
    he has expressed his opinion on insanity in other essays, by
    implication in the <i>QR</i>, possibly #391 and #564,
    attributed to David Uwins. The author's argument is a
    continuation of these articles in its advocacy of physiological
    over moral explanations for insanity; like these other
    articles, there is mention here of the dominance of Quaker
    moralists in the field of study.&nbsp;On page 120-21 of this
    article, Charles Lamb's 'Confessions of a Drunkard' is quoted.
    The writer calls it a 'fearful picture of the consequences of
    intemperance, and which we have reason to know is a true tale.'
    The passage called forth a response in the <i>London
    Magazine</i> 6 (Aug. 1822), 99, in a note written perhaps by
    Lamb himself which does not deny the incident cited but abuses
    the <i>QR</i> for the use it makes of it. Gooch's name was
    introduced to WG by Southey in 1813. See Murray MS., WG to JM,
    Feb. 1813 [numbered 214].</p>

    <p class="smallprint">The following evidence is published here
    for the first time. Wales MS. 21743C (17/1), WG to Edward
    Copleston, 27 June [1822]: 'Senior has given me a clever legal
    Art. It is good, too, because it touches upon [Byron's] Cain,
    on whom I have again failed to procure a paper ....' (Cf.
    pp.123-24 and p.135 of the article.) Bodleian MS. d. 130 (ff.
    58-59), Thomas Arnold to John Taylor Coleridge, 24 Aug. 1822:
    '... the last Number of the Quarterly contains a fresh Proof of
    the disgraceful Influence exercised by Murray over it.' The
    Oriel Noetics' circle, to which Arnold belonged, despised
    Byron. Their disgust predisposed them against Murray, Byron's
    publisher. The article deals in part with Murray's effort to
    protect his Byron copyright against piracy.</p>
