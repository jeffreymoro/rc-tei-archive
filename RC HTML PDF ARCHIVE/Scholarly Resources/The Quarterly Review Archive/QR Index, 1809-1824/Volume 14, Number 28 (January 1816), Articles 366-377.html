    1810. The whole crew reached shore, but all were made slaves by
    the Arabs, and the captain and mate killed. Adams was taken far
    to the eastward and visited Timbuctoo on a trading expedition;
    he may have been only the second or third European or American
    to describe that city. He was transferred from owner to owner,

    note, slightly modified, with quotation from <i>DNB</i>: 'The
    removal of the marbles from the Parthenon, which was not part
    of the Earl's original plan (he was in Greece to record them
    and make casts) began in the summer of 1801 out of fear for the
    marauding Turks, with the permission of the local authorities.
    Getting them back to England did not occur without difficulty
    (a shipwreck and an expensive recovery of some of the marbles
    by divers were just part of the problem) and the task was not
    completed until 1812 when the last 80 cases arrived in London.
    "No inconsiderable outcry was raised against his conduct in
    connection with his removal of the antiquities. The propriety
    of his official actions was called into question; he was
    accused of vandalism, of rapacity, and dishonesty. Elgin
    accordingly thought it advisable to throw open his collections
    to public view, and arranged them in his own house in Park
    Lane. After some preliminary negotiations, a select committee
    of the House of Commons was appointed in 1816 to inquire into
    the desirability of acquiring the Elgin collection for the
    nation. The committee recommended its purchase for the sum of
    35,000 pounds, and in July 1816 an act was passed giving effect
    to their proposal" (<i>DNB</i>). The Report to Parliament is a
    detailed account of the entire affair, with testimony by
    William Hamilton, John Flaxman, Richard Payne Knight, and
    Richard Westmacott, among others.']</span></span></p>
