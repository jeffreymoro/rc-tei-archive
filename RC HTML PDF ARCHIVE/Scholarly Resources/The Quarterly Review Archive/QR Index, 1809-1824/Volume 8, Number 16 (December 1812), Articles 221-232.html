    <p><span class="smallprint">Discussion of this article is
    published in <i>VPR</i> 28. The following information and
    evidence is published here for the first time. WG wrote to JM
    in March 1813 to tell him that the Secretary of State of the
    India Board of Control (Thomas Courtenay) was waiting for him
    with a letter from the Prime Minister asking for treatment in
    the <i>QR</i> favourable to the East India Company question,
    which is to say supportive of its monopoly of the India trade.
    (The Company's charter was up for renewal in 1814.) The
    following day, Government sent John Wilson Croker to WG to
    plead its case. WG proudly stood up for the <i>QR</i>'s
    independence by insisting that the reviewer would take his own
    line on the issue.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">Murray MS., WG to JM, [Mar. 1813;
    letter Number '215']: 'On my return I found the Secretary of
    State of the India Board of Control [Thomas Courtenay] waiting
    for me with this pretty modest letter&#8212;The Government
    People must be out of their senses to ask such
    things&#8212;Send back the letter this evening, &amp;, if you
    like, you may add your answer&#8212;if not, it is not difficult
    to know what to say. I have appointed to-morrow evening for the
    interview.' The article continues the discussion of the Charter
    from #213, which is by George Ellis. The author of the article
    refers on page 272n to article #85 and on page 265 to article
    #298, both of which are by Barrow. Barrow's <i>Travels in
    China</i> is quoted on p.276. It was Barrow's signature
    practice in his <i>QR</i> articles to refer to his own works.
    Note the extended discussion of China (pp.271-79). The author
    expresses familiarity with Admiralty (p.286). Note adoption of
    Buchanan's arguments in favour of an Anglo-Indian Church
    establishment (p.285); Barrow expresses support of Buchanan's
    position elsewhere. Fetter: George Ellis, cites 'Murray', Ellis
    letters (but see #213 above and #232 below).</span></p>

    have produced the Luddite feeling in the mob.' BL Add. MS.,

    Jan. 1813: 'You will see a paper of mine in the next Quarterly
    upon this subject [the lower classes]. It enters into the moral

    picture, which I shall be very sorry if any misjudging timidity
    should weaken or suppress.' BL Add. MS., 28603 [no folio number

    <span class="smallprint">In attributing the article to
    Whitaker, Shine cites JM III's Register and Nicholas xxix.
    Shine also quotes from Murray MS., WG to JM, [1813]: 'I like
    the worthy Dr's Art on Belsham prodigiously.' Shine
    misleadingly suggests that 'The words <i>The Dr</i> frequently
    stand for John Ireland.'&nbsp;</span></span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint"><span style=
    "font-weight: normal">The following evidence is published here
    for the first time. In Murray MS., WG to JM, [1813], Shine
    misses useful identifying information, for the letter
    continues: 'Horsley I have not yet looked at.' Horsley is #234,
    by Whitaker. The additional sentence therefore can be read as
    buttressing the attribution to Whitaker as WG is continuing his
    review with JM of the state of Whitaker's upcoming
    contributions. Murray MS., Book Loans Register: the book
    reviewed was sent to 'Revd. Dr Whitaker' on 14 Sept. 1812.
    Murray MS., Thomas Dunham Whitaker to JM, 22 Dec. 1812, will
    review 'Belsham'. Cf. the author's statement, 'The work before
    us, like many others of the present day, in the shape of
    narrative, is properly controversial' (p.433) with a similar
    statement at #183 p.92, which is also probably by Whitaker.
    Ends with: 'We conclude with ....,' which is characteristic of
    Whitaker.</span></span></p>

    [Robert William Hay letters], WG to John Barrow, 6 Feb. 1813:
    'I send you the commencement of the Russ. Art.' WG says that he
    must make omissions, including expunging a negative comment on
    Clarke, and refers to the article as the work of Barrow's
    'young friend.' Hay worked with Barrow at the Admiralty. Murray
    MS. [Hay letters], WG to Barrow, Wed. [1813]: 'I send you a
    second batch of our Russian Art.' Murray MS. [Hay letters], WG
    to Robert William Hay, 13 Feb. and 16 Feb. 1813, sends the
    first slips of 'Russia'. Murray MS. [Hay letters], WG to
    Barrow, Thursday [1813], sends the conclusion of 'Russia' and
    says he had to put Clarke in a note [see pg. 482 of the
    article]. Murray MS., WG to Hay, Thursday 1813, says JM has
    just made ready the remainder of the 'Russian Article.' The
    article is referred to at #329, which is by Hay. As minor
    supporting evidence, note the author's use of dashes and
    parentheses, and the phrases, 'We now proceed to . . .,'
    'Before we proceed to . . . .' characteristic of Hay. An
    article cited as 'Russian &lt;Campaign&gt;' is claimed by
    Croker in only one of his Clements Library MS. lists; it is
