    <p class="smallprint">[Bookseller's note, silently modified:
    'Samuel Meyrick (1783-1848), was born into a family with a
    commercial tradition as agents to the British Army. His father,
    John, passed on to him a love of military ceremonial, archery,
    and the collecting of antiquities, including arms and armour.
    Samuel began to collect pieces of armour and study them,
    becoming enough of an authority to advise theatre producers on
    costume and help artists lend authenticity to their paintings.
    As his growing collection began to attract attention, he
    received visits from George IV, from famous artists, and from
    Sir Walter Scott. Eventually he was asked to rearrange the
    armour at the Tower of London and at Windsor Palace. He was
    later knighted. His reputation was made with the publication of
    <em>A Critical Inquiry</em>, a sumptuous production with the
    plates coloured by R. Bridgens after drawings by the author and
    Charles Hamilton Smith, with whom he had collaborated on
    <em>The Costume of the Original Inhabitants of the British
    Isles</em>.']</p>

    account includes a great deal of information on Vietnam and the
    Vietnamese, and on Batavia and the Philippines.' 'Written by a
    Lieutenant in the United States Navy, this volume was not
    originally intended for publication, but written as a Memoir to
    be deposited in the archives of the "East India Marine Society
    of Salem." Includes a lovely fold-out map of the river Don-Nai,
    from Cape St. James to the City of Saigon, as well as several
    outstanding etchings.' 'The White narrative is a rare book, and
    an important one. White sailed from Salem in 1819 on a joint
    venture with the brig <em>Franklin</em> and the ship

    <p class="smallprint">[Bookseller's note, silently modified:
    'Charles Dupin (1784-1873). His study of the technical
    installations and public works of the United Kingdom includes
    important contemporary information on the transport system and
    its maintenance, with substantial chapters on Scottish canals
    and ports. The first part of the work is devoted to a detailed
    study of the army and navy and their installations, training,
    and weaponry. When he began to gather material for his work,
    Dupin had been faced with some opposition by the British
    authorities, who feared that sensitive information might be
    used by the French military, but later they conceded the
    scientific interest of his work, and allowed him to continue.
    He places particular emphasis on the canal network and includes
    detailed descriptions of all the major routes through the towns
    and cities of Great Britain. At this time canals were the main
    form of transport; the railway network was in its early stages.
    He also discusses the maintenance and building of bridges, in
    particular in London. Dupin gives detailed histories of the
    construction of the bridges of Westminster, Blackfriars and the
    Strand. In the final volume, Dupin discusses the ports of the
    British Isles. He studies the design and construction of the
    ports in general and then details all the major ports of
    England, Scotland and Wales with short histories of each.']</p>

    you what my brother Henry says to me in his last letter

    in Brakeman is cited in <i>Wellesley Index</i> II. Wellesley
    Index II states, 'Regarding the attr. to George Taylor,

    prominent early 19th century British social reformer. This, his
    first book, led to the creation of the Society for the
    Reformation of Prison Discipline and considerably influenced
    the amelioration of prison conditions.']</p>

    <p class="smallprint">The following evidence and information is
    published here for the first time. Murray MS., Cash Book
    1821-24: the same person was paid for articles 3, 4, and 9 in
    this Number. Murray MS., WG to JM, 10 July 1824: 'I have done
    with Egypt. It is an important Art. indeed too important to be
    rashly handled, and our friend is the most clashing of all
    politicians&#8212;nothing stands in his way. I have tried to
    make it safe&#8212;still it is sufficiently querulous.' Murray
    MS., John Barrow to JM, 30 Apr. 1824, refers to the article as
    his. The author of the article states on page 482: 'To these
    notices we are enabled to add, from documents in our
    possession, some circumstances of considerable interest, from a
    source equally authentic.' At about this time, Henry Salt was
    in communication with Murray and Barrow about Egypt. Salt is
    mentioned on page 491. The author alludes to an unnamed
    'correspondent' on that same page.</p>

    Revise of the West Indies, for which we are greatly obliged to
    my kind friend. Pray send it to Rowarth [the printer]
    immediately &amp; let it be corrected without loss of time. Let

    bedeviled that the mother who bore it, would not know it. Mr
    &lt;Ws&gt; ['or Mr H's' inserted above line: i.e., Wilmot,
    Horton, or Wilmot-Horton] revise is not worth a single
    farthing. I think the paper will be important.' Murray MS., WG
    to JM, postmarked Ramsgate, 10 Aug. 1824: 'I shall send the
    West Indies this week. If Mr &lt;E&gt; comes, so much the
    better; but we need not wait. Murray MS., WG to JM, [Aug.
    1824]: 'It can do no harm to forward a copy of the revise to Mr

    comes in time so much the better&#8212;Where Mr Wilmot is I do

    which is a sound &amp; useful paper &#8212;Thanks in the first
    place to our good friend C.E. I think Wilmot cannot have much
    to do to it ....' Murray MS., WG to JM, Ramsgate, Sunday, [Aug.
    1824]: 'I only wait for Mr Wilmot, who I hope will not meddle
    with what is done; but content himself with additions&#8212;if
    he has anything important to say.'</p>

    <p class="smallprint">The following information and evidence is
    published here for the first time. Iowa MS., JM to [Croker],
    [31 Mar. 1823]: 'I have just seen Mr Wilmot who has undertaken
    to favour me with an article on O'Meara &amp; when you come
    back we will give him materials&#8212;a Pamphlet from America,
    I conceive, is advertised for the 1st of April.' Murray MS., WG
    to John Taylor Coleridge, 9 Dec. 1823, on the subject of the
    West Indies trade, says 'I shall see Mr C. Ellis again soon,
    &amp; I will then ascertain his opinion of the subject of a new
    writer. Materials he will furnish, i.e. estimates &amp;c.'
    Murray MS., Robert Wilmot Horton to JM, 16 June 1824, says he
    would like to write two or three articles on political
    subjects, especially the West Indian question. Murray MS., WG
    to JM, 10 July 1824: 'I have not yet received the American
    paper&#8212;I hope it is not given up.' Murray MS., WG to JM,
    July 1824: 'You have not sent me the whole of America ... nor
    mentioned whether Mr C[roker] has revised what is forwarded. I
    do not understand Wilmot's note. Has neither he nor Hay seen
    the proofs? It will be to no purpose to look at it till the
    revise reaches me.'. Murray MS, Wilmot Horton to JM, 28 Aug.
    1824, sends the cheque back, to be placed on account. '[T]he
    article on the West Indies I dictated to a short-hand writer
    sent me confidentially by Mr. Gurney.' Murray MS., Wilmot
    Horton to WG, 20 Oct. 1824: says that he hears 'a good deal of
    interest among those persons who are connected with Abolition
    &amp; West India affairs' and that in the <i>New Times</i> a
    series of articles has been published attacking it under the
    signature 'Anglus'. In the <i>Star</i> 'Vindex' has defended
    the article. Proposes to bring Vindex together in a pamphlet
    that could then be the subject of an article in the <i>QR</i>.
