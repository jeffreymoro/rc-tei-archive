      In the absence of guidance from JM III's Register, Shine does not suggest 
      an author for this article. Shine quotes from Murray MS., WG to JM, [Feb. 
      1811]: 'I send you Clavier which I hope the printer will be careful of, as 
      it is a presentation copy.' </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">The following information and evidence is published 
      here for the first time. Murray MS., Book Loans Register: Hale's <i>Chronology</i> 
      (discussed in the article on pp.16-17, 16n) was sent to 'Rev. Geo. Doyley' 
      on 5 Dec. 1809. Devon MS. 1149M (f.83), WG to Edward Copleston, 26 Feb. 1811: 
      'I have in this No. an article on Clavier's Ancient Greece ... which I think 
      will delight you by its learning and talent. ... [and] will oblige me to postpone 
      Falconer [#141] to our next [Number].....' The topic of the article, a defence 
      of orthodox Christianity falls within D'Oyly's province. In #130, the author 
      often uses 'We must now,' and 'Now' as transitions; these are used frequently 
      as well in articles known to be by D'Oyly, including #164 and #248. </span></p>

      In co-attributing the article to Scott and Bedford, Shine cites JM III's Register; 
      Smiles I 189; Robinson I 39; Heber 1 35; Grierson II 409n; Lockhart III 110, 
      IX 276; <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> XXI 138; Douglas I 206; and Graham 41. 
      Shine says to see also Smiles I 190; Grierson II 346, 409, 410, 415-16; Lockhart 
      III 110; Southey 272; Warter II 210; Robberds II 339; and Forster 155. Shine 
      quotes from the following letters. Murray MS., WG to JM, [Jan.-Feb. 1811]: 
      'I have heard from Scott ... He has sent Kehama ...' Morgan MS., Robert Southey 
      to E. Elliott Jr., 7 Feb. 1811: 'Scott tells me he has reviewed it [my poem] 
      for the next Quarterly.' Warter II 307 [Southey's letter to Capt. Southey 
      misdated 5 Dec. 1812]: 'Bedford has seen the review which Scott has written 
      of it [Kehama], and which, from his account, though a very friendly one, is 
      ... very superficial. He sees nothing but the naked story; the moral feeling 
      which pervades it has escaped him. I do not know whether Bedford will be able 
      to get a paragraph interpolated touching upon this, and showing that there 
      is some difference between a work of high imagination and a story of mere 
      amusement.' Murray MS., WG to JM, [Feb. 1811]: '[I am sending] some more of 
      Scott&#151;but I must make a few additions to its last pages, which I am now 
      doing.' Shine says to see '<i>QR</i>. V, No. 9, p.55 and 56, for three paragraphs 
      on the relation of high poetic imagination and moral virtue: possibly Bedford's 
      interpolation.' </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published here for the 
      first time. The article was originally intended for Number 8, but Scott was 
      slow to finish it. WG deflected Grosvenor Bedford's request to review Southey's 
      <i>Kehama</i> by showing him Scott's review. Bedford did not approve as it 
      emphasized narrative, not the poem's morality. Bedford told Southey that despite 
      his having been allowed to make some changes, the article still would not 
      do and should be re-written. Pages 55-56 discuss the poem's imagination and 
      morality and may be Bedford's interpolation. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">NLS MS. 3879 (f.262), WG to Walter Scott, 22 Nov. 
      1810, suggests that Scott should review 'Kehama, [a] most strange thing of 
      Southey's, which in your hands might do wonders, as it might lead to a view 
      of Southey's poetical excellencies & defects&#151;and he would not take anything 
      wrong from you.' BL MS. 28099 (f.87), WG to George Ellis, 21 Dec. 1810: 'Scott 
      has just sent me an article on a strange poem of Southey's called Kehama&#8212;It 
      is hastily written, but he hurried it forward in the friendly expectation 
      that it was wanted for the present No. Had it been so, we should have given 
      the review before the work itself had made its appearance, which would have 
      been a little queer. I shall now send it back to him for a little of the labour 
      ....' NLS MS. 3879 (f.289), WG to Scott, 29 Dec. 1810: 'A thousand and a thousand 
      thanks to you for the Kehama: It came too late [for inclusion in issue Number 
      8]; but, to do away both with your regret and mine it would not have found 
      a place in this No. had it come a month sooner; for by some accident or other 
      the book itself had not arrived here, when it [Scott's review] reached me, 
      and we shall have published the critique before the critquee&#151;I have <u>returned</u> 
      it to you as you desired, but you must not keep it beyond a fortnight ....'

      In querying its attribution to Reginald Heber, Shine cites JM III's Register. 
      Shine also quotes from Murray MS., WG to JM [?1810-11]: 'I have got a person 
      for Sir R Wilson&#151;a good one.' </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence was first published in <i>VPR</i> 
      28. According to WG, the article's author was a young M.P., an acquaintance 
      or associate of John Barrow. The author is therefore not, despite JM III, 
      either of the Hebers, Richard or Reginald. The two parliamentarians that most 
      closely fit the description are Lord Dudley and John Wilson Croker. The article 
      is certainly not by Croker; it does not appear in any of Croker's holograph 
      lists of his articles preserved in the Clements Library, Ann Arbor, and it 
      is not collected in the bound volumes of Croker's articles preserved at the 
      Cambridge University Library. JM suspected that this article and #134 were 
      by the same person (Dudley); WG did not agree, but told him to keep mum in 
      any case. JM in his marked <i>QR</i> states that he never knew the author 
      but that Croker sent it. He conjectured that the author was a Lord Reppor, 
      but there is no M.P. with that name. Further evidence for Dudley is in JM 
      having sent the book reviewed to Richard Heber and to Reginald Heber. Dudley, 
      who was thirty years old in 1811, first entered parliament in 1803 and was 
      a friend of the Hebers. If it is Dudley's work, it is his first contribution 
      to the QR. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">Murray MS., Book Loans Register: the book reviewed 
      was sent to 'R[ichard]. Heber' on 18 Dec. 1810 and to 'Revd. R. Heber, Hodnet' 
      on 19 Dec. 1810. BL MS. 28099 (ff.89-90), WG to George Ellis, [31 Dec. 1810]: 
      '... lest you should already have hit upon Sir R. Wilson ... I have a review 
      of him in hand. I know not the writer, but am told he is ... a young man, 
      but in parliament. The offer of his assistance came thro' Barrow.' Cf. evidence 
      for #146: Murray MS., WG to JM, [9 May 1811]: 'Tarleton ... comes from Mr 
      B's friend.' Murray MS., WG to JM, 2 Jan. 1811: 'Be careful when you write 
      to our friend this time [i.e., Edward Copleston or Richard Heber?] & do not 
      even think what you suspect, but what I do not, that the two Articles are 
      by the same person [#132 and #134?]. Let us <u>multiply</u> our friends, and 
      above all affect as much ignorance as possible about them. I am sure that 
      will be best.' Both #132 and #134 advise against suing for peace with France. 
      BL MS. 28099 (ff.91-92), WG to Ellis, 2 Feb. 1811: 'That on Sir Robt Wilson, 
      which has just reached me, will require much pain to put it into a readable 
      form .... It appears to be by a young man, who hates the duty of revision.' 
      See also evidence at #134. Cf. evidence for #146: Devon MS. 1149M (f.88), 
      WG to Edward Copleston, 13 Apr. 1811: 'There is, I am told, a very foolish 
      speech of a very foolish fellow, Gen. Tarleton ... but perhaps it is not worth 
      our friend's [i.e., Lord Dudley's] notice&#151;yet it might furnish something 
      on Portugal.' </span></p>

      In attributing the article to Copleston, Shine cites JM III's Register; Nichols 
      xxiii n; Copleston 347; the article on Copleston in the <i>DNB</i>; and says 
      to see also Copleston 40. Shine also quotes from the following letters. Murray 
      MS., WG to JM, [misdated May? 1811; numbered 119]: 'Coplestone came today 
      and will be ready at any time&#151;Part of Aeschylus is come from Cambridge 
      also today ... P.S. Do not mention Copleston's name.' Murray MS., WG to JM, 
      [1811]: 'Dr I[reland] &lt;sent&gt; <sent> last night for the last leaf of 
      Dealtry [#144] & De Motu [#133] with a promise to send back both this morning. 
      They are not come. [The following sentence is not quoted in Shine.] I told 
      you that Dr I would positively reach me on Wednesday.' </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published here for the 
      first time. WG asked Copleston to soften criticism in the article of Thomas 
      Dunham Whitaker, a valuable contributor to the journal. Copleston bristled 
      at the request. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">Devon MS. 1149M (f.79), WG to Edward Copleston, 
      18 Oct. 1810, accepts his proposal for an article 'though not interesting 
      in itself; but it may be made so by adjuncts ....' Devon MS. 1149M (f.80), 
      WG to Copleston, 9 Jan. 1811, thanks him for his article on Whitaker. Devon 
      MS. 1149M (f.81), WG to Copleston, 11 Feb. 1811, hopes Copleston can finish 
      his article within a fortnight and asks him to limit its length. Devon MS. 
      1149 (f.83), WG to Copleston, 26 Feb. 1811: 'Whitaker I presume, we shall 
      have this week.' Devon 1149M (f.84), WG to Copleston, 9 Mar. 1811: 'Whitaker 
      is a good friend of ours, & I really owe him some thanks for his Review of 
      the man with 'the leaden mace' [Chalmers? #118; he says he lives next door 
      to him; the reference, 'leaden mace,' is probably to <i>Julius Caesar</i> 
      IV. iii, but the phrase is axiomatic for inducing dullness or sleep] .... 
      if, therefore ... any word can be softened ... it may be done.' Devon MS. 
      1149 (f.85), WG to Copleston, 11 Mar. 1811, assures him he did not ask for 
      an abridgement of 'Whitaker.' The blunt criticisms of Whitaker on the article's 
      final two pages indicate that Copleston won his battle with WG. </span></p>

      this article because George Ellis had claimed the subject, but after Ellis 
      withdrew his claim WG gladly accepted Dudley's contribution (see BL MS. 28099, 
      ff.89-90). Devon MS. 1149 (f.83), WG to Copleston, 26 Feb. 1811: 'I shewed 
      Canning the Article on Roscoe, with which he was greatly pleased: by his advice 
      I made a trifling omission, which even the author will scarcely discover&#151;But 
      what do you think of [Richard] Heber, the lamb, the sucking dove, the "tender-hearted" 
      Heber! He wrote to me ... to deprecate the wrath of the author, & to beg some 
      mitigation of the censor passed on his (Roscoe's) ponderous Quartos.' Devon 
      MS. 1149M (f.87), WG to Copleston, 18 Mar. 1811, says Roscoe is printed off 
      without alteration, 'though Heber wished much to mitigate the criticism of 
      the philosopher's historical labours.' Murray MS., WG to JM, n.d., says he 
      finds the MS. article on Roscoe to be 'too forensic' and calls for the abridgment 
      of 'legal phrases and terms' that 'unconsciously' crept in. Murray MS., WG 
      to JM, 2 Jan. 1811: 'Be careful when you write to our friend this time & do 
      not even think what you suspect, but what I do not, that the two Articles 
      are by the same person [#132 and 134?]. Let us <u>multiply</u> our friends, 
      and above all affect as much ignorance as possible about them. I am sure that 
      will be best.' </span></p>

      step towards objective methods in field archaeology and established Colt Hoare's 
      reputation as an archaeologist. Sir Richard Colt Hoare (1758-1838) was the 
      grandson of Henry Hoare, the banker, who had laid out the gardens at Stourhead. 
      At the beginning Colt Hoare was only called upon to finance Cunnington's enterprise 
      of recording all that could be discovered about the inhabitants of Wiltshire 
      from prehistoric to Roman times. In the course of the preparations though 
      he acquired a rapidly growing interest and knowledge, became a collaborator, 
      and was soon described by a fellow enthusiast as "barrow mad". Colt Hoare 
      wrote the work with the support of William Cunnington who had assembled much 
      of the archeological information on excavation sites but died in 1810. Stephen 
      and John Parker did the actual excavation work, while Philip Crocker made 
      all the surveys and executed the detailed drawings for the plates. For a full 
      account of Colt Hoare's life and archaeological pursuits, see K. Woodbridge,

      The manuscript evidence demonstrates that Canning's input was limited to reading 
      the article in proof and commenting upon it to WG. WG worried about the propriety 
      of the concluding pages, as did Edward Copleston, and, to some extent Canning. 
      The pages were retained on the advice of Charles Ellis and John Hookham Frere.

      In attributing the article to Grant, Shine cites JM III's Register and notes

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published here for the 
      first time. Because his father, Charles Grant, was a powerful official in 
      the East India Company, Robert Grant kept his participation in the journal 
      the deepest secret, refusing to identify himself even to JM or WG. He forwarded 
      drafts of this article to WG via Lord Teignmouth and Richard and Reginald 
      Heber. Certain comments by Lord Teignmouth led WG to suspect that the author 
      was Robert Grant's father. As WG's letter to Edward Copleston quoted below 
      demonstrates, the elder Grant undoubtedly participated in the development 
      of the article (as he had in Robert Grant's contributions to the <i>Edinburgh 
      Review</i> on the subject of India). Robert Grant requested that WG cut the 
      article down. WG did so and added material of his own. Canning read and approved 
      it. </span></p>
