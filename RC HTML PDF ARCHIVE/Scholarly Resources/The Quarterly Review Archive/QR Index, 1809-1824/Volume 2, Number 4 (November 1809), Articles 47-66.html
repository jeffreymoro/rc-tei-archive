    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence and information is published 
      here for the first time. William Erskine, Walter Scott's friend, was repeatedly 
      frustrated in his attempts to produce an article acceptable to WG. WG kept 
      offering topics of no interest to Erskine and some topics Erskine took up 
      without first informing WG turned out to have been commissioned to others. 
      Such was the case with this article. Erskine, apparently acting as mediator 
      for an associate, offered a review, sent it through the publisher Ballantyne, 
      heard nothing for some time, then through Scott learned that WG, afraid of 
      disappointing Erskine yet again, had hesitated to reply. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">NLS MS. 3878 (ff.239-42), WG to Walter Scott, [Dec. 
      1808 or Jan. 1809], says for the next Number he 'will contrive to get something 
      on Ker Porter.' Murray MS., William Erskine to JM, 15 July 1809: 'Have you 
      an article on Ker Porter's Travels in Russia? I wrote Mr Gifford about a month 
      ago, but have not had an answer.' NLS MS. 11000 (ff.138-39), JM to Erskine, 
      21 July 1809, says that 'Ker Porter' is by 'a friend of Mr Heber's.' Murray 
      MS., Erskine to JM, 13 Aug. 1809: 'Mr Ballantyne undertook some weeks ago 
      to forward to you a short Essay on our Policy with respect to Russia, which 
      I thought might be incorporated into the Review of Ker Porter's Book.' He 
      hopes it has not miscarried and will be disappointed if it is not inserted 
      as it 'contains what seems to me useful information and is written by a gentleman 
      of talent and consequence.' Murray MS., George Ellis to JM, [Aug. 1809], having 
      spoken of articles for Number 3, Ellis states that 'Russia ... must stand 
      over till next time.' (May be a reference to #72.) </span></p>

      the article and that WG inserted an extensive passage in the middle of it. 
      Canning's role in producing this article is notable as the topic is Canning's 
      infamous duel with Lord Castlereagh, an incident that for a time derailed 
      Canning's career. The article was the occasion for <i>An answer to the strictures

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence and information is published
