    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. Public Record Office (Kew), ADM 1/4368
    (miscellaneous papers of the Secretaries of the Admiralty
    [Croker and Barrow]), f. 198: <i>Exposition of Facts In support
    of an adequate duty to be imposed on India-Built Shipping, for
    the protection of the British Manufacturers of Ships</i>
    [pamphlet dated London 10 June 1813]. Murray MS., Sylvester
    Douglas to JM, 30 Nov. 1813, refers to 'Mr Barrow's article on
    ship-building' in a former Number [the reference is to #208].
    Murray MS., Douglas to JM, 12 Dec. 1813, asks when the
    <i>QR</i> will appear and says that 'Mr B's supplementary
    article' is important to him [the reference is to&nbsp; #280].
    Douglas was commissioner of the forests department. The author
    of #260 makes use of forests department records (p.7).&nbsp;The
    author of article #260 mentions #219, which is also by Barrow,
    and article #260 is referred to in articles #297, #328, #514
    (specific reference), and #704, all of which are by Barrow. It
    was Barrow's signature practice in his <i>QR</i> articles to
    refer to his own works. On p.25 Seppings is praised as having
    'established a new era in naval architecture.' Seppings is the
    subject of #328, which is also by Barrow. The passage on
    pp.21-26 on dry-rot repeats the discussion in an article by
    Barrow, #208 pp.32ff. Twice that article is specifically
    referred to. Article #260 is one in a series of articles by
    Barrow in which the problem of dry rot is addressed. The series
    includes #208, #245, #260, #280, #297, #320, #328, #514, #704,
    and #341<i>WI</i>. This article and #280 were attacked in
    <i>Remarks on the Calumnies Published in the Quarterly Review
    on the English Shipbuilders</i> (1814). The article was the
    occasion for Richard Pering, <i>A Reply to some Strictures in
    the Quarterly Review, (no. XIX.) on Indian-Built Ships; to
    which are annexed, economical recommendations for effectually
    preserving the British Navy, on the return of peace, whereby
    Millions of Money may be saved to the Country!</i>
    (1814).</span></p>

    bolts; second, that of the best method of maintaining warships
    in times of peace, with the author arguing for a massive system

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence was first
    published in <i>VPR</i> 29. The article is possibly by Walter
    Scott, but it is certainly not by John Wilson Croker. The
    article is not claimed by Croker in any of his Clements Library
    MS. lists, nor is it included in the Cambridge University
    Library bound volumes of Croker's articles. Murray MS., Book
    Loans Register: the first volume of Montagu was sent to 'W.
    Scott' on 13 May 1809. NLS MS., 853 (ff.7-8), Walter Scott to
    J. B. S. Morritt, 17 Aug. 1809 (copy), says he will review
    Montagu's letters. NLS MS., 853 (ff.114-15), Scott to Morritt,
    10 Sept. [1809] (copy), says he will review the Montagu letters
    for the next Number of the <i>QR</i>. Scott therefore had an
    interest in reviewing Montagu's letters, but no evidence has
    emerged that specifically connects him with #261. Note the
    author's use of the form 'Lewis XIV,' the practice adopted
    elsewhere in the early <i>QR</i> by Reginald Heber and Richard
    Chenevix.&nbsp;</span></p>

    writer has been unable to locate that letter) points to Sumner
    as author of article #268. That article treats a subject, the
    Spanish Inquisition, more along Sumner's line. On p.155 of #265
    two works are discussed that were the subject of reviews by
    Merivale in three articles in the <i>QR</i> (#222, 238, and
    263). The translation of Hodgson on p.151 is referred to in
    #289, which is also possibly by Merivale.&nbsp;Murray MS., Book

    "smallprint">In querying its attribution to Heber, Shine quotes
    from Murray MS., WG to JM, [10 Nov. 1813]: 'The writer of
    Eustace who is well acquainted with Germany wishes to have Mad.
    de S[ta&#235;l] if not preengaged.' Shine notes that 'The
    article on Madame de Stael's <i>Germany</i>, in the next No. of
    <i>QR</i>, was by Heber; see Entry 275.'&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence was first
    published in <i>VPR</i> 28. Robert Bland, Herman Merivale, and
    William Stewart Rose are more likely candidates. The author of
    #270 lived for an extended period in Italy (see. p.244), which
    Heber never did. Compare the author's spelling of 'Joseph II,'
    'Pius VI,' 'Nicolas III' etc., with Heber's use in #223 of the
    form 'Charles the XIIth,' 'Gustavas the IIId' etc.

    from Murray MS., WG to JM, [21 Sept. 1813]: 'I can hint to Dr
    Yng &amp; will. I have altered his Art. since you saw it &amp;
    put a little out of the old track.... Dr Y thought his Art.
