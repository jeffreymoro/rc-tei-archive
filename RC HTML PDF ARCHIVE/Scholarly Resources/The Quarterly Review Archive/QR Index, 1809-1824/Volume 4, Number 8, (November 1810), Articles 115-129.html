      <li>Murray MS., George Ellis to JM, 9 Oct. 1810: 'Why say that No 8 will be

          <p>POSTSCRIPT. / Whilst our attention has been absorbed by the forgoing 
            article, we learned that Sir John Sinclair has again buckled on his 
            armour, and is actually scouring the country, with a pamphlet much larger 
            than the former, determined to clear away any scattered remains of coin, 
            which prejudice and obstinacy may still be endeavouring to obtrude into 
            circulation. We could not now attend Sir John on this second sally, 
            without delaying the publication of our present Number: and must therefore 
            defer, till our next, the faithful record of his farther achievements 
            against the unbelievers in paper. </p>

      In attributing the article to Grant, Shine cites JM III's Register and its 
      note for #115. Shine also cites Grierson II 397, 397n. Shine quotes from the 
      following two letters. Murray MS., WG to JM, [7 Aug. 1810 postmark]: 'Of Crabbe, 
      he [Heber] says, that he hears it is proceeding&#151;but he has not seen any 
      part of it.' Murray MS., WG to JM [Sept. 1810]: 'Pitt, I am informed I shall 
      have tomorrow. One sheet of Crabbe is come ... I am promised two sheets more 
      directly.' In suggesting William Gifford as an alternative attribution, Shine 
      cites <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> XXI 138; Graham 41; Huchon 305; and says 
      to see also Clark 187, 188, 191-92, 200, 273n: Clark doubts Gifford's authorship. 
      </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published here for the 
      first time. The Shine volume attributes the article to Grant only by a happy 
      accident as Shine confuses the notes in JM III's Register that apply to #114 
      as applying to #115. Shine was led in the right direction by Grierson II 397, 
      397n. Scott offered to review this work, but WG found out too late that Richard 
      or Reginald Heber had already offered it to an anonymous friend. The article 
      was received in time for Number 7, but its length kept it out. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">NLS MS. 3879 (f.60), WG to Walter Scott, 30 Apr. 
      1810: 'Without speaking to me, he [Heber, probably Richard or possibly Reginald] 
      had put Crabbe into the hands of an anonymous friend even before I wrote my 
      last letter. This I only learned upon telling him that I was just sending 
      it to you. ... What is nearly as bad, is that this person (whose name he will 
      not tell me) is, by his own account, extremely idle ....' BL MS. 28099 (ff.73-74), 
      WG to George Ellis, 21 May 1810: 'Scott offered to review Crabb, but the reckless 
      Heber, whose kindness deserves all praise, had unfortunately ... promised 
      it to an anonymous friend .... I hope he is not mistaken ....' BL MS. 28099 
      (f.83), WG to Ellis, 1 Oct. 1810: '... we shall have a charming article on 
      Crabbe, written with great ability and taste. The writer is perfectly unknown: 
      his communication was sent by a servant, whom I did not see.' NLS MS. 3879 
      (ff.227-28), WG to Scott, 27 Oct. 1810: 'Crabbe was printed [in time for Number 
      7], but the length of this (for which I was not prepared) made it impracticable 
      to give it in the present No.' </span></p>

      a useful article on Patten's foolish & mischievous book ....' The author is 
      obviously an Admiralty official. The <i>DNB</i> article on Patten points out 
      that Barrow's <i>Life of Lord Howe</i> repeats, in almost the same words, 
      the defence in this article of the Lords of Admiralty against Patten's criticism 
      that most Lords are civilians with no naval experience. Compare #116 p.322: 
      'If a man indeed can be supposed so far to divest himself of the best feelings 
      of human nature, from the moment that he takes his seat at the admiralty board, 
      as to shake off at once all recollections of the companions of his early days 
      ...' with p. 192 of Barrow's <i>Life of Lord Howe</i>: ' How indeed can it 
      be expected that a professional man should cast aside the best feelings of 
      human nature ... that he should turn aside from these companions of his early 
      days ....' </span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published here for the 
      first time. Lodge, editor of the Talbot papers, appears to have been dissuaded 
      from reviewing his own work and given instead the task of reviewing Clifford. 
      The article starts out with a comparison of Clifford to Lodge and credits 
      the latter as having influenced the former. Murray MS., Book Loans Register: 
      the book reviewed was sent to 'E. Lodge' on 8 Nov. 1809. NLS MS. 3879 (f.60), 
      WG to Walter Scott, 30 Apr. 1810, sends Scott a review of 'Sir R. Sadlier by 
      Lodge' and asks him to look at it. 'A touch or two from your hand (for I am 
      not conversant with the subject) will be of vast use to the article. ... Make 
      what alterations you think fit; all is at your mercy.' NLS MS. 3879 (f.74), 
      WG to Scott, 9 May, 1810, concerning 'Lodge,' asks only for a 'few hints all 
      votre fac&oacute;n ....' NLS MS. 3879 (f.116), WG to Scott, 24 May 1810, requests 
      that Scott forward 'Lodge' along with 'Evans' (#100). 'I shall not be sorry 
      to oblige Lodge, who will, I think, do better with practice. Make what alterations 
      you think fit; all is at your mercy.' NLS MS. 3879 (f.228), WG to Scott, 27 
      Oct. 1810: 'Do you think Lodge's little article strong enough, after the ill 
      nature of Jeffrey? I was doubtful & therefore omitted it: but if you say the 
      word it shall now go in.' Sadleir is spelled Sadler in the head note as above 
      (concerning which, see page 404 of the article). </span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published here for the 
      first time. Murray MS., Paid Contributors List for issue Number 8: the same 
      person was paid for articles 10 and 15 in this Number. Murray MS., George 
      Ellis to JM, 1 Oct. 1810, says that a friend (i.e., Huskisson, see next letter) 
      has sent him a pamphlet to be printed by Murray that he (Ellis) will review 
      in the next Number. 'The general subject, I am aware, is the rightful property 
      of our unknown contributor who reviewed Ricardo ....' The 'unknown contributor' 
      is Robert Grant; see #78. Murray MS., Ellis to JM, 9 Oct. 1810, speaks of 
      the pamphlet in question as Huskisson's. BL MS. 28099 (f.83), WG to Ellis, 
      1 Oct. 1810, says he is glad Ellis intends 'to take up the subject of the 
      Bank restriction, which is now become very interesting, and since the publication 
      & active dispersion of Horner's Report, has assumed a terrifying aspect. I 
      will get at our friend [i.e., Grant], as soon as I can ascertain where Heber 
      is ... but as the subject will still be open to him, I cannot see that any 
      consideration of what he may wish hereafter to undertake need stop you for 
      a moment.' Harewood MS., WG to George Canning, 6 Oct. 1810: 'I wish our unknown 
      friend [i.e., Grant] could have done it [reviewed Huskisson's pamphlet which, 
      he says, Ellis is reviewing]&#151;but he is a terrible thief of time & the 
      question admits no delay, as the subject is in general agitation at present.' 
      BL MS. 28099 (ff.85-86), WG to Ellis, 15 Nov. 1810, says 'our invisible friend' 
      (i.e., Grant) will not write on the bank restriction and leaves the field 
      open to 'Mr. Ellis.' Murray MS., Ellis to JM, 25 Nov. 1810, says he will begin 
      his review of Huskisson. Murray MS., Ellis to JM, [n.d.]: 'I have begun the 
      critique of Huskisson ....' BL MS. 28099 (f.65), WG to Ellis, [26 Nov. 1810], 
      speaks of Ellis's 'finance' article. Harewood MS., Ellis to Canning, Wed. 
      Dec. 1810, says that Murray is impatient for the review of Huskisson. States 
      that 'Perceval, I find, has sketched the substance of a review of Huskisson, 
      embellished by Croker, and [intended to be] inserted in our Quarterly. The 
      proposal was communicated by Croker to Giff; who bounced, <i>comme de raison</i>, 
      and manfully vindicated our independence.' Murray MS., 1803-23 Letter Book, 
      Canning to WG, 9 Dec. 1810, says he received Sir John (#129) by post and hopes 
      to return it tomorrow and expects 'another parcel of G. E.'s Husk'n to send 
      me ....' Devon MS. 1149M (f.80), WG to Edward Copleston, 9 Jan. 1811, says 
      Ellis too busy with 'Huskisson' and 'Sir John' to review Roscoe (#134). BL 
      MS. 29281 (ff.32-33), William Nichol to Henry Boase, 23 Jan. 1811: 'Canning 
      and his friend Geo. Ellis helped Huskisson in his pamphlet&#8212;Ellis has also 
      reviewed it in the Quarterly Review.' The volume under review was published 
      by John Murray. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">[Bookseller's note: 'Winning clear praise from Ricardo, 
      the present work is Huskisson's most celebrated. Its writing was directly 
      stimulated by Huskisson serving on the famous Bullion Committee and is, essentially, 
      a further discussion and clarification of its findings. According to the <i>Dictionary 
      of National Biography</i>, the publication of this pamphlet "at once met with 
      success and earned Huskisson the reputation of being the first financier of 
      the age". The note circulation of the Bank of England had expanded from an 
      average of 11 millions in 1795 to nearly 20 millions in 1809. Specie payments 
      having been suspended in 1797, and the paper circulation having been increased, 
      the foreign exchanges had become unfavourable to Britain and the paper bank-note 
      circulation was depreciated in comparison with gold. The Bullion Committee 
      found that the over-issue of paper money ought to be brought back to "the 
      original principle of Cash payments at the option of the holder of Bank paper 
      money". Ricardo was to show in his 1810 pamphlet <i>The High Price of Bullion 
      a Proof of the Depreciation of Bank Notes</i> conclusively that the value 
      of the Bank note was depreciated from excess of issue; but much of the ground-work 
      had already been performed by Huskisson here. Ricardo certainly had a copy 
      of this major pamphlet of Huskisson's in his library since that copy actually 
      survives. It has a penciled note in Ricardo's hand "The passages marked as 
      those upon which I see reason to differ with the author." See Sraffa's Edition 
      of Ricardo, vol.x, p.400 where the exact passages are given.'] </span></p>

      Brazil is in Heber's hand, & he promises it in time.' </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">[Bookseller's note: 'Southey's <i>Brazil</i> was 
      originally intended to form part of a much larger history of Portugal, but 
      it was the only portion actually published. One of the most important works 
      on the country, it is based on the excellent collection of books and manuscripts 
      formed by the Reverend Herbert Hill, chaplain of the British colony at Lisbon. 
      "Southey was perfectly aware of the value of his history. In 1823 he wrote 
      to Henry Koster: 'I am far from regretting that so much time and labour had 
      been bestowed upon a subject for which few English readers (such as readers 
      now are) can be expected to feel much interest. What I have done is in many 
      parts imperfect; it is nevertheless even now a great achievement. As long 
      as I live I shall carefully correct and enlarge it from whatever documents, 
      written or printed, may come to my hands, and centuries hence, when Brazil 
      shall have become the great and prosperous country which one day it must be, 
      I shall be regarded there as the first person who ever attempted to give a 
      consistent form to its crude, unconnected and neglected history.' Southey 
      was by no means mistaken in his appraisal of the History. Capistrano de Abreu 
      judged it superior to Varnhagen's <i>Historia General</i>, "in form, in conception, 
      in perception." (Borba de Moraes) Borba de Moraes II 823-24. NCBEL III 256.

      of its force.' BL MS. 28603 [no folio number given], Southey to William Peachey, 
      26 Dec. 1811: 'Last night I received a singular & gratifying proof that in 
      some of my late endeavours I have not altogether been labouring in vain. A 
      circular letter was sent me from the Bristol Church of England Tract Society

      the assistance of Dr. John Ireland made a few more in order to make the article 
      'safe.' Nothing, however, was added by WG or Ireland. Murray paid Southey

      At JM II's request, WG edited out all but one negative reference to the <i>Edinburgh 
      Review</i>. The article was meant to compliment #124. WG proudly pointed out 
      to Walter Scott that in this article the <i>QR</i> showed its independence 
      from Government. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">Murray MS., Paid Contributors List for issue Number 
      8: the same person was paid for articles 10 and 15 in this Number. Murray 
      MS., George Ellis to JM, [n.d.], having mentioned the review of Huskisson 
      (see #124), says that Canning and Huskisson are waiting to see a revise (of 
      another article). Murray MS., Ellis to JM, Sunday [Sept. 1810], says he has 
      erased all but one of the allusions to the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> as requested 
      by Murray. Murray MS., Ellis to JM, [22 Nov. 1810], says that 'Sir John will 
      enliven the Number' and it is intended as a complement to the review of Huskisson 
      (#124). Murray MS., Ellis to JM, [Nov. or Dec. 1810], say that this article 
      is designed to compete with the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> in a 'popular' article 
      and speaks of proofs of it being sent to Canning and Huskisson. Devon MS. 
      1149M (f.80), WG to Edward Copleston, 9 Jan. 1811, says Ellis is too busy 
      with 'Huskisson' (#124) and 'Sir John' to review 'Roscoe' (#134). Harewood 
      MS., George Ellis to George Canning, Sunday, 2 Dec. [1810], referring not 
      to 'Huskisson' but to another article, thanks Canning for his revise and promises 
      to hand it on to 'Giff' along with Canning's letter of the '28th'. NLS MS. 
      3879 (ff.227-28), WG to Walter Scott, 27 Oct. 1810, says for the next issue 
      (Number 8). 'George will have an article on Finance, auspice Severo, for I 
      think C[anning] will assist.' NLS MS. 3879 (f.289), WG to Scott, 29 Dec. 1810: 
      'You see that we differ from the ministry respecting the Bullion business. 
      ... I have such reliance on the judgements of those who drew up the article, 
      that I am inclined to hope we cannot be far out. I have gone fairly to work, 
      however, and acquainted Mr Perceval, who expected a different article, with 
      my motive & determination. It is but fair to add, that they also behaved honourably.' 
      Murray MS., 1803-23 Letter Book, George Canning to WG, 9 Dec. 1810, says he 
      received Sir John by post and hopes to return it tomorrow and expects 'another 
      parcel of G. E.'s Husk'n to send me ....' </span></p>
