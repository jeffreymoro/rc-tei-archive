    Blomfield 34-35.&nbsp;[<i>Quarterly Review</i> Archive editor's
    note: Blomfield I 27-28 states this article was by Monk, 'which
    was rendered almost necessary by the fact that Valpy had
    published a defence of his own share in the work among the
    advertisements which formed the fly-leaves of the
    <i>Quarterly</i> itself; and from that time Bishop Blomfield
    was never again engaged in any literary polemics.' No evidence
    is cited, however, to support the attribution to
    Monk.]</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. Primary evidence points fairly clearly
    to Blomfield and Monk having worked on this article, though
    which man was primary author and which sub-editor is not clear.
    Murray MS., G. J. Monk to JM, 15 Jan. 1858, says he has a
    letter of WG to James Henry Monk that mentions this review. He
    thinks Blomfield, not his father, wrote the article. The
    article is a defence of #525, which is by Blomfield; there is
    some logic in thinking that Blomfield would be compelled to (or
    that WG asked him to) defend his own article. However, the
    article praises Blomfield (pp.377, 379) in language unlikely to
    have come from Blomfield's own pen. It is is entirely possible
    that Blomfield wrote the article and Monk sub-edited
    it.</span></p>

    JM III's Register. Shine also quotes from Murray MS., WG to JM,
    [19 July 1822 postmark]: 'Some one has sent me a review of a
    horticultural work by Loudon. Can this be our quondam friend?
    If so, I am sorry for him, for he appears from the quotations
    to be an ignorant, imprudent &amp; even profligate scholar. I
    was well aware from his Art that he could not write at all; but
    I gave him credit for knowledge of his subject &amp; therefore

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following discussion and
    information is published here for the first time. The Murray
    MS. letter quoted in Shine cannot easily be made to support the
    attribution to Loudon. WG himself did not know the author's
    identity and merely speculates that it is 'our quondam friend'.
    Why WG should refer to Loudon as a sometime or former friend is
    not clear, if, indeed, the reference is to Loudon at all.
    Except for the unsupported attribution in JM III's Register,
    there is no suggestion that Loudon had any connection with WG,
    JM, or the <i>QR</i>. While it is entirely possible that JM III
    based his attribution on definitive primary evidence, that
    evidence has not been located by the present writer despite an
    exhaustive search of the Murray archives.&nbsp;</span></p>
