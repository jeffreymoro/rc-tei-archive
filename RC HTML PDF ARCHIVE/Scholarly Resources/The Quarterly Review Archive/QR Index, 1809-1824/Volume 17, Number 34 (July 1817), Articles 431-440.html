    undertake an article on the Himalayas for the

    that Napier identified Barrow as a credible authority on the
    region in part by his authorship of this article, with the
    information having been conveyed by Barrow himself who had been
    asked by Napier to suggest topics he could write on for the
    supplement. On page 414 and n., the article's author makes a

    the following letters. Murray MS. R[ichard] Wellesley [to JM],
    28 Aug. 1817: [Shine's summary] 'The promised contribution,
    which will soon be finished, will not advocate either party.'
    [<i>Quarterly Review</i> Archive editor's note:&nbsp; Shine
    does not supply the following additional details from that
    letter: 'The subject is certainly increasing in importance
    &amp; public interest ....'&nbsp; Wellesley objects to the
    treatment of the subject in a recent <i>Courier</i> and states
    that if his opinions 'should happen not to accord with those of
    Mr Gifford or if the <u>performance</u> should not fulfill his
    wishes' then WG should omit his submission.] Shine also quotes
    Murray MS., Wellesley to JM, Brighton, 3 Oct. 1817: 'I have
    concluded and sent to you the article on South American affairs
    .... I have expressed my real opinions&#8212;Mr Gifford is
    perfectly welcome to make any correction in the style or

    information was first published in <i>VPR</i> 28. The known
    evidence taken together is too conflicting to permit a definite
    attribution to one person or to determine the correct
    combination of authors. As the following letters and those
    quoted in the Shine volume show, WG had in hand two articles on
    the same subject, one by Richard Colley Wellesley and one by
    William Jacob. It is possible that he combined the two. Murray
    MS., William Jacob to JM, 5 Oct. 1817, says he delayed writing
    on Spain in America when JM told him something was coming up in
    the Review. 'I have now the pleasure to send you an article
    which if you should approve it may be printed.' He thinks it
    too long at 30-32 pages. Jacob was the author #701, on Mexico.
