    that a review of this work by William Jacob was received and
    even set up, but cancelled at the last moment in favour of John

    was sent a number of books on America, including 'North America

    Register: the book reviewed was sent to 'John Barrow' on 16
    Jan. 1818. The article's author quotes a passage from #282
    (p.536), which is by Barrow. In his <i>QR</i> articles<i>,</i>
    it was Barrow's signature practice to refer to his own works.
    The virulent characterization of&nbsp; 'Jacobinism' is typical
    of Barrow: e.g., 'polluted trash of our Jacobinical press' and
    (p.19) 'irreligious and levelling principles of the Jacobins.'
    Cf. #482 (p.356n), an article by Barrow: 'the scum and
    feculence of the worst Jacobinical journals ....' As a matter
    of interest, cf. the characterization of <i>Edinburgh
    Review</i> writers as 'Northern philosophers' (p.13) with #539
    (p.123n).</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following discussion is
    published here for the first time. Shine and JM III supply no
    evidence in favour of Impey. John Impey (d.1829), a legal
    writer who flourished in the 1780s, seems an unlikely person to
    write on this topic. Murray MS., John Taylor Coleridge to WG,
    25 May 1819, says he has taken Smedley's two letters (probably
    written to JM on the subject of an article by him or about
    which Smedley had some interest); has written Smedley 'for the
    Religio Christiana also: which perhaps ought to come into the
    article too as a foil to the Churchman's neat &amp; pointed
    lines.' Edward Smedley (1788-1836), a recent graduate and
    fellow of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, a Church of England
    clergyman. He was awarded prizes for his undergraduate poetry,
    and between 1810 and the publication of this article, #498, he
    published four additional volumes of poems on religious themes.
    In 1821 he published <i>Religio Clerici</i>. He later became an
    editor of the <i>British Critic</i>. See <i>Poems, by the late
    Rev. Edward Smedley, A.M., with a Selection from his
    Correspondence, and a Memoir of his Life</i> (1837). Coleridge
    sent his letter to WG a few weeks before the publication of
    #498 and there is no other article in this period that
    Coleridge could plausibly be referring to, unless #500. More
    evidence is needed to demonstrate that Smedley and Coleridge
    had a role in this article. Smedley was perhaps its author;
    Coleridge may have mediated the article into the <i>QR</i>. In
    any case, the same evidence can be used to support an
    attribution of #500 to Smedley.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> (Mar.
    1844), 246-47. Murray MS., Book Loans Register: the book
    reviewed was sent to 'John Barrow' on 28 Jan. 1818. Barrow
    famously advocated exploration of the North-West Passage in the
    <i>QR</i> and elsewhere. Barrow's series of articles in the
    <i>QR</i> on polar exploration includes #451, #461, #474, #503,
    #585, #667, #705, #97<i>WI</i>, and #163<i>WI</i>. Article #503
    is alluded to in #667 and #705. Articles #406, #451, #461
    (including a specific reference) and #474, all of which are by
    Barrow, are alluded to in the article. On p.261 of the article,
    Barrow refers to himself. At pages 233 and 265 of #705, the
    author of the article specifically alludes to his former
    articles in the <i>QR</i> on Captain Ross (#451 and 503). In
    his <i>QR</i> articles<i>,</i> it was Barrow's signature
    practice to refer to his own works.&nbsp;</span></p>
