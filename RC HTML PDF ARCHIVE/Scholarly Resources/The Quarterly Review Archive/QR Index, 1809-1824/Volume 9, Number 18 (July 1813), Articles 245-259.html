    JM, [3? 5? July 1813 postmark]: 'I have heard nothing from Mr
    Barrow ....' Murray MS., Barrow to JM, 23 July 1813, sends his
    article on the national fishery. The article is referred to in
    #260, which is also by Barrow. It was Barrow's signature
    practice in his <i>QR</i> articles to refer to his own works.
    The article is one in a series by Barrow in which dry rot is
    discussed. The series includes #208, #245, #260, #280, #297,
    #320, #328, #514, #704, and #341<i>WI</i>. The article's author
    has access to Admiralty records (p.302). BL MS. 34611 (f.143),
    Barrow to Macvey Napier, 22 Dec. 1814, discusses submitting to
    <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> an article on the British
    fishery (Macvey Napier was editor of the Supplement). All
    Barrow can promise is to 'new mould' his information 'and put
    it into a more popular shape.'&nbsp;</span></p>

    'Quarterly Review / Krusensterns Voyage Dr [i.e., debit] / 1

    article's author refers back to #170, which is also by Barrow,
    and pp.433-35 is a defence of it. The author of #299, Barrow,
    states on page 285 that the article continues from #255. It was
    Barrow's signature practice in his <i>QR</i> articles to refer
    to his own works. Articles #132 and #231, by different hands,
    are also referred to.&nbsp;</span></p>
