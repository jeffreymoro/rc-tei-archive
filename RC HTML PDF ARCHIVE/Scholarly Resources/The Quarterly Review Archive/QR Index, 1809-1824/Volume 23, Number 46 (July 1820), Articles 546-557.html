      a friend of Pope and professor of poetry at Oxford, left a mass of manuscript 
      anecdotes, recollections, and notes of conversations with Pope and others. 
      He obviously intended his notes for posthumous publication and, after passing 
      through several hands, one group of manuscripts reached Malone and another 
      reached Singer. The manuscript of this title was made good use of after the 
      author's death (in 1768) by many who knew the Rev. Spence and the quality 
      of his literary criticism: Owen Ruffhead and Samuel Johnson in their lives

    <p class="smallprint">[Bookseller's note on <i>Travels in the North of Germany</i>: 
      'After his early naval career, Hodgskin (1787-1869) embarked, in July 1815, 
      upon a three-year continental tour, with the object of collecting material 
      on the social and economic conditions of Europe in the aftermath of the Napoleonic 
      wars. The present work was the result. "[His] description and information 
      were accompanied by a sort of running commentary, consisting of a considered 
      criticism of the ideas of government and law" (Elie Hal<i>&eacute;</i>vy, <i>Thomas Hodgskin</i>, 
      pp. 42-43). The work is also concerned with questions of economic and social 
      justice. It contains an important passage (II, 97-8) expounding the socialist 
      viewpoint, centred on a labour theory of value, which was to be more fully 
      formulated in his pamphlet, <i>Labour defended against the Claims of Capital</i>, 
      published five years later, and from which Marxian economic thought later 
      germinated: "Capital is the produce of labour, and profit is nothing but a 
      portion of that labour, uncharitably exacted for permitting the labourer to 
      consume a part of what he has himself produced". See Hal<i>&eacute;</i>vy, op. cit., pp. 
      42-51, and Esther Lowenthal, <i>The Ricardian Socialists</i>, ch. 4. Goldsmiths'

    <p class="smallprint">The following evidence and information is published here

      WG has edited 'Edgeworth' and has suggested some additions. Florida MS., Croker 
      to T. Casey, 20 July 1820: 'Now do me a review (postponing the Cathedral inquiries)[.] 
      Edgeworth's life published by his daughter is under the hands of one of our 
      reviewers who has applied to me as the only Irishman in the fraternity for 
      Irish facts&#151;but alas, I am wholly ignorant of the man & his life&#151;they 
      say the book is full of <u>lies</u>; those in the first vol <u>English</u> 
      lies, told by him self, & easily detected there; those in the 2d. vol, <u>Irish</u> 
      lies carefully wrapped up by the &lt;?&gt; &lt;?&gt; of the daughter. I wish 
      you would read the 2d. vol & give me as soon as possible your observations, 
      but, at all events get me some account of whether Edgeworth ever knew Langford 
      before 1796.&#151;Did he make any <span class="smallprint"><sub>^</sub><sup>other</sup></span> efforts 
      to get into parliament at any time&#151;did he take any political bribes&#151;what 
      was the <u>secret</u> of his <u>extraordinary conduct</u> thinking <u>for</u> 
      it&#151;voting against it. How &lt;?&gt; for the Johnstown&#151;These are 
      the kind of things which you are more likely to know or at least to get at, 
      than the foundations of Cathedrals; & so I hope for complete information. 
      Florida MS., Croker to Casey, 24 July 1820: 'I expect a &lt;bunch?&gt; of 
      Edgeworthiana from you&#151;you will continue to <u>direct</u> Adm[iralt]y. 
      Look in pages 223 &c. What was the secret of this affair ....' Iowa MS., WG 
      to JM, [n.d., no watermark], 'Burn this / My dear Sir / I read all the Proofs&#151;still 
      regretting even my gentle termination&#151;but it is better to hazard it, 
      than to continue the struggle, which I rather feared. I hope all is now done 
      in good humour, & that no more will be said on either side&#151;As for the 
      public, they will stare perhaps&#151;but one must keep our secret very strictly.'
