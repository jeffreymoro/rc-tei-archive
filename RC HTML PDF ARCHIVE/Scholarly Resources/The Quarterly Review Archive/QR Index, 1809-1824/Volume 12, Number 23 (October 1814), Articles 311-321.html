    Shine cites Graham in <i>SP</i> XXII 509 and Clark 179, 201,
    203.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following discussion, published
    here for the first time, is followed by evidence for authorship
    that is also published here for the first time.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">'I never felt more vexed in my
    life,' Lamb wrote to Wordsworth when he saw what WG had made of
    this review (letter #287, 7 Jan. 1815 in Marrs, <i>Letters of
    Charles and Mary Anne Lamb</i> III 128). In an earlier episode,
    in <i>QR</i> #177, WG had gravely insulted Lamb by calling him
    a 'poor maniac'. When challenged by Southey to explain himself
    in that instance, WG abjectly apologized and claimed that in
    using the epithet he had known Lamb only by name.&nbsp; Southey
    accepted the apology and then persuaded Lamb to contribute the
    review on Wordsworth.&nbsp; Upon receiving the article, WG
    applied his editorial pen. He did so to make it, he said, less
    foolish. After its publication, Lamb told Wordsworth that a
    third of the article had been altered, with twelve or so
    passages excised and the whole rendered
    unintelligible.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">Looking at the matter
    disinterestedly, however,&nbsp;it is difficult to see grounds
    for Lamb's complaint. Few if any critics or historians have
    come to the defence of WG; most&mdash;apparently without
    looking too deeply into the matter&mdash;have sided with Lamb,
    as does Marrs (III 132n). Marrs quotes at great length a
    reviewer in the <i>Athenaeum</i> who suggested the episode
    revealed in WG a 'deep-seated corruption of principle if not of
    character'.&nbsp;But none of that is true if the article
    deserved to be rescued from Lamb's 'foolishness,' as indeed may
    have been the case if the testimony of Grosvenor Bedford,
    Southey's friend and as such not usually an apologist for WG's
    excisions, is to be credited. Bedford saw at least a part of
    Lamb's manuscript and thought it 'both feeble and affected'
    (Bodleian MS. Eng. d.52 ff.117-18, 1 Feb.
    1815).&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">Contrast Bedford's view of the
    manuscript with the published article, which is to say Lamb's
    work as revised by WG. It reads well. What WG preserved of
    Lamb's original manuscript is a forceful, clear, comprehensive
    discussion of the poem and an explanation of its Romantic
    principles. WG preserved many wonderfully expressive passages,
    such as the following: 'Nothing can be conceived finer than the
    manner of introducing these tales. With heaven above his head,
    and the mouldering turf at his feet &ndash; standing betwixt
    life and death &ndash; he seems to maintain that spiritual
    relation which he bore to his living flock, in its undiminished
    strength, even with their ashes; and to be in his proper cure,
    or diocese, among the dead.' (p.108) WG permitted Lamb to
    praise Wordsworth unambiguously and fulsomely: 'The causes
    which have prevented the poetry of Mr. Wordsworth from
    attaining its full share of popularity are to be found in the
    boldness and originality of his genius.' (p.110) WG admitted a
    number of challenging insightful definitions of Romanticism,
    including Lamb's suggestive 'Natural Methodism' (p.105) and 'To
    a mind constituted like that of Mr. Wordsworth, the stream, the
    torrent, and the stirring leaf &ndash; seem not merely to
    suggest associations of deity, but to be a kind of speaking
    communication with it.' (p.108)&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">Too, some of WG's excisions appear
    to make eminent sense. He removed, because he thought it
    digressive and believed it would unnecessarily bring the
    <i>QR</i> into direct conflict with the <i>Edinburgh
    Review</i>, an apparently elaborate refutation of Francis
    Jeffrey's classification in the August 1807 <i>Edinburgh</i> of
    Wordsworth, Southey, and Coleridge as 'Lake Poets'. WG and JM
    were careful to pick their fights with the <i>Edinburgh</i>, as
    for example in #17 and #168 when WG removed passages from
    Southey's articles critical of their northern rival. We can
    lament the loss of Lamb's discussion of the term 'Lake Poets',
    but WG's action is defensible.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following relevant primary
    evidence is published here for the first time. Bodleian MS. Eng
    d. 52 (ff.100-1), Grosvenor Bedford to Robert Southey, 30 Oct.
    1814, demonstrates that Lamb was at least consulted by WG about
    the excisions he wanted to make. Bedford states that WG
    returned the Wordsworth review to Lamb for 'some slight
    alteration,' including cutting from the beginning of the
    article a refutation of the 'Lake Poets' classification.
    Bodleian MS. Eng d. 52 (ff.117-18), Bedford to Southey, 1 Feb.
    1815, says that Frank Sayers of Norwich (a contributor to the
    <i>QR</i>) wondered if the article was intended as a burlesque.
    Bedford had seen parts at least of the original MS. and did not
    think well of it. He thought it 'feeble and affected.' Bodleian
    MS. Eng d.52 (ff.121-22), Bedford to Southey, 15 Feb. 1815,
    Southey wished to see the original MS. of the article; it had
    already been destroyed. NLS MS. 866 (f.149), WG to Walter
    Scott, 11 Sept. 1817: 'He [Southey] forced Lambe [<i>sic</i>]
    upon me for a foolish Art and was then hurt because to save the
    Revw. I made it less so.'</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence
    demonstrating Canning's authorship of this article was first
    published in <i>VPR</i> 28. This is the only article that
    Canning wrote for the <i>QR</i> not in collaboration with
    others. Harewood MS., WG to George Canning, Tuesday noon, [n.d.
    but late Oct. 1814], says that because he has let the printers
    close the 'July' Number it is perhaps too late to insert
    Canning's 'little Art.' and asks if it could be made the
    introduction to the review Canning had promised for the October
    Number, which, WG says, must be ready by the end of December.
    The letter also praises George Ellis's 'beautiful Art. on Lord
    Byron' (i.e., #308). The date of the letter and the issue
    Number referred to are established by the Ellis reference. This
    is the only Number that bears the title page date of October in
    which appears a review of Byron by Ellis. Harewood MS., WG to
    George Canning, 9 Nov. 1814, sends slips of a review by Canning
    in which Whitebread is mentioned (see pp.155-56 of this
    article).&nbsp;</span></p>

    Scot, is best known as a philosopher. His <i>Observations on
    the Nature and Tendency of Mr. Hume's Doctrine Concerning the
    Relation of Cause and Effect</i>, was published in Edinburgh,
    1804. A contemporary reviewer wrote of Brown: "Neither Bacon,
    nor Hobbes, nor Berkeley, nor Locke, possessed powers of mind
    so splendid and so various". Poetry, however, was Brown's love
    from an early age. The product of many years of writing during
    leisure moments snatched from law and medical studies, Brown's
    medical practice, and his philosophical lectures at Edinburgh,
    <i>Paradise</i> was declared "the best and most brilliant
    imitation of Pope that has appeared since the time of the great
    writer." (Allibone III, p. 260). Later reviewers, however, have
    referred to his poetry as "commonplace" and "indifferent,"
    declaring that it "never made much impression" (see <i>DNB</i>
    and <i>EB</i>-11). Shaw and Shoemaker 37103'].</p>
