    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence and
    information was first published in <i>VPR</i> 27. The article
    is certainly not Southey's; it does not appear in Southey's
    definitive MS. list of his <i>QR</i> articles. Murray MS., WG
    to John Taylor Coleridge, [4 Apr. 1818 postmark], says that
    Southey has given him a paper on the Poor Laws. Fetter: Southey
    and Rickman, cites Williams, 'Some Unpublished Letters of
    Robert Southey,' <i>Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</i>
    <i>CLXIV</i> (1898), 167-85 and note. Williams makes clear that
    Rickman in 1817 was furnishing Southey material on the poor law
    for use in the <i>QR</i>, and it is probable that the material
    was used in this article, as well as in #469. Murray MS., Cash
    Book, 1817-18, p.186: 'Quarterly Review No. 36 ... Recomposing
    RS 2 sheets 5&pound;.' There is no other article in this Number
    that is plausibly by Southey. Southey, <i>New Letters</i> II
    317; Curry II 178; and Kaderly <i>MLN</i> 70, 261-63 show that
    Rickman wished not to be known by the <i>QR</i> editorial
    coterie as author of this review, that he had Southey present
    his review to WG, and that WG and JM mistakenly believed the
    article was from Southey himself. John Davison, the author of
    one of the works under review, was an important contributor to
    the <i>QR</i>.</span></p>

    "smallprint">Shine does not suggest an author for this article
    and demonstrates that in ascribing the article to Mr [William]
    Hamilton JM III in his so-called Register mistook a reference
    in Murray MS., WG to JM [June 1818] for #455 that points
    instead to the authorship of #457. Shine quotes from Murray
    MS., WG to JM [June 1818]: 'I wish you would look at the
    Revise&mdash;you can form a better guess than I can whether
    what I have struck out, will leave room for the insertion of
    those parts of Mr Hamilton's ms which are no[t] crossed. If
    not&mdash;the note on the Memnon on p.308 [actually p.368] must
    be struck out. ... The note is certainly creditable to Mr
    Hamilton's judgment and taste.' Shine states, 'That MS letter
    probably was the basis for [JM III's] ascription of Art 2 (pp.
    308-24) to Hamilton. However, examination of QR XVIII shows
    that "page 308" (Art. 2) is a mistake for p. 368 (Art. 4): see
    Entry 457.' Shines says to see also Grierson V
    116.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence and
    information is published here for the first time.
    <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> (March 1844), 246-47, attribution
    to Barrow, but this source is often unreliable. The author of
    the article quotes from Barrow's <i>Travels</i> and refers back
    to articles on the same topic, #428, #438, and #446, all of
    which are by Barrow. In his <i>QR</i> articles<i>,</i> it was
    Barrow's signature practice to refer to his own works. The
    article is in Barrow's vein and resembles his writing in most
    respects. Murray MS., Book Loans Register: the book reviewed
    was sent to 'W Jacob' on 14 July 1817. No additional evidence
    has been located to support an attribution to Jacob. Korea is
    spelled in the article's head note as above. John Murray
    published the volume under review.</span></p>

    <p class="smallprint">[Bookseller's note, from Hill, modified:
    'This expedition took Lord Amherst's embassy to China and
    explored the relatively little-known East China Sea and the
    Yellow Sea. Visits were made to Korea and the Ryukyu
    Archipelago. Europeans had sketchily explored Korea, but it was
    not until the Alceste and Lyra expedition in 1816-17, under
    Captains Murray Maxwell and Basil Hall, that detailed
    information was obtained about the Ryukyus. On the homeward
    passage, the Alceste was wrecked in Gaspar Strait off Sumatra.
    Basil Hall was post-captain in the British Navy and saw
    extensive duty on the Pacific coast of America. Hill p.

    "smallprint">In querying its attribution to John Wilson Croker,
    Shine does not accept the unqualified attribution to Croker in
    JM III's Register. Shine cites Graham 41; Clark 197-98, 213-14;
    and Brightfield 454; and says to see also Jennings I 134. Shine
    also quotes from Smiles II 322, where Croker, in 1831, is
    quoted as saying about Hunt: '... I knew neither him nor his
    works, except "Rimini"'. It is not clear from the presentation
    of this evidence why Shine queries JM III's attribution, unless
    Shine believed the quotation from Smiles put the matter into
    doubt. In suggesting John Taylor Coleridge as a queried
    alternative, Shine cites White 124-25, 363, 393, but White does
    not decide between Coleridge and Croker. In suggesting Robert
    Southey as a third, unqueried, alternative, Shine cites Smiles
    I 399 that quotes a Byron to JM letter, 24 Nov. 1818; in it
    Byron ascribes the article to Southey.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence was first
    published in <i>VPR</i> 27 (correcting an earlier attribution
    in <i>VPR</i> 24). The article is definitely Coleridge's:
    Murray MS., WG to John Taylor Coleridge, [4 Apr. 1818
    postmark], encloses proofs of this article: 'have no fear, you
    have not been too severe ....' WG's comment demonstrates that
    Coleridge was therefore responsible for originating material
    that appeared in the article and was not (as might have been
    the case) acting as sub-editor, say, of Croker's work. Murray
    MS., WG to Coleridge, 24 Apr. 1818, Coleridge returns a
    borrowed copy of 'Leigh Hunt.' To put alternatives to rest: the
    article is certainly not by Southey; it does not appear in the
    definitive MS. list of his <i>QR</i> articles. The article is
    claimed by Croker in two of his Clements Library MS. lists;
    however, in what is demonstrably the later of these two lists,
    the entry is first queried and then crossed out. The article is
    not included in the Cambridge University bound volumes of
    Croker's articles.</span></p>

    "smallprint">Shine co-attributes the article to Henry Salt,
    John Barrow, and William Hamilton, in that order. In doing so,
    Shine cites JM III's Register (that attributes the article to
    Salt alone) and <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> XXI 414 (that
    states the article was based on documents contributed by Salt).
    Shine quotes from Murray MS., WG to JM, [June 1818]: 'I wish
    you would look at the Revise&mdash;you can form a better guess
    than I can whether what I have struck out, will leave room for

    'Hall believes the article was "compiled from documents sent
    over by Mr Salt."'</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence, first
    published in <i>VPR</i> 28, demonstrates that the article was
    primarily by Barrow, with information from Hamilton and Salt.
    Murray MS., John Barrow to JM, 17 Nov. 1818, speaks of the
    article as his. The article's author refers back to #337
    (twice), which is by Barrow, and makes two personal references
    to Barrow. The article is referred to in #472 (twice), #531
    (three times, including a specific reference), and in #578, all
    of which are by Barrow. In his <i>QR</i> articles<i>,</i> it
    was Barrow's signature practice to refer to his own works.
    There is no information in Henry Salt's fascinating letters at
    John Murray's to illuminate Salt's role in this article. Salt,
    <i>Life and Correspondence</i>, ed. J. J. Halls (1834), I 491
    correctly states (as quoted in Shine):&nbsp; 'compiled from
    documents sent over by Mr Salt.'&nbsp;John Murray published the

    "smallprint">In querying its attribution to James Russell,
    Shine cites Graham in <i>SP</i> XXII 506 and Clark 213-14 (but
    Clark merely repeats Graham). Shine points out that the
    attribution to Russell is probably based on JM III's Register
    entry for #486 (another article on Hazlitt) that arose from JM
    III's misreading in Murray MS., WG to JM,&nbsp; [Aug. 1818],
    of&nbsp; 'Russell' for 'Barrett'&nbsp;and says to see, however,
    #487. Shine gives Gifford as an alternative attribution, citing
    Hazlitt 417-32, but that is no evidence at
    all.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following discussion is
    published here for the first time. The article has often been
    attributed to WG, as in Clark 213-14, but Clark does not
    believe it reads like WG, and no one has found primary evidence
    to suggest that it is his. <i>Contra</i> Clark's opinion (p.
    213-14), the article seems to the present writer to read very
    much like WG&mdash;pedantic and sardonic. As WG had done
    elsewhere, the author taunts Hazlitt for his association with
    the working class and attacks his politics and morals. In the
    article's first sentence the author refers back to #403, which
    is probably by WG.</span></p>

    "smallprint">&nbsp;In attributing the article to Jerdan, Shine
    cites Jerdan III 55 and says to see also Brightfield 257. In
    suggesting Henry Ellis as a queried alternative Shine cites JM
    III's Register and quotes from Murray MS., Henry Ellis to JM,
    Saturday [?March 1818]: 'It [i.e., some MS. that Ellis had been
    reading for Murray] contains very little new matter upon the
    most interesting point, the Pindarries themselves. It would
    however form a good text for an article in the next Quarterly
    upon the present state of India and I should have no objection
    to undertake it.' [<i>Quarterly Review</i> Archive editor's
    note: The letter Shine quotes does not represent evidence that
    Ellis actually produced an article.]&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. Harewood MS., WG to George Canning, 21
    Feb. 1818, says he has sent Jerdan proofs for the conclusion of
    his article. Harewood MS., WG to George Canning, 28 Feb. 1818,
    sends the whole of Jerdan's proofs. There is no other article
    in this Number that could plausibly be by Jerdan that is not
    already reasonably attributed to another author. Note opening
    sentence:&nbsp; 'The rise and progress of the Mahratta States
    have been fully detailed by us in the course of our critical
    labour from more elaborate works than the little volume before
    us.' Articles that appeared before this on India include #160,
    #273, and #442, all of which are by Barrow. But the article is
    not in Barrow's manner, and the opening sentence can be seen as
    apologetic. Because it was WG's usual practice to have articles
    sub-edited by specialists, it is also possible that Barrow
    looked at the article before its publication and that Barrow
    added the first sentence.</span></p>
