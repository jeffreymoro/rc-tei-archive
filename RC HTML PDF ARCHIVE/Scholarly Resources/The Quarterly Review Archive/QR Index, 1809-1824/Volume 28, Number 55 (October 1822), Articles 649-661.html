    <em>Sir Gregor MacGregor and the Land That Never Was</em>
    (2003). It is a first-hand look into one of the most fraudulent
    schemes of the early 19th Century. Supposedly written by Gregor
    MacGregor himself, this book reinforced the myth of foreign
    hopes and bounty like none before it.' 'Once upon a time in the
    heart of Central America, there was a country named Poyais. It
    was exceptionally rich in natural resources and culture and it
    was governed by the brave and enlightened Scottish soldier, Sir
    Gregor MacGregor. On a cold January morning in 1823, a group of
    Scottish immigrants looking for a new life set sail for this
    tropical Eden. When the settlers&rsquo; finally landed on the
    swamp-ridden Mosquito Coast, they realised they had been the
    victims of an elaborate hoax. The land they had bought did not

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following information is
    published here for the first time. The first part of the
    article is a criticism of parochial societies in general and of
    the Royal Society of Literature in particular. The balance is a
    defence of John Ireland's copyright. Ireland, Dean of
    Westminster, was WG's closest friend and a some time
    contributor to the <i>QR</i>. A possibility is 'Collinson,'
    perhaps Septimus Collinson, a divine. A 'Collinson' certainly
    published in the <i>QR</i> in this period, but no article has
    been identified as from his pen. See John Wilson Croker to John
    Murray, Brighton, 29 March 1823 (quoted in Smiles II 57-58): '
    ... remember the necessity of <u>absolute</u> secrecy on this
    point, and indeed on all others. If you were to publish such
    names as Cohen and Croker and Collinson and Coleridge, the
    magical WE would have little effect, and your Review would be
    absolutely despised&mdash;<i>omne ignotum pro mirifico</i>.'

    Murray MS., WG to JM, postmarked 18 July 1822: 'I have indeed
    run thru Dr O'Meara .... A couple of precious scoundrels &amp;
    saints&mdash;the Dr &amp; his patrons are! I trust however they
    are both in Mr Croker's hands whose property they naturally
    are.' Murray MS., WG to JM, [Oct. 1822]: 'We can hardly have
    O'Meara for this No. I suppose .... I own I shall not, unless
    Mr C expects it, wish to wait. If he is anxious about it, we
    must, I suppose have it but it will make us very late.' Murray
    MS., WG to JM, [Mar. 1823]: '[A report says] the French have
    had the Art. on O'Meara translated &amp; dispersed in great
    numbers about Paris &amp; the country. Our friend seldom writes
    in vain.' Iowa MS., JM to Croker, [pencil notation: March 31,
    1823]: 'I have just seen Mr Wilmot who has undertaken to favour
    me with an article on O'Meara &amp; when you come back we will
    give him materials&mdash;a Pamphlet from America, I perceive,
    is advertised for the 1st of April.'&nbsp;[<i>Quarterly
    Review</i> editor's note: the promised article did not
    appear.]</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">Some of the following evidence was
    first published in <i>VPR</i> 24 and <i>VPR</i> 28. Information
    about PRO/ J76/7/1 ff. 1-58 is published here for the first
    time; this information casts important light on the development
    and reception of the article, and, moreover, on the
    Government's role in the conduct of the <i>QR</i>. In the
    article's first paragraphs, the reviewer indicates that his
    article is one in a series. The series he alludes to consists
    of <i>QR</i> articles #408, 418, and 439, each of which is by
    Croker. On page 253 of the article, the author makes a specific
    reference to article #321, which is by Croker. The author makes
    a specific reference on page 242 to article #418, which is also
    by Croker. Murray MS., Cash Book 1821-24: the same person was
    paid for articles 2 and 13 in this Number (article 2 is #650,
    by Croker). This article is claimed by Croker in five of his
    Clements Library MS. lists and it is included in the Cambridge
    University bound volumes of Croker's articles.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">Murray MS., Croker to JM, 19 Feb.
    1823, Croker, speaking of this article, asks testily why JM
    should assume he was the author, a statement that can only be
    understood in the light of PRO J76/7/1 ff. 1-58: shortly after
    the article's publication, certain participants in the
    article's creation feared that statements in the article would
    lead to litigation against its authors; in his letter to JM,
    Croker was referring only to those statements. PRO J76/7/1 ff.
    1-58 contains voluminous correspondence concerning article
    #661, mostly between Sir Hudson Lowe and his military
    secretary, Lieutenant Colonel George Gorrequer, and between
    Gorrequer, Count Montholon, and Robert Wilmot Horton. The
    correspondence demonstrates that (with the exception of
    Montholon) each of these men complied with a request to submit
    material for use in #661. The focus of the correspondence and
    the reason for its preservation in the PRO is Gorrequer's
    threat to publicly denounce the use of his name in the article
    in the context of a passage on page 238: 'We have Sir Thomas
    Read's and Colonel Gorrequer's authority for this statement,
    and the notes themselves are deposited in Mr. Murray's hands,
    to satisfy any one who might doubt the accuracy of our
    quotations, which, we confess will be scarcely credible.'
    Gorrequer feared that the statement on page 238 put him in the
    position of attesting to the accuracy of the translation from
    the Italian of the word 'poltrone' as 'coward' in a letter
    quoted on page 243 in which O'Meara (according to this
    interpretation) calls Count Montholon a
    coward.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">Southampton MS., Croker to Arthur
    Wellesley, Duke of Wellington, 5 Feb. 1823 [archivist's summary
    of contents]: says WG has prepared a mock castigation of
    O'Meara; asks permission for WG to publish a paper sent by
    Wellington to Lord Whitworth concerned with Buonaparte's
    instructions to Talleyrand for treating with Lord Whitworth;
    WG&nbsp; is ready to publish and urges a prompt reply. Murray
    MS., John Taylor Coleridge to WG, 15 Feb. 1823, says the
    article on O'Meara 'comes some months after it ought to have
    done, and I think in manner is not so finished as it would have
    been if Gifford had been quite a stout man&mdash;but it is
    <u>conclusive</u> upon the book&mdash;why did not Sir H L put
    these materials in your hands sooner.' Sir Hudson Lowe
    (1769-1844), lieutenant-general and governor of St. Helena
    (1815-21). His treatment of Napoleon was attacked by O'Meara,
    Napoleon's surgeon. See Forsyth, <i>Captivity of Napoleon at
    St. Helena</i> (1853), based on the Lowe papers. Concerning
    Iowa MS., JM to Croker, n.d. [pencil notation in another hand:
    31 Mar. 1823], quoted above, if the date is correct, Wilmot did
    not produce his article on O'Meara and the pamphlet may refer
    to #719.</span></p>

    <p class="smallprint">[Booksellers' notes: 'O'Meara was a
    thoroughly disreputable character, and this rabidly partisan
    work drew furious responses from many quarters, including the
    Duke of Wellington and Louis Bonaparte. Nevertheless, it has
    influenced later scholarship and is undoubtedly (if used
    cautiously) one of the most important St. Helena works.' Tulard
    579. 'This view [that it was because O'Meara's was Irish that
    he was partial to Napoleon] is supported by O'Meara's
    deportment at the end of his life when he became an active
    member of O'Connell's Reform Club. But that was after he had
    been lionised by Byron and other admirers. At this stage of his
    life O'Meara displayed a different sort of [stereotypical]
    Irishness: already drummed out of the army in 1807 for
    duelling, he was drummed out of St. Helena in 1818 for openly
    and repeatedly slandering Sir Hudson Lowe.' Sutcliffe, <em>The
    Sandler Collection</em> (1996)]</p>
