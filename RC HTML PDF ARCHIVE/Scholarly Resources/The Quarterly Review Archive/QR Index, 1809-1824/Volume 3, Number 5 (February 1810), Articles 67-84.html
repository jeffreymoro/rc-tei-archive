      In attributing the article to Young, Shine cites JM III's Register; Brande 
      XXVIII 157; <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> XXI 138; Young 230-38; and Pettigrew 
      IV 21. Shine also quotes from Murray MS., WG to JM, 13 Feb. 1810 [16 Feb. 
      postmark]: 'Dr Young has set up a page of curious Greek with Fry's types, 
      which he wishes to have inserted in his Article.' </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence and information is published 
      here for the first time. The article appears in Young's definitive MS. list 
      of his QR articles. Devon MS. 1149M (f.78), WG to Edward Copleston, 21 Apr. 
      1810: mentions Young's article on Herculanensia. BL MS. 28099 (f.69), WG to 
      George Ellis, 12 Feb. [1810], says Young's article in this Number is 'above 
      all praise.' Murray MS., George Ellis to JM, 2 Feb. 1810, says he has returned 
      to WG 'the excellent article on the Herculanean manuscript'. George D'Oyly 
      told Blomfield about the article, who hurried a note to Jeffrey to stop a 
      similar article from appearing in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. 'If his letter 
      arrives in time, we have lost a triumph.' NLS MS. 3879 (f.50), WG to Walter 
      Scott, 28 Mar. 1810: 'In Herculanensia I have no doubt that we surpass any 
      thing the Edin. Rev. can do.' NLS MS. 3879 (f.74), WG to Scott, 9 May 1810: 
      'Sir Wm [Drummond] ... is highly gratified with the review of Herculanensia, 
      and has offered his services&#8212;this, of course is not for the profane.&#8212;I know 
      not what kind of works to send him.&#8212;pious m.s. you say!!! O shocking! I thought 
      you had more gravity.' Drummond was notorious among Christians for his forthright 
      atheism; his anti-religious polemics in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> gave that 
      journal a reputation for impiety and thus indirectly contributed to the founding 
      of the <i>QR</i>. It is notable that he would consider contributing to the 
      <i>QR</i>. </span></p>

      In attributing the article to Reginald Heber alone, Shine cites JM III's Register 
      (that queries its suggestion to 'Scott or Heber'). Shine also quotes from 
      the following letters. Murray MS., WG to JM, 2 Feb. 1810: 'I have detained 
      Wallace, because I expect Mr. Gray to send for it at the request of Mr. [Richard] 
      Heber.' Murray MS., WG to JM, [?Feb. 1810]: '&lt;H&gt;[olford] is finished,

      will take care of the last leaf of which perhaps your suspicions are right.' 
      [<i>Quarterly Review</i> Archive editor's note: in quoting these letters, 
      Shine incorrectly assumes that 'Mr. Heber' refers to Reginald Heber, a sometime 
      contributor to the <i>QR</i>. The reference is instead to Reginald's brother 
      Richard, a close friend of Walter Scott's who at this time frequently acted 
      as WG's sub-editor of Scott's reviews for the <i>QR</i>. See the discussion 
      that follows.] </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">Some of the following evidence and information was 
      first published in <i>VPR</i> 28; some is published here for the first time. 
      A combination of evidence&#151;including the article's content, the material 
      cited by Shine, and the evidence of the following letters and those quoted 
      at entry #87&#151;suggests that Scott is the author of article #71 and that 
      Richard Heber looked over the proofs. For the sake of clarity, the Shines' 
      evidence quoted above is repeated here. NLS MS. 3878 (f.236), WG to Walter 
      Scott, 30 Dec. 1809: 'Murray says he has sent you Wallace&#8212;and he has done 
      well. Not that Wallace is worthy of your pains, for the story is poorly told, 
      and the battle not quite as well fought as the one which I have "heard"... 
      is to be found in a long poem called Marmion ....' Murray MS., WG to JM, 2 
      Feb. 1810: 'I have detained Wallace, because I expect Mr. Gray to send for 
      it at the request of Mr. [Richard] Heber.' Murray MS., WG to JM, [? 1810]: 
      'The conclusion of Wallace I had condemned before your letter came.' Murray 
      MS., WG to JM, [tentatively dated in Shine as Feb. 1810]: '<h>&lt;H&gt;[olford] 
      is finished, but I ... want to look it over narrowly&#151;it will make 6 or 
      7 pages&#151;which are perhaps too many. The proofs, I sent to Mr Heber by 
      his desire .... I will take care of the last leaf of which perhaps your suspicions 
      are right.' Murray MS., WG to JM, [Mar. 1810], says Scott's article has arrived 
      and 'it is an Ironical imitation of Dr Johnson.' Murray MS., WG to JM, [17 
      Mar. 1810]: 'The packet from Scott is this instant arrived&#151;but I do not 
      see how we can insert it, as I think we are full. However we will talk it 
      over&#151;I have not yet opened it.' (This letter is quoted by Shine at entry 
      #90.) Murray MS., WG to JM, [17 Mar. 1810]: 'Mr Heber, who called here this 
      evening, thinks Scott's Article should if possible appear on account of his 
      name. If you are of the same opinion, let me know, and I will prepare it.' 
      BL MS. 28099 (f.72), WG to Ellis, 6 Apr. 1810: 'O that Scott! He sent me two 
      hurried articles, just as the Rev. [Number 5] was printed.'</span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">To summarize the above evidence: In December 1809, 
      JM sent Scott a review copy of <i>Wallace</i>. (If only because of the cost, 
      JM usually sent books for review by prior arrangement.) By early February 
      WG had in hand a review of <i>Wallace</i>. On the advice of Richard Heber, 
      he sent the review to a Mr. Gray. The only person by that name known to be 
      associated <i>Quarterly Review</i> was Sir Charles Edward Grey, though at 
      a later date (see, for example, #516). There is chance this is instead a clever 
      pseudonym for Scott, alluding to Scott's 'The Gray Brother'. The 'ironical 
      imitation of Johnson' is announced as if it were a production WG has seen 
      for the first time and is therefore evidence against #71 being by Scott. And 
      yet, the next articles published in the <i>QR</i> that are known to be by 
      Scott, #87 and 100, cannot be described as 'ironical imitations of Johnson' 
      whereas, arguably, article #71 does match that description. The article's 
      first pages employ the hallmarks of Augustan prose, balanced, epigrammatic 
      phrases, and there are references to correct models and modes of imitation. 
      The author playfully cautions against imitating living authors (if it is Scott, 
      because the living author may review his imitator's work). The reviewer ironically 
      criticizes Holford's <i>Falkirk</i> for its successful imitation of aspects 
      of Scott's <i>Marmion</i> in which critics had found fault ('Mr. Scott was 
      accused of overstepping the bounds of probability in making De Wilton escape 
      detection ... in consequence of his wearing a Palmer's dress .... The author of 
      <em>Wallace</em> has however proceeded much further ....' p. 65). The letter of 17 March 
      announcing the arrival of what is apparently a second article may refer to 
      #87. The letter of 6 April 1810 clearly demonstrates that  by 
      March 1810 WG had in hand two articles by Scott. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">Richard Heber's role in the early years of the journal 
      has seldom been commented on in the scholarship. He recruited a number of 
      important contributors, including his brother, Reginald, and Robert Grant, 
      Reginald's friend. Moreover, Richard Heber was a close friend to Walter Scott 
      and George Canning. Famously, Heber was present at the October 1809 meeting 
      at Ashestiel with Scott, Murray, and Ballantyne where the subject was broached of establishing 
      a Tory journal to rival the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. It was often 
      at Heber's prodding that Scott  produced 
      material for the <em>QR</em>. For the present article, as with others by Scott, Heber 
      acted as Scott's conscience, determining  if the piece was sufficiently 
      up to standard. Heber is identified in the Shine volume as Reginald, Richard 
      Heber's younger brother, probably because Reginald was a frequent contributor 
      while Richard never wrote for the QR. However, it was Richard, not Reginald, 
      who was a member of the journal's editorial coterie and the former frequently, 
      the latter seldom, offered his opinion on articles or had it solicited by 
      WG. </span></p>

      Shine also quotes from Murray MS., WG to JM, 13 Mar. 1810 [notation on letter 
      in JM II's hand: 'In answer to my solicitation to leave out a Note reflecting 
      on Playfair in an Article on Archimedes ....'] 'The 1st proof is not yet returned 
      from Woolwich ....' [<i>Quarterly Review</i> Archive editor's note: in attributing 
      the article to Young, JM III appears to have been confused by Young's having 
      had a hand in articles #103 and 186. Young was, however, sub-editor of these 
      articles, not, as JM III thought, their primary author. JM III may also have 
      been confused by a reference to Young and Playfair in Murray MS., George Ellis 
      to JM, 23 June 1809, concerning which see #43.] </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence and discussion was first 
      published in VPR 28. JM insisted that Gregory drop from the article a criticism 
      of Playfair. WG expressed his pleasure at the appearance of this article. 
      He had an interest in the subject, as he was himself known as a competent 
      mathematician. The <i>Edinburgh Review</i>&#151;one of whose pillars was Henry 
      Brougham, who had made an impression at the university as a mathematician&#151;had 
      published some notable articles on mathematics. WG was happy to engage the 
      'Northern Blast' on this additional front. Young lived in London, on Welbeck 
      Street, whereas the article's author was at Woolwich, as indicated in Murray 
      MS., WG to JM, 13 Mar. 1810, quoted above. Gregory was mathematical master 
      at Woolwich Academy from 1802. He succeeded the eminent Charles Hutton as 
      professor of mathematics there and served in the period 1807-38. Article #73 
      is not on Young's definitive MS. list of his QR articles. This evidence, taken 
      together, indicates that Young's role in the article was, at best, a subordinate 
      one and that the article originated at Woolwich. Gregory is specifically identified 
      in Murray MS., Books Loaned Register, 8 Nov. 1811: a book reviewed at #186 
      was sent to 'Dr O. Gregory, Woolwich'. NLS MS. 3879 (f.50), WG to Walter Scott, 
      28 Mar. 1810: 'We have ventured on Mathematics <span class="smallprint">^<sup>too</sup></span> 
      you see, & I hope not ingloriously. There the E[dinburgh] R[eview] fancied 
      themselves perfectly secure.' See also evidence at #103 and #186. </span></p>

      [<i>Quarterly Review</i> Archive editor's note: the removal of the signature

      of Parr.' [<i>Quarterly Review</i> Archive editor's note: WG's denial in this 
      letter of Grant's authorship of #78 should be read in the light of Grant's 
      strenuous insistence that his contributions be kept a deep secret. To mask 
      (perhaps from Ellis) what might have been a good clue, WG is suggesting to 
      Murray that they adopt the fiction that the author of Parr and this article

    <p><span class="smallprint"> The following evidence was first published in <i>VPR</i> 
      24. BL MS. 28099 (f.85), quoted below definitively demonstrates that Grant 
      was the article's author. Bodleian MS., Eng. Lett. d.214 (f.55), Robert Grant 
      to Reginald Heber, 'Ireland' 11 Oct. 1809, concerning topics he might cover 
      in the QR, says he sees a work on paper money that could be a pretext 'for 
      attacking the present code of the Edinburgh wits [i.e., the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>] 
      about money matters.' BL MS. 28099 (f.72), WG to George Ellis, 6 Apr. 1810: 
      'I am glad of your little remark on Ricardo, as it may be useful. I can convey 
      it to our nameless friend through Heber. He has promised a review of Gifford's 
      lumbering life of Wm Pitt ....' (Cf. #114.) BL MS. 28099 (f.85), WG to Ellis, 
      15 Nov. 1810: explaining why Grant has declined to write <i>again</i> on bank 
      restriction, WG quotes Grant as saying that '[t]he subject has now assumed 
      a delicacy from which, when I wrote on Ricardo, it was exempt.' NLS MS. 3879 
      (f.50), WG to Walter Scott, 28 Mar. 1810: 'The next thing on Paper money is 
      anonymous, and came to me thro. a third hand' (probably Grant to Heber to 
      Teignmouth). Murray MS., Ellis to JM, 4 Apr. 1810, speaks of this article 
      as 'very masterly certainly.' Fetter: William Greenfield (probably), cites 
      'Cook; Ellis letters' at Murray and notes that 'the Ellis letters at Murray's 
      make it clear that Ellis did not do the review and indicate his belief that 
      "our unknown correspondent" did it.' The Ricardo volume under review was published

      John Latham (1787-1853), a school friend of Reginald Heber and graduate of 
      Brasenose College, Oxford. Copleston, however, discovered that his article

      Vinctus</i> (i.e., #138). Murray MS., Cash Book 1810-11, p. 7: '1810, Feb 
      1 Quarterly Review No 5 Dr [i.e., debit] Aristophanes <peter> &lt;Peter&gt; 
      Elmsley'. The Cash Book reference probably indicates that a copy of Elmsley's 
      Aristophanes was provided to the author of #80. At about this time, John Symmons 
      also wrote for WG on classics (see #92). He was, however, a recent graduate 
      of Oxford University. [These notes produced with the assistance of Dr. Christopher

      In querying its co-attribution to Ireland and Gifford, Shine cites JM III's 
      Register. Shine also quotes from the following letters. Murray MS., WG to 
      JM, postmark 31 Mar. 1810 [<i>Quarterly Review</i> Archive editor's note: 
      only part of the relevant portion of the letter is quoted in Shine; the letter 
      is more fully quoted in what follows]: 'I have seen the Dr [Ireland] & he 
      laughs at the idea. Let us keep our own secrets, & we shall do well.' Notation 
      on letter: 'Article on Syndey Smith in No 5 after my application to Mr G.' 
      Murray MS., WG to JM, 30 Mar. 1810 [notation in JM II's hand: 'Article on 
      Sidney Smith in No 5 after my application to Mr G&#151;to know if it were 
      quite proper. J.M.']: says 'I wish for my part, that every writer in the Rev. 
      was unknown to me, & that not an Article was heard of till it came out. Nothing 
      is so hostile to our success, as having too many confidants&#151;but we shall 
      grow wiser in our time, I hope.' Shine also quotes Smiles's transcription 
      of Murray MS., Ellis to JM, 4 Apr. 1810: 'G[ifford]. though the best tempered 
      man alive, is <u>terribly</u> severe with his pen; but S.S. would suffer ten 
      times more by being turned into ridicule ... than from being slashed and cauterized 
      in that manner.' [<i>Quarterly Review</i> Archive editor's note: Smiles, but 
      not Shine, quotes the following additional passage from the letter. Concerning 
      an article in this Number, WG must 'guard against the bad taste of Dr. I.'] 
      In suggesting Dudley alone as an alternative attribution, Shine cites JM III's 
      Register. In suggesting John Wilson Croker as a third alternative attribution, 
      Shine cites Smith vi and <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> XXI 138. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence was first published in <i>VPR</i> 
      27. Devon MS. 1149M (f.75), WG to Edward Copleston, 3 Jan. 1810: Richard Heber 
      says that Copleston's friend will review Sydney Smith. Devon MS. 1149M (f.114), 
      WG to Copleston, 9 Feb. 1810, says he is happy that 'Sidney is ready.' BL 
      MS. 28099 (f.69-72), WG to Ellis, 12 Feb. [1810], discussing articles in this 
      Number, says that '[Sydney Smith] is a nuisance to be abused; not merely a 
      Jack pudding parson; but a mischievous partisan ... [who] put me in a towering 
      passion.' Bodleian MS. Eng. lett. d.309 (f.20), Richard Heber to Copleston, 
      [3 Mar. 1810], says WG thanks Copleston for the article on Sydney Smith's 
      sermons and asks permission for himself and Dr. Ireland to make alterations 
      and additions, to give the article pungency. Devon MS. (f.113), WG to Copleston, 
      [late Mar. or early Apr. 1810]: thanks Copleston for procuring the article 
      on Sydney Smith; the article is from Copleston's friend. Murray MS., George 
      Ellis to JM, n.d., speaks of WG as having been harsh with Sydney Smith. BL 
      MS. 28099 (f.71-72), WG to Ellis, [6 Apr. 1810], excuses his severity toward 
      Sydney Smith and refers to the 'little headpiece' mentioned in Devon MS. (f.113), 
      which Dudley, through Copleston, apparently agreed to let WG insert; 'the 
      rest is his [Dudley's] own'. Devon MS. 1149M (f.79), WG to Copleston, 18 Oct. 
      1810, makes it clear that Dudley had recently submitted his first contribution. 
      NLS MS. 3879 (f.50), WG to Walter Scott, 28 Mar. 1810: 'Look at your friend 
      Sidney Smith [in this Number], and see how we have graced him. If he continues 
      to print Sermons, I will not as Stephano says, take too much from him: he 
      is a present for any Reviewer that ever trod on &lt;shoe&gt; leather.' </span></p>

      requesting me to review the great life of Nelson, and offering me 20 guineas 
      a sheet to do it .... The Life of Nelson is by Stainer Clark, whose ... laying 
      unhallowed hands upon such a subject, I am desired not to spare.' Murray MS.,

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence and discussion is published 
      here for the first time. The article appears in Southey's definitive MS. list 
      of his QR articles. Murray MS., Cash Book 1810-11, p.27: '5 April 1810 Quarterly 
      Review / Article 18 extra &pound;13.10 cheque No 799 ....' Murray MS., George Ellis 
      to JM, 4 Feb. 1810, says he is glad that Southey's article is to be '<u>animated</u> 
      and inserted.' NLS MS 3879 (f.50), WG to Walter Scott, 28 Mar. 1810: '[W]e 
      have also a very well written Article by Southey&#151;indeed excellent. It 
      has cost me an infinity of pains, merely, however, to reduce it, for it originally 
      filled four sheets!' NLS MS. 2528 (f.7), WG to Robert Southey, 18 Apr. 1810: 
      '... your most beautiful Essay on the Lives of Nelson. Sorry I was (and I 
      ask your pardon sincerely for it) to be driven by circumstances to some omissions; 
      but I have the consolation of thinking that not one syllable of yours has 
      been changed.' Murray MS., George Ellis to JM, 4 Apr. 1810, wonders how Murray 
      could ever have thought ill of Southey's Nelson. John Murray reprinted the 
      essay as a separate volume, with the portions excised by WG returned. Southey's 
      <i>Nelson</i> is considered to be one of the gems of English prose. </span></p>
