    Marshall 382. In suggesting Robert Southey as a queried
    alternative, Shine quotes from Murray MS., Thomas Young to
    [WG], 29 Aug. 1814: 'I have long had the review [<i>QR</i>
    Number 21]. The Italian article has given me much pleasure. I
    conclude it is Southey's.'&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following information is
    published here for the first time. On p.26 of article #283,
    article #200 is referred to as 'our Review'; #200 is probably
    by Merivale. Murray MS., WG to JM, 15 July 1814: 'I am quite
    sorry that I did not give you Mr Merivale's draft&mdash;he
    probably wants it .... His little art. I had not the leisure to
    revise.' Merivale, however, characteristically adopts the form
    'Henry the Seventh,' 'Louis the Fourteenth' etc.; the author of
    this article writes, 'Alonso VI,' 'William IX' etc. The length
    of the article also does not match WG's description of
    Merivale's article. See #289 below. The article closes with a
    promise to continue the discussion of Italian epic poetry, but
    no such article appeared.&nbsp;</span></p>

    author refers back to a translation of Hodgson quoted in #265

    Merivale. The reference may be to #306. Henry Joseph Thomas
    Drury (1778-1841) an educator, divine, and classicist, son of
    the famous Harrow School headmaster, Joseph Drury, was
    schoolmaster to Lord Byron at Harrow. His sister married John
    Herman Merivale. His brother, Benjamin Heath Drury, also a
    divine, was assistant master at Eton. The evidence may suggest
    that Merivale was mediating his brother-in-law's (Henry's or
    Benjamin's) article into the Review. JM II's 'Rev R Drury'
    (repeated by JM III in his so-called Register) may be a mistake

    apply to either article.) On page 199 of the article, Barrow is
    cited (in his articles Barrow was notoriously self-promoting).
    The author has visited Sete Cidades (p.200), a volcano in San

    debunking strategy adopted by the author is similar to Barrow's
    approach in other articles. The author uses the form 'Alphonso
