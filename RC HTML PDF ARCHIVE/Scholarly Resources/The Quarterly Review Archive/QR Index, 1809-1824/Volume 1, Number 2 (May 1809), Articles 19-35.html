    <p><span class="smallprint">[Booksellers' notes: 'Gass was one
    of the sergeants of the Lewis and Clark expedition. He kept a
    daily journal during the journey, as instructed by Thomas
    Jefferson and Meriwether Lewis, and was thus able to publish
    his account only a year after the return of the expedition. His
    narrative was eagerly seized upon in the absence of the
    official report, which did not appear until 1814. An important
    contemporary account of the expedition.' 'Excepting Lewis and
    Clark and Sacajawea, Patrick Gass is better known than any
    other member of the Corps of Discovery. There are several
    reasons for this. By virtue of his being sergeant during the
    expedition, his name crops up with greater frequency in the
    journals of Lewis and Clark than that of most others. He was
    the first of the journalists to publish his account, so that he
    early came to the attention of readers. He was the first member
    of the party to have a biography written about him. And, in the
    matter of longevity, he far outstripped all
    others.']</span></p>

    proposed to give Sydney Smith's sermons to Ireland, and the
    thing must not be. I intend to write to Mr. Gifford by post,
