        <br />

        <ul>
          <li>The so-called Peterloo Massacre occurs 16 August when
          Manchester magistrates order armed and mounted soldiers
          to clear an assembly of sixty thousand protestors. Around
          five hundred are injured and eleven killed; the radical
          leaders, including Henry Hunt, are imprisoned. (See
          <i>QR</i> #533)<br /></li>

          <li>The British Government passes the so-called 'Six
          Acts' for the suppression of radical political activities
          and labor organization. Henry Grattan's motion to
          consider Catholic emancipation is defeated by two votes
          in the Commons.<br /></li>

          <li>"Missouri Compromise" in United States Congress
          admits slave-holding Missouri into the Union. Slavery is
          maintained in southern states while it is outlawed in the
          north and any future state.<br /></li>

          <li>Declarations of independence from Spain are made in
          Venezuela, Columbia and Ecuador.<br /></li>

          <li>August von Kotzebue is assassinated in Germany by a
          radical student, leading to a conservative government
          crackdown (see <i>QR</i> #614). The Convention of
          Karlsbad orders increased intellectual suppression in
          schools, universities and publishing.<br /></li>

          <li>Two further British expeditions to the Arctic Ocean
          in search of the Northwest Passage, including that by
          William Parry (see <i>QR</i> #585, 705).<br /></li>

          <li>In May, James Mill appointed assistant examiner of
          correspondence, East India House.<br /></li>

          <li>Robert Owen of New Lanark motivates passage of a
          Cotton Mills and Factories Act regulating conditions of
          employment in cotton mills. Still, children age nine and
          older can work 12 hour days.<br /></li>

          <li>Edward Irving becomes Thomas Chalmers's assistant
          (see <i>QR</i> #684).<br /></li>

          <li>Byron publishes <i>Mazeppa</i> and <i>Don Juan</i>,
          Cantos I-II; Keats publishes <i>Ode to a Nightingale</i>;
          Scott publishes <i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i> and <i>A

          completes <i>Prometheus Unbound</i> (see <i>QR</i>
          #607).<br /></li>

    "smallprint">In querying its attribution to Barrow, Shine
    follows JM III's Register and quotes from the following
    letters. Murray MS., WG to JM, 24 July 1818 and 6 Aug. [1818]:
    'If your poetical friend means to take up Iceland, I shall lay
    it down.... I had actually begun a review of Ebenezer
    Henderson's tour .... I think it too serious and too much of a
    matter-of-fact volume for your flighty friend.' Annotation on
    letter suggests <i>QR</i> No. 38, Art. 1. Murray MS., WG to JM
    [postmark Ramsgate, 6 Aug. 1818]: 'Barrow&mdash;Why should he
    not take Henderson? It would not interfere with Cohen.'
    [<i>Quarterly Review</i> Archive editor's note: as in Shine,
    but the transcription should instead read 'Colden' and is
    therefore a reference to #482, an article probably by Barrow.]
    &nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here in full for the first time; taken as a whole, it does not
    support a possible attribution to Southey that was first
    published in <i>VPR</i> 27, nor does it definitively point to
    Barrow as author of the review. Shine, having in the second
    letter quoted above misread 'Colden' as&nbsp; 'Cohen,'
    incorrectly conjectures that the 'poetical friend' mentioned in
    the first letter quoted above is 'Cohen.' Colden is the subject
    of #482, an article probably by Barrow. In the light of the
    following letter, there is reason to posit, instead, that the
    'poetical friend' is Southey. Murray MS., Robert Southey to JM,
    4 Sept. 1817: 'I will be kind to Dr. Holland.' (See p.301 of
    the article.)&nbsp; In content, structure, and language the
    article resembles Southey and not Barrow: the article is more
    analytical than descriptive (the former Southey's, the latter
    Barrow's usual manner); the author's interest is political and
    social, not anthropological and geographical (the former
    Southey's, the latter Barrow's usual interests). Note also
    sentiments characteristic of Southey but certainly not of
    Barrow: the emphasis on religious language and a 'moral' view
    (p.292); concern for pastoral care (p.298); an interest in the
    Sabbath (p.299); a concern over the prevalence of 'popish'
    religion (p.301). As it was Barrow's signature practice in his
    <i>QR</i> articles to refer to his own works,&nbsp; it is
    relevant that the article contains <i>no</i> references to
    works by Barrow, and yet twice the article's author refers to
    #182, an article by Southey on Iceland. However, the article is
    not on Southey's definitive MS. list of his <i>QR</i> articles
    and, moreover, Shine quotes the following letter that appears
    to rule out a contribution by Southey to this Number. BL MS.,
    28603 [no folio number given], Robert Southey to William
    Peachey, 9 Feb. 1819: 'there is nothing of mine in the last
    Quarterly [<i>QR</i> Number 38, the most recent issue, was
    published 2 Feb. 1819].'&nbsp;A series of letters preserved at
    the Bodleian also appears to preclude Southey as author of this
    article. Bodleian Library MS. Western MSS. d.47 (ff.128-29),
    Robert Southey to Grosvenor Bedford, 28 Nov. 1818, speaks of
    Copyright (#502) and the Catacombs (#507) as the two articles
    he is working on now, that when he completes them he will write
    nothing more for the <i>QR</i> for the next six months.
    Bodleian Library Western MSS. d.47 (ff.134), Southey to
    Bedford, [30 Jan. 1819], says that WG has postponed both of his
    articles for a future Number. Bodleian Library Western MSS.
    d.47 (ff.136-37), Southey to Bedford, 8 Feb. 1819, is
    disappointed in the current Number of the <i>QR</i>. There is
    no mention of his having contributed to the issue.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence and

    Croker in six of his Clements Library MS. lists and included in
    the Cambridge University bound volumes of Croker's articles.
    NLS MS. 852 (f.58), Walter Scott to JM, 12 Aug. 1818 (copy),
    says he returns an article and regrets it is not as good as
    Jeffrey's in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. It was Scott,
    apparently, who reviewed Maturin's novel in the
    <i>Edinburgh</i> (<i>ER</i> #837, June 1818) which makes his
    opinion on #480 hardly disinterested! (See <i>Wellesley
    Index</i> I 458 for the attribution to Scott; in an age when
    reviews tended to be unsigned, it was the usual practice among
    commentators to putatively attribute an article to a journal's
    editor, as Scott does in his comment to JM.) The reason the
    article Scott refers to is probably #480 is because Birkbeck on
    America is the only other book reviewed by both the <i>ER</i>
    and the <i>QR</i> during this period, a topic unlikely to have
    concerned Scott enough for JM to have sent it to him, whereas
    Scott was Maturin's patron.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. Murray MS., WG to John Taylor
    Coleridge, 7 Jan. 1819, says he still has Coleridge's MS. of
    'Samor.' Murray MS., WG to JM, [1818 postmark]: 'I think Samor
    has much mind in it&mdash;especially when compared with the
    review in the British Critic.' Murray MS., Coleridge to WG, 22
    Jan. 1822: 'I long to know how Milman bears the review of
    Samor, &amp; if he tells you I shall be glad to have it
    communicated to me. I have a great deal of love for his heart,
    &amp; respect for his head &amp; should be most sorry if any
    difference of opinion on a matter of taste should be taken
    unkindly by him.' Bodleian MS., d.130 (ff.13-14), Thomas Arnold
    to Coleridge, 5 Feb. 1819, says he likes the review of Samor,
    as does 'Lowe,' one of Milman's most intimate friends, but
    regrets 'Gifford's rude Treatment' in cutting some of his
    (Arnold's) favourite extracts. Murray MS., WG to Coleridge, 12
    Mar. 1819, Friday, says his 'Samor' is well liked and he is
    surprised at Milman's reaction. 'I am more sorry than surprised
    at your account of Milman. He ought to be pleased; but I
    suppose tis as hard to be an author &amp; wise, as it is to be
    in love &amp; be wise. ... no one suspects it of being severe

    to the journal's editorial coterie. A number of the works
    alluded to were reviewed by Heber (in #51, #76, #471, and #622
    possibly). The subject of #342, by Croker, Wraxall's spurious

    correspondence 12.84, Bishop Carlisle to Sir James Smith, says
    he has been assured that this article was by an Oxford man (and
    therefore not George D'Oyly). 'Many thanks to you for your
    reply to Monck [<i>sic</i>] and Q. Reviewer. ... I see how
    strong your learning was that Monck had written the
    Review&mdash;I am assured that it was written by an
    <u>Oxford</u> man. ... If the fact be true that an
    <u>Oxford</u> man was the author, that will serve to exculpate
    D'Oyly ... besides I cannot think it possible, that so very

    apply to you for information of which he has made material use,
    &amp; underhand attack you in the dark, anonymously in a
    Review. I cannot think him capable of such a thing.' In the
    article a footnote that discusses Cambridge University policy
    would more likely come from a Cambridge than and Oxford man.
    The defence of Christianity, which is the thrust of the
    article, is in keeping with D'Oyly's official position at the
    university as Christian apologist.</span></p>

    evidence to support various combinations of authors for this
    article, but for the most part the same names are involved,
    Monk, Gifford, Canning, and Croker. Of these only the
    attribution to Croker cannot be supported by the evidence Shine
    presents. Of the letters quoted below, Shine cites Murray MS.,
    WG to JM [22 Jan. 1819] and Iowa MS., JM to Croker, n.d. Shine
    also cites Monk in <i>Athenaeum</i> No. 2472 pp. 393-95;

    Dudley 215,.215n; and Greville I 74, 74n.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence (some of
    which was first published in <i>VPR</i> 28 and the rest of
    which is published here for the first time) establishes the
    primary authors of the article, but it appears that there may
    have been even more hands involved. The gestation of this
    article caused a crisis of confidence in WG's leadership among
    the <i>QR</i>'s editorial coterie. It seems that WG, wielding
    his usual dictatorial pen, excised much of Monk's material, but
    Croker and others took Monk's side. Against his will, and after
    an extraordinary representation by Croker of the combined
    opinion of the <i>QR</i>'s editorial group, WG pulled the
    article back from the press, reinserted as much of Monk's
    material as he possibly could, and apologised to his coadjutors
    for his behaviour. The incident prompted WG seriously to
    consider resigning the editorship. Harewood MS., WG to George
    Canning, March 27 [1818 watermark], regarding the Report on
    Education, 'Monk has already written to me. I must now let him
    go on, keeping an eye on him.' Murray MS., James Monk to JM, 16
    Jan. 1819, complains that he was hurried to get his article in
    and yet the <i>Quarterly</i> has not appeared. 'I understand
    that the Number was to be out a week at least before the
    enacting of Parliament ... as far as the last article is
    concerned, the effect will be unfortunate.' Murray MS., WG to
    JM, [22 Jan. 1819]: '... thank God I have been able to complete
    my design. I have tried to satisfy Monk &amp; brought in every
    scrap that I could.' Iowa MS. (f.93), WG to JM, [n.d., no
    watermark]: 'I have, as you desired, opened your
    letter&mdash;&amp; have sent the Art. It would bear the
    appearance of sheer obstinacy to hold out any longer, &amp; in
    giving up my opinion I have the satisfaction of knowing that my
    friends will not think I give way lightly, or that I insert any
    thing without due consideration. That I am wrong, it is now my
    duty to think, and I most cheerfully leave you to get the
    affair thro' Rowarth's [the printer's] hands as speedily as
    possible. I hope the pages will contain the new matter [i.e.,
    that the pages will not have to be completely reset]. This has
    been a trying day for me, &amp; I am nearly exhausted. I hope
    the other changes were made. The errata must be prefaced
    with[:] / A few of our copies contain the following errata,
    which the reader will be pleased to correct[.] / Or the
    customary formula[.] Clements Library MS., Croker letters,
    Letter Book No. 8, John Wilson Croker to WG, 30 Jan. 1819
    [copy]:&nbsp; 'My dear friend. / I have seldom felt more
    &lt;concerned&gt; than at all the trouble and vexation which I
    was the cause (with others) of giving you yesterday. / It has
    been all my life my rule to do what I think my duty to my
    friends at the risk of displeasing them, but really, ill as you
    are and fatigued and vexed by other matters I should not have
    pressed my opinion upon you if I had not thought the honor and
    safety of the good ship in which we all have the honor to serve
    under your orders, were in question. / I was the spokesman, but
    I assure you the crew were <u>one and all</u> [double
    underlined in the MS.] of the opinion I gave you and I was only
    the mouthpiece. My greatest apprehension, I will own to you,
    was not on account of the article or the person principally
    mentioned in our discussion. I trembled more for the fate of
    the last Article, that beautiful essay which unites in the
    highest degree sound reason, eloquent wit, irresistible logic,
    happy pleasantry with a true English and a true Christian
    spirit. I was afraid that an abject confession of a most
    unjustifiable calumny, when there was no calumny at all and
    only six letters unjustifiable would destroy our credit &amp;
    involve B. in the acquittal of W. / For either of these
    worthies I do not care a fig. I believe they are both impotent,
    the one from over rage [overage?] and the other from poorness
    of intellect, but as the friends of the Church &amp; State look
    to the Quarterly for what is to be said against them it would
    be a sad thing to weaken that confidence which the well
    disposed public has in our publication. / The good humour and
    kindness with which you have borne this intrusion of mine makes
    me more than ever you obliged and affectionate / JWC / W.
    Gifford Esq. / P.S. I am to be in Parliament to day.' Quoted in
    Smiles, II 49: John Wilson Croker to JM, n.d., 'I wrote to you
    and our friend from Gloucester Lodge [Canning's residence], I
    hope with some success, though I rather fear Mr G[ifford]'s
    illness may render him unwilling to have any more changes made.
    I would not press it, if I did not in my conscience believe
    that the character and efficacy of the <i>Review</i> is
    concerned, vitally concerned in the matter .... The Speaker
    [Manners-Sutton] longs to see the <i>Review</i>. Could you send
    him a number to-night. You might request not to show it till
    Monday; I will get back the copy from him.' Iowa MS. (f. 96),
    WG to JM, [n.d., no watermark], 'Burn this / My dear Sir / I
    read all the Proofs&mdash;still regretting even my gentle
    termination&mdash;but it is better to hazard it, than to
    continue the struggle, which I rather feared. I hope all is now
    done in good humour, &amp; that no more will be said on either
    side&mdash;As for the public, they will stare perhaps&mdash;but
    one must keep our secret very strictly[.] Ever yours / William
    Gifford / I inclose a line for Mr &mdash;/ Whose &lt;man&gt;
    will call[.] I did not know till I came down to hear that he
    had been in the room. Yesterday tired me.' As the letter was in
    Croker's collection, evidently it was forwarded to Croker by JM
    to demonstrate Gifford's determination to put their difference
    behind him. Murray MS., Thomas Mitchell to JM, 29 May 1820
    [notation on letter in JM II's hand: 'QR 38 last article.']:
    'You once transmitted me ten names, as joint contributors to
    it, in which you were, no doubt, perfectly correct.' Suggests
    that Cambridge thinks it was solely the work of Professor Monk.
    Shine supplies a number of sources that claim a role for
    Canning in inspiring the article and in contributing the
    conclusion. Claimed by Croker in four of his Clements Library
    MS. lists. However, in what appears to be the latest of these
    lists, Croker's contribution is noted as partial. Included in
    the Cambridge University bound volumes of Croker's articles.
    The article was answered in a pamphlet, <i>A Vindication of the
    Enquiry into Charitable Abuses, with an Exposure of the
    Misrepresentations Contained in the Quarterly Review</i>
    (London, 1819). Smiles draws attention to an article in the
    <i>Athenaeum</i> (20 March 1875) in which this article is
    mentioned. Two later letters in the Murray archives bear on
    article #492 and the WG letters published in the
    <i>Athenaeum</i>, as follows. [Dr. Christopher Stray drew these
    letters to the attention of the present writer.] Murray MS., C.
    J. Monk to JM III, 25 Mar. 1875: 'my letter on the charge
    brought by Wm. Reeve &amp; W. Hayward against Bishop Monk. '
    Murray MS., JM to C. J. Monk, 29 March [1875]: 'The fact is
    that I read in that correspondence [published in
    <i>Athenaeum</i> 20 March 1875] the most complete confirmation
    of the statement I <s>f</s> received from my Father, &amp;
    which I firmly believe, that, although the substance of the
    Article on Brougham, &amp; all the solid parts were written by
