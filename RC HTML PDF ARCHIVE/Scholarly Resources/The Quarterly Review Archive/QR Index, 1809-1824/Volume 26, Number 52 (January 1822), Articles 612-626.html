    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. The article appears in Southey's
    definitive MS. list of his <i>QR&nbsp;</i>articles.</span></p>

    <p class="smallprint">This English translation of a work that
    was first published in Latin in 1784 was by Sara Coleridge
    (1802-1852), Southey's niece, who was raised at Keswick under
    Southey's roof. Indeed, the translation was undertaken to
    complement Southey's <em>Tale of Paraguay</em>, 'which had been
    suggested to him by Dobrizhoffer&rsquo;s volumes' (<em>EB</em>
    1911 edition). John Murray published the volume under
    review.</p>

    <p class="smallprint">[Booksellers' notes on the Latin
    original, the first quoting Sabin 20414: 'Highly eulogized by
    Coleridge, Southey, Charles Lamb, Lowndes and Brunet. It is
    almost the only work relating to this almost unknown tribe of
    Indians, and is a memorial of nearly eighteen years of
    suffering and toil amongst a most savage race.' 'The Jesuit
    Dobrizhoffer was sent to Paraguay in 1749, where he remained
    until the expulsion of the Jesuits from the Spanish possessions
    in 1767. During his eighteen years in residence, he lived first
    among the Guarani and then the Abipones. The author wrote that
    his experience "in the four colonies of the Abipones has
    afforded me opportunities of closely observing their manners,
    customs, superstitions, military discipline, slaughters
    inflicted and received, political and economical regulations,
    together with the vicissitudes of the recent colonies."']</p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">Evidence in favour of Thomas
    Turton's authorship was first published in <i>VPR</i> 28. The
    article was submitted by John Taylor Coleridge and was written
    by an acquaintance of his. The article is referred to in
    #63<i>WI</i> as a continuation of article #613. The author of
    #63<i>WI</i> states that his manuscript lay unpublished for
    some time. Article #63<i>WI</i> is attributed to Thomas Turton;
    it was published when John Taylor Coleridge was editor of the
    <i>QR</i>. Article #63<i>WI</i> answers Burgess's rebuttal of
    #613. Taking into account Coleridge himself having been
    involved in the production of both articles and #63<i>WI</i>
    having been written soon after Burgess responded to #613, it is
    inherently unlikely that someone other than the author of #613
    would have been called upon by Coleridge (as editor) to defend
    #613. Murray MS., WG to John Taylor Coleridge, 21 Feb. 1822: 'I
    heard of your young friend from Whately, who spoke of him with
    feeling as a man of genius and talent. ' Says he will be glad
    to accept his articles. 'Let him write a short article.' Says
    the manuscript Coleridge sent is printed: 'I want the writer to
    revise &amp; compress the opening pages, so as to reduce the
    Art. to a sheet&mdash;it now makes 19 pages.' Article #613 is
    16 pages long, one octavo sheet. Coleridge's and Whately's
    'young friend' is perhaps John Keble, or it may be Thomas
    Arnold; both men were younger than Whately and Coleridge, both
    were Oxford men (as Whately and Coleridge were), and both had
    been approached by Coleridge to submit articles to the
    <i>QR</i>; at about this time Keble, however, expressed his
    complete lack of interest in reviewing and reviews (Bodleian
    MS., d. 134, f.124, Keble to Coleridge, June 1822). For Arnold,
    see Bodleian MS., d. 130 (ff. 43-44), Thomas Arnold to John
    Taylor Coleridge, 21 May 1821: 'I have had a very civil Answer
    from Gifford to my Letter requesting him to send me Cramer's
    Book.&mdash;He asks me to send him occasional assistance on any
    subject that I like.' Still, taking into account Murray MS., WG
    to Coleridge, 21 Feb. 1822, quoted above, the article seems not
    to have come from the 'young friend' but from another of
    Coleridge's acquaintances. Cf. Coleridge's interest in this
    general topic in Murray MS., Coleridge to WG, 6 Dec.
    1823.</span></p>

    <p class="smallprint">[Bookseller's note, silently corrected:
    'Kotzebue had accompanied Krusenstern on his circumnavigation
    in 1803-06. On this, the first voyage under his own command, he
    discovered new island groups in Oceania, checked the locations
    of others, and gathered new information on the Pacific coast of
    Siberia. He sailed north through Bering Strait, explored the
    northwest coast of Alaska with the hope of finding the western
    end of a northwest passage, and in 1816 discovered and explored
    Kotzebue Sound. It is an excellent and descriptive record of
    explorations to Brazil and Chile, Kamschatka, the Bering Strait
    and Alaska, California, the Sandwich Islands, and Guam. The
    total duration of voyage was three years; it produced a wealth
    of scientific data. This was one of the truly great voyages of
    discovery.']</p>

    attacked abuses of the India government; in 1823 he was
    expelled from India by its governor. The author of this review,
    #616, accuses Buckingham of plagiarism. Buckingham sued Bankes
    and also answered him in pamphlet, <em>Mr. Buckingham's

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence was first
    published in <i>VPR&nbsp;</i> 28. The article's author refers
    to #237, which is by Barrow. In his <i>QR</i> articles, it was
    Barrow's signature practice to refer to his own works. Article
    #623 bears many marks of Barrow's work. However, as Murray MS.,
    Cash Book 1821-24 states that the same person (Barrow) was paid
    for articles 3, 8, and 14 in this Number, it appears that
    Barrow did not write this article. It is possible that Barrow
    sub-edited the article or, less likely, that Murray's accounts
    in this instance are misleading.</span></p>
