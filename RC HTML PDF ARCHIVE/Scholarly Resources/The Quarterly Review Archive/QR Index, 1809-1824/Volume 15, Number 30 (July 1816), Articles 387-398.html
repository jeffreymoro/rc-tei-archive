    book reviewed was sent to 'John Barrow' on 3 July
    1815.&nbsp;The article is notable partly because of its pointed
    criticism of John Barrow as a travel writer who wants sound
    judgment and a keen eye. The article appears in Southey's
    definitive MS. list.&nbsp;</span></p>

    collectable, as of 2003 valued in excess of &pound;8000.

    traveller who disguised himself as an Arab and thereby gained
    access to many places throughout Asia Minor and North Africa
    forbidden to Christians, particularly the mosques of Omar and
    Mecca itself. In 1803 he departed for Tangier and travelled
    through North Africa to Egypt, where he met Chateaubriand at
    Alexandria. Cf Atabey 46 (for French edition); Blackmer 62;

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following information and
    evidence is published here for the first time. The Shine
    volume's positive attribution to Uwins is not adequately
    supported. JM III relied solely on JM II, whose attribution is
    in pencil and is not supported by evidence. The <i>DNB</i>
    attribution may have relied on the <i>GM</i> article. As the
    <i>GM</i> article is often unreliable and no source is given,
    it is not adequate evidence. Two other articles are claimed for
    Uwins in Shine, #483 and #564. Cf. the methodical
    <i>divisio</i> in this article with that in #483. Author, a
    medical man (p.395), seems familiar with Edinburgh Infirmary
    (p.391). Defends serious religion (p.401). Faults democratizing
    of expectations (p.400). Cites Morgagni (p.402). This article
    is referred to (twice) in #564, which is also attributed to
    Uwins. Cf. #631, author (Gooch?) says he has written previously
    on the insane. Oddly, in what appears to be a coincidence, in
    both this Number and in Number 47 Octavius Gilchrist submitted
    an article but in neither Number is an article positively
    attributable to him. In any case, medical topics are outside of
    Gilchrist's purview, so this is probably a false lead. These
    are the Gilchrist references in question: Murray MS., WG to
    Octavius Gilchrist, 16 Oct. 1816: 'you must finish your Art as
    soon as you conveniently can.' Murray MS., WG to Octavius
    Gilchrist, 27 Nov. 1820: 'your proofs reached me.'&nbsp;Cf.
    #564. David Uwins was a major contributor of medical-scientific

    to Croker in JM II's marked <i>QR</i> and JM III's Register

    former), the article is not claimed by Croker in any of his
    Clements Library MS. lists and it is not included in the
    Cambridge University bound volumes of Croker's articles.
    Brightfield depended in this instance on JM III's Register. The
    tentative attribution to Gilchrist is based on Murray MS., WG
    to Octavius Gilchrist, 16 Oct. 1816: 'you must finish your Art
    as soon as you conveniently can.'&nbsp;The unusual brevity of
    this article is suggestive of WG himself, whose articles tend
    to be brief, or to a regular contributor to the <i>QR</i> whom
    WG would have indulged. For that reason Croker is a good
    candidate (indeed a number of Croker's reviews are exceedingly
    brief), but the evidence for Croker amounts to a guess on JM
    II's part.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">[Bookseller's note: 'Humboldt,
    traveller, observer, geographer, astronomer, and geologist, was
    one of Europe's leading men of science of the nineteenth
    century. During the years 1799-1804 he and his associate,
    Bonpland, traveled and gathered data in the New World. From the
    notes and observations made during a year's stay in Mexico,
    Humboldt wrote this classic work which is more geographic and
    economic than political in nature. "Humboldt was unable to
    visit the northern provinces - the Californias, Sonora,
    Chihuahua, Texas, New Mexico, and Coahuila - and relied instead
    upon reports, published and unpublished, that were made
    available to him in Mexico City. His discussions of these areas
    are nonetheless detailed and thorough, containing much data
    that had never before appeared in print." "The writings of
    Humboldt provide the best introductory reading preparatory to
    any effort to understand the history and the characteristics of
    Spanish America. His works are still the most instructive, the
    most intelligent, the most suggestive books about Mexico"

    Wednesday [1812 watermark]: 'surprised and grieved at the idea
