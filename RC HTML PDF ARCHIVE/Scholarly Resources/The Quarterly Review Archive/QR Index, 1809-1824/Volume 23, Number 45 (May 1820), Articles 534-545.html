    <p><span class="smallprint">Some of the following evidence was
    first published in <i>VPR</i> 28; information supplied by Mr.
    Ronald Solomon is published here for the first time. Between
    the publication of Number 41 and Number 42, Barron Field sent a
    manuscript article for inclusion [Murray MS., Field to JM, 24
    Aug. 1819]. Mr. Ronald Solomon in a private correspondence with
    the present writer argues in favour of Field's authorship of
    articles #535 and 559. In doing so, Solomon re-interprets
    letters quoted in <i>VPR</i> 28 and draws attention to passages
    in #535 that support an attribution to Field. Murray MS.,
    Barron Field to JM, 1 Feb. 1821, Field states that his 'little
    article on Van Diemen's land is very much appreciated.' Field's
    reference to a 'little article may be to #535, which is 10
    pages long or to #559, which is 17 pages long. (The latter
    article is about New South Wales.) More persuasively still, as
    Solomon points out, in its first sentence the author of #535
    speaks of Van Diemen's Land as a 'state only fifteen years
    old.' That comment therefore dates the manuscript of this
    article to 1818, the time of publication of the pamphlet under
    review; the comment also dates the probable composition of this
    article to 1818 or 1819, coincident with Field's letter to JM
    cited above. Furthermore, at page 78 of the article the author
    states 'the Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales has
    lately made a circuit to the island.' Barron Field is the Judge
    referred to; Barrow was not likely to have had this
    information. Most uncharacteristic of Barrow, in #535 there is
    not a single reference to previous articles in the <i>QR</i>,
    let alone to articles by Barrow. In his <i>QR</i>
    articles<i>,</i> it was Barrow's signature practice to refer to
    his own works. See also the evidence at #559.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. Murray MS., John Barrow to JM, 29 May
    1820, says when the article is printed (he does not state which
    one) return 'Dr. Holland's two volumes.' Barrow probably meant
    from the printer, who may have been using the volumes to copy a
    quotation; conversely, it is possible that Holland's volumes
    had been lent to Murray either from Barrow or another party for
    use by the reviewer. (See pp. 114n and 128, references to Dr.
    Holland.) The reviewer has access to official correspondence
    (p.117). The author makes a specific reference to #82, an
    article by Barrow; the subject of #267 and #547, both of which
    are also by Barrow, is alluded to on p.128 and p.125,
    respectively; the author refers to <i>Edinburgh Review</i>
    writers as 'Northern Seers' (cf. 'Northern Philosophers' in
    #493, p.13, which is also by Barrow). In his <i>QR</i>
    articles<i>,</i> it was Barrow's signature practice to refer to
    his own works. Murray MS., WG to Robert William Hay, 28 Dec.
    1819, says he cannot get John Wilson Croker to work on Parga
    (perhaps as sub-editor); Croker sometimes sub-edited Barrow's
    articles.</span></p>

    n.d.: 'I shall pursue D'Israeli as soon as I can who is however
    too much of a "Hellus," to please me altogether.' Murray MS.,
    Mitchell to JM, 29 May 1820, says the <i>QR</i> just arrived
    and he has detected a misprint on p.277: for 'more virgins,
    more speed' read 'more vigour, more speed'!&nbsp;</span></p>
