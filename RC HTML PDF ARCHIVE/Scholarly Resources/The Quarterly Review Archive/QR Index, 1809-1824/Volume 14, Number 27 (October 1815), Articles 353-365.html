        a variety of documents relative to the loss of the journals
        and drawings to which we alluded in a former page; when the
        appearance of some publications on the subject by Lord

      eruption in Indonesia that occurred in April 1815 reached
      London via a report in <i>The</i> <i>Times</i> in
      November</span>. Fallout from the eruption exacerbated
      already difficult climate conditions in Europe that had begun
      in 1814; the winter of 1814-15 was severe; 1816 came to be
      known as the 'year without a summer.' The cold wet weather is
      said to have indirectly inspired Mary Shelley's
      <i>Frankenstein</i>; the startling sunsets caused by volcanic

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence was first
    published in <i>VPR</i> 28; additional discussion is published
    here for the first time. This is Southey's topic (cf.# 224,

    definitive MS. list of his <i>QR</i> articles. Murray MS.,

    Mendicity were in my possession when the last paper was

    <p><span class="smallprint">The evidence is too slight to
    attribute this article definitely to any one author to the
    exclusion of all other possible authors. JM III does not
    substantiate his assertion that the article is by Barrow. The
    article's style and strategies do not suggest Barrow. As it was
    Barrow's signature practice in his <i>QR</i> articles to refer
    to his own works, it is perhaps significant that there are no
    references in #359 to other articles by Barrow, nor is this
    article referred to any later article of Barrow's. The article
    is almost certainly not by Southey. Not only does the article
    not appear in the MS. list published in Curry et al. <i>WC</i>,
    but his 19 July 1816 letter quoted above is a complaint that
    #358 anticipated or usurped his own efforts. During the period
    January to March 1816, Southey was busy composing a poem on
    Waterloo. In that period there is no mention in his
    correspondence with Grosvenor Bedford preserved in the Bodleian
    of articles he is working on for the <i>QR</i>.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence is published
    here for the first time. Murray MS., WG to John Taylor
    Coleridge, 3 Mar. 1816, says that in this Number 'Wordsworth
    ... fell into inadequate hands. The writer was not of my
    choice; but Southey's&mdash;who did not consult me.' (WG would
    not have said this had Keble&mdash;see below&mdash;Coleridge's
    close friend, been the author of the review. Indeed it is more
    likely that WG was defending himself against Coleridge's
    complaint that his friend Keble might have produced a better
    review.) Bodleian MS. Eng. lett. d.134 (f.39), John Keble to
    John Taylor Coleridge, 4 March 1815, states that he is
    preparing a review of Wordsworth for Rennell (editor of the
    <i>British Critic</i>). Bodleian MS. Eng. lett. d.134 (f.40)
    Keble to Coleridge, [11 Apr. 1815], says 'Wordsworth' is ready
    and that he will show it to Davison who 'attacked me to
    contribute to the QR.' This last letter is misinterpreted by
    John R. Griffin in &lsquo;John Keble and the <i>Quarterly
    Review</i>,' <i>Review of English Studies</i> 29 (Nov. 1978),
    454-55 and in <i>John Keble, Saint of Anglicanism</i> (1987) as
    demonstrating that Keble was the author #362. (Griffin also
    misattributes #371 and #393 to Keble.) In the letter, written a
    full year before #362 appeared, Keble is making two points
    here, first that he has finished his review of Wordsworth for
    submission to the <i>British Critic</i> and second that he will
    show it to Davison who, by the way, had been asking Keble to
    contribute an article to the <i>QR</i>. Keble's article is
    probably 'Wordsworth's <i>Excursion</i>' <i>British Critic</i>
    (May 1815) NS III, 452-63. Davison continued to press Keble to
    contribute to the <i>QR</i>, but Keble complained that he did
    not feel able to meet the <i>QR</i>'s higher standard (see
    Bodleian MS. Eng. lett. d.134 f.64, Keble to Coleridge, 27 Mar.
    1817). Griffin appears to have been misled in part by <i>QR</i>
    Number 27's October 1815 title page date.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">Murray MS., Barron Field to JM, 31
    May 1815: 'I send you the <u>materials</u> for a review of
    Wordsworth's new poems, which I promised you, with a view of
    handing them over to your reviewer. You will remember that the
    condition of my assistance is that the review is to be
    favourable; and if my facts and analysis of the new poems be
    used, I shall not refuse any remuneration you may think my
    papers worth; for in fact I took up the task under an idea that
    I should be in time for your Review.'&nbsp;If these materials
    were used in the article, Gifford held onto them for a long
    time. Mr. Ronald Solomon of Sydney, Australia, in private
    correspondence with the present writer argues that Field had no
    involvement in the article. Solomon points out that Field's
    letter to JM is dated 31 May 1815, two days before the
    publication of <i>White Doe</i> and therefore likely irrelevant
    to a discussion of that poem. Solomon also points to Field's
    condition that the review be favourable, whereas the article
    'is not, but in part, hostile, critical, at odds with his
    expressed reverence for Wordsworth.' Solomon draws attention to
    the absence of any mention of the article by Field in his
    <i>Memoir</i>. 'That suggests,' Solomon concludes, 'the
    "materials" were very slight, for he usually brought out any
    contribution he made to literary discussion.'</span></p>

    attack on Elgin, who was trying to arrange the sale of his
    Marbles to the nation. John Tweddell spent four months in
    Athens in 1795, keeping detailed journals of his observations
    of every temple, archway, stone and inscription he saw, but
    died suddenly of fever in 1799. He sent letters home of which
    this work largely consists, but a mystery surrounds the fate of
    his journals and drawings that had been entrusted to Lord
    Elgin. Byron was instrumental in erecting a memorial to
