    'If you have not Gilly, send to me for it:&mdash;Only I must
    have it again, as it was presented to me by himself.'&nbsp; The
    authorship of this striking anti-missions article (assuming it
    is the elder William Gilly) suggests some telling associations.
    William Stephen Gilly (1789-1855), Gilly&rsquo;s son, had
    befriended Leigh Hunt at Christ&rsquo;s Hospital; he later
    visited Lord Bryon at Genoa. These liberal connections seemed
    to have had little effect on young Gilly for in the same year
    this article appeared the younger Gilly published his
    <em>Narrative of an Excursion to the &hellip; Vaudois</em>. The
    Vaudois, an Italian Protestant sect intermittently the focus of
    Catholic persecution, were perennially the object of English
    anti-Catholic propaganda (<em>vide</em> Milton&rsquo;s
    &lsquo;On the Late Massacre in Piedmont&rsquo;). On the
    strength of this book and a flurry of public appearances the
    younger Gilly became a prominent anti-Catholic crusader. A
    Church of England clergyman like his father before him, the
    younger Gilly gained promotion in the church through the
    sponsorship of Lord Eldon, a leading Ultra-Tory. In the light
    of his son&rsquo;s evangelical propensities, it is charming to
    read the elder Gilly&rsquo;s <em>QR</em> article as an epistle
    from of an unzealous Polonius to his son urging him not to join
    the mission field.</span></p>
