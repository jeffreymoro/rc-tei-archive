    the book reviewed was sent to 'Rev. T. Falconer' on 10 July
    1810. Devon MS. 1149M (f.80), WG to Edward Copleston, 9 Jan.
    1811, states that Copleston has provided an introduction to
    'Falconer' and has otherwise generally improved it. Devon MS.
    1149M (f.81), WG to Edward Copleston, 11 Feb. 1811: 'We have a
    tremendously long Article in this No. as you know. But the
    writer has laid out his whole soul in it, and no further
    abridgement can take place &mdash; though I lament that nature
    has not endowed our Bath friend with the faculty of
    compression.' Devon MS. 1149M (f.82), WG to Copleston, 17 Feb.
    1811: 'The Strabo of our Bath friend is follement long, and the
    last (1st) part slovenly in style.' Devon MS. 1149M (f.83), WG
    to Copleston, 26 Feb. 1811: 'I have in this No. an article on
    Clavier's Ancient Greece ... which ... will oblige me to
    postpone Falconer to our next ....' BL MS. 28099 (f.95), WG to
    George Ellis, 15 Apr. 1811, mentions a 'geographical' article
    by Falconer for this Number procured by Heber. Devon MS. 1149M
    (f.91), WG to Copleston, 31 May 1811: 'Falconer is the first
    Article in this No. .... The only interesting part ... you were
    kind enough to append.' Falconer published <i>Two Letters . . .
    on the Articles in the Edinburgh Review, relating to the Oxford
    Strabo</i> (John Murray, 1811), and in 1817 an English
    translation of Strabo. Copleston's likely contribution to a
    recent <i>QR</i> article (see #113 above), a passage on Strabo,
    is cited in the opening paragraph of this article (cp. the
    first letter cited above).</span></p>

    'No. 120']: 'I send you the first 16 pages of Barry .... The

    emphasis on China, a topic that is Barrow's preserve. There is

    Barrow: 'We entirely concur .... agrees with one we ventured to
    give in a former Number, with regard to those Sanscrit works,

    quarters near Katmandu. Kirkpatrick, a staff officer under Lord
    Cornwallis in India, was dispatched to Nepal to mediate. As the
    rather romantic opening paragraph of the Preface states, "No
    Englishman had hitherto passed beyond the range of lofty
    mountains which separates the secluded valley of Nepaul from
    the north-eastern parts of Bengal; and the public curiosity
    respecting that Terra Incognita (as it might then be justly
    called), was still ungratified., when toward the close of the
    year 1792, an opportunity was unexpectedly presented to the
    British government in India, of removing the veil which had so
    long interposed between the two countries."']</span></p>

    querying its attribution to George D'Oyly, with an alternative
    queried attribution to John Ireland, Shine cites JM III's
    Register. Shine also quotes from the following letters. Murray
    MS., WG to JM, [dated by another hand 'May? 1811']: 'I sent all
    of Dealtry but the last leaf which I am obliged to keep,
    because I have not yet seen Dr Ireland. This little addition
    must come in there.' Murray MS., WG to JM, [1811]: 'Dr
    I[reland] &lt;sent&gt; last night for the last leaf of Dealtry
    &amp; De Motu ... I told you that Dr I would positively reach
    me on Wednesday.' WG to JM, [May 1811]: 'D'Oyly has not yet
    sent his proof....' Murray MS., WG to JM, [17 May 1811]:
    'D'Oyly has not been sent but I think the first sheet will want
    few alterations ....'</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence was first
    published in <i>VPR</i> 27 and <i>VPR</i> 28. The evidence for
    attribution is certainly confusing but on balance establishes
    Gregory as the primary author. Ireland seems to have been
    brought in to ensure that the article did not contain language
    that would be offensive to the Saints (parliamentary
    Evangelical philanthropists under William Wilberforce). On the
    face of it, the letters seem to suggest Ireland as the primary
    author. However, mathematics formed no part of Ireland's
    expertise while at this time Gregory had a monopoly on
    mathematics in the <i>QR</i>. The subject is picked up again,
    possibly by Gregory, in #519 (p. 148). The letters that Shine
    quotes from in support of D'Oyly as primary author more likely
    refer to #145. D'Oyly was perhaps brought in as sub-editor of
    this article because he shared with Dealtry an association with
    Cambridge University or volunteered as protector of its
    reputation.</span></p>

    <p><span class="smallprint">Devon MS. 1149M (ff.107-8), WG to
    Edward Copleston, 23 May 1812, says that Ireland 'check[ed] the
    eagerness of Dealtry &amp; the other disputants' in this
    mathematical debate 'who were growing rather fierce'. BL MS.,
    28099 (f.65), WG to George Ellis, [26 Nov. 1810]: 'I have not
    written to our friend [Thomas] Young. ... There is a treatise
    on Fluxion by Dealtry come out this morning&mdash;would this,
    think you, suit him? And yet there is a difficulty, for if a
    favourable account could not be given of it, I should not wish
    to have it noticed. The saints are scandalized at out treatment
    of him in the last No. [cp. #106] ... that I should not like to
    venture another attack on him.' Criticism of Bossut on
    pp.340-49 similar to that on pp.157-58 of #215, which is also
    probably by Gregory. The promotion of Hutton's trigonometry
    table is a repetition of p.401 of #122, which is also probably
    by Gregory. Hutton (mentioned again on p.351 of the article)
    was Gregory's mentor.&nbsp;</span></p>

    'Marshman (1768-1837), a British orientalist, was a bookseller
    by the age of 15, then became a weaver and educated himself by
    reading continuously at his loom, before being called to India
    to serve as a missionary. This was his first book, preceding
    his translation of the works of Confucius (see below); he then
    published a Chinese grammar and the first Chinese Bible which
    was the first book printed in Chinese from moveable metal type.
    He later published the first newspaper ever printed in any
    Oriental language. Marshman resided at the mission in
    Serampore, and there he translated the Bible into at least nine
    Indian dialects, all the while teaching and establishing other
    missions. The Catholic Encyclopedia states that "The first
    Protestant (Ye-su-kiao) worker among the Chinese was Joshua
    Marshman, though he did not go to China, his labours being
