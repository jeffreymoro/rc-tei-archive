      Shine also quotes from the following letters. Murray MS., WG to JM, 21 May 
      1810: 'Leslie I will have ready ....'; Murray MS., WG to JM, [29 July 1810

      part which I was anxious about, he speaks not ill.' </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence was first published in <i>VPR</i> 
      27. WG had recently recruited Olinthus Gregory as his mathematical contributor 
      (see #73; cf. #186). He used Young as sub-editor of Gregory's contributions 
      (see #73 and #186) and had Gregory perform the same function for Young (see 
      #99). Young was not pleased with Gregory's criticisms of Dr. Playfair. The 
      article is not in Young's definitive MS. list of his QR articles. Murray MS., 
      Book Loans Register: the book reviewed was sent to 'Mr Gifford' on 22 Dec. 
      1809 and to 'Dr Young' on 11 Aug. 1810. NLS MS 3879 (f.50), WG to Walter Scott, 
      28 Mar. 1810: 'The only article, except yours, unfortunately, which I have 
      for the next No. [Number 7] is a review of Leslie's Geometry, which is not 
      favourable to the Professor.' NLS MS. 3879 (f.60), WG to Scott, 30 Apr. 1810: 
      '... you are not, I hope, afflicted with any feelings of exquisite tenderness 
      for Professor Leslie:&#8212;as I have a "wise word" or two to say to him, in the 
      present No. which might chance to discompose you for a minute or two.' BL

      WG to Walter Scott, 17 Feb. 1810: 'On Monday I received from Bath a letter 
      announcing a new publication called "the daughters of Isenberg" as about to

      In suggesting Ireland as a queried alternative attribution, Shine cites the 
      additional note in JM III's Register entry for #106. Shine also quotes from 
      the following letters. Murray MS., WG to JM, 17 July 1810: 'Dr Ireland wants 
      <u>Dealtrie</u>. If it was sent to my house, it was left behind, & you may

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence was first published in <i>VPR</i> 
      27. Wellcome MS., 68126 demonstrates definitely that the article is not by 
      D'Oyly. The article is important because it opened a rift between the <i>QR</i> 
      and a significant portion of its readership, the evangelical party in the 
      Church of England and its political equivalent, the Clapham Sect or 'Saints,' 
      the group of parliamentary evangelical philanthropists who were key supporters 
      of the British and Foreign Bible Society. WG was deluged by letters complaining 
      that this article was an attack on the Saints. WG had received early support 
      for the QR from the Saints through his friend Lord Teignmouth. Robert Grant, 
      one of the <i>QR</i>'s most important contributors, was a second-generation 
      Saint. Murray MS., WG to JM, [1811]: 'Dr I[reland] &lt;sent&gt; <sent> last 
      night for the last leaf of Dealtry & De Motu ... I told you that Dr I[reland] 
      would positively reach me on Wednesday.' Wellcome MS., 68126, WG to George 
      D'Oyly, 9 Nov. 1810, in defending the article to D'Oyly, WG says it was drawn 
      up by a 'confidential & respectable friend'. Cf. Devon MS. 1149M (ff.110-11), 
      WG to Copleston, 5 Oct. 1812, where WG speaks of Canning and Ireland as his 
      'two most confidential friends'. BL MS. 28099 (f.65), WG to George Ellis, 
      [26 Nov. 1810]: 'The saints are scandalized at our treatment of him [Dealtry] 
      in the last No. and I have had so many letters, and such tedious catalogues 
      of his talents & virtues, that I should not like to venture another attack 
      on him.' Murray MS., Book Loans Register: one of the pamphlets reviewed was

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence and information is published 
      here for the first time. Heber's ms. journal is introduced throughout Clarke's 
      volume in the form of notes. Murray MS., George Ellis to JM, n.d. [ca. June 
      1810; 1808 watermark], says that 'De Flagis' (see #72) was so long he had 
      not the space to review Clarke's travels in Russia and suggests that Reginald 
      Heber undertake it (cf. #242 and #426). Murray MS., Ellis to JM, 4 Feb. 1810, 
      says that Heber may review Clarke's Russia. BL MS. 28099 (ff.75-76), WG to 
      Ellis, 12 July 1810: 'Murray has got Clarke for you ....' Murray MS., Ellis 
      to JM, 22 July [1810], says that Clarke's travels have not arrived, which 
      he (Ellis) would like to do as a light article. Murray MS., Ellis to JM, n.d. 
      [Aug. 1810], says he has found Clarke's 'great book' more difficult to review 
      than expected and asks to be given the last position in the review (to give 
      him ample time). Murray MS., Ellis to JM, [Sept. 1810] Sunday, states that 
      he has erased allusions to the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, but left one prominent 
      quotation from them, relating to 'abstraction' to 'evince [their] extreme 
      bad taste.' BL MS. 28099 (f.79), WG to Ellis, 9 Sept. 1810: '... I am mightily 
      pleased with what you have done of Clarke ....' Murray MS, Book Loans Register: 
      On 10 Sept. 1810, JM paid &pound;5 for postage to transport 'Review of Clarkes Travels 
      from Sunning Hill,' Ellis's residence and on 19 Sept. &pound;2 for 'Postage Clarkes 
      Travels Sunning Hill'; a note on the line below that entry reads 'd[itt]o 
      first part before [&pound;] 2'. NLS MS. 3879 (f.197), WG to Walter Scott, 22 Sept. 
      1810, says that in the upcoming Number there 'is a very excellent article 
      by George [Ellis] on Clarke's Russia, which, he says, will please no one&#8212;It 
      is written with great knowledge of the subject whereas in the last Edin. Rev. 
      it was merely written to justify the [Ministry of All] Talents for their infamous 
      abandonment of the Russians, who are shamefully abused.' NLS MS., 853, (ff. 
      11-12), Scott to J. B. S. Morritt, 3 Oct. 1810 (copy), says that Ellis wrote 
      the first review of Clarke's travels. NLS MS. 3879 (ff.227-28), WG to Scott, 
      27 Oct. 1810: 'There is more than one thing which he [Francis Jeffrey, editor 
      of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>] will not like in this No. George's sly sneer 
      at the "perfumes of Astrachan" is excellent. [See page 151 of the article, 
      and 151n.] Those who know it say that it [Astrakhan, on the Volga] stinks 
      like an old devil of rotten Sturgeon, the only article of traffic!' Murray 
      MS., Ellis to JM, 25 Nov. 1810, he returns 'Dr. Clarke's volume'. Heber I 
      363: Reginald Heber to John Thornton, 1810, says his (Heber's) Russian notes 
      are made more conspicuous in the review of Clarke's travels. (Cf. bottom of

      for Field. In suggesting Barron Field alone as an alternative attribution, 
      Shine cites Graham 41 and the <i>DNB</i>. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence and discussion is published 
      here for the first time. Field's authorship is well established. WG's role 
      is asserted in JM II's marked <i>QR</i>, but no primary evidence has been 
      discovered to substantiate JM II's claim. Evidence for Douce, introduced below, 
      is that Douce may have been brought in as sub-editor and Douce may have shared 
      materials with Field. Murray MS., WG to JM, [24] Sept. 1810: 'It was certainly 
      not by my advice that Huet [#109] was made to follow Wordsworth [#108], when 
      either the Cam verses or Field's article [#112] ... should have come before 
      it.' Murray MS., JM to WG, 25 Sept. 1810 [draft]: 'I withheld Herrick until 
      we should be in active need of something to make up because I had taken it 
      into my head that the writer does not posses talent sufficient ... to write 
      in such a Review. ... I thought too, if it were desirable to notice Herrick 
      that no one could have done it so well as Mr Ellis.' See also evidence at 
      #111. Note comment on p.171 of the article: 'Being in Devonshire during the 
      last summer, we took an opportunity of visiting Dean Prior, for the purpose 
      of making some inquiries concerning Herrick ....' Bodleian Library, MS. Douce 
      d. 22, (f.18), WG to Francis Douce, 11 July 1810, presumes he had permission 
      to publish 'the information which you so kindly supplied me' but sends the 
      proofs for Douce's judgment. States that whatever Douce suggests will be carefully 
      introduced. 'I can find nothing either to change or amend.' Douce was an expert 
      on the poetry of the sixteenth century as, for instance, Bodleian Library, 
      MS. Douce e.5.: 'Materials for a biography of English poets to the end of 
      the sixteenth century, collected by J. R[itson] and F. D[ouce].' But see #109. 
      Mr. Ronald Solomon, LL.B., of Sydney, points out (in private correspondence 
      with the present writer) that 'Scriblerus referred to at p. 169 is also referred 
      to in article #177 (p. 483).' Solomon also points out that in <i>Notes and 
      Queries</i> Field claims the article (<i>Notes and Queries</i> Vol.10 8 July 
      1854 p.27). </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">[Bookseller's note: 'Edited with a brief preface 
      and notes to the poems by Dr. John Nott, a Bristol physician with a taste 
      for literature and literary scholarship; as Nott points out, this was the 
      first publication of Herrick's poems since the original appearance of Hesperides 
      in 1648. Charles Lamb once characterized Nott, in a different context, as 
      a "damned fool." In fact he seems rather a charming man, with less-than-obvious 
      tastes; he was the first Englishman to produce a full translation of Catullus,

      175. Shine also quotes from the following letters. Murray MS., WG to JM, [18 
      Aug. 1810 postmark]: 'It [a parcel] contains a letter from Mr Home Drummond 
      of Scotland saying that he has altered his review of the Oxford business and

      in the course of ten days.' Murray MS., WG to JM, [Sept. 1810, numbered 94]: 
      [Shine's paraphrase] Gifford does not wish to affront Mr Davison by omitting 
      his article now. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">The substance of the following evidence was first 
      published in <i>VPR</i> 28. An article by Drummond on this topic was rejected 
      in favour of Davison's, but WG included as much of Drummond as he could fit 
      in. Copleston was responsible for a passage on Strabo at pp.189-200. Drummond 
      (1783-1867), a Scot, educated at Oxford, who became a liberal Tory MP, separately 
      published a reply to the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>'s Oxford calumnies, apparently 
      the article WG had rejected in favour of Davison's. The production of this 
      article marked a turning point in JM's relationship with his editor. Fearing 
      that the article would divide his readers, JM attempted to keep the article 
      out. WG angrily accused him of intimidation. After an exchange of heated letters, 
      the two men reconciled and from then on WG was given much greater independence 
      in his conduct of the <i>QR</i>. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">Devon MS. 1149M (f.114), WG to Edward Copleston, 
      [9 Feb. 1810 postmark]: 'I have given you much trouble, but I was desirous 
      of obliging the writer of the Oxford article, if it could be safely done. 
      I do not know him personally&#151;he signs himself Home Drummond, & this is 
      his second attempt. His first, I was obliged to lay aside, though not void 
      of ingenuity. I give up every part of it to your judgment, from which there 
      shall be no appeal, & shall consider it as a singular kindness, if you will 
      correct the part specified, & 'damn with a blot' whatever you disapprove.' 
      NLS MS 3879 (f.50), WG to Walter Scott, 28 Mar. 1810: 'I am under some difficulty 
      with a young gentleman whom you know, I fancy. Mr Home Drummond. Last year 
      (indeed almost at our outset[ )], he sent me a critique on a Latin Dict. It 
      was, by no means ill done; but Murray, who was then lord paramount, thought 
      it not sufficiently novel and so it was laid aside. With great good nature, 
      Mr. H[ome] D[rummond] sent me for the present No. some remarks on the Oxford 
      Statutes. This was high matter, as the dispute now runs high between our rivals 
      [the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>], & the University: and as I had lost all sight of Oxford 
      near five and twenty years I did not dare to venture it upon my knowledge. 
      I therefore sent it to a good & true man [i.e., Richard Heber]. He pointedly 
      objected to some of it&#151;the panegyrical part chiefly, as far as it related 
      to Dr Tatham, and observed, as indeed, I thought before, that a statute was 
      scarcely a legitimate object of criticism&#151;This has laid me under a second 
      difficulty. And yet there is so much good aye, very good in the Article, that 
      I am yet very anxious to print some part of it; but then it must be as an 
      appendage to another article, and of this, perhaps, the writer will not hear.'

      A little greek I can cook up [#105], & there are two or three pretty articles, 
      which will fill a place .... I had nearly forgot Leslie [#103]. BL MS. 28099 
      (f.81), WG to George Ellis, 7 Sept. 1810: 'The residue of Copleston has not 
      yet reached me ....' NLS MS. 3879 (f.197), WG to Scott, 22 Sept. 1810: 'My 
      article on Oxford is sober & judicious.' In the light of the evidence for 
      #139 cited below, it is probable that Copleston contributed, or at least heavily 
      corrected, the passage on Strabo at pp.189-200. Murray MS., WG to JM, Monday 
      night, [24 Sept. 1810]: 'I will send to Mr C[opleston]. if you agree to abide 
      by his answer: on no other condition will I consent to violate my feelings 
      by affronting a gentleman of character & reputation for such Mr Davison is. 
      He probably came to town on purpose to see his Art. He has seen it & has revised 
      it, & is returned in the full expectation of its appearance. After all, I 
      do not quite enter into your opinion of it. It is clear, sensible & intelligent. 
      I wish indeed, it had more spirit & interest[,] so I do many other articles 
      which yet pass muster very well. Nor do I find any great fault with its sober 
      tone: there is enough in this No. to provoke the &lt;scurrilous&gt; <scurrilous> 
      language of our opponents without calling down more of it on Mr Copleston 
      .... I must have the revise to send to Oxford. I ought to have had it last 
      night.' Murray MS., JM to WG, 25 Sept. 1810: 'Respecting the Oxford Article, 
      I assure you mistake me ... if you think with me that upon the whole we would 
      be better without this article&#151;then I shall feel obliged if you put the 
      matter delicately to Mr C[opleston]&#151;but if your decision is that although 
      we & Mr C[opleston] would not be served by it ... can not just omit it & that 
      the &lt;proposing&gt;<proposing> it may be inconvenient & hazardous let it 
      go in at once&#8212;I have hurried the corrections of it & you will have a revise 
      of the first pages at any rate ....' Murray MS., Ellis to JM, Sunday [Sept. 
      1810], says he finds the article on Copleston 'tedious & feeble' and thinks 
      it should be admitted only if Copleston himself wants it or if it is needed 
      to fill up the Number. </span></p>

      I 177-78; <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> XXVIII 34; and says to see also Heber 
      I 345. Shine quotes from the following letters. Murray MS., WG to JM, [18 
      Aug. 1810 postmark]: '&#151;and not a line from our unknown friend&#151;I 
      must apply to Heber.' Murray MS., WG to JM, Aug. 18, 1810 and ['Recd Oct 6 
      1810']: '...Pitt is not yet come to hand ... Mr C[anning] ... delighted with 
      Pitt, indeed.' In suggesting George Canning as an alternative attribution, 
      Shine cites BL MS. 28603 [no folio number given], Robert Southey to William 
      Peachey, 27 Nov. 1810: 'There are some bold strokes against the Scotchmen 
      in the last number,&#151;in the article upon Leslie & in that upon Mr Pitt, 
      the main part of which comes (I have no doubt) from Canning.' Shine also cites

    <p><span class="smallprint">The following evidence and discussion is published 
      here for the first time. Article #114 is the single most important article 
      in the publishing history of the early <i>QR</i>. WG called it 'our manifesto.' 
      So perfectly did it articulate the Canningite liberal conservative position 
      that many readers believed it to have been from the pen of Canning himself, 
      and the article does contain information about Pitt provided by Canning. It 
      established the journal's reputation for literary brilliance and as a repository 
      of inside knowledge. Also crucial to the history of the journal, it led to 
      a marked increase in subscriptions and thus rescued the QR from impending 
      ruin. WG delayed the publication of this Number by many weeks as he waited 
      upon Grant, who was a desultory worker at best. During the period of the article's 
      composition, Grant also happened to fall ill. Two holograph drafts of this 
      article, one entire and one partial, in Robert Grant's hand, possibly with 
      notations by Canning, are preserved at the India Office Library, London (MSS 
      Eur E308 / 26). Important correspondence between WG and Canning concerning 
      this article is preserved among the Earl of Harewood's collection, deposited 
      at the Leeds Archives, Sheepscar Branch, Leeds. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">Harewood MS., WG to George Canning, 30 Dec. 1809: 
      'And now my dear Canning, I have a very great and serious favour to ask of 
      you. I cannot of course think of your Reviewing the Life of Pitt, at this 
      busy period; but as the publick look up to us, as it must be a masterly article, 
      as it will be considered as a sort of Manifesto of the Pitt-principle, and 
      as an accredited, not to say, an official testimony to his habits and virtues, 
      I earnestly hope that you will assist us. The Reviewer of Parr, whom I only 
      know through Heber, and who is a most prodigious acquisition to us, will undertake 
      [it] on condition that some friend of Mr Pitt run over the Life, and together 
      with occasional hints, furnish him with such corrections of the facts, as 
      may occur to him on the perusal. He says, and very justly, that Jeffrey's 
      best articles are so far subscription articles, that they are the result of 
      the studies and thoughts of several friends. ... [WG then quotes from Grant's 
      note to Heber:] "The Cannings and Freres are the natural proprietors of Pitt's 
      fame, and I think ought to make a great effort on the occasion. In fact whatever 
      accredits Pitt's fame now, tends to strengthen their hands in parliament and 
      in the country."... [WG then promises to send Canning the book and tells him 
      that Francis Jeffrey, editor of the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, is going to review it.] 
      'At all events we must beat them on this Article.' Murray MS., WG to JM, 1 
      Jan. 1810: 'Mr C. wishes to have Pitt's Life, sent to him immediately. As 
      it is of importance that he shall get it as soon as possible, I wish you would 
      endeavour to get it sent for him. Direct it to Right Honble Geo. Canning Hinckley 
      Leicestershire.' Murray MS., WG to JM, 9 Jan. 1810: 'I will write to him [Reginald 
      Heber] to day, & send to _______ Pitt's vol.' Murray MS., WG to JM, 13 Jan. 
      1810: 'I have left with Mr. Heber a note for our unknown friend.' BL MS. 28099 
      (f.72), WG to George Ellis, 6 Apr. 1810: 'He [a person spoken of in the letter 
      as Heber's nameless friend, the author of 'Ricardo' (#78)] has promised a 
      review of Gifford's lumbering life of Wm Pitt&#8212;this will be a grand thing for 
      us especially as Canning has promised to give me some observations to transmit 
      to him.' NLS MS. 3879 (f.60), WG to Walter Scott, 30 Apr. 1810: 'I hope to 
      have a review of my namesake's lumbering life of Pitt for this Number. If 
      I have, it will be one that will do us credit.' BL MS. 28099 (f.73-74), WG 
      to Ellis, 21 May 1810: '... I constantly expect the Life of Pitt, & this, 
      with Canning's touches, which he will be sure to give, will be a noble article.' 
      Murray MS., WG to JM, 3 July 1810: 'I have not yet got Pitt.' BL MS. 28099 
      (ff.75-76), WG to George Ellis, 12 July 1810: for Number 7 'I reckon on Pitt 
      [#114], Crabbe [#115], (Scott), <span class="smallprint">^<sup>I will write to</sup></span>[,] 
      something from Southey [#102], Dr. Whitaker [#108, or #106?], Reginald Heber 
      [#107], and a review of the Oxford Question [#113]. A little greek I can cook 
      up [#105], & there are two or three pretty articles, which will fill a place 
      .... I had nearly forgot Leslie [#103].' Murray MS., WG to JM, 16 July 1810 
      [17 July 1810 postmark]: 'I have pressed Mr. Heber, and he, I doubt not, will 
      do all he can.' Murray MS., WG to JM, 3 Aug. 1810: 'Any news of Pitt or Crabbe?' 
      Murray MS., WG to JM, 8 Aug. 1810: 'I fear we are going too fast, that is, 
      if we mean to have Pitt, for Heber seems to think that it will make 3 [1/2] 
      sheets. If we are to have him, however, I expect that he will reach you or 
      me in a post or two. ... I have heard nothing of Crabbe.' Murray MS., WG to 
      JM, [7 Aug. 1810 postmark]: 'He [Heber] says illness alone has prevented the 
      completion of the article; that when he left town his friend was down with 
      a fever (of a very serious kind) but that the m.s. was in such a state of 
      forwardness that a day <span class="smallprint">^ <sup>or two</sup></span> of health 
      would complete it. It will be best to wait therefore this week, at least for 
      the first half of it. Of Crabbe, he says, that he hears it is proceeding&#8212;but 
      he has not seen any part of it. ... Pitt will make rather more than 3 sheets!' 
      BL MS. 28099 (f.77), WG to Ellis, 31 Aug. 1810: 'I have this day received 
      a part of ... Pitt with a promise of the remr. immediately. It is not the 
      most important part i.e. the estimate of his character ... I have sent it 
      to the press, and shall transmit it immediately to Claremont [to Ellis who 
      will transmit it to Canning?]. Pray tell Canning to be as tender as justice 
      will allow him on [John] Gifford, who is a well meaning, hot headed, honest, 
      blundering soul .... The article is, as might be expected, very admirable. 
      I really expect much from it.' Murray MS., WG to JM [Sept. 1810]: 'Pitt I 
      am informed I shall have tomorrow. A sheet of Crabbe is come in, and is every 
      thing that I expected ....' NLS MS. 3879 (f.197), WG to Walter Scott, 22 Sept. 
      1810, says that in the upcoming Number 'I also have a magnificent article 
      on Gifford's Pitt.' BL MS. 28099 (f.83), WG to Ellis, 1 Oct. 1810: 'Pitt is 
      gone to Canning ....' BL MS (India Office Library) MSS Eur E308 / 26: holograph 
      draft and a partial draft of this article in Robert Grant's hand. </span></p>
    <p><span class="smallprint">Devon MS. 1149M (ff.110-11), WG to Edward Copleston, 
      5 Oct. 1812: 'Mr Yorke[,] Croker and many others are fully convinced that 
      Canning wrote the article on Pitt, which, to my most certain knowledge, he 
      never saw till it appeared in print; and Canning himself gives it to a gentleman 
      who never wrote a line of it.' Murray MS., WG to JM, 6 Oct. 1810, says that 
      Canning has 'Pitt.' Harewood MS., WG to Canning, 9 Oct. 1810, thanks for his 
      work on the Pitt article. BL MS. 28099 (f.67), WG to Ellis, 16 Oct [1810]: 
      'As for Pitt&#151;he has cost me scores of letters, & hundreds of anxious 
      hours&#151;but let them go&#151;they will operate as some abatement of my 
      pains in purgatory. Canning has seen the whole&#151;but he had added nothing, 
      & in the course of correcting only put queries in the margin&#151;these, to 
      be sure, have put me upon the qui vivre, but thus the whole has centred upon 
      me, & how I have acquitted myself&#151;there's nobody knows. He has only the 
      last page now in his hands, and this I expect to morrow.' Devon MS. 1149M 
      (f.79), WG to Copleston, 18 Oct. 1810: 'We are very late this time, which 
      is more vexatious as we ventured to promise an early appearance [see head 
      note, issue <a href="05.html">Number 5</a>]. The delay has arisen from an unknown friend, who sent 
      me a considerable part of an Article more than six weeks since, with an assurance 
      that the rest should immediately follow it&#151;That &lt;vol.&gt; <vol.> I 
      only recd a week ago.' NLS MS. 3879 (ff.227-28), WG to Scott, 27 Oct. 1810: 
      'I hope you like Pitt&#151;it is very masterly; and some parts of the language 
      have never been excelled. It is our manifesto, our political creed, which 
      we must contend for.' NLS MS. 3879 (f.289), WG to Scott, 29 Dec. 1810: 'I 
      had an opportunity of conveying through Heber, that part of one of your last 
      letters which related to the review of Pitt, to the invisible author. Nothing, 
      it seems, was ever more welcome: or gave such pleasure. This is doubly gratifying 
      to me, as I hope to continue to profit by his powers, which are very, very, 
      extraordinary.' </span></p>
