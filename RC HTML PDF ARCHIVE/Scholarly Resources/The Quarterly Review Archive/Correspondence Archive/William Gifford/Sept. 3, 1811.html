    <p>My dear Sir,</p>
    <p>I am delighted with your account of Lord Charlemont,<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_9-3-1811_notes.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a> and will follow your friendly advice, in every instance, in regard to it. The writer is, indeed, a treasure to us. The critique shall be printed the instant in arrives.</p>
    <p>I have heard that Ensor was a gentleman-com<sup>r</sup>. of Maudlin&#8212;but I know not how truly. Heber once told me that he remembered a pragmatical sort of a person there, about his time&#8212;perhaps this is the man.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_9-3-1811_notes.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
    <p>I do not believe that he is much known in London; he probably resides in the country&#8212;His work has been noticed in several low publications which you never see, &amp; in some of the Reviews with extravagant praise&#8212;undoubtedly, for the worst of purposes. He is vain of his <u>scholarship</u>, (this Heber told me that Ensor whom he knew also was,) and I really think that if you could find leisure to give him the castigation which he deserves, it would be useful to us, &amp; still more to the world. These moles work in secret, but actively&#8212;when they are once laid open to day, their mischievous power is at an end. It is in obscurity they delight, for thus they wriggle among the half informed.&#8212;I should really feel truly obliged to you if&#8212;always supposing that your avocations admit it&#8212;you could give a few pages on it for this No. as I think we stand in want of something piquant.</p>
    <p>Our hic &amp; ubique<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_9-3-1811_notes.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a> friend (he was with me this morning before I received your letter) "His wicked conscience smited him"<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_9-3-1811_notes.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a> he told me, for not writing to you. He has just called in London on his way to Norfolk! He has procured a number of valuable books from the Continent via Paris&#8212;among the rest some Strabos of which you will hear from himself&#8212;He appears highly delighted with his purchases.</p>
    <p>I presume that the copying of which you speak is principally to conceal the pen of the composer&#8212;if so, it is well: but if it is only to obtain a fairer hand, it is scarcely necessary&#8212;for our printers can make out any thing.&#8212;One word more,&#8212;If your friend honours me with his correspondence, I will venture to <s>p</s> promise, in the most solemn manner, that his secret shall never escape me:&#8212;but this, as he pleases; I am satisfied.</p>
    <p>I am ever, my dear Sir,</p>
    <p>your faithful &amp;</p>
    <p>affectionate friend &amp;</p>
    <p>servt</p>
    <p>Wm. Gifford</p>
    <p>P.S.</p>
    <p>It is only the longer parcels which I will trouble you to send to the Admiralty. To John Barrow &amp;c.&#8212;for Croker is now at Ryde.</p>
