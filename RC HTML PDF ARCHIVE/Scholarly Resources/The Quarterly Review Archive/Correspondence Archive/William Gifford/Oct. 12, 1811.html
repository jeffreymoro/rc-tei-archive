    <p>My dear Sir,</p>
    <p>I have been waiting with the greatest anxiety for Charlemont,<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_10-12-1811_notes.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a> as we are absolutely at a stand. Pray have the goodness to send off as much of it as is prepared, without delay, under cover to Mr. Barrow. I greatly fear that a letter of mine has not reached you, as I sent it to the Foreign State Office, where they are sometimes less careful than at the Admiralty.</p>
    <p>Charlemont is reviewed, as it is called, in the American Review, which is just come to hand; but very poorly indeed. Pray excuse the brevity of this letter as I have waited to the last moment, in the hope that post or coach would bring me something. Ever, my dear Sir, yours affectionately</p>
    <p>Wm. Gifford</p>
