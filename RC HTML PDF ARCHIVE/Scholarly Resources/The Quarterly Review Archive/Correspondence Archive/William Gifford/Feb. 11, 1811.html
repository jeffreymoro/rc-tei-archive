    <p>My dear Sir</p>
    <p>Unluckily I have been out on Lottery business, and am returned barely in time to take a running notice of your obliging letter.</p>
    <p>I hope it will be in your power to finish your Article by to-morrow fortnight,<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_2-11-1811_notes.html#1">1</a></sup> as by that time we shall have nearly all our materials in hand. I know not what to say as to its length. I shall think with regret of your altering any thing, but we must conform to circumstances, &amp; somewhat to opinion. I should venture to hint that we ought not perhaps to exceed twenty pages [?much]. We have a tremendously long Article in this No. as you know. But the writer has laid out his whole soul in it, and no further abridgement can take place&#8212;though I lament that nature has not endowed our Bath friend<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_2-11-1811_notes.html#2">2</a></sup> with the faculty of compression.</p>
    <p>I am glad to find that it will be in your power to speak kindly of Whitaker. I believe I mentioned to you the disgust which I felt at the abject attempt to ridicule him in the British Critick. I know Nares, and I am willing to persuade myself that the Article escaped him.<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_2-11-1811_notes.html#3">3</a></sup></p>
    <p>I shall receive your friend's Critics on Roscoe with great pleasure,<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_2-11-1811_notes.html#4">4</a></sup> and will promise to make no alterations&#8212;at least, if, which I by no means think will be the case, any should appear necessary, the m.s. shall be sent to him for his concurrence. I am quite satisfied with his passing over the republished speeches&#8212;as the most judicious Holofernes expresses it satis quod sufficit.<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_2-11-1811_notes.html#5">5</a></sup>&#160;</p>
    <p>I thank you very sincerely for the mention of Mr Vaux: every recruit that we can raise is valuable &amp; this gentleman from the manner in which you mention him, promises to be highly so. You have <strike>had</strike> not said, how he is to be reached: but I shall ask Heber, who to my utter amazement walked in here last night&#8212;Such a hic &amp; ubique,<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_2-11-1811_notes.html#6">6</a></sup> I never knew&#8212;to one of my <u>locomotive</u> powers, he appears a very prodigy.<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_2-11-1811_notes.html#7">7</a></sup></p>
    <p>I flattered myself that Mr Davison was at work for us. Heber told me that he felt inclined to say something on Edgeworth.<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_2-11-1811_notes.html#8">8</a></sup> I have an article on him but I fear somewhat too feeble &amp; I postponed it in the hope that the subject would by taken up by our friend. Will you have the goodness to make my respects to him &amp; say that nothing can give me more pleasure than to find [tear] disposed to assist us&#8212;But what [tear] will he prefer? What book shall I send?</p>
    <p>In great haste, I conclude &amp;</p>
    <p>am ever, dear Sir, your</p>
    <p>faithful &amp; obliged friend</p>
    <p>&amp; servt</p>
