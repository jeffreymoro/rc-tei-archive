    <p>Octr. 27th. 1811</p>
    <p>My dear Sir,</p>
    <p>I write to you at Exeter though in the hope that your perfect recovery had enabled you to return ere this to Oxford.</p>
    <p>&#8212;I am sorry that we are so late this time; this is owing in part to my ill health, &amp; partly to disappointments; we must, however, make every possible exertion to be out by the end of December, with our 12th No.</p>
    <p>I earnestly hope that the little omission &amp; addition which I thought myself obliged to make to the excellent article of your friend,<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_10-27-1811_notes.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a> will not offend him. He is probably aware that we must sacrifice something to our plan, &amp; that many things which I would gladly offer under my own name, I cannot venture to produce in a review, where I have many palates to please, and many ticklish tempers to study. When you tender him the little modicum which is inclosed, &amp; which is pressed upon his acceptance in consequence of our inviolable plan, I will beg you to express my thanks for his kindness, and my admiration of his talents.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_10-27-1811_notes.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a> I sincerely hope that he will favour us will his ideas of Miss Seward's Letters &amp;c. for this No. or with any subject that may strike his fancy.&#8212;<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_10-27-1811_notes.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
    <p>If you do not admire our friend Davison, I shall admire at you. Is it not truly excellent?<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_10-27-1811_notes.html#2"> </a> I am quite charmed with it, &amp; so, I believe, is every body. Hallam, who was once the great support of the Edin. Rev. told a friend of mine that he had seen nothing on the subject, that could be compared to it. I hope that he, like you, is at Oxford; though I write this day to him at Barnstable.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_10-27-1811_notes.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <p>I flatter myself that you will not dislike our appearance this time, upon the whole. We have been very well received Murray tells me&#8212;and the Edin. Rev. is certainly declining <u>very</u> <u>much</u> in its sale. I hope you will find nothing to give you offence in the 1st Article&#8212;<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_10-27-1811_notes.html#3"> </a> I did my best with it; but unfortunately, I am but a tyro on the subject, and had no one to advise with&#8212;Your letters, however (for I saw Heber's) were of signal service to me.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_10-27-1811_notes.html#5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
    <p>I do not mean to hurry you; but I shall be happy to receive your favours as early as your convenience will allow, that we may get forward a little. I will take care to furnish you with proofs.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_10-27-1811_notes.html#6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
    <p>The little Article on Oxford was furnished by Mr. Allan,<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_10-27-1811_notes.html#7"><sup>7</sup></a> Heber's friend&#8212;I was once about to trouble you with the proofs, but I feared to tax your kindness. However, I looked over it as carefully as I could, and it does not read amiss&#8212;Hereafter, I hope to have something more worthy of the subject, upon a worthier book&#8212;</p>
    <p>With the sincerest regards</p>
    <p>I am ever, my dear Sir,</p>
    <p>your truly obliged &amp;</p>
    <p>faithful servt.</p>
    <p>Wm. Gifford</p>
