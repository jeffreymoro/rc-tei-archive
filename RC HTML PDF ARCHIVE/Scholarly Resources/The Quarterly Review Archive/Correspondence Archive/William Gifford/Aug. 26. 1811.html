    <p>My dear Sir,</p>
    <p>Your obliging letter followed me to Ryde, or rather passed me on its route to that place, and then several days have been unfortunately lost; for I turned aside at Chichester to pay a short visit to the widow of my poor friend Hoppner.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_8-26-1811_notes.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
    <p>I thank you for your hints on Stewart's article&#8212;all of which I have attended to. The subject, I confess, is one with which I am not very conversant; however, I have done my best, with great care, and I hope you will not disapprove of it. Heber is still rusticating, so that I have no adviser at my elbow.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_8-26-1811_notes.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
    <p>While I was at Ryde I desired Murray to send you Ensor<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_8-26-1811_notes.html#2"> </a> &amp; Lord Charlemont,<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_8-26-1811_notes.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a> which, I hope, he did not neglect to do. I have no means of inquiring, at present, for he is out of town.</p>
    <p>I shall be glad to get Lord Charlemont as soon as you have looked it over. I am much pleased with your account of what you have seen; and will deal with it, as you suggest, with a very tender hand. Probably it will stand in need of no alteration&#8212;this will please me best.</p>
    <p>I know how eager your friends must be to share you, and therefore, happy as I should be, to receive any thing from you, I will not venture to press you. If circumstances allow of any thing before the 12th or 14th of next month, it will come very grateful&#8212;but, indeed, you must not sacrifice too much to your wish to befriend us this time.</p>
    <p>Your allusion to Macvey's omissions to the second &amp; certainly the most interesting &amp; amusing part, only serve to increase my unavailing regret&#8212;I hate to think of it, though I sinned innocently.</p>
    <p>I have been spending, en passant, a day or two at Croydon with my friend Ireland. He is meditating more Westminster Lectures of which the course seems interminable. He remembers you with great kindness and pleasure, and, I suspect, looks forward to Oxford.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_8-26-1811_notes.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <p>With the sincerest regard</p>
    <p>I remain ever my dear</p>
    <p>Sir, your obliged &amp;</p>
    <p>faithful servt</p>
    <p>Wm. Gifford</p>
    <p>[tear]</p>
    <p>P.S. I shall hope to hear from you again speedily&#8212;according to your promise. Miss Owenson, if you undertake the lady, would be a plaything in your hands. Lord Clarendon, indeed, would be a work de longue halein&#233;&#8212;but let all be as you please</p>
