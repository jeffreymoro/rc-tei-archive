    <p>My dear Sir</p>
    <p>Our friend Davison has just informed me that he can do nothing for us in this No. This is a very sensible mortification to me, as it comes on the heels of several other disappointments which have left me almost disfurnished. I have written to him, in the hope that he may be more at leisure, for our Septr. No.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_6-3-1812_notes.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
    <p>He tells me that my anonymous friend has fixed upon Horne Tooke&#8212;<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_6-3-1812_notes.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a>This, I am much pleased with, as, in his hands, it will make a very interesting article. I am almost afraid to put him in mind of Trotter:&#8212;<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_6-3-1812_notes.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a> but cannot what was written for Fox be introduced into the present criticism&#8212;the two characters sometimes came in contact, &amp; therefore may fitly appear together. This, however, is only for you&#8212;as you can form some opinion on it, having seen what was written. Do you think, that I can have it by the second week of July? If so&#8212;it will be a favour of the highest kind: but, I would not be importunate.</p>
    <p>Mr Vaux's communication, too, would be extremely serviceable for this No.&#8212;for I am really obliged to sue in form&#226; pauperis, from the circumstances mentioned above.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_6-3-1812_notes.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a> I wrote to Mr Phillpotts on the completion of our No. I hope that my letter reached him. Do you think that I might venture to solicit his aid? I am ignorant of his avocations, &amp;, indeed, of the subjects which it might be proper to mention to him.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_6-3-1812_notes.html#5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
    <p>I hope that you have determined ere this to favour us with the Article to which you alluded in your last. I will not press you, as to time. Assuredly, it will be highly interesting, and happy, indeed shall I be to receive it. I have, as you have probably observed, kept aloof from the question, that we might present it as a whole, upon a befitting occasion; and there can be none more so, that the examination of the publication of Lord Clarendon.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_6-3-1812_notes.html#5"> </a><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_6-3-1812_notes.html#6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
    <p>This miserable state of uncertainty in which we have been kept for so many days, is not favourable to me. Nothing is done by two or three who had engaged to prepare their critiques for this No.</p>
    <p>Ever, dear Sir, your</p>
    <p>truly obliged and obedt</p>
    <p>servt Wm. Gifford</p>
    <p>P.S. Pray have the</p>
    <p>goodness to give the</p>
    <p>inclosed to Mr Davison</p>
