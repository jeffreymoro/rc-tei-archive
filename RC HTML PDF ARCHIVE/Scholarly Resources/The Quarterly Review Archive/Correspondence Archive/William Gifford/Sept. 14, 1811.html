    <p>My dear Sir,</p>
    <p>I thank you most sincerely for Ld Charlemont,<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_9-14-1811_notes.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a> which I recd yesterday, &amp;, after running it over, sent, at once, to the Press. I was greatly pleased with it, and feel very confident that you have, in no instance, said one word too much in its favour. This friend of ours is, indeed, a valuable co-adjutor. The proofs shall be sent as you desire. I have no wish to abridge the extracts, which are all interesting or amusing.</p>
    <p>I wish very much to take notice of Miss Seward, and shall be extremely happy to hear that your friend will venture upon her. If her poetical works, which Scott edited in three volumes, could be comprised in the same article with her letters ( I wish not to limit its length) it would be desirable&#8212;but let this be as the writer pleases. If he will undertake the work, I shall beg you to inform <sub>^</sub> <sup>me</sup> whether it can be prepared in time for our next No.&#8212;In that case, it should reach me by the last day of November. I think we shall not postpone the subject to a later period.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_9-14-1811_notes.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
    <p>I was much alarmed at your accident till I came to the conclusion of it. I trust that the convalescence of your worthy father has advanced with a rapidity equal to your desires, and that you are quite recovered. I know not how it is, but I never feel quite easy when I hear that a friend of mine uses a gig. So many accidents happen to those ticklish vehicles&#8212;but all, I hope, is over.</p>
    <p>&#8212;Now for Ensor&#8212;<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_9-14-1811_notes.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a> I should be the most unreasonable creature in the world, if I could now urge you to sacrifice any portion of your time to me. No, my dear Sir, you have better cares that claim you&#8212;Lay him aside till your return to Oxford, when it will be as acceptable as at present, and complete the Article to your own satisfaction. I shall indeed, stand in need of all your kindness for our next No. as I cannot look forward to much matter, and an unpleasant accident has just called off one of my friends, who had engaged for a Review of Malcolm's India.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_9-14-1811_notes.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
    <p>Davison, as Sir Toby observes, is a Peg-o-Ramsey<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_9-14-1811_notes.html#5"><sup>5</sup></a>&#8212;He promised me his article by the 9th, and lo! the 14th is arrived without it. However, I can now make some progress:&#8212;yet I shall jog him by this Post. I hope to be able to send to Budd some time on Monday.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_9-14-1811_notes.html#6"><sup>6</sup></a> It will be unlucky, however, if the gentleman be not in, or near town, as we have no time to lose. All Pater Noster Row will be marshalled against us, if we are not out of the press by the last day of this month.</p>
    <p>With the sincerest regard,</p>
    <p>I am, my dear Sir, most</p>
    <p>faithfully yours</p>
    <p>Wm. Gifford</p>
    
    <p>&#160;</p>
