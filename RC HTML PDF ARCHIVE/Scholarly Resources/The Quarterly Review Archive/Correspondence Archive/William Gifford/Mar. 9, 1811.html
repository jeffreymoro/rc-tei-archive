    <p>My dear Sir,</p>
    <p>I take shame to myself for not noticing that part of a former letter which related to your friend Mr Vaux; but it was really a lapse of memory; for I meant to have accepted his assistance with thanks. For a first Article, would it not be proper to leave the choice to himself? If so, I will immediately transmit any work on which he may fix. I shall be very happy to hear of his entering our ranks.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_3-9-1811_notes.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
    <p>I have to thank you for the mention of Lord Charlemont for my unknown correspondent.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_3-9-1811_notes.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a> His last Article<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_3-9-1811_notes.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a> convinces me that any subject of this nature, is perfectly safe in his hands, and I shall, if he will accept of that which you mention, confide it to him with equal security &amp; pleasure. I hold him to be a most valuable ally.</p>
    <p>I purpose to send you De Motu<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_3-9-1811_notes.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a> when it is set up, &amp; you will then judge if any part of it appear [?minute] or less important than the subject requires. It seems to me a very excellent piece of criticism. Whitaker is a good friend of ours, &amp; I really owe him some thanks for his Review of the man with "the leaden mace,"<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_3-9-1811_notes.html#5"><sup>5</sup></a> who, by the way, is my next door neighbour:&#8212;if, therefore, upon a view of the whole any word can be softened, (which I do not know) it may be done.&#8212;</p>
    <p>I have a letter from Heber this morning&#8212;He is still, "like honest Ovid, among the goats", but not forgetful of us.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_3-9-1811_notes.html#6"><sup>6</sup></a> He expresses a wish to see something in the hands of Mr Vaux.&#8212;I have sent to Murray to say that if the proof can be got ready this post, to send it off at once, to you. Ever, my</p>
    <p>dear Sir, very sincerely yours</p>
    <p>Wm. Gifford.</p>
