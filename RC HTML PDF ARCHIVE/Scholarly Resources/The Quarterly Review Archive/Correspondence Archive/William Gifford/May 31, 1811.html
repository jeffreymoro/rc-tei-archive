    <p>My dear Sir,</p>
    <p>"Star after star goes out, and all is night"<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_5-31-1811_notes.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a>&#8212;I have had so many disappointments in this No. that I scarcely know how I shall be able to make it out.</p>
    <p>I have not yet rec'd the Article from Scotland&#8212;what is more to be lamented, I fear, is, that we are all wrong with respect to the writer.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_5-31-1811_notes.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a> By this morning's post, I had a note from Home Drummond communicating, under secrecy, his name, which, notwithstanding the injunction, I think it necessary to mention to you. It is not Brown but <u>Napier</u>&#8212;a person of whom I know nothing. Is he known to you? Heber is in Yorkshire. At his return, I shall also mention the name to him: &amp; to no other person living.</p>
    <p>I must look forward to better prospects. Will your leisure, my dear Sir, allow of your assisting us in the next? I hope it will. There is a work worthy of your talents which Oxford has lately sent forth; I mean Lord Clarendon's two volumes.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_5-31-1811_notes.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a> We have not yet taken up the Catholick Question; and I should be happy to get a grand view of it, as bearing upon the present times. There is also a volume by a man of the name of <u>Ensor</u>, full of conceit, arrogance and mischief.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_5-31-1811_notes.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a> He merits a castigation from <u>you</u>, &amp; a smart one would do good; for some people are pushing his work forward. I merely take the liberty of hinting at these; but, in fact, I shall be equally pleased with any subject which may engage your fancy. There are, I think, many interesting works just out of the press.</p>
    <p>Falconer is the first Article in this No.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_5-31-1811_notes.html#5"> </a> He makes nearly two sheets&#8212;by far too much for such a subject; but I was willing to gratify him. The only interesting part of the Article, to the general reader, is most assuredly that which you were kind enough to append.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_5-31-1811_notes.html#5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
    <p>I regret that our theological articles are not so strong, generally speaking, as they ought to be. A good subject is rather inadequately handled in this No.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_5-31-1811_notes.html#6"><sup>6</sup></a> It is from Cam where they seem to neglect style, or rather perhaps to have adopted slovenly models. I have taken pains with it, as Ireland could tell you; but cannot much applaud my success.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_5-31-1811_notes.html#7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
    <p>I am now anxious to get out, &amp; must fill up as well as I can. More than half the articles on which I had calculated this No. have not reached me; and I am even now doubtful of Stewart.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_5-31-1811_notes.html#8"><sup>8</sup></a> However, I must proceed: [tear] sheet, I think, are printed. [tear] hear nothing of Mr Davison [is he at] Oriel?&#8212;Have you looke [tear] into that strange mess of vanity &amp; [tear] impertinence, the collected letters of Miss Seward? She would make a good Article; but I know not where to apply.<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_5-31-1811_notes.html#9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
    <p>I should be delighted to hear more frequently from you; and should myself often trouble you, if I were not fearful of breaking in upon your studies.</p>
    <p>Ever my dear Sir, most</p>
    <p>faithfully yours</p>
    <p>Wm. Gifford.</p>
    <p>P.S. I hope your friend will send me <strike>Marchmont</strike>&#160; Charlemont as soon as it is finished that we may put it forward for No.11.</p>
