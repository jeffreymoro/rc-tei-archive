    <p>My dear Sir</p>
    <p>I am about to mention to you a matter some delicacy in which I rely on your kindness for an excuse. Heber gratified me with an acct that you would undertake Dugald Stuart;<a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_2-17-1811_notes.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a> at the same he said that you agreed with him that if a Scotch gentleman, whom he mentioned but whose name I do <sub>^</sub><sup>not</sup> recollect, could be prevailed on to give a critique on him, it would be right to accept it.<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_2-17-1811_notes.html#2">2</a></sup></p>
    <p>Now I have a letter from Drummond (which I enclose) with an offer of this very Article from a person who, I am firmly persuaded is the very person meant by you and Heber. What shall I do? Heber is flown as usual&#8212;but I will follow your advice implicitly, &amp; feel infinitely obliged to you for bestowing it. I am sorry to trespass upon your time thus, but <u>res dura</u>, you know&#8212;and then a single line will be sufficient.</p>
    <p>Roscoe I have not yet received<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_2-17-1811_notes.html#3">3</a></sup>&#8212;that is, I sent it to the press immediately, &amp; have not got it back. It will do, I think, excellently. We have but one article printed, but we shall do very well as I have most of my materials before me. The Strabo of our Bath friend is forc&#233;ment long, and the last (1st) part slovenly in style.<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_2-17-1811_notes.html#4">4</a></sup> I have, however, put in a few connecting particles, &amp; struck out a few disconnecting ones&#8212;and upon the whole, I hope that it will sound [Greek].<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_2-17-1811_notes.html#5">5</a></sup></p>
    <p>I shall be extremely glad of Mr Davison's Edgeworth.<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_2-17-1811_notes.html#6">6</a></sup> I have a neat but <u>feeble</u> review of it, which, at any rate, I shall not use, after what has appeared in the Edin. Rev. where they have treated the subject of education &#224; plusieurs reprises. With Mr Davison in my hand, I shall not fear to meet them "dareful, beard to beard."<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_2-17-1811_notes.html#7">7</a></sup></p>
    <p>With the truest esteem, I</p>
    <p>am, dear Sir, ever most</p>
    <p>faithfully yours</p>
    <p>Wm. Gifford</p>
    <p>P.S. We have just reprinted our 4th No. and I could not help (though I believe it is rather unfair) to insert the delicious line which you pointed out in friend Northmore<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_2-17-1811_notes.html#8">8</a></sup></p>
    <p>&#8212;supply to needy men</p>
    <p>Who paid in <u>forged paper</u>!&#160;</p>
    <p>We get on well, &amp; shall print 6,000 this time.</p>
    <p>Monday morn.<sup><a href="/reference/qr/correspondence/gifford/notes/Gifford_to_Edward_Copleston_2-17-1811_notes.html#9">9</a></sup></p>
