              <p>Sir</p>

              <p>I venture to address you upon a subject that is
              not perhaps undeserving of one moment of your
              attention.</p>

              <p>There is a work entitled the Edinburgh Review,
              written with such unquestionable talent that it has
              already obtained an extent of circulation not
              equalled by any similar publication. The principles
              of this work are however so radically bad<font color=
              "#00FF00">,</font> that I have been led to consider
              the effect which such sentiments so generally
              diffused, are likely to produce; &amp; to think that
              some means equally popular ought to be adopted to
              counteract their dangerous tendency. But the
              publication in question is conducted with
              <strike><font color="#008080">such</font></strike>
              high &amp; decisive authority by <font color=
              "#008080"><u>the Party</u></font> of whose opinions
              it is the organ, that there is little hope of
              producing against it any effectual opposition, unless
              it arise from you Sir, and your friends<font color=
              "#008080">&#8212;</font>Should you Sir think the idea
              worthy of encouragement I should with equal pride
              &amp; willingness engage my arduous exertions to
              promote its success, but as my object is nothing
              short of producing a work of the greatest talent
              &amp; importance, I shall entertain it no longer if
              it be not so fortunate as to obtain the high
              patronage which I have thus Sir taken the liberty to
              solicit.</p>

              <p>Permit me sir to add that the person who thus
              addresses you is no adventurer, but a man of some
              property inheriting a business that has been
              established for nearly a century. I therefore
              <font color="#008080"><strike>pl</strike></font>
              trust that my application will be attributed to its
              proper motives, &amp; that your goodness will at
              least pardon its intrusion.</p>

              <p>I have the honour to be Sir</p>

              <p>Your most humble &amp; <font color=
