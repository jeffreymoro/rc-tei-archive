    <p>The first issue of the <i>Quarterly Review</i> appeared in
    March 1809.</p>

    <p>The previous year, a number of developments, most related to
    the building conservative opposition to the liberal
    <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, precipitated the founding of the
    journal.</p>

    to James Grahame states, "It will be well for Jeffrey if his
    abuse of Wordsworth does not draw down vengeance upon his
    head." (Curry, <i>New Letters of Robert Southey</i>, 469)</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">12 February</font></b> Robert
    Southey to John Taylor Coleridge, "I am strongly moved by the
    spirit to make an attack upon Jeffrey along his whole line,
    beginning with his politics." (Southey, <i>Life</i>, 135)</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">4 March</font></b> George Canning

    <i>Marmion</i>.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">13 March</font></b> Walter Scott to

    <i>Marmion</i>...."</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">23 April</font></b> Walter Scott to
    Anna Seward, says he admires Southey and Wordsworth for their
    "upright undeviating morality ... with all they think and say
    and write."</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">23 April</font></b> same to same,
    "Nothing new of the literary kind ... except that Jeffrey has
    written a very sharp review of <i>Marmion</i> ...." Scott
    claims not to be distressed and states that he and Jeffrey went
    over the review with mutual good humour. Same information is
    repeated in Scott to Surtees, n.d. (But see June 20 below.)</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">ca. 28 May</font></b> <i>Edinburgh
    Review</i> January number appears, contains negative review of
    Walter Scott's <i>Marmion</i>. Sydney Smith writes against
    missions to India, thus contributes to ongoing East India House
    debate and rankles Robert Southey and key supporters of the
    journal, the Saints.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">12 May</font></b> Octavius
    Gilchrist (a friend of William Gifford's and later a reviewer
    in the <i>Quarterly</i>) writes to Walter Scott; he mentions
    his friend William Gifford a number of times.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">5 June</font></b> Octavius
    Gilchrist writes to Walter Scott that John Murray would like to
    contact Scott, to ask if he would edit the plays of Beaumont
    and Fletcher.</p>

    <p><font color="#000066"><b>20 June</b></font> Robert Southey
    to Neville White, "I have not seen the Scotch review of
    Marmion, but I have heard that on its appearance, Walter Scott
    showed Jeffrey the letter in which I had refused to bear a part
    in his review." (Southey, <i>Life</i>, 153).</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">ca. 10 September</font></b> "Don
    Cevallos," a radical article by Francis Jeffrey and Henry
    Brougham appears in <i>Edinburgh Review</i> [advertised for 10
    September in <i>Monthly Literary Advertiser</i>; however, it
    had been advertised in the <i>Courier</i> from 26 August.]</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">20 September</font></b> John Murray
    arrives at Edinburgh, dines with Archibald Constable and James
    Ballantyne. He and Ballantyne walk together, discover basis of
    agreement for partnership, and similar views on the weakness of
    Scott's relationship with Constable.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">21 September</font></b> Ballantyne
    takes their conversation to Walter Scott, who is
    sympathetic.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">26 September</font></b> Ballantyne
    writes to John Murray that Scott will meet with them on
    Saturday or Sunday.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">2 October</font></b> John Murray
    arrives for two-day visit to Walter Scott at his Ashestiel
    residence. Scott presses him to extend his stay. Richard Heber,
    a mutual friend of George Canning and Walter Scott, is also
    there; he and John Murray meet for the first time. Over the
    next three days, Scott and the others develop the idea of a
    journal to rival Constable's <i>Edinburgh Review</i>.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">3 October</font></b> Scott takes
    John Murray and Heber sightseeing.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">4 October</font></b> Now joined by
    James Ballantyne, the party go on another sightseeing tour.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">5 October</font></b> John Murray
    and Ballantyne set out early for Edinburgh. John Murray writes
    to his wife that his plans of the past twelve months concerning
    a new conservative review and establishing a business
    arrangement with Ballantyne and Scott have been realized beyond
    his expectations.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">12 October</font></b> William
    Gifford writes to George Canning.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">16 October</font></b> John Murray
    arrives back in London.</p>

    the Exposition of Don Pedro Cevallos" <i>Examiner</i> Number 42
    (October 16, 1808) 657-59.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">23 October</font></b> William
    Erskine to his brother-in-law Archibald Campbell-Colquhoun,
    Lord Advocate of Scotland, answers the Lord Advocate's letter
    and returns Canning's, says "plan alluded to is already in some
    measure begun. Murray ... went to Ashestiel" to suggest a
    Review to oppose the <i>Edinburgh</i>, and to ask Scott to be
    editor. Scott declined. Thinks if government is to give
    support, editor should be in London. William Gifford has been
    offered editorship. Thinks Canning has his eye on Gifford.
    Malthus has agreed to assist. Scott will assist; has been hurt
    by Jeffrey's <i>Marmion</i>.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">25 October</font></b> Walter Scott
    to William Gifford, says he has received letter from Lord
    Advocate who has been in correspondence with Canning, who
    informs him that Gifford is to be editor. Recounts Murray's
    visit to Ashestiel. States that Murray had had some earlier
    communication with Canning on the subject of a Review,
    "although indirectly" (through Stratford Canning?).
    <i>Edinburgh Review</i> on Spain "have done the work great
    injury with the public"</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">26 October</font></b> John Murray
    writes to Walter Scott, has reason to believe government will
    be supportive as he has seen William Gifford who spoke
    circumspectly about having spoken with high politicos about the
    need for a review; William Gifford has employed John Murray as
    publisher for Dr. John Ireland, William Gifford's best
    friend</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">27 October</font></b> Scott, in
    letter to Archibald Campbell-Colquhoun, says he has read
    Canning's letter and has replied; asks Campbell-Colquhoun to
    forward that letter and a long letter to William Gifford (copy
    to Canning); thinks William Gifford will eventually agree to
    provide articles for the review; he does not know William
    Gifford's address; the letter was approved by William
    Erskine.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">31 October</font></b> Scott to
    Joanna Baillie, denies harboring hard feelings toward Jeffrey,
    but wishes the <i>Marmion</i> review had been couched in more
    civil language.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">6 November</font></b> Robert
    Southey writes to Walter Scott, is glad Scott has broken his
    association with the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">9 November</font></b> William
    Gifford replies to Walter Scott's letter; says he has spoken
    with Canning and Lord Hawkesbury about the review; Canning has
    promised to speak with George Ellis, William Gifford with Rose;
    thinks Jackson of Christ Church and other good men from Oxford
    and Cambridge might be solicited; William Gifford warns Scott
    about his poor health.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">9 November</font></b> Southey to
    Herbert Hill, says he has communicated with Scott who has
    broken with the <i>Edinburgh</i> for political reasons. Southey
    thinks his refusal to write for the <i>Edinburgh</i> first
    pricked Scott's conscience, and perhaps Scott also stung by
    <i>Marmion</i> review. Gifford has asked Southey to write for
    the new journal. Wants to write on the missionaries, to answer
    Sydney Smith's anti-missionary articles in the
    <i>Edinburgh</i>. In a letter to Grosvenor Bedford dated 11
    November, Southey repeats his belief that he had pricked
    Scott's conscience.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">11 November</font></b> George Ellis
    writes to Walter Scott a detailed prospectus of what the review
    should and should not be, that it should use popularity to
    become a vehicle of instruction.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">15 November</font></b> John Murray
    writes long letter to Walter Scott outlining his plan for the
    review; reminds Scott that for almost two years he had had the
    idea of a review opposing the principles of the <i>Edinburgh
    Review</i>, and that he had written Canning about it one year
    since. Tries to clarify who will author the lead article of the
    first number; Gifford has asked Southey, against John Murray's
    objections. Insists the journal must be independent of
    government. Asks Scott's approval of a title for the journal,
    <i>London</i> <i>Quarterly Review</i>. Declares the editor's
    salary to be 200 pounds per annum and sets total payments to
    contributors per number at 60 guineas.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">17 November</font></b> John Murray
    writes a second long letter to Scott; says he has met William
    Gifford again; William Gifford has communicated with Canning,
    Lord Hawksebury, Mr. Long, and Huskisson; Southey has declined
    writing the lead article on the war in Spain; John Murray will
    write to Ballantyne.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">19 November</font></b> John Murray
    to Walter Scott, has learned through William Gifford that the
    Saints (parliamentary evangelicals under William Wilberforce),
    who had been contemplating a review to counter the
    <i>Edinburgh</i>, will now support their project. 19 November
    Scott to Thomas Scott, says "a plot has been hatching by the
    gentlemen who were active in the Anti-Jacobin paper..."</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">22 November</font></b> George
    Ellis's second letter to Walter Scott on the review in receipt
    of Scott's reply to his first; with Scott fears that Gifford's
    health will lead to problems; does not know Southey, doubts his
    political opinions are sound.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">24 to 27 November</font></b>
    William Gifford and Canning in conference with George Ellis at
    Claremont, Ellis's residence; for four days they discuss the
    review.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">29 November</font></b> William
    Gifford meets with George Canning; arranges an interview for
    John Murray with Canning. George Ellis will write for the new
    journal. George Ellis writes a third letter to Walter Scott;
    discusses November 24-27 Claremont conference; appears Canning
    is too busy to write for the review; Ellis agrees to undertake
    the lead article on the war in Spain; calls for the politics of
    the review to be temperate and independent of government.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">1 December</font></b> John Murray
    writes to Walter Scott about the November 24-27 Claremont
    conference; Samuel Rogers, Edward Copleston, and Reginald Heber
    (Richard's brother) might be recruited; he and William Gifford
    agree with Scott the review should avoid offending the
    Saints.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">6 December</font></b> John Murray
    writes to Walter Scott that Thomas Moore and Sotheby have
    agreed to contribute reviews.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">18 December</font></b> George Ellis
    writes to Walter Scott; everything is coming together; three
    scientific men have been recruited.</p>

    <p><b><font color="#000066">ca. 29 December</font></b> James
    Pillans will write for the new journal. James Mill offers a
    review (by another writer) on the West Indies. Mrs. Inchbald is
    asked to contribute, but she is very diffident. William Gifford
    meets with Canning and Ellis at Claremont.</p>
