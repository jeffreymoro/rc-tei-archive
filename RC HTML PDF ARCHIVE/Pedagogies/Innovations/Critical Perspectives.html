<h3 align="center">Literary Theory and Criticism<br/>
    By Kat Seiffert</h3>
    <p align="center">Perspectives defined by the Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory</p>
    <p align="center">for use in the IVANHOE GAME</p>
    
    <p>Classical Marxism</p>
    
    <p>Four Tenets of Classical Marxism:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>denial that any cultural piece (literature, art, etc.) can exist independently of ideology, class, and economics.</li>
    <li>&#8220;truth&#8221; is subjective and institutionally created.</li>
    <li>art is a branch of production and thus a commodity.</li>
    <li>focus on how class struggle is represented in or has influenced literature and history.
    <ul>
    <li>Art and literature represent what is &#8220;typical&#8221; about a class</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Modernist Theory and Criticism</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Avant-garde, experimental style of writing in the early 20 th century.</li>
    <li>International movement that signaled &#8220;a revolutionary break from established orthodoxies, a celebration of the present, and an experimental investigation into the future&#8221; (512).</li>
    <li>Classical style is often used: preference &#8220;for the visual and the concrete over the general and abstract, for freshness of idiom, for the vital complexities that are &#8216;intensive&#8217; rather than extensive&#8221; (513). For example, a classical writer would prefer to write about the local and well-defined place or moment rather than an infinite question.</li>
    <li>Two modernist camps:
    <ol>
    <li>the individual is ultimately limited and finite</li>
    <li>the individual is limited but, through celebrating diversity, individual limitations are lifted.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>New Historicism</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Placing a text within a larger spectrum of discourses and practices during the time period the text was written while realizing that the points of views presented in period texts do not necessarily represent the mindset of the general population or even the literate population of that specified period.</li>
    <li>No set of methodological procedures or coherent theoretical program surrounding New Historicism.
    <ul>
    <li>The creator of New Historicism, Stephen Greenblatt, never intended for it to be a literary theory but rather an &#8220;array of reading practices that investigate a series of issues that emerge when critics seek to chart the ways texts, in dialectical fashion, both represent a society&#8217;s behavior patterns and perpetuate, shape, or alter that culture&#8217;s dominant codes&#8221; (535)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Generally, it calls for the realization that art and society are interrelated.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>New Humanism</p>
    <ul>
    <li>A cultural movement that began in 1892 by Irving Babbitt and Paul Elmer More while they were Harvard graduate students.</li>
    <li>It affirms freedom of the will and the necessity of standards in life and art.</li>
    <li>Founded on the ethical teachings of Erasmus, Jesus, Aristotle, Confucius, and Buddha for the &#8220;reform of the inner life&#8221; and a call &#8220;for an ethical aristocracy to exemplify the virtues of moderation&#8221; during a time when American society was &#8220;drift[ing] into materialism, hedonism, and demagoguery&#8221; (540).</li>
    <li>Plays on humanity&#8217;s dualism of desirous impulses and the will to refrain.</li>
    <li>Individuals are responsible for their own happiness, illuminating the insufficiency of all deterministic theories&#8212;Darwinism, Marxism, Freudianism, Behaviorism.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Postmodernism</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Explores the social determinants of the literature/art and its impact on society. Essentially, literature/art is ideologically influenced and conversely influences popular ideology. (That is, to postmodernist critics, art and literature seem to submit to dominant culture; this sense that art always submits to the dominant ideology is sometimes called "conspiracy theory.")</li>
    <li>"[H]ighlights the multiplication of voices, questions, and conflicts that has shattered what once seemed to be (although it never really was) the placid unanimity of the great tradition and of the West that gloried in it&#8221; (587).</li>
    <li>The postmodern writer (the artist, not the critic) manipulates &#8220;cultural givens&#8221; through the use of parody, collage, juxtaposition, etc. for various ends (586).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Feminism -- see the separate page devoted to this topic, <a href="/pedagogies/commons/innovations/IVANHOE/feminism.html">Feminism</a>.</p>
    <p>Poststructuralist Feminism</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Promotes the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes.</li>
    <li>A formative statement of poststructuralist feminism by Barbara Johnson: &#8220;The question of gender is a question of language&#8221; (242). Thus, poststructuralist feminists believe that &#8220;gender difference dwells in language rather than in the referent, that there is nothing &#8216;natural&#8217; about gender itself&#8221; (242). Language and discourse are part of patriarchal society; if there is a way around it, it would only be through a new form of writing (<em>&#233;criture f&#233;minine</em>).</li>
    <li>Questioning of &#8220;what is woman?&#8221; led to the proposition that there is no such thing as &#8220;woman,&#8221; according to popular poststructuralist feminist Julia Kristeva (245): that is, the ideas of "woman" (and, for that matter, "man") are cultural constructs, definitions that change to meet changing historical needs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Traditional Freudian Criticism</p>
    <ul>
    <li>When reading a piece of literature psychoanalytically, the work discloses the author&#8217;s unconscious fantasies.</li>
    <li>Places significance on &#8220;dreams, fetishism, repression and childhood eroticism, parapraxes, the object choice in love, the uncanny, the roles of Eros, daydreams, or almost anything else,&#8221; providing insight into the unconscious (312).</li>
    <li>Symbolism is heavily relied upon in Freudian Criticism (e.g. the abundance of phallic symbols are overwhelmingly a result of Freudian psychoanalysis).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Postmodern Freudian Criticism</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Works disclose the unconscious fantasies of a society or culture, not of an individual</li>
    <li>Relies heavily on the work of Jacques Lacan and, more recently, Slavoj Zizek</li>
    </ul>

<h3 align="center">FEMINISM: introduction and basic history<br/>
    By Kat Seiffert</h3>
    <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Feminism</strong>:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Belief in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes.</li>
    <li>The movement organized around this belief.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The American Heritage&#174; Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition<em><br/>
    Copyright &#169; 2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company.</em></p>
    <p>Feminism is a popularly misconstrued movement that is often associated with burning bras and the superiority of the female over the male, although both are true for parts of feminism&#8217;s history. It would be also misguided to assume that the term &#8220;feminism&#8221; could be replaced with &#8220;equalism&#8221; because feminism identifies itself with women&#8217;s rights and equality rather than the equal rights of everyone. Today, feminist issues range from access to employment, education, child care, contraception, and abortion, to equality in the workplace, changing family roles, addressing sexual harassment, and equal political representation.</p>
    <p>Before deconstructing &#8220;feminism&#8221; further, it is imperative to address the difference between being a &#8220;female&#8221; and being &#8220;feminine,&#8221; as they are two terms essential to the feminist movement:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>A female is defined solely biologically whereas to be feminine is a social construct that adheres to the image of the passive, defenseless, rather emotional housewife in a dress. To be masculine is to be tough, rational, domineering businessman in pants. Many people do not fit into the strict social categorizations of being a feminine female or a masculine male but rather define themselves somewhere in between. Therefore, being a female does not necessarily imply that one is feminine and vice versa. A feminist is someone who believes that sexism causes social problems. NB: a person does not need to be biologically a female in order to be a feminist, nor feminine -- nor NOT feminine (see below)!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Today, feminism means something entirely different than when the first feminist document, Mary Wollstonecraft's <em>Vindication of the Rights of Women,</em> was published in 1792. (Women wrote documents complaining of sexism -- see for instance Mary Astell's <em>Some Reflections Upon Marriage</em> (1700) -- but Wollstonecraft's pamphlet was the first to propose a plan for social reform.) Part of the reason why feminism is often misunderstood is due to a lack of historical understanding of the feminist movement.</p>
    <p>Feminism has occurred in three waves over slightly more than 200 years. The first wave of feminism, termed &#8220;equality feminism,&#8221; was the movement of women demanding full legal equality, full educational and commercial opportunity, the right to collect wages, and the right to vote. At the same time, first wave feminists wanted to be like men and therefore shed their femininity to become more masculine.</p>
    <p>The second wave of feminism during the 1960s and 1970s overwhelmingly argued for a &#8220;woman-centered&#8221; perspective, which put women as superior to men. The second wave is also called &#8220;difference feminism.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Over the past few decades, a third wave of feminism occurred. Third wave feminism calls for equal social, political, and economic rights between men and women while not asserting the superiority of either gender. Third wave feminists neither swear off femininity nor exclude masculinity from their personality. The point is to be equal without overwhelmingly accepting or barring socially constructed gender roles.</p>
    <p>Post-structuralist feminists such as H&#233;l&#232;ne Cixous and Luce Irigaray have proposed an alternatives to patriarchal language, sometimes called <em>&#233;criture f&#233;minine</em>.</p>
    <p>A feminist, today, is more than fighter for the equality of the sexes. He/she is &#8220;one who studies gender in order to demystify the essentialist mythologies that trap men and women into determining gender identity as &#8216;natural&#8217;,&#8221; according to Lisa Starks in her essay &#8220;Hyperfeminisms: Poststructuralist Theories, Popular Culture, and Pedagogy.&#8221; With that definition, one does not need to be female to be a feminist as there are many males who are feminists. To be a feminist means to question and/or reject the socially constructed gender affixed to being a male or a female.</p>
