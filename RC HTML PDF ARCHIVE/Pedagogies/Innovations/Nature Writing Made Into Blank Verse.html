<p>English 330 Romanticism Prof. Reed</p>
<p>Lines Composed a Few Hours Before Class, November 25, 2003, Giving the Assignment for the Second Exercise in Nature Writing</p>
<p>For this assignment you must take the prose You wrote in witness to some natural scene On Emory&#8217;s campus&#8211;some surviving nook Which master builders have not overbuilt&#8211; And turn it into five and twenty lines (Or so) of verse, into blank verse, to be Precise, the meter and the medium Favored by Shakespeare, Milton and the bards Of the Romantic era, whose keen ears Heard the correspondent breeze as it blew Across the strings of tree-hung harps within, Plucking the true-born English metric line: Unstress then stress, syllabic pairs times five, Without the sing-song of the couplet&#8217;s rhyme, Occasional substitute feet allowed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I expect a major poem To flow from ev&#8217;ry pen (or each key board), Mighty lines to drown out Wordsworth&#8217;s song Or push proud Manfred off his Alpine perch. Rather I hope to foster a respect In you for the craft of making verses Out of the &#8220;stubborn basement of English,&#8221; As it was called by Blake&#8211;who was immune For the most part to iambic pentameter, preferring seven-stress lines And damn the unstressed syllable count, taken from the silly Greeks.</p>
<p>If you can hear what happened in these last Two lines, you&#8217;re ready to take on your task, The task that must be done and handed in On Tuesday next, December&#8217;s second day.</p>
