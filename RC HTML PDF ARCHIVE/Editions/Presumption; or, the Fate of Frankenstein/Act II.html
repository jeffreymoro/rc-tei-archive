<div class="bodyText">
<h3>SCENE I:</h3>
<i>An apartment in the House of Elizabeth, at Belrive. &#8211; Table and chairs. The hurried music from the close of the First Act to play in continuance until this scene is discovered, and Frankenstein enters, hastily, to centre of stage. Music ceases.</i>
<p><b>FRANK.</b> At length in my sister&#8217;s house! &#8211; and safe! I have paced with quick steps, but at every turn feared to meet the wretch &#8211; my heart palpitates with the sickness of fear! [He does not pursue me &#8211; dreams that have been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space, are now become a hell to me &#8211; the change so rapid, the overthrow so complete &#8211; ] What have I cast on the world? a creature powerful in form, of supernatural and gigantic strength, but with the mind of an infant. Oh, that I could recall my impious labour, or suddenly extinguish the spark which I have so presumptuously bestowed. &#8211; Yet that were murder &#8211; murder in its worse and most horrid form &#8211; for he is mine &#8211; my own formation. Ha! who approaches?</p>
<p><i>Enter Elizabeth, they embrace.</i></p>
<p><b>ELIZ.</b> My dear Victor! my dear brother!</p>
<p><b>FRANK.</b> Elizabeth! [My love, how sweet is this embrace &#8211; ]</p>
<p><b>ELIZ.</b> You [are] come to stay, I hope, until our wedding is over. Clerval will be here presently. Alas! Frankenstein! your cheek is pallid &#8211; your eye has lost its wonted lustre. Oh, Victor, what are the secrets that prey upon your mind and form? &#8211; The pernicious air of your laboratory will be fatal to you.</p>
<p><b>FRANK.</b> <i>(Apart.)</i> Fatal indeed!</p>
<p><b>ELIZ.</b> I pray you, for my sake, cease &#8211; I understand upon one subject you have laboured incessantly.</p>
<p><b>FRANK.</b> One subject! <i>(Aside.)</i> Am I discovered?</p>
<p><b>ELIZ.</b> You change colour, my dear brother. I will not mention it &#8211; I &#8211; there is a wildness in your eyes for which I cannot account.</p>
<p><b>FRANK.</b> <i>(Starts.)</i> See &#8211; see &#8211; he is there!</p>
<p><b>ELIZ.</b> Dearest Frankenstein &#8211; what is the cause of this?</p>
<p><b>FRANK.</b> Do not ask me. I &#8211; I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room.</p>
<p><b>ELIZ.</b> Calm your mind, Victor.</p>
<p><b>FRANK.</b> Pardon me, Elizabeth. I know not what you will think of me.</p>
<p><b>ELIZ.</b> I have intelligence of one dear to you and for whom, prior to your close attention to study, you had the tenderest regard. &#8211; Say, Victor, will you not be glad to hear that I have a clue to lead you to your lost love, Agatha DeLacey!</p>
<p><b>FRANK.</b> Agatha! dearest Agatha! her name recalls my sinking spirits &#8211; where &#8211; where is she to be found? Oh, would that I ne&#8217;er had been robbed of her! &#8216;Twas her loss that drove me to deep and fatal experiments!</p>
<p><b>ELIZ.</b> A traveller! a beautiful Arabian girl, was here but last night; she was seeking Felix DeLacey, the brother of Agatha, to whom she had been betrothed &#8211; she gave me the information that the family are but a short distance from hence &#8211; the Valley of the Lake.</p>
<p><b>FRANK.</b> And Agatha there? &#8211; Agatha! there is yet life and hope for me &#8211; Ah no. <i>(Aside.)</i> The dreadful monster I have formed! &#8211; away with thought! Elizabeth, I will instantly seek her. Agatha&#8217;s smiles shall move this heavy pressure &#8211; to the Valley of the Lake. &#8211; Farewell, sister, farewell!</p>
<p><i>(Embraces Elizabeth, and Exit hastily)</i></p>
<p>[<b>ELIZ.</b> Unfortunate Frankenstein! &#8211; what can thus agitate him? &#8211; he will not hint the mysterious calamity to his affectionate sister &#8211; but he flies now to seek her who possessed his first love, and Agatha will sooth his mind to its former peaceful state &#8211; Ah love! All potent love! &#8211; If care or misfortune prey on my heart, I have only to think of Clerval, and be happy. &#8211;</p>
<p class="mediumBoldMaroon">SONG &#8211; ELIZABETH</p>
<p>When evening breezes mildly blow,<br/>
&#160; And all day&#8217;s tumults cease;<br/>
Where streams in gentle murmurs flow;<br/>
&#160; And all around breathes peace &#8211;<br/>
What shall my pensive mind employ,<br/>
&#160; From ev&#8217;rything free?<br/>
I&#8217;ll turn to life&#8217;s best dearest joy,<br/>
&#160; And think of love and Thee!</p>
<p>When pleasure&#8217;s smile no longer gleams,<br/>
&#160; And sorrow weighs my breast<br/>
When hope withdraws its placid beams<br/>
&#160; I sink with care opprest &#8211;<br/>
Ah whither shall my heart then turn,<br/>
&#160; To what sweet refuge flee?<br/>
With passion&#8217;s fire then shall burn<br/>
&#160; And throb with love and thee. <i>(Exit)</i><br/></p>

<h3>SCENE II:</h3>
<i>A wood in the neighbourhood of Geneva. A Bush &#8211; A Gypsy&#8217;s fire flaming, over which hangs a cauldron. A group of Gypsies discovered surrounding the fire in various positions. All laugh as the scene discovers them. When Tanskin, Hammerpan, with others (male and female) advance to sing the following</i>
<p><span class="mediumBoldMaroon">CHORUS</span></p>
<p>Urge the slow rising smoke,<br/>
Give the faggot a poke,<br/>
For unroof&#8217;d rovers are we;<br/>
Whilst our rags flutt&#8217;ring fly,<br/>
We the brown skin espy,<br/>
Our vellum of pedigree.<br/>
Behold each tawney face<br/>
Of our hard-faring race,<br/>
Which the cold blast ne&#8217;er can feel;<br/>
See our glossy hair wave,<br/>
Hear us, loud, as we crave<br/>
But dumb only when we steal!</p>
<p><b>TANS.</b> I tell you it was even so, friend Hammerpan &#8211; a giant creature with something of a human shape; but ugly and terrible to behold as you would paint the Devil.</p>
<p><b>HAM.</b> And does this monster any mischief, or is he a pacific monster?</p>
<p><b>TANS.</b> I never heard of any being harmed by him!</p>
<p><b>HAM.</b> Then why are you so frightened, Master Tanskin? For my part, should he come across my path, let who will fly, I&#8217;ll stand my ground like an anvil!</p>
<p><b>TANS.</b> And get well beat like one for your pains.</p>
<p><i>(Flute heard.)</i></p>
<p>What sounds are those?</p>
<p><b>HAM.</b> <i>(Returning to the fire.)</i> Why, &#8216;tis Felix, the son of old DeLacey. The young fellow is much famed for his excellence upon the flute, as the father for his piety, charities, and twanging on the harp, which, together with the beauty of his daughter, seems to have turned the heads and won the hearts of all the surrounding country. Now my merry wanderers, our meal is smoking. I&#8217;faith, I&#8217;m in a rare relishing humour for it, so, prithee, Dame, ladle us our porridge, with a whole dead sheep in it. Fegs, it scents rarely! <i>(Sniffs.)</i></p>
<p><i>Music. &#8211; The gipsies crowd round the fire with their bowls. The Demon rapidly crosses the platform at the back &#8211; Disappears.</i></p>
<p><b>1ST GYP.</b> Hilliho! &#8211; what tall bully&#8217;s that? the steeple of Ingoldstadt taking a walk. See yonder, comrades!</p>
<p><b>HAM.</b> See what?</p>
<p><b>TANS.</b> <i>(Trembling.)</i> As I&#8217;m a living rogue, &#8216;tis he!</p>
<p><b>HAM.</b> One of the Devil&#8217;s grenadier&#8217;s, mayhap! Pooh, pooh! Old Tanskin, we all know you are a living rogue, but you won&#8217;t frighten us with your ten feet. Come, give me a drink, I say.</p>
<p><i>One of the gipsies gives him a wooden bowl.</i></p>
<p>Gentlemen Gipsies, here&#8217;s all your good &#8211; ha! ha! ha! &#8211;</p>
<p><i>Music. &#8211; The Demon appears on an eminence of the bush, or a projecting rock.</i></p>
<p>Help! murder! wouns! &#8216;tis the Devil himself! away with the porridge!</p>
<p><i>Music. Throws bowl away. Hammerpan and all the Gipsies shriek and run off The Demon descends, portrays by action his sensitiveness of light and air, perceives the gipsies&#8217;s fire, which excites his admiration &#8211; thrusts his hand into the flame, withdraws it hastily in pain. Takes out a lighted piece of stick, compares it with another faggot which has not been ignited. Takes the food expressive of surprise and pleasure. A flute is heard, without. The Demon, breathless with delight, eagerly listens. It ceases &#8211; he expresses disappointment. Footsteps heard and the Demon retreats behind the rock.</i></p>
<p><i>Enter Agatha, followed by Felix, his flute slung at his back.</i></p>
<p><b>AGA.</b> Those sweet sounds recall happier days to my memory. &#8211; In the midst of [our] poverty, how consoling it is to possess such a brother as you are. Dear, thoughtful Felix, the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground you brought, because you thought it would give pleasure to your poor Agatha.</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. We are the children of misfortune; [Agatha &#8211; ] poverty&#8217;s chilling grasp nearly annihilates us. Our poor blind father, now the inmate of yon cottage &#8211; he who has been blessed with prosperity to be thus reduced &#8211; the noble-minded old DeLacey. Wretched man that I am, to have been the cause of ruin to both father and sister.</p>
<p><b>AGA.</b> Why, Felix, we suffered in a virtuous cause! Poor Safie, thy beloved &#8211;</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. Is, I fear, lost to me for ever. The treacherous Mahometan, her father, whose escape I aided from a dungeon in Paris (where he was confined as a State prisoner), that false father has doubtless arrived at Constantinople, and is triumphing at the fate of his wretched dupes.</p>
<p><b>AGA.</b> Nay, Felix &#8211;</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. Alas, Agatha! for aiding that escape, my family &#8211; my beloved family &#8211; are suffering exile and total confiscation of fortune.</p>
<p><b>AGA.</b> But Safie still loves you?</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. That thought is the more maddening! Safie! fairest Safie! &#8211; and she was my promised reward for liberating her faithless father &#8211; dragged away with him and forced to comply with his obdurate wishes. Oh, she is lost &#8211; lost to me for ever!</p>
<p><b>AGA.</b> Let not hope forsake you, Felix &#8211;</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. [Agatha! It requires resignation to bear our heavy woes.] The early passion of each of us has been blighted, our rigorous imprisonment and sudden banishment have driven all trace of thee from thy admirer, young Frankenstein.</p>
<p><b>AGA.</b> Dear Felix, press not more wretched recollections on my mind. I consider Frankenstein lost to me for ever. In abject poverty, dare I hope that the brilliant and animated student could e&#8217;er think of the unfortunate Agatha. <i>(Weeps.)</i> Let me dry these unworthy tears and exert a woman&#8217;s firmest fortitude. My soul is henceforth devoted exclusively to the service of my poor dark father.</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>, you shall behold me no longer unhappy.</p>
<p class="mediumBoldMaroon">DUET &#8211; FELIX AND AGATHA</p>
<p>Of all the knots which Nature ties,<br/>
The secret, sacred sympathies,<br/>
That, as with viewless chains of gold,<br/>
The heart a happy prisoner hold,<br/>
None is more chaste &#8211; more bright &#8211; more pure,<br/>
Stronger, stern trials to endure;<br/>
None is more pure of earthly leaven,<br/>
More like the love of highest heaven,<br/>
Than that which binds, in bonds how blest<br/>
A daughter to a father&#8217;s breast.</p>
<p><i>(Exeunt)</i></p>
<p><i>Music. &#8211; The Demon cautiously ventures out &#8211; his mantle having been caught by the bush, he disrobes himself leaving the mantle attached to the rock; he watches Felix and Agatha with wonder and rapture, appears irresolute whether he dares to follow them; he hears the flute of Felix, stands amazed and pleased, looks around him, snatches at the empty air, and with clenched hands puts them to each ear &#8211; appears vexed at his disappointment in not possessing the sound; rushes forward afterwards, again listens, and, delighted with the sound, steals off catching at it with his hands.</i><br/></p>

<h3>SCENE III:</h3>
<i>Exterior of the Cottage of Old DeLacey. On right, a hovel, with a low door, near which are two or three large logs of wood and a hatchet; a small basket with violets on a stool at the right side of the cottage door, and a stool also on the left side of the cottage, whereon DeLacey is discovered seated, leaning on his cane, a common harp at his side. &#8211; Music.</i>
<p><b>DEL.</b> Another day is added to the life of banished DeLacey! <i>(Rises and comes forward.)</i> But how will it be passed &#8211; like the preceding days &#8211; in wretched poverty, hopeless grief, and miserable darkness! <i>(Calls.)</i> Agatha! Felix! Alas! I am alone! Hark &#8211; no &#8211; I thought I heard footsteps &#8211; my children come. They must not suppose me cheerless &#8211; my lute is here &#8211; &#8216;tis a fair deceit on them &#8211; this lute which has so oft been damped with the tears from my sightless eyes &#8211; the sound of it is the only indication I can give that I am contented with my lot!</p>
<p><i>Music. &#8211; DeLacey</i> <i>returns to his seat and plays several chords. The Demon enters, attracted by the lute, suddenly perceives DeLacey, and approaches towards him &#8211; expresses surprise by action that DeLacey does not avoid him &#8211; discovers his loss of sight, which the Demon appears to understand by placing his hand over his own eyes, and feeling his way. At the conclusion of the music on the lute &#8211; occasioned, as it were, by the Demon having placed his hand on the instrument &#8211; a short pause, and during which the Demon, having lost the sound, appears to he looking for it, when the lute music is again resumed. In the midst of the music (without ceasing) a voice is heard</i>.</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. <i>(Within.)</i> This way, Agatha.</p>
<p><i>The Demon, alarmed, observes the little door of hovel, which he pushes open, signifies that he wishes for shelter, and retreats into this hovel or wood-house by the ending of the lute music by DeLacey, when Enter Felix and Agatha.</i></p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. <i>(Apart to Agatha.)</i> Observe his countenance, beaming with benevolence and love &#8211; behold those silver hairs &#8211; and, Agatha, I &#8211; I have reduced him to this pitiable state of poverty!</p>
<p><b>AGA.</b> Cease, Felix &#8211; this self reproach? <i>(Goes to DeLacey.)</i> We have returned, dear father. Have you wanted us?</p>
<p><i>Agatha leads her father forward.</i></p>
<p><b>DEL.</b> No, no, Agatha! You anticipate all my wants, and perform every little office of affection with gentleness.</p>
<p><b>AGA.</b> Is it not my duty, and am I not rewarded by your kind smiles?</p>
<p><b>DEL.</b> Amiable girl, let thy poor father kiss thee. <i>(They embrace.)</i> Felix, my son, where are you? <i>(Felix comes forward, and takes his hand.)</i> Now I am cheerful &#8211; I am happy! &#8211; indeed I am, my children. Let me encourage you to cast off your gloom. What &#8211; a tear, Agatha!</p>
<p><b>AGA.</b> Nay, dear sir!</p>
<p><b>DEL.</b> &#8216;Tis on my hand. <i>(Pressing her hand to his lips, which he had held in his while speaking to Felix.)</i></p>
<p><i>The Demon appears watching them with attention and interest.</i></p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. <i>(Apart.)</i> At first my father&#8217;s countenance was illuminated with pleasure &#8211; but thoughtfulness and sadness have again succeeded &#8211; <i>(Assuming gaiety.)</i> Now must I to labour again. Our [stock of] fuel is nearly exhausted. My time has been lately so occupied I have omitted my task in the forest.</p>
<p><i>Music. &#8211; Felix takes up a hatchet and chops a log of wood.</i></p>
<p><b>AGA.</b> And I, too, have been neglectful &#8211; these flowers of which you are so fond, my dear father, have wither&#8217;d &#8211; they must be replaced &#8211;</p>
<p><i>[Music &#8211; she takes them from the basket &#8211; Felix is busied cutting the wood &#8211; ]</i></p>
<p><b>SAFIE.</b> <i>(At a distance.)</i> Felix!</p>
<p><b>AGA.</b> What voice was that?</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. It cannot be &#8211; no &#8211; it was but fancy!</p>
<p><i>Music resumed. &#8211; Felix chops the log in continuance &#8211; at a similar break in the tune the same voice heard again, nearer.</i></p>
<p><b>SAFIE.</b> <i>(Without.)</i> Felix!</p>
<p><i>No music.</i></p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. That magic sound! Alas! no &#8211; there is no such happiness in store for me!</p>
<p><b>SAFIE.</b> <i>(Without, louder.)</i> Felix! Felix!</p>
<p><i>Music. &#8211; Felix drops the hatchet, rushes forward. &#8211; At the same instant Safie enters, and falls into the arms of Felix &#8211; pronouncing</i> "Felix."</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. &#8216;Tis she! &#8211; Safie! Beloved of my soul! &#8211; Ah! revive!</p>
<p><b>DEL.</b> Safie, the traitor&#8217;s daughter? Impossible!</p>
<p><b>AGA.</b> &#8216;Tis, indeed, our sweet Safie!</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. We never will part more! Father! father! would that you could behold her! It is my dear, lost Safie.</p>
<p><i>Music. &#8211; Safie revives, and crosses to old DeLacey, kneels, and kisses his hand, during which the Demon appears at the little hovel, watching them, and then retires within again.</i></p>
<p><b>DEL.</b> Bless you, my child! where is your father &#8211; where the treacherous friend who devoted us to ignominy?</p>
<p><b>SAFIE.</b> <i>(Rises.)</i> I have fled from him; he would have sacrificed his daughter, loathing the idea that I should be united to one of Christian faith. Sickening at the prospect of again returning to Asia and being immured in a harem &#8211; ill suited to the temper of my soul now accustomed to a nobler emulation &#8211; I &#8211; I have sought the love and protection of my Felix!</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. Faithful girl! Your constancy shall be crowned by eternal love and gratitude.</p>
<p><b>AGA.</b> But Safie, you are fatigued. Come, dear girl, and on my lowly couch, seek repose.</p>
<p><i>Music. &#8211; Safie affectionately kisses and presses DeLacey&#8217;s hand, embraces Felix, crosses back to Agatha, and is led into the cottage by Agatha and Felix.</i></p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. <i>(Who returns with a gun from the cottage-door.)</i> Father, I am wild with joy! &#8211; no longer the sad, pining Felix. The sun of prosperity again gleams on us &#8211; Safie is returned! I am rich! &#8211; happy! But hold! I must procure refreshment for our guest. Our larder is not too much encumbered with provision. I&#8217;ll to the village &#8211; I&#8217;ll cross the forest &#8211; I&#8217;ll hunt, shoot &#8211; and all in ecstasy! Farewell, father! I&#8217;ll soon be back. Farewell!</p>
<p><i>[Music. &#8211; Exit Felix. &#8211; The Demon ventures out, and looks with a kind expression on DeLacey.</i></p>
<p><b>DEL.</b> Good Felix! Now, by the return of Safie will his hopes be rewarded &#8211; yet must he remain in perpetual poverty and unceasing labour. But this instant, did he complain that our store of fuel was consumed &#8211; unless he possessed superhuman strength his day&#8217;s employment must be doubled &#8211; where are my favorite violets?</p>
<p><i>Music. &#8211; DeLacey feels for the Basket which contained them &#8211; the Demon apppears to comprehend his wish, and rushes off.</i></p>
<p><b>DEL.</b> My flower basket not yet replenished. &#8211; My dear children amply repay my former anxious care &#8211; they have toiled for my support thoughout our misfortunes &#8211;</p>
<p><i>Music. &#8211; The Demon re-enters cautiously and tremblingly with a handful of flowers, which he gently places in the basket.</i></p>
<p><b>DEL.</b> Thanks dear Agatha! &#8211; ever watchful of your poor father&#8217;s comfort &#8211;</p>
<p><i>Music. &#8211; DeLacey turns up the stage, and again seats himself on the cottage stool. &#8211; The Demon examines log of wood, takes up hatchet, points to the wood, intimating he understands the use of it &#8211; Agatha appearing at the window &#8211; The Demon rushes off with the hatchet. &#8211; Music ceases.</i></p>
<p><b>DEL.</b> Agatha!</p>
<p><i>Enter Agatha from cottage.</i></p>
<p><b>AGA.</b> Did you call, father?</p>
<p><b>DEL.</b> Sleeps your sweet guest?</p>
<p><b>AGA.</b> Fatigue will soon lull her to repose. I should not have left her had I not thought I heard you call me. Ah, father, some one has punished my negligence by replenishing your basket of violets.</p>
<p><b>DEL.</b> Did you not fill it, Agatha?</p>
<p><b>AGA.</b> No, dear sir. &#8211; Ah, Felix has forestalled me.</p>
<p><i>Exit Agatha into cottage again.</i></p>
<p><b>DEL.</b> [No person has been here since the departure of Felix.] <i>(DeLacey rises and takes up the basket of flowers from the stool. Smelling the violets.)</i> How delightful is the perfume! &#8211; more exquisite because I am debarred the pleasure of beholding these sweet emblems of spring! The touch and scent elevate my spirits! How ungrateful am I to complain! In the contemplation of thee, oh, Nature, the past will be blotted from my memory! &#8211; the present is tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipated joy.</p>
<p><i>Music. &#8211; DeLacey replaces the basket of flowers, and returns to his seat, leaning pensively on his cane. &#8211; The Demon enters with a pile of green faggots with foliage on his shoulders and throws them loosely on the stage. &#8211; Smiles with gratulation at that which he has accomplished. &#8211; Approaches DeLacey, falls flat at his feet, then kneels to him, and is about to press his hand. &#8211; DeLacey feels around him with his cane and hand, without the knowledge of anyone being near him, and seated all the time &#8211; then calls.</i></p>
<p><b>DEL.</b> Agatha! Agatha!</p>
<p><i>Music. &#8211; The Demon instantly retreats into hovel, and Agatha enters from cottoge door.</i></p>
<p>Agatha, child, I pray you lead me in. <i>(Rises from his seat and comes forward.)</i></p>
<p><b>AGA.</b> Yes, father. Good Heavens! why, Felix could not have returned from the forest so quickly? What a quantity of wood!</p>
<p><b>DEL.</b> How?</p>
<p><b>AGA.</b> Here is fuel to last us for a long time. [ &#8211; Surely some kind spirit [watches over us &#8211; or] how could we have been so bountifully supplied? Come, father, to the cottage &#8211; come!</p>
<p><i>Music. &#8211; Agatha leads De Lacy into cottage, afterwards comes forward.</i></p>
<p>&#8211; Frankenstein! vain is the endeavour to drive you from my recollection. Each bird that sings, each note of music that I hear, reminds me of the sweet moments of my former love!</p>
<p class="mediumBoldMaroon">SONG &#8211; AGATHA</p>
<p><i>(Flute accompaniment, behind the scenes.)</i></p>
<p>In vain I view the landscapes round,<br/>
&#160; Or climb the highest hill;<br/>
In vain, in vain, I listen to the sound<br/>
&#160; Of ev&#8217;ry murmuring rill.<br/>
For vain is all I hear or see,<br/>
When Victor dear is far from me. <i>(Thrice)</i><br/>
But hark, hark, hark,<br/>
My love, my love is near,<br/>
His well-known dulcet notes I hear. <i>(Thrice)</i></p>
<p>Oh, yes, my love is near,<br/>
&#160; I hear him in the grove;<br/>
Soon will he be here,<br/>
&#160; And breathe soft vows of love.<br/>
Oh, fly not yet, ye blissful hours,<br/>
&#160; Oh, fly not yet away;<br/>
While love its soft enchanting pours,<br/>
&#160; Prolong, prolong your stay! <i>(Thrice)</i><br/>
Oh, yes, my love is near,<br/>
&#160; I hear him in the grove,<br/>
Soon will he be here,<br/>

<h3>SCENE IV:</h3>
<i>A Wild Forest.</i>
<p><i>Enter Felix, with his gun.</i></p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. Not a shot yet &#8211; and, egad, joy has made my hand so unsteady, that were a fine pheasant to get up, I could not bring it down again. Thy return, sweet Safie, has restored me to existence. When I thought I had lost thee for ever, I was occupied by gloomy thoughts, and neither heeded the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected on the lake; but now my love fills my imagination, and all is enjoyment!</p>
<p class="mediumBoldMaroon">SONG &#8211; FELIX</p>
<p>Thy youthful charms, bright maid, inspire<br/>
&#160; And grace my fav&#8217;rite theme,<br/>
Whose person kindles soft desire,<br/>
&#160; Whose mind secures esteem.<br/>
Oh, hear me then my flame avow,<br/>
&#160; And fill my heart with joy &#8211;<br/>
A flame which taught by time to grow,<br/>
&#160; No time can e&#8217;er destroy.<br/>
My tender suit with smiles approve,<br/>
&#160; And share the sweets of mutual love.</p>
<p>When autumn yields her ripen&#8217;d corn,<br/>
&#160; Or winter, darkening, lowers,<br/>
With tenderest care I&#8217;ll soothe thy morn,<br/>
&#160; And cheer thy evening hours.<br/>
Again, when smiling spring returns,<br/>
&#160; We&#8217;ll breathe the vernal air;<br/>
And still when summer sultry burns,<br/>
&#160; To woodland walks repair &#8211;<br/>
There seek retirement&#8217;s sheltered grove,<br/>
&#160; And share the sweets of mutual love.</p>
<p><i>Felix retires up stage. Enter Frankenstein.</i></p>
<p><b>FRANK.</b> In vain do I seek a respite from these dreadful thoughts &#8211; where&#8217;er I turn my eyes, I expect to behold the supernatural Being! &#8211; to see him spring from each woody recess &#8211; but on, on to Agatha, and repose.</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. A traveller! and surely I know his air and manner. <i>(Comes forward.)</i></p>
<p><b>FRANK.</b> Good stranger, can you direct me to the habitation of old DeLacey?</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. Better than most persons, I trust.</p>
<p><b>FRANK.</b> How! Felix DeLacey!</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. The same! the same! Frankenstein! You know, my friend &#8211; &#8216;tis long since we have met.</p>
<p><b>FRANK.</b> Your strange and sudden disappearance from Paris &#8211;</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. Makes as strange a story, with which I shall not now detain you. Come to our humble cottage. [ &#8211; Ah, Frankenstein, we have been as poor as mice, and our dwelling is not much larger than a trap &#8211; ] Egad! I&#8217;m overjoyed to see you!</p>
<p><b>FRANK.</b> And Agatha?</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. Is queen of the Castle! &#8211; and between ourselves Frankenstein has still a warm corner of her heart for you. Come, we have only to cross the wood. [ &#8211; I&#8217;m in high spirits, my friend &#8211; I&#8217;ve this day recover&#8217;d my mistress &#8211; but that will make another strange story. &#8211; This is indeed a lucky day &#8211; Safie is restored &#8211; and I ramble out to kill a Pheasant, and pop upon a philosopher who is likely to become a brother-in-law &#8211; ]</p>
<p><b>HAM.</b> <i>(Without.)</i> Any good Christians in the neighbourhood?</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. What have we here?</p>
<p><i>Enter Hammerpan, with a long pole, tinker&#8217;s utensils, fire kettle, &amp;c.</i></p>
<p><b>HAM.</b> Real Christians! human beings! Oh, good Gentlemen, have you seen it?</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. It! &#8211; what?</p>
<p><b>HAM.</b> Ah! that&#8217;s it! As I live, I saw it an hour ago in the forest!</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. What do you mean by <i>it?</i></p>
<p><b>HAM.</b> My hair stood on end like mustard and cress, and so will yours when you see it!</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. Get you gone! you are tipsy!</p>
<p><b>HAM.</b> I wish I was. As I take it, you are Master Felix, of the Valley of the Lake; we&#8217;ve done business together before now.</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. I know you not!</p>
<p><b>HAM.</b> I mended your kettle t&#8217;other day. You did me a good turn &#8211; one good turn deserves another &#8211; I&#8217;ll put you on your guard &#8211; the very devil is abroad.</p>
<p><b>FRANK.</b> <i>(Aside.)</i> How!</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. <i>(Laughs.)</i> Ha! ha! ha! You romancing tinker! [ &#8211; and pray how was his worship dressed?</p>
<p><b>HAM.</b> [Dress&#8217;d &#8211; why it was stark undressed all but a cloak.] You may laugh, but the other gentleman don&#8217;t laugh. You may perceive <i>he</i> believes it <i>. (To Frankenstein.)</i> I saw it &#8211; I saw with <i>this one eye</i>.</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. One eye!</p>
<p><b>HAM.</b> Yes, I&#8217;m blind of the other &#8211; a little boy threw a pebble at it, so I&#8217;ve been <i>stone</i> blind ever since, gentlemen. He was ten foot six long, <i>(Holds his pole high up.)</i> with a head of black lanky locks down to his very elbows.</p>
<p><b>FRANK.</b> &#8216;Tis the Demon! <i>(Apart to himself)</i></p>
<p><b>HAM.</b> I lifted up my hammer to strike it but I was so tremulous that I knock&#8217;d my own head instead.</p>
<p><b>FRANK.</b> What did this strange object? <i>(To Hammerpan.)</i></p>
<p><b>HAM.</b> It didn&#8217;t speak to me, nor I to it. I saw it at first in the forest picking acorns and berries &#8211; and then, after it had dispersed our tribe, like a ferret among the rats &#8211; it took a drink at our broth, and burnt its fingers in our fire.</p>
<p><b>FRANK.</b> And what became of this creature?</p>
<p><b>HAM.</b> I wasn&#8217;t curious enough to inquire. My wife was in fits at the sight of the devil &#8211; so I was obliged to keep my one eye upon her.</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. Your one eye has been pretty well employed. Come, come, gipsy, we&#8217;ll cross the wood and see if this man mountain is to be met.</p>
<p><b>HAM.</b> The good genius of wandering tinkers forbid!</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>. <i>(To Frankenstein.)</i> And now, my friend, we&#8217;ll on to the cottage.</p>
<p><b>FRANK.</b> So, so! <i>(Apart.)</i> I will follow ye!</p>
<p><i>(Exeunt Felix and Hammerpan)</i></p>
<p>So! the peasants have already been terrified by the ungainly form! Ambitious experimentalist! The consciousness of the crime I have committed eternally haunts me! I have indeed drawn a horrible curse on my head! He may be malignant, and delight [for its own sake] in murder and wretchedness! a whole country may execrate me as their pest! Every thought that bears towards my baneful project causes my lips to quiver and [my] heart to palpitate. [But, away with these wretched reflections &#8211; ] I must now to the cottage of Felix. Agatha, fairest Agatha, [fairest Agatha,] instead of smiles, your lover will meet you with dark and hopeless despondency! <i>(Exit Frankenstein)</i><br/></p>
