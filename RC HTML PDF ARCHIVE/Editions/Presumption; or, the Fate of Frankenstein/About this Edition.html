Behrendt is George Holmes Distinguished University Professor of English at the University of Nebraska. He has published widely on the Shelleys and on Blake, in addition to authoring numerous studies of relations among the arts.

<p class="bodyText"><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Text and Images<a name="text"> </a></span>: According to its best modern editor, Jeffrey N. Cox, <i>Presumption</i> exists in two primary performing texts. The first is a text called <i>"Frankenstein": A Melo-Dramatic Opera in Three Acts</i>. This is the so-called "Larpent" version, the text that was routinely submitted for scrutiny to John Larpent (1741-1824), whose post as Examiner of Plays was roughly equivalent to that of government censor. The second text appears in a scarce collection called <i>Dick's Standard Plays</i> (c. 1865). The text that appears on this Web site is the editor's own editorial reconstruction from these two sources and is based upon the text published by Jeffrey N. Cox in <i>Seven Gothic Dramas</i>, to which one should turn for the most reliable information about what, precisely, is in one version or another, or both. The editor's aim in developing the present text has been simply to provide an accessible text for the generalist seeking some clear sense of the early stage incarnations of Peake's influential play.</p>
