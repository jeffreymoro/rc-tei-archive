<h4><i>The Rights of Woman</i></h4>
                        <br/>
                        Yes, injured Woman! rise, assert thy right!<br/>
                            Woman! too long degraded, scorned, opprest;<br/>
                            O born to rule in partial Law's despite,<br/>
                            Resume thy native empire o'er the breast!<br/>
                            <br/>
                            Go forth arrayed in panoply divine;<br/>
                            That angel pureness which admits no stain;<br/>
                            Go, bid proud Man his boasted rule resign,<br/>
                            And kiss the golden sceptre of thy reign.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            Go, gird thyself with grace; collect thy store<br/>
                            Of bright artillery glancing from afar;<br/>
                            Soft melting tones thy thundering cannon's roar,<br/>
                            Blushes and fears thy magazine of war.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            Thy rights are empire: urge no meaner claim,--<br/>
                            Felt, not defined, and if debated, lost;<br/>
                            Like sacred mysteries, which withheld from fame,<br/>
                            Shunning discussion, are revered the most.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            Try all that wit and art suggest to bend<br/>
                            Of thy imperial foe the stubborn knee;<br/>
                            Make treacherous Man thy subject, not thy friend;<br/>
                            Thou mayst command, but never canst be free.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            Awe the licentious, and restrain the rude;<br/>
                            Soften the sullen, clear the cloudy brow:<br/>
                            Be, more than princes' gifts, thy favours sued;--<br/>
                            She hazards all, who will the least allow.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            But hope not, courted idol of mankind,<br/>
                            On this proud eminence secure to stay;<br/>
                            Subduing and subdued, thou soon shalt find<br/>
                            Thy coldness soften, and thy pride give way.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            Then, then, abandon each ambitious thought,<br/>
                            Conquest or rule thy heart shall feebly move,<br/>
                            In Nature's school, by her soft maxims taught,<br/>
                            That separate rights are lost in mutual love.<br/>
