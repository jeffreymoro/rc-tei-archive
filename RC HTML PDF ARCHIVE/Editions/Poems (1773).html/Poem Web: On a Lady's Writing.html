    <br/>
    Barbauld's short poem "On a Lady's Writing" is a reading of cultural inscriptions in the materials and processes of handwriting. At first glance, the poem seems to be of small consequence; after all, it simply describes an unnamed woman's handwriting:<br/>

    The one modern critic who has commented on the poem takes the work to task because it "refuses to consider women's writing as anything but 'correct' strokes of the pen" (<a href="/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/on_writing_web/bibliography.html#sha_richard">Sha</a> 111). But no such refusal exists in the poem. To rediscover the complex socio-cultural contexts of the poem is to appreciate how in its six lines Barbauld's poem documents and challenges the nature of bourgeois women's position in social relations in the later eighteenth century through related practices of <a href="/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/illustrations/18thc-writing.html">penmanship</a>, writing, and the <a href="/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/criticism/biblio_conduct_books.html">conduct book</a>.<br/>
    <br/>
    An obvious line of inquiry concerns the identity of "a Lady." Who is she? Many of the works Barbauld included in <cite>Poems</cite> (1773) are addressed to members of her family or to friends associated with the Warrington Academy, where Barbauld's father was an instructor; for example, two poems entitled "<a href="/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/characters.html">Characters</a>" which precede it in <cite>Poems</cite> (1773) have been associated with her future sister-in-law and a cousin. Yet the indefinite article in "a Lady" and the focus on handwriting might suggest that Barbauld is not concerned with a particular person's identity. The translation of a poem about handwriting into a printed form takes the poem away from association with a specific individual towards more general consideration of the practice of writing as one of the many accomplishments a lady need acquire, as she suggests in the sketch likely addressed to her sister-in-law: "Her ready fingers plied with equal skill / The pencil's task, the needle, or the <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/notes/quill_note.html?width=350&height=350">quill</a>." Because Barbauld understood handwriting as a product of social construction, her poem investigates how the discipline of handwriting might empower women, rather than simply encourage them to act with complicity. In the connections that the poem makes between handwriting and character, Barbauld indicates her awareness of how penmanship serves social control, how as Jonathan <a href="/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/on_writing_web/bibliography.html#goldberg_jonathan">Goldberg</a> points out,"training of the hand is not to disturb social relations and hierarchies, but to maintain them" (141).  <a href="/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/on_writing_web/web2.html"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/images/arrowright.gif" align="right" border="0" alt="Next"/></a></td>

        <br/>
        The training of the hand reinforced social relations through specific physical practices. A lady was expected to comport her body with a certain correct carriage; Barbauld recognized its counterpart in the physical act of writing. But these very postures are a product of the body politic. In the sort of prescription of how the body should be disciplined, Barbauld seems well aware of the accompanying political implications of penmanship and what that gendered term suggests about women's place in her culture. <br/>

            <br/>
            In the eighteenth century the dominance of England's mercantile economy was demonstrated in the fact that the English mercantile hand, or English round hand, developed from the Italian hand and promoted in the early eighteenth century by writing masters like George Shelley, master of the Writing School at Christ's Hospital, became popular throughout Europe. To practice this particular form of handwriting signifies an implicit allegiance with Britain's economic power. More than being a poem about graceful handwriting, "On a Lady's Writing" would have women recognize how their potential is simultaneously constrained and empowered by the kind of hand expected of ladies, a simpler form of round hand developed for women.<br/>
            <br/>
            <a href="/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/illustrations/wbrooks.html"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/images/wbrooks_thumb.jpg" width="200" height="149" border="1" alt="Brooks"/></a><br/>
            <br/>
            In an early eighteenth-century copy book William Brooks uses the Italian hand to advertise his skill at teaching the "Ladies of Great Britain" a hand "which as your own I recommend to your choice and practice, being full of Beauty, Ornament and Delight, and Invented for the Sole use and Embellishment of your fair Sex." Brooks makes clear the values inscribed in a woman's hand. "Sole use" may sound like privilege, but it is a marketing ploy that also conveys how women are separated from handwriting that embodies power; "Ornament" betrays how women are seen both as consumable and as consumer, rather than agents in their own right.<br/>
            <br/>
            Yet Barbauld's reference to "Her even lines" suggests that if women were included, they were also contained by a system in which they merely wrote a simplified hand for decorative purposes. Women have the potential to do more than embellish if they can write a round hand that displays "steady temper." Writing about the Renaissance, <a href="/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/on_writing_web/bibliography.html#goldberg_jonathan">Jonathan Goldberg</a> considers the sorts of ideological rifts that the female hand reveals, which for all its regulation, "cannot finally be stabilized in the duplicative regimes of copy. The claims for the extension of literacy--that it will only support the status quo--has its correspondent anxiety--that it will put power in anyone's hand. The anxiety is expressed most evidently through the woman's hand, which needs special policing" (145-6). "On a Lady's Writing" belongs to the thriving culture of the woman of letters, including <a href="/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/illustrations/muses_engraving.html">Bluestocking writers</a>, whose correspondence was collected for public consumption in the early nineteenth century. Without recourse to its contexts, the poem's potential richness is lost to readers. <br/>

                Another matter concerns what the lady was writing using those "correct" strokes. The commonplace book or miscellany which might be shared with others is one venue through which a lady might display her hand. Or she might write a journal. But above all, lady's writing likely means letter writing. Letter writing was a means to engage with the world without violating propriety, and consequently contained potential for women's indirect power. As <a href="/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/on_writing_web/bibliography.html#perry_ruth">Ruth Perry</a> points out, "Letters were the perfect vehicle for women's highly developed art of pleasing, for in writing letters it is possible to tailor a self on paper to suit the expectations and desires of the audience" (69). Barbauld challenges the deployment of this art, which like a lady's hand is a lesser version of how society makes use of letter writing.<br/>
                <br/>
                <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/notes/blair_note.html?width=350&height=350">Hugh Blair</a> suggests in his 1784 observations on Epistolary Writing in his <cite>Lectures on Rhetoric</cite> that "The first requisite, both in conversation and correspondence, is to attend to all the proper decorums which our own character, and that of others, demand" (3.69). But Barbauld's vagueness about what the lady is writing seems deliberate--it is entirely up to the reader to imagine what is being written. The language she uses seems willfully pointed--"Strong as her judgment" implies not only the power of the familiar letter as a private way in which woman might have influence, as she again raises the possibility of unrealized potential.<br/>
                <br/>
                <a href="/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/on_writing_web/chapone.html"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/images/chapone_frontispiece_thumb.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="8" alt=""/></a> The power of the private letter suggests both how women might use writing and how it uses them. Barbauld herself not only practised the familiar letter but, like Mary Wollstonecraft, advocated use of the open letter as political polemic, as seen in her pamphlets on the <a href="http://www.usask.ca/english/barbauld/works/test_acts.html">Test Acts</a>. But if the familiar letter is the more prevalent cultural product of the age, its close alliance to the conduct book (see <a href="/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/related_texts/gregory.html">Gregory's 1774 <cite>A Father's Legacy to His Daughters</cite></a>), which more often than not takes the form of the letter, needs to be considered, especially given the signals the poem sends through its very pointed language. In her 1773 <cite>Letters on the Improvement of the Mind</cite> addressed to her niece, Hester Chapone writes in her Dedication to Elizabeth Montagu that she acknowledges how "some strokes of your elegant pen have corrected these Letters" and she numbers an ability to "write a free and legible hand" among the "indispensable requisites" a lady might obtain (137). Barbauld's poem utilizes a vocabulary of conduct to problematise expectations about a lady's writing. And her background as a <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/notes/unitarianism_note.html?width=350&height=350">Dissenter</a> influences how in spite of what seems a conservative perspective for women, she cannot separate women from a more general pursuit of individual rights. Concepts like judgment, freedom, and how one comports oneself within the social sphere have to do with issues of rights and responsibilities that extend beyond the superficial forms of conduct or even Bluestocking culture to embrace a politics against exclusion. <a href="/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/on_writing_web/bibliography.html#keach_william">William Keach</a> suggests of Barbauld, "Dissent has taught her to claim a critical freedom for herself that has to coexist both
                with intellectual and political solidarity and with the continuing relegation of women to the realm of nuturing domesticity" (50). In the final line Barbauld makes most clear the relation between writing and conduct and the fact that if manners are formed and footsteps guided, they depend on social expectations. The poem displays a sort of irony in that Barbauld reminds the reader of the discrepancy between what women are capable of and what society expects women to do with their writing. <br/>

                    "On a Lady's Writing" might help us consider the vexed question of Barbauld's politics. It is worth revisiting Mary Wollstonecraft's inclusion of the poem in <a href="/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/illustrations/on_writing_fr_facsimile.html"><cite>The Female Reader</cite></a> (1789), a cultural project intended "to imprint some useful lessons on the mind, and cultivate the taste at the same time." In spite of their antagonism elsewhere, Wollstonecraft demonstrates her understanding of the poem's challenge to taste. At the same time we need to remember another past cultural practice that reclaims the printed page to writing. It is significant that a copy of the poem appears in an early nineteeth-century miscellany produced in manuscript by a lady, where it is titled "On Miss C-'s Writing," which is now held in the U. of Chicago library. Barbauld's modern editors, William McCarthy and Elizabeth Kraft, suggest they have no knowledge of the provenance of the manuscript or of the identity of Miss C. But the copy represents Barbauld's point. The poem's renaming and appearance in an example of a lady's handwriting embody the very negotiation between public and private with which Barbauld is concerned. Presumably the creator of the miscellany copied the poem because it reminded her of her friend Miss C. In so doing the lady had the opportunity to consider what the poem signifies about the power of writing by applying it to a particular personal context. If such cues were available to women in the late eighteenth century, modern readers might need to ask what sorts of cultural practices are captured in Barbauld's description of writing that is "Correct though free, and regular though fair."<br/>
                    <br/>
                    We may not place a value on handwriting in the respect that Barbauld's age did, but the poem reminds us of the link between writing and literacy. From her perspective as a <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/notes/unitarianism_note.html?width=350&height=350">Dissenting</a> thinker Barbauld asks ladies to use their literacy to change society's inscription of middle-class women. In that respect the poem may be applied to remind us of how we too might question our own use of literacy to explore how as inheritors of the Enlightenment our own culture, depending upon how we use it, has potential to contain or to free us. <br/>
