            <p>MY SEA-HERMITAGE.</p>
            <p><i>Inscribed to Capt. C. Biden,<br/>
                E.I.C.S. Commander of the Ship Victory.</i></p>
            <p>by Mrs. Fletcher.</p>
            <p>(<i>Late Miss Jewsbury.</i>)</p>
            <p>Swinging in my cot at ease,<br/>
                Yet a wanderer o'er the seas,<br/>
                Seas that never lead may sound,&#8212;<br/>
                Seas that have for man no ground;&#8212;<br/>
                Depths whose wonders call for faith,<br/>
                Never known till known in death,<br/>
                Till, unto the drowner's eye<br/>
                Knowledge blends with agony;<br/>
                And too soon, too sadly, he<br/>
                Fathometh the mystery,<br/>
                One, one with Eternity!<br/>
                O thou element, whose band<br/>
                Is alone thy Maker's hand,<br/>
                By thy fullness never spent,<br/>
                But for Him, omnipotent!<br/>
                By thy length and breadth of span,<br/>
                By thy tides since Time began,<br/>
                By thy heaving, and, oh! more,<br/>
                By thy dread and solemn roar;<br/>
                By thy depths that nought may stir,<br/>
                Mighty, mighty sepulchre!&#8212;<br/>
                By the ravage thou hast wrought,<br/>
                By the sorrow thou hast brought<br/>
                Unto human life and thought;&#8212;<br/>
                Ay, by all thy power and pride,<br/>
                When thou wast, and nought beside,<br/>
                Save the heaven thou couldst not drown,<br/>
                And the arm that kept thee down;&#8212;<br/>
                Thee, I name, with spirit bent,<br/>
                But for God, omnipotent!<br/>
                Yet a wanderer o'er thy waves,<br/>
                (Call them liquid land of graves)<br/>
                Frail as feather in the breeze,<br/>
                I am in my cot at ease!&#8212;<br/>
                All thy dreaded storms forgot,<br/>
                All thy strength as it were not,<br/>
                Heaving with thee, as a child<br/>
                With its mother's pulses mild,<br/>
                Looking on thy billows' sway<br/>
                As that child on lambs at play;<br/>
                Not a shore from east to west,<br/>
                Not a fear within my breast,<br/>
                And my cabin full of all<br/>
                That may lessen sense of thrall;<br/>
                Books, read last amid green hills<br/>
                &#160;With their poetry of rills;&#8212;<br/>

                Birds that singing in their cage<br/>
                Make my ocean-hermitage<br/>
                Have a sound and look of hours,<br/>
                That once tread on moss and flowers:<br/>
                Tranquil I, and happy they,<br/>

                Yes, but better things than these<br/>
                Make me have a heart at ease;<br/>
                Better even than the knowing<br/>
                That our ship is swiftly going,<br/>
                With her frame and <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/oceanides/notes/tackling.html?width=500&height=400">tackling</a> good,<br/>

                Better even than the knowing,<br/>
                That her ruler's heart is glowing<br/>
                With each brave and kindly thought<br/>
                Tempered as a sailor's ought.<br/>
                Yes 'tis something more than these<br/>
                Maketh <i>home</i> upon the seas;&#8212;<br/>
                Name it, ye who know the worth<br/>
                Of the nearest friend on earth;<br/>
                Name it; ye who know the love<br/>
                Of the nearer friend above!</p>
