            <p>SUNSET AND NIGHT.</p>
            <p><i>By Mrs. Fletcher.</i></p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; BEAUTIFUL !   O beautiful!<br/>
                When his blaze of glory done,<br/>
                In the Tropics sinks the Sun!<br/>
                Not, as at his noon, untended<br/>
                By a veiling cloud; or blended,<br/>
                As at morn, with shadows dim,<br/>
                Waiting for their light from him:&#8212;<br/>
                But, in a pavilion rare,<br/>
                Of amber, and empurpled air,<br/>
                Golden dews, and vapours fair,<br/>
                Girt about with gorgeous clouds,<br/>
                Vast and towering, yet in crowds,<br/>
                Each some form of glory taking;<br/>
                Each some splendid vision waking.<br/>
                Sea and Heaven, depth and height,<br/>
                Met in such harmonious light,<br/>
                Gemmed with colours so intense<br/>
                In their soft magnificence,<br/>
                That the painter&#8217;s spirit dies,<br/>
                Loving what his art defies,<br/>
                And the raptured vision sees<br/>
                Paradise upon the seas!<br/></p>
            <p>There, in that cloud-garden glows<br/>
                All the richness of the rose;<br/>
                There, meandering, seem to run<br/>
                Rivers that have washed the Sun,<br/>
                Or, instead of common mould,<br/>
                Wandered over beds of gold.<br/>
                There, are dark stupendous rocks,<br/>
                Riven as with thunder shocks;<br/>
                A gigantic granite band,<br/>
                Frowning on some lovely land,<br/>
                Strength in Desolation&#8217;s hand!<br/>
                There, again, are milder seen,<br/>
                And amongst them, intervene<br/>
                Level plains of boundless span,<br/>
                Broken, as by caravan<br/>
                With its winding dusky line,<br/>
                That the eye may scarce define,<br/>
                Merchant, camel, slave, and steed,<br/>
                Bending on with laden speed<br/>
                To some city far before,<br/>
                Such as once on India's shore<br/>
                Dazzled many a conqueror&#8217;s eyes,<br/>
                Till he drew and won the prize.<br/>
                Treasuries of wealth and bloom,<br/>
                Deserts now, of wreck and gloom;<br/>
                Passed away, as pass ere long<br/>
                Yon glowing clouds, this feeble song.<br/></p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Beautiful! O beautiful!<br/>
                Night upon the Tropic skies!<br/>
                Whether the full Moon arise<br/>
                Ere the gorgeous West be pale,<br/>
                And she shines, as if a veil<br/>
                Golden tissued, and a zone<br/>
                Grained with fire, were round her thrown;<br/>
                All her clouds of simple white,<br/>
                With the sun&#8217;s own color <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/oceanides/notes/dight.html?width=500&height=400">dight</a>,<br/>
                Yet amid that lustrous keen<br/>
                Flecked with such delicious green,<br/>
                Ocean wears an emerald sheen.<br/></p>
            <p>Lovely too, at midnight&#8217;s noon,<br/>
                'Tis to see the waning Moon,<br/>
                Rise above a ridge of cloud,<br/>
                Fair, yet spectral, wan and proud;<br/>
                Holding in her radiant rim<br/>
                Her bright former self, now dim,<br/>
                Traced unto the gazer&#8217;s sight<br/>
                Only by a thread of light;<br/>
                While a thousand lesser stars,<br/>
                And the two of strength and love,<br/>
                <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/oceanides/notes/venusjove.html?width=500&height=400">Venus, and broad-flashing Jove</a>,<br/>
                Shine, and cast a light below,<br/>
                As if they usurped her glow.<br/>
                A silver light on peaceful waters,<br/>
                Too often dark with storm and slaughters.<br/></p>
            <p>Thus to wander night and day,<br/>
                Through the Tropics&#8217; sunny way,<br/>
                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Beautiful! O Beautiful!</p>
