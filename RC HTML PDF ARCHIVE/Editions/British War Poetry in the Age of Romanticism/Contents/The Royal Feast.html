    <p>1807.5<br/><b>The Royal Feast</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Hull Packet</i> (August 11, 1807)<br/></p>
    <p>As brothers Fred. and Alexander<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    At Tilsit dined with their <i>Commander</i>,<br/>
    Forgetful of their warlike toils,<br/>
    Their cares, discomfitures, and foils—<br/>
    Napoleon view'd each royal guest,<br/>
    And thus his anxious mind exprest;<br/>
    "With <i>England's</i> George to grace this <i>fete</i>,<br/>
    My transports would be quite complete!"</p>
