    <p>1795.11<br/><b>Anna's Complaint;<br/>
    Or the Miseries of War; written in the Isle of Thanet, 1794<br/></b> "Mrs. Moody"<br/><i>The Universal Magazine</i>, XCVI (March 1795), pp. 205-206<br/><i>The Scots Magazine</i>, LVII (May 1795), p. 314</p>
    <p>                     A Ballad.</p>
    <p>On Thanet's rock, beneath whose steep,<br/>
    Impetuous rolls the foaming deep,<br/>
    A lowly maid to grief consign'd,<br/>
    Thus pour'd the sorrows of her mind:</p>
    <p>And while her streaming eyes pursue<br/>
    Of Gallia's cliffs the misty view,<br/>
    Accurst she cries that guilty shore,<br/>
    Whence William shall return no more.</p>
    <p>Thou, cruel war, what hast thou done!<br/>
    Thro' thee the mother mourns her son,<br/>
    The orphan joins the widow's cries,<br/>
    And torn from love—the lover dies.</p>
    <p>Ah, William! wherefore didst thou go<br/>
    To foreign lands to met the foe?<br/>
    Why, won by war's deceitful charms,<br/>
    Didst thou forsake thy Anna's arms?</p>
    <p>Alas! full little didst thou know,<br/>
    The monster war doth falsely show;<br/>
    He decks his form with pleasing art,<br/>
    And hides the daggers in his heart.</p>
    <p>The music of his martial band,<br/>
    The shining halberd in his hand;<br/>
    The feather'd helmet on his head,<br/>
    And coat so fine of flaming red.</p>
    <p>With these the simple youth he gains,<br/>
    And tempts him from his peaceful plains;<br/>
    And by this pomp was William led,<br/>
    The dangerous paths of war to tread.<br/><br/>
    Fair-sounding words my love deceiv'd,<br/>
    The great ones talk'd, and he believ'd,<br/>
    That war would fame and treasure bring,<br/>
    That glory call'd to serve the king.</p>
    <p>But wise men say, and sure it's true,<br/>
    That war is theft and murder too;<br/>
    Yet had my William thought it so,<br/>
    He had not gone to fight the foe.</p>
    <p>How blest could Anna see him now,<br/>
    With shoulders bending o'er the plough;<br/>
    Toiling to sow his native fields,<br/>
    And reap the harvest Virtue yields.</p>
    <p>Then happier lot would both betide,<br/>
    A bridegroom he, and I a bride,<br/>
    But these fond hopes return no more,<br/>
    For dead he lies on yonder shore.</p>
    <p>O in that battle's dismal day,<br/>
    When thou, dear youth, didst gasping lay,<br/>
    Why was not then thy Anna there,<br/>
    To bind thy wounds with softest care?</p>
    <p>To search with speed the nearest spring,<br/>
    To thy parch'd lips the water bring,<br/>
    To wash with tears thy bleeding face,<br/>
    And sooth thee with a last embrace?</p>
    <p>But thou, amid a savage train,<br/>
    Wert mingled among heaps of slain,<br/>
    Without one friend to hear thy sighs,<br/>
    Or Anna's hand to close thine eyes.</p>
    <p>Thou, cruel war, what hast thou done!<br/>
    Thro' thee the mother mourns her son,<br/>
    The orphan joins the widow's sighs,<br/>
    And torn from Anna—William dies.</p>
    <p> </p>
