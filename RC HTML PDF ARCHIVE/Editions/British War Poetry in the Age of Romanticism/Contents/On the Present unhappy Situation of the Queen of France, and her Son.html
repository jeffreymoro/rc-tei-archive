    <p>1793.10<br/><b>On the present unhappy Situation of the QUEEN of FRANCE, and her Son.</b><br/>
    Charlotte Smith<br/><i>The Universal Magazine</i>, XCIII (August 1793), pp. 147-148<br/><i>The Gentleman's and London Magazine</i> (September, 1793), p. 496<br/></p>
    <p>(From 'The Emigrants,' a Poem, by Mrs. Charlotte Smith.)<br/></p>
    <p>Unhappy France!<br/>
    If e'er thy lilies, trampled now in dust,<br/>
    And blood-bespotted, shall again revive<br/>
    In silver splendour, may the wreath be wov'n<br/>
    By voluntary hands; and Freemen, such<br/>
    As England's self might boast, unite to place<br/>
    The guarded diadem on <i>his</i> fair brow<br/>
    Where Loyalty may join with Liberty,<br/>
    To fix it firmly.—In the rugged school<br/>
    Of stern Adversity so early trained,<br/>
    His future life, perchance, may emulate<br/>
    That of the brave Bernois <a href="#1">[1]</a>, so justly called<br/>
    The father of his people.—<br/>
    Innocent pris'ner, most unhappy heir<br/>
    Of fatal greatness, who art suff'ring now<br/>
    For all the crimes and follies of thy race;<br/>
    Better for thee, if o'er thy baby brow<br/>
    The real mischief never had been held:<br/>
    Then, in a humble sphere, perhaps content,<br/>
    Thou hadst been free and joyous on the heights<br/>
    Of Pyrennean mountains, shagg'd with woods<br/>
    Of chestnut, pine, and oak: as on these<br/>
    Is yonder little thoughtless shepherd lad.</p>
    <p>____________While I gaze<br/>
    On his gay vacant countenance, my thoughts<br/>
    Compare with his obscure, laborious lot,<br/>
    Thine, most unfortunate, Imperial boy!<br/>
    Who round thy fallen prison daily hear'st<br/>
    The savage howl of murder, as it seeks<br/>
    Thy unoffending life: while sad within<br/>
    Thy wretched mother, petrified with grief,<br/>
    Views thee with stony eyes, and cannot weep!—<br/>
    Ah! much I mourn thy sorrows, hapless Queen!<br/>
    And deem thy expiation made to Heav'n<br/>
    For every fault, to which Prosperity<br/>
    Betray'd thee, when it placed thee on a throne,<br/>
    Where boundless power was thine, and thou wert rais'd<br/>
    High (as it seem'd) above the envious reach<br/>
    Of Destiny!—Whate'er thy errors were,<br/>
    Be they no more remember'd; tho' the rage<br/>
    Of Party swell'd them to such crimes, as bade<br/>
    Compassion stifle every sigh that rose<br/>
    For thy disastrous lot—More than enough<br/>
    Hast thou endur'd; and ev'ry English heart,<br/>
    Ev'n those that highest beat in Freedom's cause,<br/>
    Disclaim, as base, and of that cause unworthy,<br/>
    The vengeance or the fear that makes thee still<br/>
    A miserable Prisoner!</p>
