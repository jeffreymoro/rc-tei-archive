    <p>1793.22<br/><b>Effects of War</b><br/>
    "Pacificus"<br/><i>The Cambridge Intelligencer</i> (November 16, 1793)</p>
    <p>With glittering arms I saw the soldiers march<br/>
    With hearts elate, and footsteps light as air,<br/>
    Vaunting of victories their arms would gain:<br/>
    Eager they fill'd the transports waiting near,<br/>
    To waft them to the hostile tented field,<br/>
    And from the vessel's side with loud huzza,<br/>
    Hail'd with a cheerful voice the crouded shore,<br/>
    And bade their much dejected friends farewel.<br/>
    Dejection too prophetic of their fate!<br/>
    Post, after post, soon brings a heavy tale,<br/>
    Though gloss'd with victory, fatal to the peace<br/>
    Of fathers, mothers, children, wives, and friends.<br/>
    Dead, is the hand that long with labour fought<br/>
    To feed the little offspring hovering round:<br/>
    Vanish'd the hope that sooth'd a parent's age;<br/>
    Sunder'd the ties of faithful wedded love,<br/>
    And the dear long-tried friend forever gone.<br/>
    Such is the curse of victory!—Now review<br/>
    The horrors that attend an adverse fate.<br/>
    The conquerors are become the conquer'd now;<br/>
    See them retreat before a foe, enrag'd<br/>
    By unprovok'd assault, and numerous wrongs.<br/>
    Their marches harrass'd by th' advancing van,<br/>
    And loss sustain'd of men, of stores, and arms.<br/>
    Famine and pestilence new horrors add,<br/>
    And fainting by the way leave many a wretch<br/>
    To linger out the sad remains of life,<br/>
    Hopeless of better fate, than, that some foe,<br/>
    May kindly cut its thread, and end his pain.<br/>
    A shatter'd remnant reach once more the shore,<br/>
    From whence in healths full tide they gaily fail'd,<br/>
    Once more their footsteps press their native land,<br/>
    And like a cordial draught through every vein,<br/>
    New vigour flows, and warms their languid hearts.<br/>
    Impatient now each seeks his long-lost home,<br/>
    To cheer the breast that in his absence pines,<br/>
    And in the fond embrace each soon forgets,<br/>
    The various sorrows they have long endur'd.<br/>
    Not e'en the sickly face and mangled limb,<br/>
    Checks the pure joy that glows at his return.<br/>
    Terror had long suggested he was lost:<br/>
    He is once more at home, and all seems well.</p>
    <p>If aught can damp <i>his</i> joy, it is the tale,<br/>
    The mournful tale, that he is doom'd to tell,<br/>
    Of his lost comrades, in the fatal field,<br/>
    Blasting the lingering hope, that yet surviv'd,<br/>
    And bade the anxious bosom daily watch,<br/>
    For <i>his</i> return, who was its only joy.</p>
    <p>    Long should reflection in a Monarch's mind<br/>
    Dwell on such themes. Then strongly there impress'd,<br/>
    War in its various horrors would appear:<br/>
    And if a spark of virtue in him lives,<br/>
    Nature must shrink from such a thought accurs'd,<br/>
    As plunging nations in offensive wars!</p>
    <br/>
