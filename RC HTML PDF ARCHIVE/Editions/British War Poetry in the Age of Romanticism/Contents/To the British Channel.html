    <p>1807.12<br/><b>To the British Channel</b><br/>
    "R. Bloomfield"<br/>
    [Robert Bloomfield] <a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXVII (December, 1807), p. 1149<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (September 9, 1808)<br/><i>The Political Register and Repository of Fugitive Verse</i>, VI (1811), pp. 366-367<br/></p>
    <p>Roll, roll thy white waves, and enveloped in foam,<br/>
        Pour thy tides round the echoing shore;<br/>
    Thou guard of Old England—my country, my home!<br/>
        And my soul shall rejoice in the roar!<br/></p>
    <p>Though high-fronted valour may scowl at the foe,<br/>
        And with eyes of defiance advance;<br/>
    'Tis <i>thou</i> has repell'd desolation and woe,<br/>
        And the conquering legions of France.<br/></p>
    <p>'Tis good to exult in the strength of the land,<br/>
        That the flow'r of her youth are in arms;<br/>
    That her lightning is pointed, her jav'lin in hand,<br/>
        And arous'd the rough spirit that warms;<br/></p>
    <p>But never may that day of horror be known,<br/>
        When these hills and these valleys shall feel<br/>
    The rush of the phalanx by phalanx o'erthrown,<br/>
        And the bound of the thundering wheel.<br/></p>
    <p>The dread chance of battle, its blood and its roar,<br/>
        Who can wish in his senses to move;<br/>
    To plant the foul fiend on Britannia's own shore<br/>
        All sacred to peace and to love?<br/></p>
    <p>Hail—glory of Albion! ye fleets and ye hosts<br/>
        I breathe not the tones of dismay:<br/>
    In valour unquestioned, still cover your coasts,<br/>
        But may Heav'n keep the slaughter away.<br/></p>
    <p>Thou gem of the ocean, that smil'st in thy pow'r,<br/>
        May thy sons prove too strong to be slaves!<br/>
    Yet let them not scorn in the dark-fated hour<br/>
        To exult in their rampart of waves.<br/><br/>
    The nations have trembled—have cower'd in the dust,<br/>
        Even the Alps heard the conqueror's song,<br/>
    When the Genius of Gaul, with unquenchable thirst,<br/>
        Push'd her eagles resistless along!<br/></p>
    <p>And still they advance, and the nations must bleed,<br/>
        Then sing, O my country, for joy;<br/>
    The girdle of ocean, by Heav'n was decreed<br/>
        To protect what the sword would destroy.<br/></p>

                <p><span class="footnote_text">1. Born on a farm in Suffolk, Bloomfield (1766-1823) was apprenticed to his uncles, a tailor and a shoemaker. Self-taught by reading the poetry columns and magazines, Bloomfield wrote <i>The Farmer's Boy</i>, published in March, 1800. Twenty-six thousand copies were sold in less than three years. In 1802, the Duke of Grofton became his patron. Bloomfield is referred to favorably by Byron in <i>English Bards and Scots Reviewers</i>.</span>
