    <p>1805.4<br/><b>The Muffled Drum</b><br/>
    John Mayne <a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, XLVIII (July 1805), p. 51<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXV (July 1805), p. 656<br/><i>The Monthly Mirror</i>, XX (August 1805), p. 126<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (August 17, 1805)<br/></p>
    <p>Ah me! how sorrowful and slow,<br/>
        With arms revers'd, the soldiers come—<br/>
    Dirge-sounding trumpets, full of woe,<br/>
        And, sad to hear, the Muffled Drum!<br/></p>
    <p>Advancing to the House of Pray'r,<br/>
        Still sadder flows the dolesome strain;<br/>
    Ev'n Industry forgets her care,<br/>
        And joins the melancholy train!<br/></p>
    <p>O! after all the toils of war,<br/>
        How blest the brave man lays him down!<br/>
    His bier is a triumphal car—<br/>
        His grave is—glory and renown!<br/></p>
    <p>What tho' nor friends nor kindred dear,<br/>
        To grace his obsequies, attend?<br/>
    His comrades are his brothers here,<br/>
        And ev'ry hero is his friend!<br/></p>
    <p>See Love and Truth, all woe begone;<br/>
        And beauty, drooping in the crowd—<br/>
    Their thoughts intent on him alone<br/>
        Who sleeps for ever in his shroud!<br/></p>
    <p>Again, the trumpet slowly sounds<br/>
        The Soldier's last Funeral Hymn:—<br/>
    Again the muffled drum rebounds,<br/>
        And ev'ry eye with grief is dim!<br/><br/>
    The gen'rous steed, which late he rode,<br/>
        Seems, too, its master to deplore;<br/>
    And follows to his last abode<br/>
        The warrior—who returns no more!<br/></p>
    <p>For him, far hence, a mother sighs,<br/>
        And fancies comforts yet to come!<br/>
    He'll never bless her longing eyes—<br/>
        She'll only hear the Muffled Drum!<br/></p>

He went to London in 1787 where he became proprietor and joint editor of <i>The</i><i>Star</i>. His long poem, <i>Siller Gun</i>, expanded over a period 1777-1836, was considered by Walter Scott to be superior to anything of Ferguson and close to Burns (<i>Lady of the Lake</i>, v. 20.).</span>
