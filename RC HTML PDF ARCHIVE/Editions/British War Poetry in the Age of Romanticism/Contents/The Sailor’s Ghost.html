    <p><i>From Poems by</i> ANDREW SCOTT, <i>Bowden</i>.<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/></p>
    <p>The busy world was hush'd in sleep,<br/>
        And clear the night stars twinkling shone,<br/>
    As forth fair Mary went to weep,<br/>
       Beneath the pale beams of the moon.<br/></p>
    <p>In Nelson's fleet her lover sail'd<br/>
        Her mind, harass'd with boding fear,<br/>
    Did only whisper something ail'd<br/>
        Her absent tar, her sailor dear.<br/></p>
    <p>Her pillow, by the death-watch, long,<br/>
        With constant clink, had marr'd her rest<br/>
    Thus omens gave presages strong,<br/>
        Of tidings soon, to her unblest.<br/></p>
    <p>A dreary dream the fair one dream'd:<br/>
        As on her couch last night she lay;<br/>
    Bedrench'd in blood her William seem'd,<br/>
        Pale was his cheek, and cold as clay.<br/></p>
    <p>Some distance off, her father's home,<br/>
        Which not far from the sea-beach stood,<br/>
    Where, jutting o'er the briny foam,<br/>
        A rigged rock o'erhangs the flood.<br/></p>
    <p>Thither, where thickets form a shade,<br/>
        And shelter from night's chilly breeze,<br/>
    To weep her woes, the lovely maid<br/>
        Sought night's deep solitude, and these.<br/></p>
    <p>"What if, by dauntless Nelson led,<br/>
        My love has lately fac'd the foe?<br/>
    What if, in honour's blood-stain'd bed,<br/>
        His lifeless clay this night lies low?<br/></p>
    <p>What if, by deadly ball propell'd,<br/>
        Or vengeful cutlass trenching deep,<br/>
    His bright expressive eyes are seal'd,<br/>
        For ever clos'd in lasting sleep?<br/></p>
    <p>Where fishes skim the ooze beneath,<br/>
        And huge sea-monsters darkly roam.—<br/>
    Ah me! I fear that now in death<br/>
        My darling gluts some living tomb<br/></p>
    <p>"Yes," from the beach, reply'd a voice,<br/>
        'Twas William's very voice she ken'd;<br/>
    "Ah, Mary! now our wonted joys,<br/>
        And promis'd bliss, is at an end.<br/><br/>
    For cold in death my body lies,<br/>
        Transpierc'd with wounds beneath the flood,<br/>
    Where fell the brave, no more to rise—<br/>
        Oh this has been a day of blood!<br/></p>
    <p>Yet conquest to my country falls;<br/>
        Nor has our blood been shed in vain;<br/>
    Still Britain, in her wooden walls,<br/>
        Maintains her empire o'er the main.<br/></p>
    <p>Their naval pride upon the main<br/>
        No more Britannia's foes may boast,<br/>
    But, wailing o'er their numbers slain,<br/>
        They weep this night a navy lost.<br/></p>
    <p>When first the foe appear'd in sight.<br/>
        And all our decks for battle clear,<br/>
    In haste I did my Mary write;<br/>
        'Twas well I did, my fate was near.<br/></p>
    <p>And from my locks the ringlet shorn<br/>
        Therein I careful did inclose,<br/>
    That this to thee might hence be borne,<br/>
        If I my life should chance to lose.<br/></p>
    <p>Then take, dear maid, what Henry gives,<br/>
        When him in port you hap to see,<br/>
    For he, my faithful messmate, lives,<br/>
        To bear my last sad boon to thee."<br/></p>
    <p>Then light as air the spirit pass'd,<br/>
        (For by this time the grey cock crew,)<br/>
    And cry'd, "Sweet maid, I hie to rest.<br/>
        Adieu my Mary, hence adieu!"<br/></p>
    <p>Then Mary tore her yellow hair,<br/>
        Big heav'd her breast with heavy woe,<br/>
    And from the rock, in wild despair,<br/>
        She sunk down in the deeps below.<br/></p>
