    <p>1794.13<br/><b>The Farmer and Labourer</b><a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Scots Magazine</i>, LVI (August 1794), pp. 473-474</p>
    <div class="indent15">
    <p>Farmer.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Thomas, awake! the drum and fife I hear;<br/>
    Unusual sounds! my body quakes with fear!<br/>
    What distant yells are those? A woman's shriek!<br/>
    'Tis no recruiting party's drunken freak.<br/>
    Fly hence, and leave your mid-day's cheering dose—<br/>
    The sound of war is hostile to repose.<br/>
    Thomas, arise! yon thatch is now in flames,<br/>
    And from the pillag'd farm, run swift the dames.<br/>
    Too late your lev'ling plans you'll now repent;<br/>
    Behold the curse of slothful discontent.<br/>
    Away and gain your cot; your babes, your wife,<br/>
    Implore your rescuing hand, to risk your life;<br/>
    These hapless victims at your conscience lie—<br/>
    Rebel thou art, as rebel thou must die.</p>
    <div class="indent15">
    <p>Labourer.</p>
    </div>
    <p>    Alas! my throbbing heart forbodes some ill;<br/>
    Through all my veins unusual horrors thrill.<br/>
    The soldier well I ween'd would prove no foe,<br/>
    For Liberty I thought was bliss, not woe.</p>
    <div class="indent15">
    <p>Farmer.</p>
    </div>
    <p>    Exchange no word, your reason comes too late;<br/>
    Behold the troops advance—submit to fate.<br/>
    Had you, mistaken man, no murmur spread,<br/>
    But till'd the soil to earn your daily bread,<br/>
    Your cant of Liberty and equal Right<br/>
    Had never challeng'd Heaven's wrathful might;<br/>
    At eve your cot in guiltless peace would rest;<br/>
    Your wife, your children, in their fire be blest.<br/>
    Nor daily pittance ever yet was scant,<br/>
    When industry supply'd bare simple want,<br/>
    Fell riot, drunkenness, the alehouse score,<br/>
    Fill'd your weak brain with wild delusion's roar,<br/>
    Your thoughts from toil, from daily labour turn'd,<br/>
    And all the slothful man with foul disorder burn'd.<br/></p>
    <div class="indent15">
    <p>Labourer.</p>
    </div>
    <p>    Ah! well-a-day! I thought the time would come,<br/>
    When all the land would rise at sound of drum.<br/>
    Dick thought the same, and Thomas said as how<br/>
    'Twas very hard all day to go to plough,<br/>
    And vow'd that squire Bumkin was no better;<br/>
    Or parson Fussock fam'd for learned letter,<br/>
    Than us poor harmless volks whom God design'd<br/>
    With flesh and blood to be of human kind:<br/>
    But, zure, I must confess he had his pot,<br/>
    And seem'd as thos he had himself forgot.</p>
    <div class="indent15">
    <p>Farmer.</p>
    </div>
    <p>    Peace, umskul, peace! were all as idly prone,<br/>
    Instead of bread, many must be fed with stone:<br/>
    All men, 'tis true, are made of flesh and blood;<br/>
    But brains like thine are not of self-same mud.<br/>
    God's providence distinction made; for thou<br/>
    Canst shew no wisdom but in team or plough;<br/>
    And, couldst thy knavish holiday take place,<br/>
    The strongest club would give the weakest chace:<br/>
    Till devastation reign'd through all the land,<br/>
    And man, supine, be lost to all command.<br/>
    Is this the golden harvest thou would'st reap?<br/>
    Nor peasant sows, nor shepherd tends his sheep.<br/>
    Pluck from the thorn the berry and the crab,<br/>
    And the rough skin prefer to woollen drab.<br/>
    Then, lobby, take thy lesson from mad France,<br/>
    And view the consequence of random chance.<br/>
    See o'er the champaign land a barren soil,<br/>
    The cot forsaken, and the farm in spoil;<br/>
    The peasants murder'd, or by rapine torn,<br/>
    From peaceful homes, in wand'ring clans forlorn,<br/>
    To fell banditti turn'd, embru'd in blood,<br/>
    Their crests with crimson'd motto, 'Public good.'</p>
    <p>    See where the stately castle aw'd the plain—<br/>
    Its lofty walls now boast their strength in vain;<br/>
    Allegiance sworn, its vassals now rebel,<br/>
    With demon rage like fiends let loose from hell,<br/>
    The Chieftain's crime was birth and high descent,<br/>
    The walls give way, the mansion straightway rent,<br/>
    On the sharp pike the mangled head is rais'd,<br/>
    And the damn'd deed is by the nation prais'd.<br/>
    The sound of liberty, and rights of man,<br/>
    In blood reverberates from clan to clan;<br/>
    Where law has sanction'd, and where justice ties,<br/>
    Confusion whelms all forms, all properties;<br/>
    And chaos reigns among the sons of men,<br/>
    Till God's avenging arm restores fair Peace again.</p>
