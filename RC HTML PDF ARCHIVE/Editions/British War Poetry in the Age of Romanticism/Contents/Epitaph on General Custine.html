    <p>1793.17<br/><b>Epitaph on General Custine</b><a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Cambridge Intelligencer</i> (October 5, 1793)</p>
    <p>Here lies an headless General—(I'll say <i>dead</i>)<br/>
    As many <i>living</i> Generals want an head.<br/>
    One morn, whilst dressing (be that morn forgot)<br/>
    He turn'd his orders into <i>Papillotes</i><a href="#2">[2]</a><br/>
    His side-locks curl'd so smart; but poor Custine,<br/>
    Remember'd not he had an head between.<br/>
    Fate came, the slightest orders to recall,<br/>
    And with the curls, alas! took head and all.</p>
