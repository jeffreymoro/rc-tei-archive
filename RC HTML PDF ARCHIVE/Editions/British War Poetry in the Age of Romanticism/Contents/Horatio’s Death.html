    <p>1805.10<br/><b>Horatio's Death</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (November 22, 1805)<br/></p>
    <p>Reclined on a rock of her sea-beaten Isle,<br/>
        BRITANNIA survey'd the profound;<br/>
    Saw FREEDOM and VIRTUE and INDUSTRY smile;<br/>
            In transport she gaz'd all around—<br/>
    While the murmurs, arising from OCEAN'S dark Waves,<br/>
    Hoarse sounded—"BRITANNIA reigns Queen of the Waves."<br/></p>
    <p>    To hear once again the brave acts of her sons,<br/>
            Determin'd to fly o'er the ball:<br/>
        No shores, whether friendly or hostile, she shuns;<br/>
            Their fame had extended o'er all;<br/>
    And oft in her flight, as in Ocean she laves,<br/>
    The Tritons still hail her as Queen of the Waves.<br/></p>
    <p>    But Chief, midst her heroes, wherever she goes,<br/>
            She hears her HORATIO'S proud name;<br/>
        FAME'S numberless voices in concert arose,<br/>
            Nor sufficed his great deeds to proclaim—<br/>
    They sounded, "the Hero her enemies still braves;<br/>
    "BRITANNIA alone reigns the Queen of the Waves."<br/></p>
    <p>    Her course, overjoy'd at his praises, she steers,<br/>
            To see her brave Son, o'er the main;<br/>
        When off Cape Trafalgar, exulting she hears<br/>
            The Hero's victorious again!<br/>
    And tells the proud Despot to rule o'er his slaves,<br/>
    Nor strive with his Queen for the Crown of the Waves.<br/></p>
    <p>    With grief soon she learn'd that her Hero had died,<br/>
            The tears gush'd in floods from her eyes;<br/>
        His deeds were too bright for a mortal, she cried,<br/>
            Then bore him aloft to the skies.<br/>
    The warriors that fell, still exclaim from their graves,<br/>
    BRITANNIA for ever reigns Queen of the Waves."</p>
