    <p>1806.9<br/><b>Song</b><br/>
    “Mr. Dibdin”<br/>
    [Charles Dibdin]<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (November 8, 1806)<br/></p>
    <p>Ye lads who wish well to the spot of your birth,<br/>
    The most independent and happy on earth,<br/>
    It rests with your selves that in future you be,<br/>
    As you ever yet HAVE been—united and free.<br/></p>
    <p>It depends on yourselves that no hypocrite rob<br/>
    This land of its rights by the threats of a mob;<br/>
    You ne'er will give way to the bluster and noise<br/>
    Of Imposters, who CALL themselves Liberty Boys!<br/></p>
    <p>The men who from harm would your Country save,<br/>
    Are not bullies nor blackguards, but men truly brave:<br/>
    The one who for years has made Freedom's cause smile,<br/>
    The other who first broke the line at the nile.<br/></p>
    <p>The People's real Champions, believe me, are those<br/>
    Who within and without doors dare combat your foes.<br/>
    Give your Votes<a href="#2">[2]</a> to the true friends of Liberty Hall,<br/>
    Who scorn to rob Peter by paying of PAUL.<br/></p>
    <p>What more can I say your good will to inspire,<br/>
    Towards those who both burn with true freedom's best fire?<br/>
    I don't mean the man who your suffrages mocks,<br/>
    But the friends and companions of NELSON and FOX!<br/></p>
    <p>Then fill up your glasses, my lads, while I sing<br/>
    The Navy, HOOD, SHERIDAN, and our good KING;<br/>
    May Englishmen never with nonsense be cramm'd,<br/>
    And BONY'S supporters all die and be damn'd.</p>
