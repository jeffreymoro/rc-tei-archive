    <p>1797.2<br/><b>The Depredations of the Rats</b><br/>
    "D. W. D."<br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, XXXI (January 1797), pp. 38-39<br/></p>
    <p>A Ludicrous Tale.</p>
    <p>Shenstone, in merry vein, hath told<br/>
    How once these vermin were so bold<br/>
        A college-room to seek:<br/>
    Tho' meat serve vermin less refin'd<br/>
    These rats sought what improv'd the mind,<br/>
        Therefore digested Greek.<br/></p>
    <p>They fed on Homer, Pindar too<br/>
    And other authors, old and new,<br/>
        Fam'd in the class of learning;<br/>
    Yea, both in prose and poetry,<br/>
    In logic and geometry,<br/>
        These rats were all-discerning.<br/></p>
    <p>Tho' Shenstone's rats were rats of taste,<br/>
    Tho' they all other rats surpass'd<br/>
        In learning and condition;<br/>
    Yet will we find among our rats,<br/>
    Long undisturbed by dogs or cats,<br/>
        The greatest politician.<br/></p>
    <p>Know then, that in an upper room,<br/>
    Where oft the host was wont to come<br/>
        To read the affairs of State,<br/>
    At night, when all were hush'd in sleep,<br/>
    These rats would from the wainscot creep,<br/>
        And range in quest of meat.<br/></p>
    <p>One night they ran across the floor,<br/>
    And squalling search'd the closet o'er,<br/>
        No <i>meat</i>, alas! was found;<br/>
    Then one, of fruitless labour tir'd,<br/>
    At length to higher aims aspir'd<br/>
        And leap'd up from the ground.<br/></p>
    <p>This rat, in eager search of pelf,<br/>
    Survey'd with prying eyes each shelf,<br/>
        That nothing might escape her;<br/>
    But here was neither cheese, nor meal,<br/>
    Nor mutton, beef, nor pork, nor veal,<br/>
        Nay, nought, alas! but <i>paper</i>.<br/></p>
    <p>The rest ascended from the floor,<br/>
    And gain'd the shelf above the door,<br/>
        Where lay Paine's Rights of Men;<br/>
    Here did these pilfering rats devour<br/>
    As much sedition in an hour<br/>
        As Tom could write in ten.<br/><br/>
    Poor Jacobin! well might he weep,<br/>
    Well might wild dreams confuse his sleep<br/>
        Whilst they consum'd the libel,<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    The book which he so much approv'd,<br/>
    The book which he had always lov'd<br/>
        Much better than the Bible.<br/></p>
    <p>Addresses, pamphlets, fell a prey,<br/>
    The newspapers of yesterday<br/>
        They ate; nay, what is further,<br/>
    These hungry pilferers thought no more<br/>
    Of gnawing Couriers<a href="#2">[2]</a> by the score<br/>
        Than Frenchmen think of murther.<br/></p>
    <p>Such havoc mark'd their steps until<br/>
    Each greedy rat obtain'd his fill<br/>
        Of politics and news;<br/>
    Cram'd with sedition, down they came,<br/>
    And with them fell a picture frame<br/>
        Which they could not refuse:<br/></p>
    <p>Its glass was broken by the fall,<br/>
    But mark, my friend! this was not all;<br/>
        The paper still was whole;<br/>
    Soon these corroding vermin tore<br/>
    The print, but, being fill'd before,<br/>
        They lodg'd it in their hole.<br/></p>
    <p>This was an emblem of the tree<br/>
    Of Gallia's mimic liberty,<br/>
        Which never bore good fruit;<br/>
    How can we then with justice blame<br/>
    This troop of rats which thither came<br/>
        To cut off branch and root?<br/></p>
    <p>But when they back return'd again,<br/>
    Alas! the influence of Tom Paine<br/>
        Began its usual works;<br/>
    No wonder.—can th' effect be good<br/>
    To any who devour the food<br/>
        Wherein rebellion lurks?<br/><br/>
    The rats in discord spent the night,<br/>
    The master, at the approach of light,<br/>
        Came bustling to his room;<br/>
    He enter'd, look'd around confus'd,<br/>
    Then shook his head, while thus he mus'd:<br/>
        "How wretched is my doom<br/></p>
    <p>"Prints, pamphlets, Paine's true Rights of Men,<br/>
    "And all the labours of his pen,<br/>
        "All, all are eaten up!<br/>
    "'Tis plain enough these thievish vermin<br/>
    "Last night did all at once determine<br/>
        "On politics to sup."<br/></p>
    <p>Ten sharp spring-traps were then prepar'd,<br/>
    In which these rats might be ensnar'd;<br/>
        For soon the troubled master<br/>
    Had plotted their destruction, whence<br/>
    He thought to reap some recompence<br/>
        For this bewail'd disaster.<br/></p>
    <p>Next night the vermin trotted out<br/>
    In quest of prey, and ran about;<br/>
        But mark their sudden fall!<br/>
    The baits invite them, sad mishaps!<br/>
    They tasted, but—off went the traps,<br/>
        And guillotin'd them all.<br/></p>
    <p>Had they not meddled with Tom Paine,<br/>
    'Tis ten to one they'd not been slain;<br/>
        Of this no more we'll mention;<br/>
    But only say, sedition's bait.<br/>
    With its sure offspring, evil fate,<br/>
        Cut off the whole <i>convention</i>.<br/></p>
    <p>Thus perish'd both, the writings first,<br/>
    And next the rats; which were the worst<br/>
        Let Reason's voice determine:<br/>
    By Reason 'twill not be denied,<br/>
    The books deserv'd to be destroy'd<br/>
        Much rather than the vermin.<br/></p>
