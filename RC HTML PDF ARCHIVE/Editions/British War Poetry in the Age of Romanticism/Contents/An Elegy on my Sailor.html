    <p>1795.24<br/><b>An Elegy on my Sailor</b><br/>
    John Gabriel Stedman<br/><i>The Weekly Entertainer</i> (1795)<a href="#1">[1]</a></p>
    <p>Loud sounds the tempest—peals of thunder roar,<br/>
    Tremendous lightnings flash from shore to shore.<br/>
    Seas dash the shaking rocks, seas mount the flaming sky,<br/>
    And elements convuls'd—speak dissolution nigh.<br/>
    Such scenes as these (while tossing on the waves,<br/>
    True to his duty still) the manly sailor braves.<br/>
    Such was my boy,<a href="#2">[2]</a> (whose eyes could never weep<br/>
    But for his neighbours' woes)—now swallow'd in the deep.<br/>
    O agonizing pain! pain never felt before,<br/>
    My manly boy, my John, my sailor, is no more.<br/>
    Still let me mourn with hope,—and God adore,<br/>
    With hope to see my sailor once again,<br/>
    Floating on seas of bliss,—thro' the azure main,<br/>
    Till then, a short farewell, my lovely boy.<br/>
    Thy shipmates' darling, and thy father's joy.<br/>
    Yet one small comfort soothes (while doom'd to part,<br/>
    Sweet gallant youth!) thy parent's broken heart.<br/>
    No more thy tender frame, thy blooming age,<br/>
    Shall be the sport of ocean's turb'lent rage.<br/>
    No more thy olive-beauties on the waves,<br/>
    Shall be the scorn of such European slaves,<br/>
    Whose optics, blind to merit, ne'er could spy<br/>
    That sterling worth could bloom beneath a western sky.<br/>
    No more, my dear!—no more—while such were scar'd,<br/>
    Undaunted shalt thou rock upon the yard.<br/>
    There, while the silver moon gleam'd thro; the gale,<br/>
    With manly skill and courage hand the sail.<br/>
    When fame, who scann'd the value of her tar,<br/>
    Did make thee shine on board a man of war,<br/>
    With honour,—while with equal glory fir'd,<br/>
    To please a parent, brother, friend, thou e'er aspir'd,<br/>
    Till death, rentless death (none can withstand)<br/>
    To cut thy cable—gave the last command.<br/>
    Now soar, my angel! to thy Maker's shrine,<br/>
    There meet that prize due to such worth as thine.<br/>
    Fly, gentle shade, fly to that blest abode,<br/>
    There view thy mother—and adore thy God.<br/>
    There, O my boy! on that celestial shore,<br/>
    O may we gladly meet, and part no more.</p>
