    <p>1794.9<br/><b>The Field of Battle</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Gentleman's and London Magazine</i> (May 1794), pp. 271-272 <a href="#1">[1]</a></p>
    <p>Faintly bray'd the battle's roar,<br/>
        Distant, down the hollow wind;<br/>
    Panting terror fled before,<br/>
        Wounds and death were left behind.</p>
    <p>The war-fiend curs'd the sunken day,<br/>
        That check'd his fierce pursuit too soon;<br/>
    While, scarcely lighting to the prey,<br/>
        Low hung, and lour'd, the bloody moon:</p>
    <p>The field, so late the hero's pride,<br/>
        Was now with various carnage spread;<br/>
    And floated with a crimson tide,<br/>
        That drench'd the dying and the dead!</p>
    <p>O'er the sad scene of dreariest view,<br/>
        Abandon'd all to horrors wild,<br/>
    With frantic step, Maria flew;<br/>
        Maria, sorrow's early child!</p>
    <p>By duty led, for every vein,<br/>
        Was warm'd by Hymen's purest flame;<br/>
    With Edgar o'er the wintry main<br/>
        She, lovely faithful wanderer, came.</p>
    <p>For well she thought a friend so dear<br/>
        In darkest hours might joy impart;<br/>
    Her warrior, faint with toil might chear,<br/>
        Or soothe her bleeding warrior's smart.</p>
    <p>Though look'd-for long—in chill affright;<br/>
        (The torrent bursting from her eye,)<br/>
    She heard the signal for the fight—<br/>
        While her soul trembled in a sigh—<br/><br/>
    She heard, and clasp'd him to her breast,<br/>
        Yet scarce could urge th' inglorious stay;<br/>
    His manly heart the charm confest—<br/>
        Then broke the charm and rush'd away!</p>
    <p>Too soon, in few but deadly words,<br/>
        Some flying straggler breath'd to tell,<br/>
    That, in the foremost strife of swords,<br/>
        The young, the gallant, Edgar fell!</p>
    <p>She pres'd to hear—she caught the tale—<br/>
        At ev'ry sound her blood congeal'd!<br/>
    With terror bold—with terror pale,<br/>
        She sprung to search the fatal field.</p>
    <p>O'er the sad scene, in dire amaze,<br/>
        She went—with courage not her own—<br/>
    On many a corpse she cast her gaze—<br/>
        And turn'd her ear to many a groan!</p>
    <p>Drear anguish urged her to press<br/>
        Full many a hand, as wild she mourn'd:<br/>
    Of comfort glad, the drear caress<br/>
        The damp, chill, dying, hand return'd.</p>
    <p>Her ghastly hope was well nigh fled—<br/>
        When, late, pale Edgar's form she found,<br/>
    Half buried with the hostile dead,<br/>
        And bor'd with many a grisly wound;</p>
    <p>She knew—she sunk—the night-bird scream'd,<br/>
        The moon withdrew her troubled light,<br/>
    And left the fair, tho' fall'n she seem'd,<br/>
        To worse than death—and deepest night!</p>
