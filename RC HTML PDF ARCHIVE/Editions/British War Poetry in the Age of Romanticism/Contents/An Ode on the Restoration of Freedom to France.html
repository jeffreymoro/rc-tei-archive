    <p>1793.1<br/><b>An Ode on the Restoration of Freedom to France</b><br/>
        Anon<br/><i>The Gentleman's and London Magazine</i>, January, 1793, p. 48</p>
    <p><br/>
        Unfold, father Time, thy long records unfold,<br/>
        Of noble achievements accomplish'd of old;<br/>
        When men by the standard of Liberty led,<br/>
        Undauntedly conquer'd, or chearfully bled:<br/>
        But now 'mid the triumphs these moments reveal<br/>
        Their glories all fade, and their lustre turns pale,<br/>
        While France rises up and proclaims the decree,<br/>
        That tears off their chains, and bids millions be free.<br/><br/><br/>
        As spring to the fields, or as dew to the flow'rs;<br/>
        To the earth parch'd with heat, as the soft dropping show'rs,<br/>
        As health to the wretch that lies languid and wan,<br/>
        Or rest to the weary, is Freedom to man:<br/>
        Where Freedom the light of her countenance gives,<br/>
        There only he triumphs, there only he lives;<br/>
        Then seize the glad moment and hail the decree,<br/>
        That tears off their chains, and bids millions be free.<br/><br/><br/>
        Too long had oppression and terror entwin'd,<br/>
        Those tyrant-formed chains that enslav'd the free mind;<br/>
        While dark superstition with nature at strife,<br/>
        For ages had lock'd up the fountains of life;<br/>
        But the daemon is fled, the delusion is past,<br/>
        And reason and virtue have triumph'd at last;<br/>
        Then seize the glad moment and hail the decree,<br/>
        That tears off their chains, and bids millions be free.<br/><br/><br/>
        France, we share in the rapture thy bosom that fills,<br/>
        While the genius of Liberty bounds o'er thine hills;<br/>
        Redundant henceforth may thy purple juice flow,<br/>
        Prouder wave thy green woods, and thine olive trees grow!<br/>
        While the hand of philosophy long shall entwine,<br/>
        Blest emblem, the laurel, the myrtle, the vine;<br/>
        And heav'n thro' all ages confirm the decree,<br/>
        That tears off their chains, and bids millions be free.</p>
