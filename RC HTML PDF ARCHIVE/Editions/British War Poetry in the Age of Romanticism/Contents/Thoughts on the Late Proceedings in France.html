    <p>1793.25<br/><b>Thoughts on the Late Proceedings in France</b><br/>
    "Eliza"<br/>
    [Eliza Daye?]<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXIII (1793), iv</p>
    <p>Ye garlands, wove with Fancy's flowers,<br/>
    Farewel! Thou Muse of pensive hours,<br/>
        While peace is torn from weeping years,<br/>
    Teach me to tell, in mournful songs,<br/>
    How Men of Rights wrought mighty wrongs,<br/>
        And Nations fill'd with tears!<br/>
    How chill'd the patriot virtues stood<br/>
        When their loud champions spurn'd their laws,<br/>
    Stain'd the astonish'd land with blood,<br/>
        And dar'd to call it Freedom's cause!</p>
    <p>Indignant, generous passions rise;<br/>
    Soft Pity lifts her dewy eyes.<br/>
        Wonder alone no more is found,<br/>
    While Vice its hydra-head can rear<br/>
    In tiger-visag'd Roberspierre,<a href="#2">[2]</a> [sic]<br/>
        And Danton<a href="#3">[3]</a> ivy-crown'd.<br/>
    Santerre! ye thousands! guards to Death!<br/>
        Wide ye extend one tyrant's reign,<br/>
    For whom still spreads contagious breath,<br/>
        The baneful family of PAINE.</p>
    <p>Rises for kings a deeper sigh?<br/>
    As men no more do monarchs die;<br/>
        To undistinguish'd dust they turn;<br/>
    Them, woes or joys, distress or please,<br/>
    And preys to murder or disease,<br/>
        Their friends, their kindred, mourn.<br/>
    Yet blasts, which slender shrubs have broke,<br/>
        Unmov'd the forest-trees may bear;<br/>
    While the rude storm that rends the oak<br/>
        All the troubled grove must share.</p>
    <p>Say, have the storms which rent a throne<br/>
    Its sovereigns overwhelm'd alone?<br/>
        Has their wide sphere its rage withstood?<br/>
    Our hearts, if grief compell'd to know,<br/>
    Through narrow circles spread their woe,<br/>
        Kings empires mourn in blood.<br/>
    This—Hist'ry tells of former days;<br/>
        This—now the anxious moments mourn;<br/>
    And, oh! the forfeits life repays<br/>
        Till Peace with her fair train return.</p>
    <p>O, God of armies, hear our prayer!<br/>
    Incline the victor's heart to spare;<br/>
        Let conscience seal the murderer's doom.<br/>
    As Bosworth and Philippi boast,<br/>
    May Richard's dreams and Caesar's ghost<br/>
        In battle overcome.<br/>
    Hope beams through interposing hours,<br/>
        And Gallia's injur'd lord is seen<br/>
    Leading to empyreal bowers<br/><i>    The spirit of his slaughter'd queen.</i></p>
    <p>From dungeons deep, thro' murder'd fame,<br/>
    Magnanimous the sufferer came:<br/>
        Thro' savage Joy's insulting breath<br/>
    She pass'd serenely to the grave,<br/>
    Smil'd at the freedom<a href="#4">[4]</a> Frenchmen gave,<br/>
        And sov'reign shone in death.<br/>
    Martyr at Friendship's holy shrine,<br/>
        Fair Lamballe hails to Heav'n her queen.<br/>
    Cazotte!<a href="#5">[5]</a> can its best joys be thine<br/>
        Till there thy matchless child be seen?</p>
    <p>Naked of good, yon gulph so near,<br/>
    Does Marat's shivering shade appear?<br/>
        Uncall'd, so stain'd, by Cordé sent!<br/>
    Oh! could her hand those stains erase!<br/>
    It took his time, Heav'n's gift for grace,<br/>
         Beyond the grave were such means lent.<br/>
    But check, my Muse, this daring flight,<br/>
        While distant wonders round thee throng;<br/>
    Shrink silent from the awful sight,<br/>
        And sighing end thy sorrowing song.</p>
