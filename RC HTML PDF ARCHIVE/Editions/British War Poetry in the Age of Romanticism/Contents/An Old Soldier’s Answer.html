    <p>1809.14<br/><b>An Old Soldier's Answer</b><br/>
    “A. Z.”<br/><i>The Poetical Magazine</i> (1809), pp. 133-134<br/></p>
    <p>"Cease, vain complainer, check those dastard sighs,<br/>
        Thy Country calls thee, and thy King commands:<br/>
    Shall Gallic infidels," the vet'ran cries,<br/>
        'Plunder thy sheep-folds, and lay waste thy lands?<br/>
    Go, seize with manly grasp thy polish'd blade,<br/>
    Nor curse the artizan by whom 'twas made.<br/></p>
    <p>"What time thy faithful watch-dog growls alarms,<br/>
        Bold dost thou meet the plund'rers of thy flocks:<br/>
    Shall Anna then, be sever'd from thine arms;<br/>
        Thy babes be dash'd against the blood-stain'd rocks;<br/>
    And thou nor hear their cries, nor heed their tears?<br/>
    Rouse, rouse thee, Henry, from such coward fears."<br/></p>
    <p>Fire-flashing vengeance darting from his eyes,<br/>
        Quick springs young Henry from his mossy bed;—<br/>
    "Perish each dastard thought!" he boldly cries,<br/>
        "Lead me, ere yet one British soul has bled—<br/>
    Lead me, good vet'ran, to th' invaded coast,<br/>
    And Henry's single arm shall prove an host."<br/></p>
    <p>
    <i>Devonshire, May 30, 1809.</i>
