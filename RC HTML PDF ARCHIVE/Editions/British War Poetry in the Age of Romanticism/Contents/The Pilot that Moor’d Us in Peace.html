    <p>1802.8<br/><b>Song<br/>
    The Pilot that Moor'd Us in Peace</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXII (August 1802), pp. 756-757<br/><i>The Monthly Mirror</i>, XIII (June 1802), pp. 419-420<br/></p>
    <p>If we honour the pilot that weather'd the storm,<br/>
        And ne'er can our justice and gratitude cease,<br/>
    Shall the sight of the harbour our hearts fail to warm?<br/>
        No—here's to the pilot that moor'd us in peace!<br/></p>
    <p>For the chance of new warfare Ambition may sigh,<br/>
        And Party hostilities strive to renew;<br/>
    To Wisdom, that nation to nation could tie,<br/>
        The blessings of Europe are honestly due.<br/></p>
    <p>And shall not his merits then Britons revere,<br/>
        Who went to the helm, at his Sovereign's command—<br/>
    A Pilot who prov'd he could steadily steer,<br/>
        And the vessel secure from the storm and the strand?<br/></p>
    <p>Who, when gloom and dejection hung over the State,<br/>
        As the ORB THAT PRESERV'D US its radiance withdrew,<br/>
    Brought the ship into port, through the perils of fate,<br/>
        Unsully'd her flag, and in safety her crew.<br/></p>
    <p>Exulting, impetuous, on Glory we gaze,<br/>
        And, caught by War's triumphs, scarce think of its woes;<br/>
    But the pause of Reflection its horrors displays,<br/>
        And the heart of humanity pants for repose.<br/></p>
    <p>So, ADDINGTON,<a href="#1">[1]</a> proudly as Britons we burn,<br/>
        On viewing the laurels by Conquest assign'd,<br/>
    But with nobler delight to thy olive we turn,<br/>
        As the symbol of happiness shar'd by mankind.<br/></p>
    <p>O take then—for honour with spirit maintain'd;<br/>
        For counsels, by judgment and prudence matur'd:<br/>
    O take, for the peace which thy wisdom has gain'd,<br/>
        The thanks of an empire whose rights are secur'd!<br/></p>
    <p>And O! if the value of concord we prize,<br/>
        And with that the blessings of life may increase;<br/>
    The respect of the good, and the praise of the wise,<br/>
        Will point to the Pilot that moor'd us in Peace!</p>
