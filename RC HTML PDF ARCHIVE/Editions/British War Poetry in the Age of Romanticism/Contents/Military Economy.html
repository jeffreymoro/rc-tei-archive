    <p>1808.16<br/><b>Military Economy</b><br/>
    William George<br/><i>The Monthly Mirror</i>, IV (September, 1808), p. 184<br/></p>
    <p>                                       I.<br/></p>
    <p>Our <i>soldiers</i> of late—'twas when muffins were dear,<br/>
    Economy bade without <i>powder</i> appear;<br/>
    The plan was approved of, but yet, in good sooth,<br/>
    It took from the ranks all the <i>flour</i> of our youth!<br/></p>
    <p>                                      II.<br/></p>
    <p>But now, to abridge both their trouble and care,<br/>
    Their locks are all shorn—not a <i>White-lock</i> is there!<br/>
    And as to appearance, with all due submission,<br/>
    I think <i>losing</i> their hair a wondrous <i>addition</i>!<br/></p>
    <p>                                     III.<br/></p>
    <p>Our Britons, like Samson, as somewhere one reads,<br/>
    Have no need of <i>locks</i> to <i>secure</i> their brave deeds;<br/>
    For let all our foemen in myriads assail,<br/>
    'Tis certain our soldiers will never <i>turn tail</i>!<br/></p>
    <p>                                     IV.<br/></p>
    <p>Tho' curtail'd their ranks, 'tis their character due,<br/>
    In beating the French, that they still <i>keep their cue</i>;<br/>
    And no doubt their attempts with success will be sped,<br/>
    For the French can ne'er injure a <i>hair of their head!</i><br/></p>
    <p>                                     V.<br/></p>
    <p>Some troops are <i>light arm'd</i> in the white "tented field,"<br/>
    While some are <i>light-finger'd</i>, and others <i>light-heel'd;</i><br/>
    But ours, when <i>light-hearted</i> are most to be dreaded,<br/>
    And not a whit less now they all are <i>light-headed</i>!<br/><br/>
                                         VI.<br/></p>
    <p>May freedom's full harvest be gather'd by Spain!<br/>
    May Corsican vermin attempt it in vain!<br/>
    May the daughters of Britain, secur'd from alarms,<br/>
    Receive their rich <i>crops</i> with outstretch'd grateful arms!</p>
    <br/>
