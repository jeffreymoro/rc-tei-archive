    <p>1798.11<br/><b>On a Learned Acquaintance<br/>
    Turning Soldier<br/></b> "Dr. Trotter, Physician to the Fleet"<br/>
    [Thomas Trotter, MD]<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, XXXIV (December 1798), pp. 404-405.<br/></p>
    <p>In Imitation of Horace's Ode to Iccius, L. I. Od. 29.</p>
    <p>    My learned friend I now behold,<br/>
    Equipp'd for sharing Spanish gold;<br/>
    With tow'ring crest and martial air,<br/>
    Long Whiskers—what a face of hair!<br/>
    His charger, honest Yorkshire's breed,<br/>
    And well he fits the prancing steed:<br/>
    Then bow, ye proud Directors, bow,<br/>
    Whom Austria's bands could never cow;<br/>
    And when he frowns, or moves his clutch,<br/>
    Go seek your swamps, ye trembling Dutch.<br/></p>
    <p>    But when thy arm has wrought the fall<br/>
    Of some remorseless bloody Gaul,<br/>
    What gayest of Parisian dames,<br/>
    For pointed darts and am'rous flames,<br/>
    Shall turn to you her wishful eyes,<br/>
    A victor thou, and she thy prize?<br/>
    If Tallien, what an host of charms!<br/>
    Long ankle, shoulders bare, and naked arms!<br/><br/>
        You want a valet? chuse at pleasure,<br/>
    Around your throng the Etat-Major;<br/>
    All grinning for old English fare,<br/>
    'Yclept th' army d'Angleterre.<br/>
    Or to the Tribune cast thine eyes,<br/>
    And see the speaker gape and rise,<br/>
    With all a Marat's logic grace,<br/>
    A tyger's heart, a monkey's face.<a href="#2">[2]</a><br/>
    His speech the bulletins record,<br/>
    "Honourable mention," every word.<br/>
    Tho' here the orator presumes,<br/>
    A tonsor he, and vends perfumes;<br/>
    How pert, how frisk he enters in!<br/>
    How glib he sweeps the yielding chin!<br/>
    Murmurs!—'twas but the bristling hair;<br/>
    Applauses!—your mustaches stare.<br/></p>
    <p>    What wonders then shall give surprize?<br/>
    What new-born monsters meet our eyes?<br/>
    Shall the fam'd Nile, more famous now,<br/>
    From wreathes that circle Nelson's brow,<br/>
    To Abyssinia backwards course,<br/>
    And bear fresh glories to his source?<br/>
    Shall Thames than Gravesend flow no higher,<br/>
    And leave all London town in mire?<br/>
    Since you those classic vales desert,<br/>
    Nor leave them with an aching heart:<br/>
    Quit bowers and academic groves,<br/>
    And walks where science fondly roves,<br/>
    Dear seats that woo the Muse to play,<br/>
    Where Flora might with Darwin stray;<br/>
    For gorget, sash, and pomp of war,<br/>
    And cap that marks the stern hussar;<br/>
    For tented fields, where cannons rattle,<br/>
    And trumpets mock the groans of battle.<br/></p>
    <p>    We watch'd your morn serenely fair,<br/>
    And flowers and blossoms op'ning there;<br/>
    And fondest wishes, hopes so gay,<br/>
    Ne'er dream'd of this unwelcome day.</p>
