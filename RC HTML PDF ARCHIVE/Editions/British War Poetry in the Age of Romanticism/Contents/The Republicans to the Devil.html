    <p>1794.10<br/><b>Song<br/>
    The REPUBLICANS to the DEVIL.</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXIV (June 1794), p. 558<br/><i>The Gentleman's and London Magazine</i> (July 1794), pp. 386-387</p>
    <p>Tune, "To Anacreon in Heaven."</p>
    <p>To Satan in Hell, where he sat on his Throne,<br/>
        A few Rebels from Britain preferr'd their petition,<br/>
    That he for his friends would Republicans own,<br/>
        And proclaim them, his fav'rite sons of sedition;<br/>
                For this was their aim,<br/>
                Wherever they came,<br/>
        To set all in confusion, the world in a flame:<br/>
    And they begg'd he'd instruct them now best to convey<br/>
    Wealth, Glory, and Freedom, from Britain away.<br/></p>
    <p>My friends, Satan cries, you are welcome to hell:<br/>
        'Tis a jubilee here when the world is in trouble;<br/>
    Each Daemon rejoices when people rebel,<br/>
        But, when a King bleeds, their triumph is double.<br/>
                Hark, Paris does ring,<br/>
                Ca Ira<a href="#1">[1]</a> they sing;<br/>
        Like them, dip your hands in the blood of your King:<br/>
    Go join the Convention, you'll quickly convey<br/>
    Wealth, Glory, and Freedom, from Britain away.<br/></p>
    <p>Great Sir, they replied, we approve of your plan,<br/>
        Each virtue we'll banish, each truth we'll disown;<br/>
    France, in her fury, we'll join hand in hand,<br/>
        Hurl our God from his temple, the King from his throne:<br/>
                Then back let us fly,<br/>
                In transports of joy,<br/>
        When our Sans-Culottes friends shall to help us<br/>
                    draw nigh.<br/>
    We'll join the Convention, and quickly convey<br/>
    Wealth, Glory, and Freedom, from Britain away.<br/></p>
    <p>Then Neptune rose on Britain's fair strand,<br/>
        And declar'd to repulse them, he'd readily join;<br/>
    Whilst <i>York</i> and his <i>Heroes</i> defend them by land,<br/>
        The conquest at sea shall be Howe's and be mine.<br/>
                Then let them draw near,<br/>
                It soon will appear,<br/>
        That Britons for ever are strangers to fear.<br/>
    They'll soon trim those rascals, who hope to convey<br/>
    Wealth, Glory, and Freedom, from Britain away.<br/></p>
    <p>Stern Justice cry'd out, Your plan, my friends, alter;<br/>
        Your arms never stain with so wretched a foe;<br/>
    Tis mine to dispatch them; then, shewing a halter,<br/>
        Cried <i>Inevitabilis Restis</i>,<a href="#2">[2]</a> you know.<br/>
                O'er each rebel's head<br/>
                My halter I'll spread,<br/>
        And my sons from their fury no danger shall dread.<br/>
    Whilst a rope holds each rascal, who strives to convey<br/>
    Wealth, Glory, and Freedom, from Britain away.<br/><br/>
    Then Britons arise, and, without more delay,<br/>
        Let each Loyal Soul put his hand to his glass,<br/>
    Here's <i>The KING—may God bless him; Amen, Boys, Huzza—<br/>
        Huzza Boys—Again</i>; with three cheers let it pass.<br/>
                Whilst thus we agree,<br/>
                Let our song ever be,<br/>
        May Britons be Loyal, United, and Free:<br/>
    May a rope hold each rascal, who strives to convey<br/>
    Wealth, Glory, and Freedom, from Britain away.</p>
