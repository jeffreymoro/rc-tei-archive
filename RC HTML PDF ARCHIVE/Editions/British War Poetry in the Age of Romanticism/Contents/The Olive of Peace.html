    <p>1801.9<br/><b>The Olive of Peace</b><br/>
    “J. H. L. Hunt"<br/>
    James Henry Leigh Hunt<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (October 15, 1801)<br/></p>
    <p>By J. H. L. Hunt,<br/></p>
    <p>Author of Poems, Called ‘Juvenilia.’"</p>
    <p>Now sheath'd is the Sword that was wild as the blast:<br/>
    The Tempest of Slaughter and Terror is past;<br/>
    Old ALBION her Neighbour all smilingly hails—<br/>
    For the OLIVE of PEACE blooms again in our Vales!<br/>
                              Beam on the day,<br/>
                              Thou Olive gay:<br/>
                              "Matchless is he<br/>
                              Who planted thee;<br/>
        And mayst thou like him immortal be!"<br/></p>
    <p>Divinest of Olives, O, never was seen<br/>
    A bloom so enchanting, a verdure so green!<br/>
    Sweet, sweet do thy Beauties entwiningly smile<br/>
    In the Vine-tree of France and the Oak of our Isle!<br/>
                              Beam on the day,<br/>
                              Thou Olive gay, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>Long, long did thy envied Exotic delay,<br/>
    'Till the voice of HUMANITY charm'd thee away;<br/>
    And here, ever here mayst thou bloom in repose,<br/>
    As firm as our Oak-tree, and gay as the Rose!<br/>
                              Bloom on the day,<br/>
                              Thou Olive gay, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>Let ALCIDES his Poplar of Majesty prize,<br/>
    And VENUS her Myrtle exalt to the skies:<br/>
    FRANCE and ALBION excell all the Gods of old Greece—<br/>
    For they crown their wise heads with the OLIVE of PEACE!<br/>
                              Bloom on the day,<br/>
                              Thou Olive gay, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>The delicate Lily may gracefully mount,<br/>
    And the Pink all her charms with the Rainbow recount;<br/>
    Green, green is the Olive on ALBION'S brow,<br/>
    And the Lily and Pink to the Olive must bow!<br/>
                              Bloom on the day,<br/>
                              Thou Olive gay, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>Thou Olive divine, may Eternity's Sun<br/>
    Beam warm where thy roots thro' the ages shall run;<br/>
    The Dew of Affection 'light soft where they twine,<br/>
    And the Love of an Universe stamp thee divine!<br/>
                              Bloom on the day,<br/>
                              Thou Olive gay:<br/>
                              "Matchless was he<br/>
                              Who planted thee;<br/>
        And mayst thou like him immortal be!"</p>
