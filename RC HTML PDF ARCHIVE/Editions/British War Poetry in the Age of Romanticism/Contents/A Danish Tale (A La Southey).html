    <p>1808.4<br/><b>A Danish Tale<br/>
    (A La Southey)</b><a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (March 26, 1808)<br/><br/>
    As It Will Be Said or Sung Some Fifty Years Hence.<br/></p>
    <p>--------I Lemens! et saevas curra per Alpes<br/>
    Ut pueris placeas et declamatio fius.<a href="#2">[2]</a><br/>
                     _____<br/></p>
    <p>A Summer ev'ning's fairy dye<br/>
    Had crimson'd o'er the western sky;<br/>
    Grey-headed HOFFMAN'S work was done,<br/>
    And he was sitting in the sun;<br/>
    An aged hawthorn stood before<br/>
    His ivy-mantled cottage door,<br/>
    And honey-suckles lent their aid<br/>
    To beautify his humble shed;<br/>
    His little grand child PETERKIN<br/>
    Was sporting on the distant green,<br/>
    Rolling round a circling ball<br/>
    He found beside a mouldring wall.<br/>
    He came to ask what he had found<br/>
    That was so smooth, and large, and round;<br/>
    The old man took it from the boy,<br/>
    Then shook his head, and with a sigh,<br/>
    "'Tis some poor fellow's skull," said he,<br/>
    "Who fell in Wellesley's victory.<br/>
    "That Wellesley was a man of might,<br/>
    "And well he fought that gallant fight,<br/>
    "For then was many a fearless Dane<br/>
    "Laid low upon his native plain."<br/>
    The anxious boy, with earnest plea,<br/>
    Impatient climbs his grandsire's knee;<br/>
    And while the ardour of surprise<br/>
    Shone in his wonder-waiting eyes<br/>
    Entreats the spirit-stirring story—<br/>
    Who fought for fame? who died for glory?<br/>
    And wily pats the old man's chin—<br/>
    "Now tell your little PETERKIN;<br/>
    "Come, tell me all about the war,<br/>
    "And what they kill'd each other for;<br/>
    "And all about this WELLESLEY, too,<br/>
    "And what <i>he</i> did, <i>I</i> may not do."<br/>
    "I'll tell you what 'twas all about:<br/>
    "The English put the Danes to route,<br/>
    "And by a splendid victory,<br/>
    "Enforc'd the new morality.<br/>
    "It was a shocking sight, they say,<br/>
    "When noble CATHCART won the day,<br/>
    "And march'd into the smoking town,<br/>
    "And found the ruins all his own."<br/>
    "But tell me what 'twas all about,<br/>
    And why they put the Danes to rout."—<br/>
    "'Tis no great matter, in a war,<br/>
    What people kill each other for;<br/>
    The only ground of proper boast<br/>
    Is, which of them shall kill the most.<br/>
    'Tis idle, therefore, to inquire<br/>
    Why they set the town on fire.<br/>
    But every body said, quoth he,<br/>
    The English had the victory.<br/>
    And yet it was a shocking sight<br/>
    To see the fearful mother's flight,<br/>
    While with frantic care she prest<br/>
    Still closer to her throbbing breast<br/>
    The babe that pass'd, with transient breath,<br/>
    From instant life to instant death;<br/>
    To see, when all the work was done,<br/>
    The corses rotting in the sun;<br/>
    The dying mingled with the dead;<br/>
    The wounded, bleeding as he fled,<br/>
    While the frequent drops betray<br/>
    And track the wretch's faltering way,<br/>
    But things like that, you know, must be<br/>
    At every famous victory.<br/>
    And then the shells that burst around;<br/>
    The houses tumbling to the ground;<br/>
    The frighted virgin's piercing cry,<br/>
    While the ruins round her fly.<br/>
    Great praise the mighty CATHCART won,<br/>
    And WELLESLEY too, for all he'd done.<br/>
    The brave GAMBIER was there that day—<br/>
    Stood by, look'd on, and saw fair play,<a href="#3">[3]</a><br/>
    Then prais'd the LORD, and—went to pray."<br/>
    "Fair play!" cried little PETERKIN,<br/>
    "Why, 'twas a very naughty thing;<br/>
    Kill women! sack a peaceful town!<br/>
    And plunder what was not their own;<br/>
    Why surely every one must say,<br/>
    That this was very naughty play."<br/>
    "No, no, my boy, they said," quoth he,<br/>
    "The English had the victory;<br/>
    "The service too was prized so dear,<br/>
    "The King made each a mighty Peer."<br/>
    "A Peer!" rejoin'd the little prater,<br/>
    "What's he! a man! or something greater?"<br/>
    "A Peer is—what I'm not quite sure—<br/>
    He gets a pension when he's poor:<br/>
    That is, whene'er he can't afford<br/>
    To be the thing they call a Lord."<br/>
    "I'm glad that neither you nor I<br/>
    "Are Lords," replied the simple boy:<br/>
    "Let England war with women then,<br/>
    "We'll never fight with less than men."<br/>
    The placid old man griev'd to find<br/>
    What errors cloud the new-born mind.<br/>
    "Poor Ignorance! away," quoth he;<br/>
    "Go, read the <i>New Morality</i>;<a href="#4">[4]</a><br/>
    "And then, my child, you'll cease to wonder,<br/>
    "Why praise should sanction lawless plunder;<br/>
    "Why solemn Senates shou'd applaud<br/>
    "Ruthless rapine, shabby fraud;<br/>
    "Why, in this enlighten'd season,<br/>
    "Force should be the "better reason;"<br/>
    "In every case why greater might<br/>
    "Should constitute superior right;<br/>
    "And why, such things must always be<br/>
    "The fruits of such a Victory.<br/>
    "But in my boy; the sun is down,<br/>
    "And all his cheering heat is gone;<br/>
    "The evening-dew is on the leaves,<br/>
    "And lo! the modest twilight weaves<br/>
    "Of clouds that wander west away,<br/>
    "Her fairy robe of night and day."<br/></p>
