    <p>1802.12<br/><b>The Sailor's Farewel</b><br/>
    “Doctor Ogilvie”<br/>
    [Dr. John Ogilvie?]<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Poetical Register and Repository of Fugitive Poetry</i>, I (1802), pp. 81-82<br/></p>
    <p>Hark! the holla that calls us away!<br/>
    Tom, fill up a bumper in haste:<br/>
    While the ship lies unmoor'd in the bay,<br/>
    Let us drink to the days that are past.<br/></p>
    <p>Let us drink, jolly boys, ere we part,<br/>
    To our mates that carouse on the shore;<br/>
    To the Friend, whom we lodge in our heart;<br/>
    To the Nymph whom we prize as our store.<br/></p>
    <p>Adieu to the hut in the vale,<br/>
    To the secret recess of the grove;<br/>
    To old Ned, with October so stale;<br/>
    To Molly the maid of my love;<br/></p>
    <p>To the joys of the feast, and the glass,<br/>
    Where Beauty displays all her charms;<br/>
    To the song, and the buxom young lass<br/>
    That melts at the sound in your arms.<br/></p>
    <p>See the mainsail that floats on the wind.<br/>
    Hark! they heave up the anchor! Yee ho!<br/>
    Our friends stand assembled behind;<br/>
    While the shores all re-echo—hillo!<br/></p>
    <p>Let the heart of each Briton rejoice,<br/>
    At the shouts that resound from the main;<br/>
    'Tis the Spirit of England, brave boys,<br/>
    That swells in the slow-rolling strain.<br/></p>
    <p>Farewel to our dear native home,<br/>
    And our sweet little pastures of yore;<br/>
    O'er the wide-spreading ocean we roam,<br/>
    And may see the old hamlet no more.<br/><br/>
    Yet the heart of a sailor can feel<br/>
    For his friend's, for his country's repose;<br/>
    To these it presents the smooth peel,<br/>
    And the rough oak beneath,—to their foes.<br/></p>
    <p>Free Lords of the Ocean we steer,<br/>
    In commerce supreme, as in war;<br/>
    To the Nations we speak without fear,<br/>
    Let the Monsieurs contend—if they dare.<br/></p>
    <p>We'll bring, with your monkeys so gay,<br/>
    In frolic akin, as in face,<br/>
    Some spruce little Frenchman to play,<br/>
    And give each—<i>the fraternal embrace</i>!<br/></p>
    <p>Ye breezes, blow fair from the land!<br/>
    —Thou Power on all nature impress'd,<br/>
    Who hold'st the wild winds in thine hand;<br/>
    O smooth the rough billows to rest!<br/></p>
    <p>They fill the loose sails as they glide:<br/>
    The landscape recedes from the view:<br/>
    In our broad wake, we furrow the tide,<br/>
    —Ye shores of Old England, adieu!</p>
