    William Thomas Fitzgerald <a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXIII (July 1803), p. 665<br/><i>The Anti-Gallican</i>, (1804), p. 54. <a href="#2">[2]</a><br/></p>
    <p>[Written by W. T. Fitzgerald, Esq.<br/>
    and Recited by Him at the Meeting<br/>
    of the Literary Fund, July 14.]<br/></p>
    <p>Britons, to Arms! of Apathy beware,<br/>
    And let your Country be your dearest care;<br/>
    Protect your Altars! guard your Monarch's<br/>
                         Throne,<br/>
    The Cause of GEORGE and Freedom is your<br/>
                          own!<br/>
    What! shall that England want her Sons'<br/>
                         support,<br/>
    Whose Heroes fought at CRESSY<a href="#3">[3]</a>—AGINCOURT?<a href="#4">[4]</a><br/>
    And when great Marlb'rough<a href="#5">[5]</a> led the<br/>
                       English van,<br/>
    In France, o'er Frenchmen, triumph'd to a man!<br/>
    By ALFRED'S great and ever honour'd name!<br/>
    By EDWARD's prowess, and by HENRY'S fame!<br/>
    By all the gen'rous Blood for Freedom shed,<br/>
    And by the Ashes of the Patriot Dead!<br/>
    By the bright glory Britons lately won<br/>
    On Egypt's plains, beneath the burning sun,<br/>
    BRITONS, TO ARMS! defend your Country's<br/>
                         cause,<br/>
    Fight for your KING! your LIBERTIES! and<br/>
                         LAWS!<br/>
    Be France defied, her slavish yoke abhorr'd,<br/>
    And place your safety only on your Sword.<br/>
    The Gallic Despot, sworn your mortal foe,<br/>
    Now aims his last, but his most deadly blow;<br/>
    With England's plunder tempts his hungry<br/>
                         slaves,<br/>
    And dares to brave you on your native<br/>
                         waves!<br/>
    If Britain's Rights be worth a Briton's<br/>
                          care,<br/>
    To shield them from the son of Rapine—swear!<br/>
    Then to Invasion be Defiance given,<br/>
    Your Cause is just, approv'd by Earth and<br/>
                        Heaven!<br/>
    Should adverse winds our gallant Fleet<br/>
                        restrain, `<br/>
    To sweep his "bawbling"<a href="#6">[6]</a> vessels from<br/>
                        the main;<br/>
    And Fate permit him on our shores t'advance,<br/>
    The Tyrant never shall return to France;<br/>
    Fortune herself shall be no more his friend,<br/>
    And <i>here</i> the history of his crimes shall<br/>
                          end—<br/>
    His slaughter'd Legions shall manure our<br/>
                         shore,<br/>
    And ENGLAND NEVER KNOW INVASION MORE.</p>
