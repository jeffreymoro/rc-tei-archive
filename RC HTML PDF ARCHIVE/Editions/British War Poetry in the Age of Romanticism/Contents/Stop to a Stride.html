    <p>1803.10<br/><b>Stop to a Stride</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXIII (November 1803), p. 1060<br/></p>
    <p>To the Tune of "Ally Croker."<br/></p>
    <p>Bonaparte, the <i>Corsican</i>, to gain a Consul's robe, sir,<br/>
    Was by Ambition strongly urg'd to stride across the globe, sir:<br/>
    He strode o'er France, he threw his leg o'er Switzerland and<br/>
                                           Italy;<br/>
    And a tidy spot then caught his eye, a Paradise it seem'd to be:<br/>
    It was that garden ENGLAND call'd he threaten'd soon to land on.<br/>
    A little fruitful spot of ground JOHN BULL had clapp'd his hand<br/>
                                             on,<br/></p>
    <p>He strode again, to set his toe upon old <i>Albion's</i> shore, sir,<br/>
    And saw the gruff old Gentleman, who stopp'd his coming o'er, sir:<br/>
    'Who dares to check my bold career?'—"'Tis I," cried JOHNNY<br/>
                                         BULL, sir;<br/>
    "And if a foot you nearer come, by Heav'ns I'll crack your<br/>
                                         skull, sir:<br/>
    "For, I'm determin'd to protect, while I've an inch to stand<br/>
                                             on,<br/>
    This little fruitful spot of ground you see I've clapp'd my<br/>
                                         hand on.<br/></p>
    <p>"And is it you, proud <i>Corsican</i>? I guess what you'd be doing;<br/>
    "You wish to reap my plenteous crops, without the toil of<br/>
                                        ploughing:<br/>
    "And here you bring your hungry troops, half-starv'd with meagre<br/>
                                        frog-soup,<br/>
    "My sheep and oxen to devour, my poultry and my hogs up:<br/>
    "Your scheme, to feast on good sirloin, will prove a vainly—<br/>
                                     planned one;<br/>
    "My beef and pudding I'll secure—'tis an object, and a grand<br/>
                                            one.<br/></p>
    <p>"Keep close to France, as <i>Consul First</i>, contented in your<br/>
                                         station,<br/>
    "For if old <i>England</i> you invade, you'll find small consolation:<br/>
    "Fair <i>Britain's</i> wooden Walls again by NELSON are commanded,<br/>
    "And he's the boy to drub you well,—though only <i>single-handed</i>:<br/>
    "Your foolish scheme, to lord it here, ere yet too late, abandon;<br/>
    "For, while this spot yields beef and beer, JOHN BULL will<br/>
                                    keep his hand on."</p>
