    <p>1812.9<br/><b>Thoughts<br/>
    Suggested by the Approach of a Regiment</b><br/><b>of Soldiers</b><br/>
    “J. K. C.”<br/><i>The Poetical Register and Repository of Fugitive Poetry</i>, VII (1812), pp. 17-20<br/></p>
    <p>When I hear the gay bugle notes sounding from far,<br/>
        Or the clang of the trumpet from squadrons advancing;<br/>
    When I see all the pomp and the splendor of war,<br/>
        In the banners that wave and the plumes that are dancing—<br/>
            When the sprightly fife and drum<br/>
            Nearer still and nearer come;<br/>
            Cymbals mingling clash and ring,<br/>
                Beating to the soldier's tread,<br/>
            Swords that meteor flashes fling,<br/>
                Gleaming o'er each Horseman's head—<br/>
        Then, oh then! the pride of story<br/>
            Memory bids in floods to roll;<br/>
        Then our fathers' deeds of glory<br/>
            Fill the thought, and fire the soul!<br/>
                Swift as pass the tramping lines,<br/>
                    Fancy glows, and panting turns;<br/>
                Distant soon the pageant shines—<br/>
                    Still she muses, still she burns—<br/>
                —Hark! that roar—the rushing fight!<br/>
                Battling armies are in sight!<br/>
                See! 'tis Albion's fire that glows!<br/>
                See! 'tis Gallia dares oppose!—<br/>
                Sons of Albion, Britons, on!<br/>
                    Hurl your ardour on the foe!—<br/>
                Rout their legions—joy!—'tis done!<br/>
                    Sons of Albion, mercy show!<br/>
    —Cease, cease, my flush'd bosom, these dreams of the battle—<br/>
    O canst thou see joy in the war-tempest's rattle?<br/>
    And canst thou exult in the red tide that flows<br/>
    With the blood of thy brethren—or e'en of thy foes?<br/>
    Say, should'st thou not rather with awe-restrain'd breath,<br/>
    Contemplate in tears the wild congress of death;<br/>
    Ah! should'st thou not weep and lament to the cry<br/>
    Of the wounded that groan, and the conquer'd that die?<br/>
            Dreadful war! no more I see<br/>
            Pomp and glory wait on thee!<br/>
    O furl the proud banners that float o'er the plain,<br/>
    Nor stain the green turf with the gore of the slain;<br/>
    And bare not the steel that with meteor-like rays,<br/>
    Athwart the bright ether all dreadfully plays,<br/>
    For mine eye can no longer delight in its blaze.<br/>
    Ah no! for my bosom now mournfully swells,<br/>
    With the woes that the Breeze from the battle-field tells—<br/>
    It tells that the sun-beams all brilliant that play'd<br/>
    On the plumes and the spears of the gay cavalcade;<br/>
    Of their faulchions and helms that emblazon'd the pride,<br/>
    Shone as bright on the arms of the thousands who died—<br/>
    It tells that those beams shone as clear on the day,<br/>
    When each warrior slept on his death-bed of clay;<br/>
    And it sighs, that sad breeze, as opprest with the groans,<br/>
    Which the voice of the dying had mixt with its moans.<br/>
    —Then now drear came the night o'er the late-swarming heath,<br/>
            While the grass whistled shrill to the hollow wind's breath;<br/>
            How silent save that—ah, how solemn and still!<br/>
            As arose the pale moon from the forest-dark hill:<br/>
            And shrunk not the beauteous queen of the night,<br/>
            Ah! shudder'd she not at yon terrible sight?<br/>
    Alas! for she saw from the far-waving wood,<br/>
    Her path o'er the plain track'd with horror and blood;<br/>
    And the lone heath o'er which her soft lustre she shed,<br/>
    Grimly glanc'd back her ray, bright from arms that were spread,<br/>
    All broken and gory, beside the cold dead;<br/>
    And long by the hearth of each warrior's home,<br/>
    His children shall listen, and wish he were come;<br/>
    And long shall that wish to each bosom be dear,<br/>
    Ah! long in each eye shall it combat the tear.<br/>
    Perhaps that same night, when beneath the keen blast,<br/>
    Her soldier lay stiffen'd, and chill on the waste,<br/>
    The wife would look out and contemplate the sky<br/>
    Survey the mild moon-beam—and think with a sigh<br/>
    That it shone on his tent, while he wakeful might lay,<br/>
    Or be dreaming of her, and his home far away:<br/>
    Then turning to join the gay ring round the fire,<br/>
    She would smile with her children and talk of their sire;<br/>
    If she wept for his boldness, or told of his might,<br/>
    Each stripling youth glow'd to be with him in fight;<br/>
    While with fervour more mild the soft daughter would burn,<br/>
    As she pictur'd the joys of her father's return.<br/>
    Fond maiden, ah no!—thy lov'd father no more<br/>
    The threshold shall tread of his own humble door;<br/>
    Go, comfort thy mother, for desolate now,<br/>
    A lone widow, is she—and an orphan art thou!<br/>
    And oh! with what anguish your bosoms will wail,<br/>
    When, all rudely perchance, ye shall hear the sad tale;<br/>
    Thus reft of your staff, your support, and your stay,<br/>
    What sorrows may press on the future's dark way;<br/>
    What tears of affliction may languidly flow,<br/>
    What nights of despair, and what mornings of woe!<br/>
            Should poverty all but deny the raw shed,<br/>
            And pale want and disease ghastly glare round your bed,<br/>
            And the past rise in contrast—all gay with delight—<br/>
            Say what will ye think of the 'glorious fight?'<br/>
            Will ye too exult with the conqueror?—no!—<br/>
            For his laurels are cypress—his victory woe—<br/>
            And the trophies Ambition so joyous would read,<br/>
            Are the widow's lament, and the orphan's lone tear!<br/>
                    Ah! sad war! no more I see<br/>
                    Pomp and glory wait on thee!<br/>
    These, these are the sorrows that flow from the battle:<br/>
        —Then heed not my soul the fam'd heroes of story;<br/>
    —And pant not my bosom to join the war's rattle,<br/>
        Nor so proudly beat high with wild visions of glory.</p>
