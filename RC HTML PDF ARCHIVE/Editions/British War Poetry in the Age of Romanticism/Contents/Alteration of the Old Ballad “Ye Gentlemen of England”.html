    <p>1801.1<br/><b>Alteration of the Old Ballad</b><br/>
    “Amator Patriae"<br/>
    [Thomas Campbell]<br/><i>The Courier</i> (March 18, 1801)<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (March 18, 1801)<br/><i>The Poetical Register and Repository of Fugitive Poetry</i>, IV (1806), pp. 233-234<br/><i>The Shrewsbury Chronicle</i> (September 4, 1807)<br/></p>
    <p>"Ye Gentlemen of England."<br/></p>
    <p>         Composed on<br/></p>
    <p>The Prospect of a Russian War.<br/></p>
    <p>Ye Mariners of England<br/>
        That guard our native Seas,<br/>
    Whose Flag has brav'd a thousand years,<br/>
        The Battle and the Breeze,<br/>
    Your glorious Standard launch again,<br/>
        To match another Foe,<br/>
    And sweep thro' the Deep<br/>
        While the Stormy Tempests blow—.<br/>
    While the Battle rages loud and long<br/>
        And the Stormy Tempests blow!<br/></p>
    <p>The Spirits of your Fathers<br/>
        Shall start from ev'ry wave;<br/>
    For the Deck it was their Field of Fame<br/>
        And Ocean was their Grave!<br/>
    Where BLAKE<a href="#1">[1]</a> (the Boast of Freedom) fell<a href="#2">[2]</a><br/>
        Your manly hearts shall glow,<br/>
    As ye sweep thro' the Deep<br/>
        When the stormy Tempests blow—<br/>
    When the Battle rages loud and long—<br/>
        And the stormy tempests blow!<br/><br/>
    BRITANNIA needs no Bulwark,<br/>
        No Tow'rs along the Steep;<br/>
    Her march is o'er the mountain-waves,<br/>
        Her <i>home</i> is on the Deep:—<br/>
    With thunders from her native Oak<br/>
        She quells the floods below,<br/>
    As they roar on the shore<br/>
        When the stormy Tempests blow—<br/>
    When the Battle rages loud and long<br/>
        And the stormy Tempests blow!<br/></p>
    <p>The Meteor Flag of England<br/>
        Must yet terrific burn,<br/>
    Till Danger's troubled Night depart<br/>
        And the Star of Peace return!<br/>
    Then, then, ye Ocean Warriors,<br/>
        Our Song and Feast shall flow<br/>
    To the fame of your name,<br/>
        When the Tempests cease to blow—<br/>
    When the fiery fight is heard no more<br/>
        And the Tempests cease to blow!</p>

                        <span class="footnote_text">1. Robert Blake (1599-1657), reorganized the navy under the Commonwealth and had many victories at sea against the Dutch and the Spanish. His most spectacular victory was against the Spanish at Santa Cruz where he had been sent to capture Gibraltar. He destroyed the entire Spanish fleet, with the loss of only one ship and fifty men. Blake authored the Fighting Instructions, the basis for naval tactics throughout the eighteenth century, as well as the Articles of War, the basis of naval discipline.<br/><br/><a name="2"> </a>2. This line was later altered to read "Where Blake and mighty Nelson fell."</span>
