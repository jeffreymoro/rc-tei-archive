    <p>1804.16<br/><b>Bonaparte's Soliloquy</b><br/>
    “R. P. C.”<br/><i>The Anti-Gallican</i> (1804), pp. 259-260<br/></p>
    <p>A Parody on Hamlet's Soliloquy.<br/></p>
    <p>To invade, or not invade?—That is the question—<br/>
    Whether 'twere better policy to bear<br/>
    The discontented spirit of my Army,<br/>
    To whom I've promis'd plunder; or to make<br/>
    A grand attack on Britain?—To invade,—to fight,<br/>
    On their own shores, a people fam'd for valour;<br/>
    And by that fight to put an end<br/>
    To the eternal jealosy and strife<br/>
    Subsisting 'twixt the French and English Nations;—<br/>
    And what is most desirable to me;—<br/><i>England's complete o'erthrow</i>!—To invade—to fight,—<br/>
    To fight?—perchance to <i>beat</i>!—aye, there's the point<br/>
    That shakes my Resolution most; besides,<br/>
    When the French fleet shall brave the English Thunder,<br/>
    How soon a ball or bullet may decide<br/>
    The premier CONSUL'S fate,—must give me pause.<br/><br/>
    Here is the reason of my long delay<br/>
    To execute my threat:—Fear holds me back,<br/>
    Tho' desp'rate motives urge.—Else who would bear<br/>
    Unsatisfied, the strong desire I feel<br/>
    To conquer ENGLAND; desolate her towns;<br/>
    Her bulwarks burn; and drench her plains with blood?<br/>
    Who could endure the mortifying sight<br/>
    Of English cruizers, impudently bold,<br/>
    Blockading e'en the very ports of France;—<br/>
    But that the dread of Britain's dauntless sons,<br/>
    (That free unconquer'd race!) "puzzles my will;"<br/>
    And makes me rather all the dangers brave,<br/>
    That hover round my present slipp'ry state,<br/>
    Than heedless rush on almost certain ruin<br/>
    On hated ALBION'S shores?—Thus prudence, fear,<br/>
    And policy combin'd, can change the hue<br/>
    Of Resolution; and thus serious thought<br/>
    Can alter plans of greatest "pith and moment,"<br/>
    And make th' INVASION I so long have threaten'd,<br/>
    —All end in <i>Nothing</i>!—</p>
