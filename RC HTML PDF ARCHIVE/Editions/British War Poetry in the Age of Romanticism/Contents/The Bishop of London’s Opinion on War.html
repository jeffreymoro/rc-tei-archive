    <p>1793.13<br/><b>The Bishop of London's Opinion on War</b><br/>
    Beilby Porteous<br/><i>The Cambridge Intelligencer</i> (September 14, 1793)<br/></p>
    <p>_____________ONE murder makes a Villain,<br/>
    MILLIONS a Hero: Princes are privileged<br/>
    To kill, and numbers sanctify the crime.<br/>
    Ah! Why will Kings forget that they are men?<br/>
    And men that they are brethren? Why delight<br/>
    In HUMAN SACRIFICE? Why burst the ties<br/>
    Of Nature, that should knit their souls together<br/>
    In one soft bond of amity and love.<br/></p>
    <p>They yet still breathe destruction, still go on,<br/>
    Inhumanly ingenious, to find out<br/>
    New pains for life, new terrors for the grave,<br/>
    Artificers of death! Still Monarchs dream<br/>
    Of universal empire, growing up<br/>
    From universal ruin. Blast the design<br/>
    Great God of Hosts, nor let thy creatures fall<br/>
    Unpitied Victims at Ambitions shrine!</p>

    <p>From Dr. Porteous's Poem on Death.<a href="#1">[1]</a></p>

    <span class="footnote_text">1. Beilby Porteous (1731-1808) became Bishop of London in 1787. While a student at Cambridge in 1759, he won the Seatonian prize for his long poem, <i>Death</i>, from which this is extracted. (The extravagant elegy of George II in this poem was later satirized by Thackeray in <i>The Four Georges</i>.) As Bishop of London, Porteous was friendly to evangelicals and was a special friend of Hannah More. Although interested in reform, he was opposed to the French Revolution and preached against the <i>Rights of Man</i>.</span></p>
