    <p>1804.7<br/><b>The Soldier's Return</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Scots Magazine</i>, LXVI (April 1804), p. 297<br/></p>
    <p>The wars for many a month were o'er,<br/>
        E'er I could reach my native shed;<br/>
    My friends ne'er hop'd to see me more,<br/>
        But wept for me as for the dead.<br/></p>
    <p>As I drew nigh, the cottage blaz'd;<br/>
        The ev'ning fire was clear and bright;<br/>
    And through the window long I gaz'd,<br/>
        And saw each friend with dear delight.<br/></p>
    <p>My father in his corner sat,<br/>
        My mother drew her useful thread,<br/>
    My brothers strove to make them chat,<br/>
        My sisters bak'd the household bread:<br/></p>
    <p>And Jean oft whisper'd to a friend,<br/>
        That still let fall a silent tear:<br/>
    But soon my Jessy's grief shall end—<br/>
        She little thinks her Harry's near.<br/></p>
    <p>My mother saw her catching sighs,<br/>
        And hid her face behind the rock;<br/>
    While tears swam round in all their eyes,<br/>
        And not a single word was spoke.<br/><br/>
    What could I do?—If in I went,<br/>
        Surprize might chill each tender heart;<br/>
    Some story, then, I must invent,<br/>
        And act the poor maim'd soldier's part.<br/></p>
    <p>I drew a bandage o'er my face,<br/>
        And crooked up a lying knee,<br/>
    And found that e'en in that blest place<br/>
        Not one dear friend knew ought of me.<br/></p>
    <p>I ventur'd in—Tray wagg'd his tail,<br/>
        And fawn'd—and to my mother ran:<br/>
    "Come here," they cry'd; "what can he ail!"<br/>
        While my feign'd story I began.<br/></p>
    <p>I chang'd my voice to that of age,<br/>
        "A poor old soldier lodgings crave:"<br/>
    The very name their loves engage—<br/>
        "A soldier! aye, the best we have."<br/></p>
    <p>My father then drew in a seat,<br/>
        "You're welcome," with a sigh, he said:<br/>
    My mother fry'd her best hung meat,<br/>
        And curds and cheese the table spread.<br/></p>
    <p>"I had a son," my father sigh'd,<br/>
        "A soldier, too; but he is gone!"<br/>
    "Have you heard from him?" I reply'd;<br/>
        "I left behind me many a one:—<br/></p>
    <p>"And many a message I have brought<br/>
        "To families I cannot find;<br/>
    "Long for John Goodman's have I sought,<br/>
        "To tell them Hall's not far behind."<br/></p>
    <p>"O! does he live?" my father cry'd,<br/>
        My mother did not stay to speak;<br/>
    My Jessy now I silent ey'd,<br/>
        Who throbb'd as if her heart would break.<br/></p>
    <p>"He lives indeed!—this 'kerchief see,<br/>
        "At parting his dear Jessy gave;<br/>
    "He sent it her, with love, by me,<br/>
        "To shew he yet escapes the grave."<br/></p>
    <p>An arrow, darting from a bow,<br/>
        Could not more quick the token reach:<br/>
    The patch from off my face I drew,<br/>
        And gave my voice its well-known speech.<br/><br/>
    "My Jessy, dear!" I softly said:<br/>
        She gaz'd, and answer'd with a sigh:<br/>
    My sisters look'd as half-afraid;<br/>
        My mother fainted quite for joy.<br/></p>
    <p>My father danced round his son;<br/>
        My brothers shook my hand away;<br/>
    My mother said, Her glass might run,<br/>
        She car'd not now how soon that day.<br/></p>
    <p>"Hout, woman!" cry 'd my father dear,<br/>
        "A wedding first I'm sure we'll have:<br/>
    "I warrant we'll live this hundred year—<br/>
        "Nay, may be, lass, escape the grave."</p>
