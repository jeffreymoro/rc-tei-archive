    <p>1802.11<br/><b>Lines Written at Norwich<br/>
    On The First News of Peace</b><br/>
    Amelia Opie<br/><i>Poems by Mrs. Opie</i> (1802), pp. 81-86<br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, LXII (July 1802), pp. 43-44<br/></p>
    <p>What means that wild and joyful cry?<br/>
    Why do yon crowds in mean attire<br/>
    Throw thus their ragged arms on high?<br/>
    In want what can such joy inspire?<br/></p>
    <p>And why on every face I meet<br/>
    Now beams a smile, now drops a tear?<br/>
    Like longloved friends, lo! strangers greet, . . . .<br/>
    Each to his fellow man seems dear.<br/></p>
    <p>In one warm glow of christian love<br/>
    Forgot all proud distinctions seem;<br/>
    The rich, the poor, together rove;<br/>
    Their eyes with answering kindness beam . . . .<br/></p>
    <p>Blest sound! blest sight! . . . . But pray ye pause<br/>
    And bid my eager wonder cease;<br/>
    Of joy like this, say, what's the cause?. . . .<br/>
    A thousand voices answer . . . . 'PEACE!'<br/></p>
    <p>O sound most welcome to my heart!<br/>
    Tidings for which I've sighed for years!<br/>
    But ill would words my joy impart;<br/>
    Let me my rapture speak in tears.<br/></p>
    <p>Ye patient poor, from wonder free<br/>
    Your signs of joy I now survey,<br/>
    And hope your sallow cheeks to see<br/>
    Once more the bloom of health display.<br/><br/>
    Of those poor babes that on your knees<br/>
    Imploring food have vainly hung,<br/>
    You'll soon each craving want appease, . . . .<br/>
    For Plenty comes with Peace along.<br/></p>
    <p>And you, fond parents, faithful wives,<br/>
    Who've long for sons and husbands feared,<br/>
    Peace now shall save their precious lives;<br/>
    They come by danger more endeared.<br/></p>
    <p>But why, to all these transports dead,<br/>
    Steals yon shrunk form from forth the throng?<br/>
    Has she not heard the tidings spread?<br/>
    Tell her these shouts to Peace belong . . . .<br/></p>
    <p>'Talk not of Peace, . . . . the sound I hate,'<br/>
    The mourner with a sigh replied;<br/>
    'Alas! Peace comes for me too late, . . . .<br/>
    For my brave boy in Egypt died!'<br/></p>
    <p>Poor mourner! at thy tale of grief<br/>
    The crowd was mute and sad awhile;<br/>
    But e'en compassion's tears are brief<br/>
    When general transport claims a smile.<br/></p>
    <p>Full soon they checked the tender sigh<br/>
    Their glowing hearts to pity gave;<br/>
    But, while the mourner yet was nigh,<br/>
    They warmly blessed the slaughtered brave: . . . .<br/></p>
    <p>And from all hearts, as sad she passed,<br/>
    This virtuous prayer her sorrow draws: . . . .<br/>
    'Grant, Heaven, those tears may be the last<br/>
    That war, detested war, shall cause! . . . .<br/></p>
    <p>Oh! if with pure ambition fraught<br/>
    All nations join this virtuous prayer,<br/>
    If they, by late experience taught,<br/>
    No longer wish to slay, but spare, . . . .<br/></p>
    <p>Then hostile bands on War's red plain<br/>
    For conquest have not vainly burned,<br/>
    Nor then through long long years in vain<br/>
    Have thousands died and millions mourned.</p>
