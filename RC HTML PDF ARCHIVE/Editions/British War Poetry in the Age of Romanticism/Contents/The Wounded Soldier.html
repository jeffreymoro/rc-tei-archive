    <p>1799.12<br/><b>The Wounded Soldier</b><br/>
    “Mr. Merry”<br/>
    [Robert Merry]<br/><i>The Spirit of the Public Journals</i>, II (1799), pp. 126-129<br/></p>
    <p>The sun was just retir'd, the dews of eve<br/>
        Their glow-worm lustre scatter'd o'er the vale;<br/>
    The lonely nightingale began to grieve,<br/>
        Telling, with many a pause, her tend'rest tale.<br/></p>
    <p>No clamours rude disturb'd the pensive hour,<br/>
        And the young moon, yet fearful of the night,<br/>
    Rear'd her pale crescent o'er the burnish'd tow'r,<br/>
        That caught the parting orb's still ling'ring light.<br/></p>
    <p>Twas then, where peasant footsteps mark'd the way,<br/>
        A wounded soldier feebly mov'd along;<br/>
    While pity in his youthful form might view<br/>
        A helpless prematurity of age.<br/></p>
    <p>Then as with strange contortions lab'ring slow,<br/>
        He gain'd the summit of his native hill,<br/>
    And saw the well-known prospect spread below,<br/>
        The farm, the cot, the hamlet, and the mill;<br/><br/>
    In spite of fortitude, one struggling sigh<br/>
        Shook the firm texture of his tortur'd heart;<br/>
    And from his hollow and dejected eye<br/>
        One trembling tear hung ready to depart.<br/></p>
    <p>"How chang'd (he cried) is the fair scene to me,<br/>
        Since last across this narrow path I went!<br/>
    The soaring lark felt not superior glee,<br/>
        Nor any human breast more true content.<br/></p>
    <p>"When the fresh hay was o'er the meadow thrown,<br/>
        Amidst the busy throng I still appear'd;<br/>
    My prowess too at harvest-time was shown,<br/>
        While LUCY's carol ev'ry labour cheer'd.<br/></p>
    <p>"The burning rays I scarcely seem'd to feel,<br/>
        If the dear maiden near me chanc'd to rove;<br/>
    Or if she deign'd to share my frugal meal,<br/>
        It was a rich repast — a feast of love.<br/></p>
    <p>"And when at ev'ning, with a rustic's pride,<br/>
        I dar'd the sturdiest wrestlers on the green,<br/>
    What joy was mine! to hear her at my side<br/>
        Extol my vigour and my manly mien.<br/></p>
    <p>"Ah! now no more the sprightly lass shall run<br/>
        To bid me welcome from the sultry plain;<br/>
    But her averted eye my sight will shun,<br/>
        And all our cherish'd fondest hopes be vain.<br/></p>
    <p>"Alas! my parents, must ye too endure<br/>
        That I should gloom for e'er your homely mirth,<br/>
    Exist upon the pittance ye procure,<br/>
        And make ye curse the hour that gave me birth?<br/></p>
    <p>"Oh, hapless day! when at a neighb'ring wake,<br/>
        The gaudy sergeant caught my wond'ring eye,<br/>
    And as his tongue of war and honour spake,<br/>
        I felt a wish to conquer or to die.<br/></p>
    <p>"Then, while he bound the ribands on my brow,<br/>
        He talk'd of captains kind and generals good,<br/>
    Said, a whole nation would my fame avow,<br/>
        And <i>bounty</i> call'd the purchase of my blood.<br/></p>
    <p>"Yet I refus'd that <i>bounty</i> — I disdain'd<br/>
        To <i>sell</i> my service in a righteous cause,<br/>
    And such to my dull sense it was explain'd,<br/>
        The cause of monarchs, justice, and the laws.<br/><br/>
    "The rattling drums beat loud, the fifes began,<br/>
        My King and country seem'd to ask my aid;<br/>
    Through ev'ry vein the thrilling ardour ran —<br/>
        I left my humble cot, my village maid.<br/></p>
    <p>"Oh, hapless day! torn from my LUCY's charms,<br/>
        I thence was hurried to a scene of strife,<br/>
    To painful marches, and the din of arms —<br/>
        The wreck of reason and the waste of life.<br/></p>
    <p>"In loathsome vessels now with crowds confin'd,<br/>
        Now led with hosts to slaughter in the field;<br/>
    Now backward driv'n, like leaves before the wind,<br/>
        Too weak to stand, and yet asham'd to yield.<br/></p>
    <p>"Till oft-repeated victories inspir'd,<br/>
        With tenfold fury the indignant foe,<br/>
    Who ruthless still advanc'd as we retir'd,<br/>
        And laid our boasted, proudest honours low.<br/></p>
    <p>"Through frozen deserts then compell'd to fly,<br/>
        Our bravest legions moulder'd fast away,<br/>
    Thousands of wounds and sickness left to die,<br/>
        While hov'ring ravens mark'd them for their prey.<br/></p>
    <p>"Ah! sure remorse their savage hearts must rend,<br/>
        Whose selfish, desp'rate frenzy could decree,<br/>
    That in one mass of murder men should blend,<br/>
        Who sent the slave to fight against the <i>free</i>.<br/></p>
    <p>"Unequal conquest! — at fair Freedom's call,<br/>
        The lowest hind glows with celestial fire;<br/>
    She rules, directs, pervades, and conquers all,<br/>
        And armies at her sacred glance expire.<br/></p>
    <p>"Then be this warfare of the world accurs'd!<br/>
        The son now weeps not on the father's bier,<br/>
    But gray-hair'd age (for nature is revers'd)<br/>
        Drops o'er his children's grave an icy tear."<br/></p>
    <p>Thus having spoke — by varying passions tost,<br/>
        He reach'd the threshold of his parents' shed,<br/>
    Who knew not of his fate, but mourn'd him lost,<br/>
        Amidst the number of the <i>unnam'd dead</i>.<br/></p>
    <p>Soon as they heard his well-remember'd voice,<br/>
        A ray of rapture chas'd habitual care:<br/>
    "Our HENRY lives — we may again rejoice!"<br/>
        And LUCY sweetly blush'd, for she was there.<br/><br/>
    But when he enter'd in such horrid guise,<br/>
        His mother shriek'd, and dropp'd upon the floor:<br/>
    His father look'd to heav'n with streaming eyes,<br/>
        And LUCY sunk, alas! to rise no more.<br/></p>
    <p>O, may this tale, which agony must close,<br/>
        Give due contrition to the self-call'd great,<br/>
    And show the poor how hard the lot of those<br/>
        Who shed their blood for <i>ministers of state</i>!</p>
