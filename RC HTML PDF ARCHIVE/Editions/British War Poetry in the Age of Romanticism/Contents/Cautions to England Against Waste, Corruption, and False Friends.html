    <p>1796.9<br/><b>Cautions to England.<br/>
    Against WASTE, CORRUPTION, and FALSE FRIENDS.</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Universal Magazine</i>, XCIX (August 1796), p. 130<br/><br/>
    [From Mr. Knight's Didactic Poem, entitled 'The Progress of Civil Society.']</p>
    <p>Yet, happy Britain! ere it is too late,<br/>
    Shun the dire horrors that thy rashness wait:<br/>
    Dismiss the venal and the useless train,<br/>
    That waste thy vigour and thy vitals drain;<br/>
    Shake off the leeches that, at every pore,<br/>
    Empty thy veins, and fatten on thy gore;<br/>
    And while thy power with Gallic foes contends,<br/>
    Ah, shun the direr curse of German friends;<br/>
    Whom still thy treasures, wrung from misery, pay,<br/>
    To mock thy sufferings, and thy cause betray.<br/>
        Be thy own friend, and let thy children know,<br/>
    That, for themselves, their blood and treasures flow;<br/>
    That not ambitious hopes, or vengeful pride,<br/>
    Lead on thy armies, or thy councils guide,<br/>
    But that thy sword, impartial Justice draws,<br/>
    To save thy liberties and guard thy laws.<br/>
        Yet, happy Britain!—with proportion'd weights,<br/>
    Guard the just balance of thy three Estates;<br/>
    For, in that balance only, canst thou find<br/>
    Order and Rule, with Liberty combin'd.</p>
