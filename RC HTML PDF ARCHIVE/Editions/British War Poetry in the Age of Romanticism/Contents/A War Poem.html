    <p>1799.11<br/><b>A War Poem.<br/><i>On the late Mr.</i> Blythe, <i>a Midshipman on board the Mars</i></b><br/>
    “Nauticus”<br/><i>The British Poetical Miscellany</i>, (1799), pp. 7-8<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXI (April 1801), p. 352 <a href="#1">[1]</a><br/></p>
    <p>Hark! how the Church-bells' thund'ring harmony<br/>
    Stun the glad ear!—Tidings of joy have come—<br/>
    Good tidings of great joy!—Two gallant ships<br/>
    Met on the element—they met—they fought<br/>
    A desperate fight!—Good tidings of great joy!<br/>
    They fought a desperate fight—The English guns<br/>
    Plough'd up the hostile deck—they shatter'd her—<br/>
    Old England triumph'd!—Yet another day<br/>
    Of glory for the Ruler of the Waves.<br/>
    For those who fell—'twas in their country's cause,<br/>
    They have their passing paragraphs of praise,<br/>
    And are forgotten.</p>
    <p>                                       There was one who dy'd<br/>
    In that day's glory, whose obscurer name<br/>
    No proud historian's page will chronicle.<br/>
    Peace to his honest soul!—I read his name—<br/>
    'Twas in the list of slaughter;—and bless'd God<br/>
    The sound was not familiar to mine ear.<br/>
    But it was told me after, that this man<br/>
    Was one whom lawful violence had forc'd<br/>
    From his own home, and wife, and little ones,<br/>
    Who by his labour liv'd:—that he was one<br/>
    Whose uncorrupted heart could keenly feel<br/>
    A husband's love—a father's anxiousness;<br/>
    That from the wages of his toil he fed<br/>
    The distant dear ones; and would talk of them<br/>
    At midnight, when he trod the silent deck<br/>
    With him he valued:—talk of them, of joys<br/>
    That he had known.—O God! and of the hour<br/>
    When they should meet again, till his full heart,<br/>
    His manly heart, at last would overflow,<br/>
    E'en like a child's, with very tenderness.<br/>
    Peace to his honest spirit! Suddenly<br/>
    It came, and merciful the ball of death,<br/>
    For it came suddenly, and shatter'd him,<br/>
    And left no moment's agonizing thought<br/>
    On those he lov'd so well.</p>
    <p>                              He ocean deep<br/>
    Now lies at rest. Be Thou her comforter,<br/>
    Who art the widow's friend; Man does not know<br/>
    What a cold sickness made her blood run back,<br/>
    When first she heard the tidings of the fight.<br/>
    Man does not know with what a dreadful hope<br/>
    She listen'd to the names of those who dy'd:<br/>
    Man does not know, or, knowing, will not heed,<br/>
    With what an agony of tenderness<br/>
    She gaz'd upon her children, and beheld<br/>
    His image, who was gone. O God! be Thou<br/>
    Her comforter, who art the widow's friend.</p>
