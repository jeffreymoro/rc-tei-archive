    <p>1801.14<br/><b>The Widow</b><br/>
    “T. M.”<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (December 28, 1801)<br/><i>The Courier</i> (December 30, 1801)<br/></p>
    <p>    The solemn midnight bell had toll'd,<br/>
    From church-yard drear the owlet bird,<br/>
        Shriek'd in the blast that blew so cold,<br/>
    Whilst the fast falling shower was heard,<br/>
        Though shud'ring at his hootings wild,<br/>
    Yet to her anxious throbbing breast<br/>
        MATILDA clasp'd her lovely child,<br/>
    And thus she sung it oft to rest—<br/>
        "Where is thy warrior father gone?<br/>
        "Why stays he in the field of death?<br/>
        "Why hears he not thy mother's moan?<br/>
        "Why thus increase her heartfelt grief?<br/><br/>
        And now anon the hapless maid,<br/>
    Saw shadows of the dead pass by,<br/>
        In visionary dreams betray'd,<br/>
    Her piercing sad anxiety;<br/>
        She heard the warning death-watch near,<br/>
    She'd fain the dying fire renew,<br/>
        But grasp'd by icy hand of fear,<br/>
    She saw the fading lamp burn blue;<br/>
        She still the little infant press'd,<br/>
    And wept and sung it off to rest:<br/>
        "Oh, should thy father not return,<br/>
        "We'll seek him through the live-long day,<br/>
        "And all the night will sit and mourn,<br/>
        "Where the unshrouded corpses lay."</p>
    <p>    His head the day star scarce had rear'd,<br/>
    When bending 'neath the weight of years,<br/>
        A broken soldier, maim'd and scar'd,<br/>
    Before her cottage gate appears;<br/>
        His furrow'd cheeks were red and blue,<br/>
    For he had travell'd all the night,<br/>
        And the big drops of morning dew,<br/>
    Silver'd his snowy hair so bright;<br/>
        His tears, they eloquently told,<br/>
    The fatal unexpected news,<br/>
        That WILLIAM'S body, dead and cold,<br/>
    Return'd to dust the wild wind strews;<br/>
        Then did she kiss her sleeping child,<br/>
    And sorrowing sung so sweetly wild;<br/>
        "Thy poor fond father never more,<br/>
        "Will hug his only infant boy,<br/>
        "For though the dreadful battle's o'er,<br/>
        "He comes not back with smiles and joy."<br/></p>
    <p>    "Alas, for him no more we wait,<br/>
    "When homeward from the field he came,<br/>
        "At evening near the village gate,<br/>
    "Nor thou blest babe the weary team<br/>
        "With sparkling eyes no more behold—<br/>
    "And thou shalt look, and look in vain,<br/>
        "To kiss thy father's cheek so cold,<br/>
    "And I his love, return again.<br/>
        "Oh, tell me! is the body found?<br/>
        "And is it pierc'd with many a wound?<br/>
        "And is it left awhile to bleed,<br/>
        "Where the slow flighted ravens feed?<br/></p>
    <p>    "Whether in holy ground he's laid,<br/>
    "And where—Oh tell me—tell me true!<br/>
        "That I may wander and bedew,<br/>
    "With hallow'd tears his lone grave bed!"<br/></p>
    <p>    "Yes, maiden fair—I'll tell most true,<br/>
    "I saw him quietly inurn'd<br/>
        "And 'neath the aged gloomy yew,<br/>
    "I heard his funeral rites perform'd;<br/>
        "But long and dreary is the way,<br/>
    "Where his sad mould'ring relics lay;<br/>
        "In BERTRAM'S walls<a href="#1">[1]</a>, by virtue blest,<br/>
    "Thy WILLIAM'S honour'd ashes rest."<br/></p>
    <p>    Soon as the midnight bell had toll'd,<br/>
    And fatal croak'd the raven bird,<br/>
        Although the wintry wind blew cold,<br/>
    And scarce another sound was heard,<br/>
        She wander'd forth, to BERTRAM'S walls,<br/>
    And through the hollow winding dale,<br/>
        Pac'd wearily her unknown way,<br/>
    She heard the hungry owlet's call,<br/>
        She brav'd the piercing icy gale,<br/>
    Whilst her lov'd boy in slumber lay,<br/>
        Frantic, she scoffs the wind that blows,<br/>
    Whilst shiv'ring on the heath she stands,<br/>
        Imperious fate her life demands;<br/>
    All cover'd o'er with falling snows,<br/>
        She looks in vain—no traveller comes or goes.<br/></p>
    <p>    She wander'd on mid shades of night,<br/>
    She saw the trembling stars appear:<br/>
        No gipsey's fire nor cottage light,<br/>
    No watch-dog told a village near;<br/>
        Fast fell her tears—her famish'd form<br/>
    Now bent beneath the searching storm<br/>
        So dreary and so very cold!<br/>
    Her little Babe upon her breast,<br/>
        Too weak to cry, had sunk to rest;<br/>
    And, ere the morning bell had toll'd,<br/>
        Beneath the drifted snow she lay<br/>
    A Corpse, upon the lone Heath's way!<br/></p>
