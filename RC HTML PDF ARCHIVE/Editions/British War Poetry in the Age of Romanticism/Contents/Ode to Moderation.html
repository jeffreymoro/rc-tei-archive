    <p>1795.25<br/><b>Ode to Moderation</b><br/>
    "A. C."<br/><i>The Cabinet</i>, III (1795), pp. 117-120<br/></p>
    <p>To thee, whose cautious step, and specious air,<br/>
        Deceive the world, who simulating <i>good</i>,<br/>
    Drop'st from thine oily tongue the pitying pray'r,<br/>
        T'avert the ills of man, and spare his blood.<br/>
    'To thee I call, but with no friendly voice,'<br/>
        I am no dupe to thine insidious art,<br/>
        The vaunted mercy of thy traitor heart,<br/>
    Nor in thy promises can I rejoice.<br/>
    For well I know thee hypocrite!—I know<br/>
    Thou art the fatal source of human woe,<br/>
    Thine is the shield that bloodiest tyrants bear,<br/>
    Foul harbinger of death, black herald of despair.<br/></p>
    <p>Why groans you hapless, violated land,<br/>
        With such continued suff'rance, and long care?<br/>
    'Tis that, deceiver! there thou giv'st command,<br/>
        That mod'rate justice, mod'rate truth are there.<br/>
    The poor not quite destroy'd, tho' doom'd to toil<br/>
        From day to day unceasing, yet must hide<br/>
        Their soul's deep anguish from the gaze of pride,<br/>
    And greet with smiles the plund'rers of the soil.<br/>
    The sad seditious thoughts that fire the brain<br/>
    Must be subdued,—'tis treason to complain;<br/>
    For order, peace, tranquility require,<br/>
    They suffer all <i>unmoved</i>,—then silently expire.<br/></p>
    <p>O rather bear me fury, vengeance wild!<br/>
        To the red scene of slaughter and dismay,<br/>
    Where the bold multitude, no more beguil'd,<br/>
        The deathful banners of their rage display.<br/>
    Ah! let <i>their</i> gen'rous ardors burn for me;<br/><i>    Their</i> fiercest energies my bosom steel,<br/>
        Who learn to vindicate, when taught to feel,<br/>
    And dare th' extreme of all things to be free:<br/>
    Better by far at once the conflict end,<br/>
    The gen'ral <i>foe</i> prevail, or genial <i>friend</i>,<br/>
    Than that faint hope should languish with the throng,<br/>
    Who love the right but half, but half detest the wrong.<br/></p>
    <p>Mark, how the desolating tempest flies,<br/>
        And rends the groaning forest from its base;<br/>
    Its bursting thunders wreck the pow'rless skies,<br/>
        Its lightnings Nature's loveliest scenes deface.<br/>
    Anon, behold its transient fury sped,<br/>
        More fresh the flowers their vivid tints disclose,<br/>
        With richer pride the yellow harvest glows,<br/>
    More soft the air, more sweet the odours spread.<br/>
    Thus from the storms of intellectual strife,<br/>
    The moral system wakes to purer life,<br/>
    The passions harmonize which late were hurl'd,<br/>
    And reason's fairer beams illume a happier world.<br/></p>
    <p>'Tis true, seductive is thy mild discourse,<br/>
        With dainty terms of soft benevolence,<br/>
    And honied phrases fill'd, abjuring force,<br/>
        Trusting to time, and to progressive sense.<br/>
    Thus the wild jargons of submissive peace,<br/>
        Of calm endurance, petrify the heart,<br/>
        Check the bold tear of manhood ere it start,<br/>
    And bid the holy animation cease.<br/>
    By due and slow degrees, by sober zeal,<br/>
    Profess to rectify the public weal,<br/>
    Which, by confusing parts, confound the whole,<br/>
    Disorganize the will, and dislocate the soul.<br/></p>
    <p>'Tis thine to boast of long existing laws,<br/>
    Blast the <i>effect</i> of ill, but not the <i>cause</i>;<br/>
    'Tis thine to call it mad erroneous rage,<br/>
        When indignation's spirit nobly glows,<br/>
        When smarting with the sense of bitt'rest woes;<br/>
    The mass of man the war of nature wage,<br/>
    'Tis thine with horror then to paint the scene,<br/>
    As barb'rous tyranny had never been,<br/>
    Of ruthless anarchy alone complain,<br/>
    Then if thy victims pause, prepare th' eternal chain.<br/></p>
    <p>Ah! wouldst thou ask me why I thus can hate,<br/>
        Why thus abhor thee, execrable pow'r?<br/>
    'Tis, that I deem thy mercy worse than fate,<br/>
        'Tis, that thou smilest only to devour.<br/>
    Did the great Pole<a href="#1">[1]</a> thy baleful influence share,<br/>
        When rous'd to fury at his country's call;<br/>
        Or when he found that country doom'd to fall,<br/>
    Felt <i>he</i> a moderation of despair?<br/>
    Meanwhile, <i>thy</i> tranquil Hecate of the North,<br/>
    Sent her infernal legions <i>mildly</i> forth,<br/>
    To quell intemp'rate zeal,—the land to <i>save</i>,—<br/>
    With mod'rate murder sweep whole nations to the grave.<br/><br/>
    At thy approach, true principle decays,<br/>
        Cabals succeed, with reas'nings most abstruse,<br/>
    Of reg'lar governments the placid praise,<br/>
        Of tender words and savage deeds profuse.<br/>
    Unhappy France! I see thy laurels die,<br/>
        I see thy fading glories dimly shine,<br/>
        The tyrants triumph with their wrath <i>benign</i>,<br/>
    The <i>mod'rate</i> wrath of boundless cruelty.<br/>
    The bold terrific energy is past,<br/>
    And peace and tyranny return at last,<br/>
    Thy star of vict'ry rose—when at the sight,<br/>
    Pale moderation shriek'd, and all again was night.<br/></p>
    <p>O ye fall'n patriots! ere I drop the pen,<br/>
        One rending sigh shall to your worth be paid,<br/>
    Ye greatest, noblest, bravest, best of men!<br/>
        One grateful tear be offer'd to your shade.<br/>
    Tho' monarchs execrate, tho' Britons scorn,<br/>
        Your deathless name, yet still to freedom true,<br/>
        Be't mine, alas! to pay the homage due,<br/>
    With Sorrow's cypress wreath your shrine adorn.<br/>
    Scar'd at the light'ning of your lifted spear,<br/>
    The traitor crouch'd, the despot learnt to fear,<br/>
    And tho' thro' seas of blood your ark was driv'n<br/>
    The deluge still was just, the ark belong'd to heaven.</p>
