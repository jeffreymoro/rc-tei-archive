    <p>1815.11<br/><b>Lines written after reading an account of<br/>
    the Late Battle</b><br/>
    “W. A.”<br/><i>The New Monthly Magazine</i>, IV (November 1, 1815), p. 331<br/></p>
    <p>How soon the world's pacific prospects fade<br/>
        And sink in sombre shade.<br/>
    Those joys which lately we with rapture viewed<br/>
            Those peaceful charms;<br/>
            To War's alarms<br/>
            Once more give way;<br/>
    Mad Discord! not sufficiently imbrued<br/>
    With deeds of blood, and cursed destructive power<br/>
    Would still prolong its short remaining hour,<br/>
    Short I should hope, for lo! the embattled plain<br/>
            Proof of its potent sway<br/>
    Lies heaped with myriads of its victims slain.<br/></p>
    <p>Once more the fiend in human form appears,<br/>
        The Monstrous hydra rears<br/>
    His seven-fold, hideous features, to our sight<br/>
            Rebellion thrives,<br/>
            The tyrant strives,<br/>
            But strives in vain<br/>
    To bring his traitorous forces to the fight,<br/>
    He ne'er can cope with England's proudest boast,<br/>
    Who leads to victory, in himself a host,<br/>
    Whose troops are those heroic Britons born,<br/>
            Whom nothing can restrain;<br/>
    Who dare proud Gallia's power, her empty vauntings<br/>
                                    scorn.<br/></p>
    <p>But pause! and contemplate this scene of blood,<br/>
        This endless widowhood,<br/>
    To many a thousand sorrows, joys, and fears:<br/>
            The mother's sighs,<br/>
            The Orphan's cries,<br/>
            The parent's grief,<br/>
    In agonising strains assail our ears—<br/>
    Say then; shall England's sufferers bleed in vain,<br/>
    In this blest land sure no one will refrain<br/>
    To give a pittance to their country's need,<br/>
            Tho' small it gives relief,<br/>
    And heals the wound by want made deep indeed.<br/><br/>
    What tho' my feelings for my country yearn,<br/>
        And claim my first concern,<br/>
    Yet fine supporters of this glorious day,<br/>
            Allied by birth,<br/>
            And every worth,<br/>
            To honour`s cause;<br/>
    Your dauntless prowess shines with brightest ray!<br/>
    And while we sojourn in this world below,<br/>
    May we no discord, no disunion know,<br/>
    Firm to each other, shew mankind like men<br/>
            Support, enjoy our laws,<br/>
    And drive oppression from his murderous den.<br/></p>
