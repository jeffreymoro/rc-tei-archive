    <p>1803.14<br/><b>“The Orphan Sailor-Boy.”</b><br/>
    “Edmund L. Swift, Esq.”<br/>
    [Edmund L. Swift]<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Poetical Register and Repository of Fugitive Poetry</i>, II (1803), pp. 60-63</p>
    <p>                            1.<br/></p>
    <p>TOM HAULYARD was a Seaman brave,<br/>
        Thro' life a gallant Tar was he;<br/>
    His cradle was the rocking wave,<br/>
        His birth-right was the roaring sea:<br/></p>
    <p>                            2.<br/></p>
    <p>Twice thirty years TOM HAULYARD fought,<br/>
        So long a spotless name he bore;<br/>
    Nor e'er the hardy veteran sought<br/>
        Retreat or rest on Britain's shore.<br/></p>
    <p>                            3.<br/></p>
    <p>Three noble Sons around him stood<br/>
        In all the pride of strength and health;<br/>
    And, while each manly form he view'd,<br/>
        Kings might have envied HAULYARD's wealth.<br/></p>
    <p>                            4.<br/></p>
    <p>But, TOM, his namesake, best he lov'd,<br/>
        My father was his eldest joy;<br/>
    Yet well a parent's fondness prov'd<br/>
        The love he bore each darling Boy.—<br/><br/>
                                5.<br/></p>
    <p>Now Britain's foes provok'd the war,<br/>
        And now their fleets usurp'd the tide;<br/>
    And hasten'd now each loyal tar<br/>
        To raise her standard's fearless pride:<br/></p>
    <p>                            6.<br/></p>
    <p>Now in the honor'd ship that bore<br/>
        The auspicious sign of CHARLOTTE's name,<br/>
    Intrepid HOWE from Britain's shore<br/>
        To meet the foes of Britain came.—<br/></p>
    <p>                            7.<br/></p>
    <p>Oh, peace be on the hallow'd tomb<br/>
        Of him who never knew to fear;<br/>
    And ever may his laurels bloom,<br/>
        Bedew'd with Britain's grateful tear!—<br/></p>
    <p>                             8.<br/></p>
    <p>And now advanc'd the daring foe,<br/>
        And now each British heart beat high:—<br/>
    Oh God!—How many wounds must flow,<br/>
        How many Christian men must die!—<br/></p>
    <p>                             9.<br/></p>
    <p>The Squadrons meet—the dread array<br/>
        Stands in a moment's awful pause—<br/>
    Our Chief to Glory leads the way,<br/>
        To Glory gain'd in Britain's cause.—<br/></p>
    <p>                            10.<br/></p>
    <p>Oh Christ!—It was a fearful sight<br/>
        To see the wounds that countless bled;<br/>
    But oh, the horrors of the fight<br/>
        To tell, would wake the sleeping dead!—<br/></p>
    <p>                            11.<br/></p>
    <p>Among the rest TOM HAULYARD stood,<br/>
        Full six feet high the Veteran rose;<br/>
    A rock above the rolling flood,<br/>
        He hurl'd back ruin on his foes.—<br/><br/>
                                12.<br/></p>
    <p>His gallant Sons around him drew<br/>
        The terrors of the flashing sword;<br/>
    While hostile thunders thinn'd the crew,<br/>
        And slaughter swept the lessening board.—<br/></p>
    <p>                            13.<br/></p>
    <p>And now, alas!—One death-wing'd ball<br/>
        On WILLIAM'S bosom urg'd its force;<br/>
    TOM HAULYARD saw his youngest fall,<br/>
        And rush'd to save his darling's corpse.—<br/></p>
    <p>                            14.<br/></p>
    <p>In either Fleet conflicting fires<br/>
        A thousand bloody deaths illume:—<br/>
    Huzza! Huzza!—the foe retires!—<br/>
        But HENRY meets his brother's doom!<br/></p>
    <p>                            15.<br/></p>
    <p>TOM HAULYARD was a Seaman bold,<br/>
        Yet might he weep his children slain;—<br/>
    Down his rough cheek the salt tear roll'd—<br/>
        —But does not namesake TOM remain?—<br/></p>
    <p>                            16.<br/></p>
    <p>Ah no!—beneath the fatal stroke,<br/>
        I saw my gallant father fall!—<br/>
    Then stood alone the aged oak,<br/>
        Stript of his youthful branches all.—<br/></p>
    <p>                            17.<br/></p>
    <p>Nor long he stood—One iron shower,<br/>
        The vengeance of the sinking foe,<br/>
    Burst forth in ruins' desperate hour:—<br/>
        TOM HAULYARD sank beneath the blow.—<br/></p>
    <p>                            18.<br/></p>
    <p>He fell!—And striving hard with death,<br/>
        All bleeding, struggled to embrace<br/>
    His Sons, to catch each parting breath,<br/>
        And dying kiss each pallid face.—<br/><br/>
                                19.<br/></p>
    <p>Even now I hear the Veteran cry,<br/>
        "Oh stay, your Father with ye falls!—<br/>
    "In Britain's cause we nobly die,<br/>
        "And who shall shrink when Britain calls?—<br/></p>
    <p>                            20.<br/></p>
    <p>"But oh, thou GOD, whose heavenly power<br/>
        "Alike can succour and destroy,<br/>
    "Receive us in this awful hour,<br/>
        "And save, oh save this Orphan Boy.—<br/></p>
    <p>                            21.<br/></p>
    <p>"My first-born's Son!"—Serene he smil'd<br/>
        To meet the death that dimm'd his eye;<br/>
    And his last prayer was "Save my Child!"<br/>
        And his last word was "Victory!"—<br/></p>
    <p>                            22.<br/></p>
    <p>Oh, peace be on the hallow'd tomb<br/>
        Of them who never knew to fear;<br/>
    And ever may their laurels bloom,<br/>
        Bedew'd with Britain's grateful tear!—<br/></p>
    <p>                            23.<br/></p>
    <p>But, hapless me!—0f all bereft,<br/>
        Of Father, Friends, of Hope, and Joy!—<br/>
    So young, so lonely am I left—<br/>
        Pity the ORPHAN SAILOR BOY!</p>
