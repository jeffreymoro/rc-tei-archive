    <p>1794.18<br/><b>Epigram</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Cambridge Intelligencer</i> (September 13, 1794)<br/><i>The Poetical Register and Repository of Fugitive Poetry</i> (1809), p. 488</p>
    <p>On hearing that the French had melted down their Saints to<br/>
    purchase Artillery.</p>
    <p>SAYS a Reverend Priest to a less Rev'rend friend,<br/>
    Where at length will the crimes of these French villains<br/>
                                      end,<br/>
    Who their Saints and their Martyrs thus impiously sell,<br/>
    And convert into damnable engines of hell!<br/>
    Prithee why, quoth his friend, are you so much surpriz'd,<br/>
    That Saints have their desert and are all—CANONIZ'D?</p>
