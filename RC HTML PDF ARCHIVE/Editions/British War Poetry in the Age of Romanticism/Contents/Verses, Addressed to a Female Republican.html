    <p>1799.3<br/><b>Verses,</b><b>Addressed to a Female Republican</b><br/>
    "S."<br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, XXXV (January 1799), p. 46<br/></p>
    <p>The world all equal! vain illusion!<br/>
    Think, charming Julia, what confusion<br/>
        Your doctrine would create;<br/>
    The French might then, the day their own,<br/>
    Reform our altar and our throne,<br/>
        And organize the state.<br/></p>
    <p>To reign, by beauty's soft controul,<br/>
    The Sovereign of the captive soul,<br/>
        Would then be public treason;<br/>
    The Queen of Love herself might dread<br/>
    To lose her throne, perhaps her head,<br/>
        In our new "Age of Reason."<br/></p>
    <p>Cease to defend so bad a cause;<br/>
    Should you subvert our good old laws,<br/>
        Yourself too dear would pay;<br/>
    For Chaos then would cover all,<br/>
    Talents and graces prostrate fall,<br/>
        To "Vive l'Egalité"<br/></p>
    <p>If what you say be just and real<br/>
    That all distinction is ideal,<br/>
        Pray stem this mighty evil;<br/>
    Destroy your own pre-eminence,<br/>
    In wit, accomplishments, and sense,<br/>
        And join our humble level.<br/></p>
    <p>Till then, I own, I hope to see<br/>
    Subjects and Kings in peace agree,<br/>
        To earth's remotest border;<br/>
    France once more own Religion's sway,<br/>
    And for the Order of the Day,<br/>
        Restore the days of order.</p>
