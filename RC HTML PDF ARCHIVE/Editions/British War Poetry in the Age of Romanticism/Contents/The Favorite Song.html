    <p>1793.14<br/><b>The Favorite Song</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Star</i> (September 21, 1793), p. 4<br/></p>
    <p>Sung in the Character of a French Cook,<br/>
    by Mr. Wallis,<br/></p>
    <p>(Belonging to the well-known and capital Inn, Called Le Grand Saumon,)<br/></p>
    <p>In the Famous Siege of Valenciennes,<br/></p>
    <p>Now performing at Astley's with unbounded Applause.<br/></p>
    <p>                         I.</p>
    <p>O, dear! what consternation<br/>
    Is in this mad French nation!<br/>
    And mine a pretty station,<br/>
        In Valenciennes me Cook!<br/>
    But Diable a ting to dress—<br/>
    Indeed I do confess:<br/>
    My saucepans are all dusty,<br/>
    My spit is blunt and rusty;<br/>
    And I'm not very lusty—<br/>
        Am I, now pray but look?<br/><br/>
                             II.</p>
    <p>Hark! how the cannons roaring<br/>
    Hot balls and bombs are pouring,<br/>
    Poor Valenciennes devouring,<br/>
        Now mine's a pretty lot!<br/>
    Each corner of the street,<br/>
    A bomb or ball I meet;<br/>
    Besides there be great matter,<br/>
    For all this noise and clatter;<br/>
    Has torn me all to tatter,<br/>
        Sans habit—Sans Culotte!</p>
    <p>                        III.</p>
    <p>Tho' I my country righting,<br/>
    This firing and this fighting,<br/>
    To me is not inviting,<br/>
        I'd rather run away:<br/>
    Those people that they call<br/>
    L'Assembly National;<br/>
    They make such great deal bother<br/>
    About von thing or t'other,<br/>
    I fear my very brother<br/>
        Will cut my throat von day.</p>
    <p>                       IV.</p>
    <p>I hope to this confusion<br/>
    There will be von conclusion;<br/>
    Ne'er be the like delusion,<br/>
        Oh! I would dance and sing<br/>
    May ev'ry Frenchman own<br/>
    Young Louis on the Throne,<br/>
    And may we ever cherish<br/>
    Our Sovereign—love and nourish;<br/>
    How can a nation flourish<br/>
        Without Von Royal King?<a href="#1">[1]</a></p>
