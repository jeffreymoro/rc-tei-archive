    <p>1793.9<br/><b>The Drum</b><br/>
    "Mr. Scott"<br/>
    [John Scott]<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Cambridge Intelligencer</i> (August 3, 1793)<a href="#2">[2]</a></p>
    <p>By the Late Mr. Scott, the Quaker.</p>
    <p>I hate that drum's discordant sound,<br/>
    Parading round, and round, and round:<br/>
    To thoughtless youth it pleasure yields,<br/>
    And lures from cities and from fields,<br/>
    To sell their liberty for charms<br/>
    Of tawdry lace and glitt'ring arms;<br/>
    And when <i>Ambition's</i> voice commands,<br/>
    To fight and fall in foreign lands.</p>
    <p>I hate that drum's discordant sound,<br/>
    Parading round, and round, and round:<br/>
    To me it talks of ravaged plains,<br/>
    And burning towns and ruin'd swains,<br/>
    And mangled limbs, and dying groans,<br/>
    And widow's tears, and orphans moans,<br/>
    And all that <i>Misery's</i> hand bestows,<br/>
    To fill a catalogue of woes.</p>
    <p>    When we read the above lines, we cannot help breathing forth this ardent prayer—Oh that all the world were, in some respects at least,—Quakers!</p>
