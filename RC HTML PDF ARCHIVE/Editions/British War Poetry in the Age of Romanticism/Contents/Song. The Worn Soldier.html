    <p>1808.3<br/><b>Song.<br/>
    The Worn Soldier</b><br/>
    "R. T."<br/><i>The Scots Magazine</i>, LXX (March, 1808), p. 208<br/></p>
    <p>The Queensferry <i>boatie</i> rows light,<br/>
    And light is the heart that it bears,<br/>
    For it brings the worn soldier safe back to his home,<br/>
    From many long toilsome years.<br/></p>
    <p>How sweet are his green native hills,<br/>
    As they smile to the beams of the west,<br/>
    But sweeter by far is the sunshine of hope<br/>
    That gladdens the soldier's breast.<br/></p>
    <p>I can well mark the tears of his joy,<br/>
    As the wave beaten pier he ascends,<br/>
    For already in fancy, he enters his home,<br/>
    'Midst the greetings of tender friends.<br/></p>
    <p>But fled are his visions of bliss,<br/>
    All his transports but rose to deceive,<br/>
    For he found the dear cottage a tenantless waste,<br/>
    And his kindred all sunk to the grave.<br/></p>
    <p>Lend a sigh to the soldier's griefs,<br/>
    For now he is helpless and poor,<br/>
    And, forc'd to solicit a slender relief,<br/>
    He wanders from door to door.<br/></p>
    <p>To him let your answers be mild,<br/>
    And, O! to the suff'rer be kind,<br/>
    For the look of indiff'rence, the frown of disdain,<br/>
    Bear hard on a generous mind.<br/></p>
    <p>
    <i>Paisley.</i>
