1812.6<br/><b>Epigram</b><br/>
Anon<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXXII (November, 1812), p. 472<br/><p>Don Joseph and Marmont<a href="#1">[1]</a> were fill'd with desires,<br/>
To place my Lord Wellington 'twixt their two fires;<br/>
But after much wonderful racket and rout,<br/>
When his Lordship appear'd, both their fires went out.<br/>
No Artillery roar'd, thro' their lines not a puff:<br/>
Yet, though cannon was silent, King Joseph <i>went</i> off.</p>
            <br/>
