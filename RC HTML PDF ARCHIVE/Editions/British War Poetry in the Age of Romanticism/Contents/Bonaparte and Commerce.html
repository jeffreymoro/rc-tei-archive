    <p>1810.9<br/><b>Bonaparte and Commerce</b><br/>
    “Hafiz”<br/>
    [Thomas Stott]<br/><i>The Morning Post</i> (November 20, 1810)<br/></p>
    <p>A Dialogue.<br/>
                      _____<br/></p>
    <p>              BONAPARTE.<br/></p>
    <p>Who art thou with front so bold,<br/>
        My imperial will opposing?<br/>
    Caitiff? hast thou not been told,<br/>
        I'm all ports against thee closing?<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    Miscreant! think not to evade<br/>
        My decrees and sov'reign pleasure!<br/>
    War is now my only trade,<br/>
        Terror my compulsive measure.<a href="#2">[2]</a><br/></p>
    <p>              COMMERCE.<br/></p>
    <p>Tyrant! I've been often told<br/>
        Of thy rancour, fury, madness!<br/>
    But to hear thee rage and scold,<br/>
        Ne'er shall sink me into sadness.<br/>
    Thunder then thy fierce decrees,<br/>
        Be thy barbarous triumphs vaunted,<br/>
    While BRITANNIA rules the seas,<br/>
        Vandal! I remain undaunted.<br/></p>
    <p>              BONAPARTE.<br/></p>
    <p>Death and hell! what do I hear!<br/>
        Varlet! scoundrel! robber! ruffian!<br/>
    Off!—or from my fist thine ear<br/>
        Shall receive imperial cuffing.<br/>
    Bring me faggots! bring me fire!<br/>
        Coffee—sugar—broadcloth—fustian,<br/>
    Piled in one commingled pyre,<br/>
        I devote now to—combustion!<br/></p>
    <p>              COMMERCE.<br/></p>
    <p>Burn away, my Bullyrock!<br/>
        Burn away!—<i>the goods are paid for</i>—<br/>
    Quick consumption of the stock,<br/>
        Merchants know is good their trade for.<br/>
    Yet I pity the poor slaves<br/>
        Who must always pay the piper,<br/>
    When thy fiery passion raves,<br/>
        O thou most malicious viper!</p>

However, British goods continued to reach France through various means, mostly by smuggling them in from the Baltic countries.</span>

The decree of Fontainbleau on October 10, 1810, prescribed sentences of ten years imprisonment and branding for the smuggling of British manufactures. All goods illegally imported were subject to confiscation; colonial produce was to be sold by the state and manufactured goods were to be publicly destroyed. These measures precipitated the crisis of 1811.</span>
