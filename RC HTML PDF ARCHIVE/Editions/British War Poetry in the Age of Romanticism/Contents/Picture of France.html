    <p>1805.1<br/><b>Picture of France</b><br/>
    "O, L, E, O, N."<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXV (February 1805), p. 159<br/></p>
    <p>                  Oh!! Liberty's cap,<br/>
                      Beware of mishap<br/>
                      From taking a NAP!!!<br/></p>
    <p>The French are so lull'd by their Corsican <i>Nap</i>!!!<br/>
    That they've swallowed a crown, and lost the red cap,<br/>
    Which on poles hung in air they once saw in a trance,<br/>
    As the emblem of Liberty, rooted in France.<br/></p>
    <p>This cap is not model'd in fashion or shape,<br/>
    To set off the noddle of Tiger or Ape.<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    The former first tried it, but found the words good,<br/>
    Which enrag'd him so much that he drench'd it in blood.<br/></p>
    <p>Weak and lank from his frolic, he threw the cap by,<br/>
    Which the Ape picking up, plac'd just over one eye.<br/>
    Though so smart now his phiz it became not the cap,<br/>
    So 'twas seiz'd, and destroy'd whilst enjoying their NAP—</p>
