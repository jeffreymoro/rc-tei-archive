    <p>1793.18<br/><b>Translation of "Pax Bello Potior,"<br/>
    A Latin Poem, in the European<br/>
    Magazine for July 1793.<br/>
    Peace More Desirable Than War.</b><br/>
    "W. R. N."<br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, XXIV (October 1793), p. 301</p>
    <p>Grant us, O God! great Ruler of the Skies!<br/>
        That which our love to thee will much increase,<br/>
    The source from which life's choicest treasures rise,<br/>
        The first of human blessings,—heav'n-born <i>Peace</i>.</p>
    <p>Beneath her shade Science her views extends,<br/>
        Cities and people with their laws improve;<br/>
    Justice, her sister Virtue's rights defends,<br/>
        And reigns with them in dignity and love.</p>
    <p>But where mad War is, thence no good can spring,<br/>
        The Laws grow dumb, Religion dormant lies;<br/>
    Probity feels, alas! a venom'd sting,<br/>
        Droops her fair form, and disregarded dies.</p>
    <p>May Heaven favour this our native land,<br/>
        Each social blessing may her sons enjoy;<br/>
    May <i>George</i> with golden Peace reign hand in hand,<br/>
        His power of doing good with zeal employ.</p>
