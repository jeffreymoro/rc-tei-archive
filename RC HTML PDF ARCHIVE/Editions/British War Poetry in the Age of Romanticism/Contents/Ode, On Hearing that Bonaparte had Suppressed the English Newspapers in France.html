    <p>1802.9<br/><b>Ode,<br/>
    On Hearing that Bonaparte had Suppressed the<br/>
    English Newspapers in France</b><br/>
    “Rusticus”<br/>
    Robert Dinsmoore or Rev. Samuel Denne<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, XLII (September 1802), pp. 219-220<br/></p>
    <p>When <i>Liberty</i> in <i>France</i> appear'd,<br/>
    And first her brazen standard rear'd,<br/>
        "Huzza!" cried Bonaparte;<br/>
    "We now shall be sublimely bless'd!"<br/>
    Then clasp'd her to his panting breast,<br/>
        And gave her all his heart;<br/>
    Arm'd his small body cap-â-pie,<br/>
    The Errant-Knight of <i>Liberty</i>.<br/></p>
    <p>Away he flew, from clime to clime,<br/>
    Unmindful of the lapse of time,<br/>
        With millions in his train!<br/>
    For <i>Liberty</i> alone he fought!<br/>
    And deem'd no victory dearly bought,<br/>
        Her glorious cause to gain;<br/>
    Whilst, in his van, arose a tree,<br/>
    Inscribed with "<i>Vive la Liberté</i>!"<br/></p>
    <p>O'er the wide world, in ev'ry zone,<br/>
    This nymph had sisters of her own,<br/>
        Bred in each various sphere.<br/>
    One in <i>Helvetia</i> liv'd, so blest!<br/>
    But O! the loveliest, and the best,<br/>
        Hath fix 'd her cottage here!<br/><i>Here</i>, safe beneath <i>Britannia's</i> eye,<br/>
    Dwells the first-born of <i>Liberty</i>!<br/></p>
    <p>Now <i>Bonaparte</i>, that wond'rous blade,<br/>
    Chose out the most vivacious maid<br/>
        Of all the sisters fair;<br/>
    Admir'd her spirit and her eye,<br/>
    From which ten thousand lightnings fly,<br/>
        And eke her martial air!<br/>
    Ah! little thought poor <i>Bon</i>. that she<br/>
    Was the spoilt child of <i>Liberty</i>.<br/></p>
    <p>For her, regardless of their breath,<br/>
    What thousands were consign'd to death,<br/>
        By night, and eke by day!<br/>
    "Whilst <i>Pity</i>, from her soft abode,<br/>
    O'ertook him on his blood-stain'd road,<br/>
        "To <i>look</i> his rage away."<a href="#2">[2]</a><br/>
    In vain! he spurn'd her tender plea,<br/>
    Devoted all to <i>Liberty</i>.<br/></p>
    <p>An enemy to all mankind,<br/>
    He left a plunder'd world behind,<br/>
        To execrate his name!<br/>
    Hark! how <i>Helvetia, Venice, Rome</i>,<br/>
    Lament their melancholy doom!<br/>
        Hark! thousands mourn the same!<br/>
    And yet, "I come to make ye free,"<br/>
    Exclaim'd this man of <i>Liberty</i>!<br/></p>
    <p>The <i>Turks</i> sublime, as travellers tell,<br/>
    Retain a custom, sprung from hell,<br/>
        By which, when Selim<a href="#3">[3]</a> dies,<br/>
    His eldest son, a Prince no more,<br/>
    Kills all his brothers by the score,<br/>
        Or puts out all their eyes.<br/>
    Safe policy! condemn'd to be<br/>
    The offspring of <i>French Liberty</i>!<br/></p>
    <p>So <i>Bon</i>. resolv'd to be as free,<br/>
    Wher'er he found a Liberty,<br/>
        He cut the Lady's throat!<br/>
    "<i>My Liberty</i> alone shall thrive,<br/>
    "Alone <i>my</i> much-lov'd maid shall live,"<br/>
        He bawl'd, in thund'ring note!<br/>
    Then cried, "My friends! in me ye see<br/>
    "Th' adorer of <i>sweet Liberty</i>!"<br/></p>
    <p>But when, at length, to bless his life,<br/><i>Miss Liberty</i> became his wife,<br/>
        He soon found, to his cost,<br/>
    She was the most unruly jade,<br/>
    And car'd not what she did, or said,<br/>
        If once her whims were cross'd!<br/>
    For Gallic Ladies can't be free,<br/>
    'Till unrestrain'd in <i>Liberty</i>.<br/></p>
    <p>What could be done? between the two,<br/>
    There was the devil and all to do,<br/>
        Who still should be the master!<br/>
    For Ma'am so kick'd, and bounc'd, and<br/>
                        swore,<br/>
    That <i>Bon</i>. who never <i>fear'd</i> before,<br/>
        Now <i>fear'd</i> some dire disaster!<br/>
    And oft he bent the lowly knee,<br/>
    In hopes to soothe Ma'am <i>Liberty</i>!<br/></p>
    <p>At last, his expectations o'er,<br/>
    His <i>Corsic</i> soul could bear no more,<br/>
        So he resolv'd to bind her;<br/>
    So, seizing Madam by the neck,<br/>
    He rudely threw her on her back,<br/>
        And tied her hands behind her!<br/>
    Exclaiming, "What is this I see"<br/>
    "Is this my once-lov'd <i>Liberty</i>?"<br/></p>
    <p>And now, within the gloom of night,<br/>
    He hears her sorrows with affright,<br/>
        And mourns his hasty choice!<br/>
    Uplifts his ever-wakeful head,<br/>
    From <i>murder'd Bourbon's</i> costly bed,<br/>
        And trembles at her voice!<br/>
    Arise! ye shades of millions dead,<br/>
    And shield the maid for whom ye bled!<br/></p>
    <p>One other maid, of all that name,<br/>
    Escap'd his persecuting flame!<br/>
        She dwells on <i>Britain's shore</i>!<br/>
    Nor can his arms, nor wretched arts,<br/>
    Hurl to her breast those cruel darts<br/>
        Her sisters felt before!<br/>
    Ah! see, she droops her pensive head,<br/>
    And weeps her lovely sisters dead!<br/></p>
    <p>The mild reproofs, and murmurs free,<br/>
    Which fall, <i>O British Maid!</i> from thee,<br/><i>    Bon</i>. hears with sad surprise!<br/>
    Then bids his mighty thunders roar<br/>
    Along his wide-extending shore,<br/>
        To drown thy tender sighs;<br/>
    And threats his <i>happy Gauls</i>, who dare<br/>
    Echo thy plaints, or urge thy pray'r!<br/></p>
    <p>Hail, <i>blissful Gaul</i>! hail, land so dear!<br/>
    Where none must speak, where none must hear,<br/>
        Except whilst air-ballooning!<br/>
    Behold a nation prostrate lies!<br/>
    Behold another Louis<a href="#4">[4]</a> rise,<br/>
        By <i>Sultan-like dragooning!</i><br/>
    Arise! ye shades of millions dead,<br/>
    And save the maid for whom ye bled!<br/></p>
