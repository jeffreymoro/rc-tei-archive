    <p>1797.6<br/><b>Soldier BOB RUSTY’S Night Cap</b><br/>
    “A. Rambler”<br/>
    [Capt. Jos. Badworth]<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, LXVII (July 1797), pp. 597-8<br/></p>
    <p>Bob Rusty, who ne'er a rupee got<br/>
    (He roundly swears that he ought not,)<br/>
        Is in his hammock pent.<br/>
    Safe moor'd, he hugs his swinging-bed,<br/>
    Without a rag to bind his head,<br/>
        Bob's night cap is CONTENT.<br/><br/>
    Tho' storms arise, if calm at <i>home</i>,<br/>
    Man may to any region roam,<br/>
        'Tis but a period lent.<br/>
    Who sees the gath'ring tempest near<br/>
    Wishes it past, but not from fear,<br/>
        His night cap is—content.<br/></p>
    <p>Shou'd nightly winds indignant roar,<br/>
    Midst rocks and breakers, a lee shore,<br/>
        The blood still calmly flows.<br/>
    Where wanted he alertly flies,<br/>
    Weathers all dangers from the skies,<br/>
        His anchor—self-repose.<br/></p>
    <p>When, 'midst the thunder-bolts of war,<br/>
    And there too not without a fear,<br/>
        None e'er knew Bob lament.<br/>
    For, soldier-hearts of British steel<br/>
    Care not for Fortune's fickle wheel,<br/>
        But are, like Bob content.<br/></p>
    <p>And many a time Bob takes his glass,<br/>
    Of course, he toasts a fav'rite lass,<br/>
        "The sweetest Heav'n e'er sent:<br/>
    "If she proves faithful to her vow,"<br/>
    (He says) "She soon shall find, as how,<br/>
        "Bob's night-cap is content."<br/></p>
    <p>If she proves false, he then declares<br/>
    He shall be rid of many cares,<br/>
        Would be where'er he went.<br/>
    Then will he take another roam,<br/>
    Still bearing with him his own home,<br/>
        Bob's night-cap is CONTENT.<br/></p>
    <p>What more would mortal have,<br/><i>Journeying</i> on this side the grave,<br/>
        Than such a happy bent.<br/>
    My fellow-soldiers, scorn old Care,<br/>
    That certain ladder to despair,<br/>
        And be, like Bob, Content.</p>
