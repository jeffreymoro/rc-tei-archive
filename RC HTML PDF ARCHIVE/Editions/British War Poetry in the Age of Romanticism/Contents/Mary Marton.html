    <p>1807.2<br/><b>Mary Marton<br/>
    A Ballad.</b><br/>
    John Mayne <a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXVII (February 1807), p. 156<br/></p>
    <p>Poor WILLIAM was landed at bonny Dumbarton,<br/>
        Where the streams from Lochlomond run into the sea;<br/>
    At home, in sweet Ireland, he left MARY MARTON,<br/>
        With a child at her foot, and a babe on her knee.<br/>
    The Regiment march'd off when the passage was over;<br/>
        The route was for England, by land all the way;<br/>
    No, never to halt; but, at Ramsgate or Dover,<br/>
        Embark in the vessels that were in the Bay.<br/></p>
    <p>Fond MARY, the while, in her spirits quite broken,<br/>
        Disturb'd in her sleep, and perplex'd in her mind,<br/>
    No letters from WILLIAM, no tidings, no token,<br/>
        Resolv'd, at all hazards, her Hero to find.<br/>
    O! what, in this world, can deter a true Lover?<br/>
        It is not long journies by land or by sea.<br/>
    'Tween hope and despair, in a boat without cover,<br/>
        She cross'd to Port Patrick from Donaghadee!<br/></p>
    <p>The Irish are true to Humanity's claims,<br/>
        And the Scots and the English are never unkind;<br/>
    Poor MARY found friends from the Boyne to the Thames.<br/>
        As she trudg'd with her babes in a wallet behind!<br/>
    Arriv'd at the coast—by her sorrowful tale,<br/>
        She soften'd the Captain to let her on board;<br/>
    And never, O! never, did mariner sail<br/>
        With a couple like WILLIAM to MARY restor'd!<br/></p>
    <p>When he press'd to his bosom his infants and wife,<br/>
        The Sailors gave way to a tear, and no more;<br/>
    The Soldiers danc'd round to the drum and the fife,<br/>
        And plaudits were heard from the people on shore:<br/>
    Then away went the fleet—and, sailing with glee,<br/>
        May Glory, in battle, be ever at hand;<br/>
    May Britons live happy, united, and free,<br/>
        Supreme on the ocean, unconquer'd by land!<br/></p>

                <span class="footnote_text">1. A Scottish poet, Mayne began his career as a printer in the office of the <i>Dumfries Journal</i>. He went to London in 1787 where he became proprietor and joint editor of <i>The</i><i>Star</i>. His long poem, <i>Siller Gun</i>, expanded over a period 1777-1836, was considered by Walter Scott to be superior to anything of Ferguson and close to Burns (<i>Lady of the Lake</i>, v. 20.).</span></p>
