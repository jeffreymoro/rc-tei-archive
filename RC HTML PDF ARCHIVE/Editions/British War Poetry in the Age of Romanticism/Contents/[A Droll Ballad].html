    <p>1815.4<br/><b>[A Droll Ballad]</b><a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXXV (March 1815), p. 259<br/></p>
    <p>Buonaparte he would set out<br/>
        For a summer excursion to Moscow,<br/>
    The fields were green, and the sky was blue,<br/>
        Morbleu! Parbleu!<br/>
    What a pleasant excursion to Moscow!<br/><br/>
    Four hundred thousand men and more,<br/>
        Heigh-ho for Moscow!<br/>
    There were marshals by the dozen, and Dukes<br/>
                            by the score,<br/>
    Princes a few, and Kings one or two,<br/>
    While the fields were so green, and the sky so blue,<br/>
        Morbleu! Parbleu!<br/>
    What a pleasant excursion to Moscow!<br/></p>
    <p>There was Junot and Augereau,<br/>
        Heigh-ho for Moscow!<br/>
    Dombrowsky and Poniatowsky,<br/>
    General Rap and Emperor Nap:<br/>
        Nothing would do,<br/>
    While the fields were so green, and the sky<br/>
                            so blue,<br/>
        Morbleu! Parbleu!<br/>
    But they must be marching to Moscow.<br/></p>
    <p>But then, the Russians they turn'd too,<br/>
        All on the road to Moscow;<br/>
    Nap had to fight his way all through—<br/>
    They could fight, but they could not <i>parlez vous;</i><br/>
    But the fields were green, and the sky was blue,<br/>
        Morbleu! Parbleu!<br/>
    And so he got to Moscow.<br/></p>
    <p>They made the place too hot for him,<br/>
        For they set fire to Moscow;<br/>
    To get there had cost him much ado,<br/>
    And then no better course he knew,<br/>
    While the fields were green, and the sky was blue,<br/>
        Morbleu! Parbleu!<br/>
    Than to march back again from Moscow.<br/></p>
    <p>The Russians they stuck close to him<br/>
        All on the road from Moscow;<br/>
    There was Tormazow and Jemalow,<br/>
    And all the others that end in <i>ow</i>;<br/>
    Rejesky and Noveresky,<br/>
    And all the others that end in <i>esky</i>;<br/>
    Schamscheff, Sonchosaneff, and Schepeleff,<br/>
    And all the others that end in <i>eff</i>;<br/>
    Wasiltschikoff, Kostomaroff, and Tchoglokoff,<br/>
    And all the others that end in <i>off</i>;<br/>
    Milaradovitch, and Jaladovitch, and Karatchowitch,<br/>
    And all the others that end in <i>itch</i>;<br/>
    Oscharoffsky, Kostoffsky, and Kazatichoffsky<br/>
    And all the others that end in <i>offsky</i>.<br/><br/>
    And last of all an Admiral came,<br/>
    A terrible Hun, with a terrible name,<br/>
    A name which you all must know very well<br/>
    Nobody can speak, and nobody can spell:<br/>
        And Platoff he play'd them off,<br/>
        And Markoff he mark'd them off,<br/>
        And Touchkoff he touch'd them off,<br/>
        And Kutousoff he cut them off,<br/>
        And Woronzoff he worried them off,<br/>
        And Dochtoroff he doctor'd them off,<br/>
        And Rodinoff he flogg'd them off;<br/>
    They stuck close to him with all their might,<br/>
    They were on the left, and on the right,<br/>
    Behind and before, by day and by night;<br/>
    Nap would rather <i>parlez vous</i> than fight—<br/>
    But <i>parlez vous</i> no more would do,<br/>
        Morbleu! Parbleu!<br/>
    For they remember'd Moscow.<br/></p>
    <p>And then came on the frost and snow,<br/>
        All on the road from Moscow;<br/>
    The Emperor Nap found as he went<br/>
    That he was not quite omnipotent;<br/>
    And worse and worse the weather grew,<br/>
    The fields were so <i>white</i>, and the sky so blue,<br/>
        Cacubleu! Ventrebleu!<br/>
    What a terrible journey from Moscow!<br/></p>
    <p>The Devil take the hindmost<br/>
        All on the road from Moscow<br/>
    Quoth Nap, who thought it small delight<br/>
    To fight all day, and freeze all night,<br/>
    And so, not knowing what else to do,<br/>
    When the fields were so white, and the sky so blue,<br/>
        Morbleu! Parbleu!<br/>
    He stole away—I tell you true—<br/>
    All on the road from Moscow.<br/>
    'Twas as much too cold upon the road,<br/>
        As it was too hot at Moscow,<br/>
    But there is a place where he must go to,<br/>
    Where the fire is red, and the brimstone blue;<br/>
        Morbleu! Parbleu!<br/>
    He'll find it hotter than Moscow.</p>
