    <p>1795.5<br/><b>Ode<br/>
    On the Present Times,<br/>
    27th January 1795</b><br/>
    "N."<br/>
    [Amelia Alderson Opie]<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Cabinet</i>, II (1795), pp. 92-94</p>
    <p>    Lo! Winter drives his horrors round;<br/>
            Wide o'er the rugged soil they fly;<br/>
        In their cold spells each stream is bound,<br/>
            While at the magic of their eye<br/>
    Each sign of Spring's gay beauty fades,<br/>
    And one white wild the aching sight invades.<br/>
    It is the time for Woe to reign,<br/>
    And hark! she bids her haggard train,<br/>
    Pale poverty and want, appear,<br/>
    Disease, their darling child, draw near,<br/>
    And, grateful for the favouring hour,<br/>
    They feel, they seize, they riot, in their power.<br/>
        But Winter! not to thee alone<br/>
            Their heart-appalling sway they owe,<br/>
        For they to war's despotic throne<br/>
            As tributary subjects bow;<br/>
    War, who bids trembling Europe gasp,<br/>
    With wild convulsions in his bloody grasp.<br/>
        Whence yonder groans? O wretched land!<br/>
            Poland, from thee, alas! they came,<br/>
        A despot speaks, and lo! a band,<br/>
            Blaspheming pure Religion's name,<br/>
    Bid cold, deliberate murder live,<br/>
    And death's dread stroke to helpless thousands give.<br/>
    And see, on Belgia's reeking plain,<br/>
    Alternate horrors rise and reign!<br/>
    What mingled sounds affright the ear!<br/>
    Now, we the song of victory hear,<br/>
    And now, despair's appalling tone,<br/>
    And now, of <i>death</i> the deep sepulchral groan.<br/>
        Freedom! for whose dear sake I'd dare<br/>
            Each various ill that tortures life,<br/>
        Though I thy matchless victories share,<br/>
            While, towering 'midst the bloody strife,<br/>
    I see thy form sublime, acquire<br/>
    New power to charm, new beauty to inspire;<br/>
        I cannot smile; I cannot join<br/>
            The song of triumph; tho' thy foes,<br/>
        Celestial power! are also mine;<br/>
            And tho' I weep for all thy woes,<br/>
        Yet I thy <i>triumphs</i> too must weep,<br/>
        And in my tears thy bloody laurels steep.<br/>
    For who are they that madly bear<br/>
    Against thy sons the venal spear?<br/>
    Are they not men?—then say, what power<br/>
    Can bid my bosom mourn no more;<br/>
    O where's the fiend-delighting ban<br/>
    Forbidding MAN to weep for SLAUGHTERED MAN!<br/>
        E'en Victory, when reflection's voice<br/>
            Breathes in her ear 'thy brothers die,'<br/>
        Shall bid her sons no more rejoice,<br/>
            But change her shouts for pity's sigh:<br/>
    She will her breast in anguish beat,<br/>
    And wear the sombrous aspect of <i>defeat</i>.<br/>
        O Britain! ill-starred land! no more<br/>
            Must Peace to thee her olive bear,<br/>
        But on thy once-triumphant shore,<br/>
            Must we behold the form of fear<br/>
    Expecting, on the swelling tide,<br/>
    To see the FOE in proud defiance ride!<br/>
    Avert the threatening, awful ill;<br/>
    For fraught with power, and fraught with will<br/>
    To make thy hardiest veterans die,<br/>
    A lurking fiend, alas! is nigh,<br/>
    Who threatens on thy sons to pour<br/>
    The fatal cloud thou bad'st on GALLIA lower.<br/>
        Lo! FAMINE spreads her banners wide;<a href="#2">[2]</a><br/>
            She comes arrayed in horrid state;<br/>
        But, not to humble Gallia's pride,<br/>
            And on the rear of <i>victory</i> wait;<br/>
    She comes the <i>humbled</i> to subdue,<br/>
    And twine round <i>fading</i> wreaths, death's baleful yew.<br/>
    She comes to Britain!—at the thought,<br/>
    Winter! thy scene with horrors fraught,<br/>
    Fades from my sight—the present ill<br/>
    Appears to lose its power to kill:<br/>
    To <i>future</i> scenes pale Fancy flies,<br/>
    Lifts her dim tearful eyes to heaven, and dies.</p>
