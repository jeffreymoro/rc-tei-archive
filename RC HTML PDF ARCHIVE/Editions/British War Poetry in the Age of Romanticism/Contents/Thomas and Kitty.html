<p>1796.4<br/><b>Thomas and Kitty</b><br/>
    "Scoto-Britannus"<br/><i>The Courier</i> (January 22, 1796)<br/></p>
<p>Far on Batavia's sea-beat shore,<br/>
        On a bleak rock and bare,<br/>
    The widow'd Kitty sat, and tore<br/>
        Her dark brown hair.<br/>
    A little fondling at her breast<br/>
        She strove to soothe to peace,<br/>
    As he her cold and bloodless nipple prest.<br/>
        Alas! when shall my sorrows cease?<br/>
    When shall the storm be o'er?<br/>
        And in my clay-cold bed<br/>
        This weary, aching head be laid,<br/>
    Where I shall grieve no more!<br/></p>
<p>Now Kitty once, of fairest nymphs most fair,<br/>
        And Thomas gayest of his gay compeers,<br/>
    Had pledg'd their faith a mutual fate to share,<br/>
        And hope had look'd for many happy years.<br/>
    His little ALL he hazarded in trade;<br/>
        But, cruelly by Fortune cross'd,<br/>
        That little ALL in trade he lost,<br/>
    By a false friend betray'd.<br/>
    Now dunn'd with all the rigour of the law,<br/>
        Tom, as the clouds began to form,<br/>
    The horrors of a jail foresaw:<br/>
        And oft would Kitty's tearful eye<br/>
        Extort a tender sigh,<br/>
    And make him wish some shelter from the storm.<br/></p>
<p>Poor shelter! with the vengeful blade,<br/>
    To aid the slaughter Death had made,<br/>
    He plow'd the wave with daring mind;<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    Nor would his much-lov'd Kitty stay behind,<br/>
    But to that foreign land would go,<br/>
    Where he was doom'd to face the maddening foe.<br/>
    Here, brought from Gallia's wide domain,<br/>
        War had his bloody eagle born:<br/>
    Her Thomas fell among the slain,<br/>
        And Kitty she was left to mourn.<br/></p>
<p>O'er his pale bloody corpse she hung,<br/>
    Her heart with every sorrow wrung:<br/>
    And now she grasp'd his cold, cold hand,<br/>
        And now she kiss'd his cheek so pale:<br/>
        And oft the day she did bewail<br/>
    That e'er she left her native land:<br/>
        Her mind foreboding many fears,<br/>
    She cross'd the wasteful ocean wild;<br/>
        And now of every stay bereft,<br/>
        To the hard world's mercy left—<br/>
    And then she hugg'd her infant child,<br/>
        And bursted into tears.<br/></p>
<p>O Thomas! 'twas a dreary day<br/>
        Thou left thy native home,<br/>
        In foreign parts to roam;<br/>
    And now on the cold clay,<br/>
        Beat by the winds so chill and drear,<br/>
            Thou lay'st thy manly head<br/>
            Among the nameless dead,<br/>
    Unwept by any friendly tear,<br/>
        But those thy Kate has shed.<br/></p>
<p>    Ah me! the bitter blast!<br/>
    Cease, cease, my little babe, to cry,<br/>
    The world is wide for thee and I:<br/>
        Soon shall the storm be past.<br/>
    Thy little limbs I shall infold;<br/>
    And shield thee from the cold,<br/>
        No wind, tho' e'er so chill and drear,<br/>
        Shall harm my little dear.<br/></p>
<p>Ah! thou too hastenest to thy grave,<br/>
        I see, I see Death in thine eye:<br/>
    Thy mammy's fondness cannot save,<br/>
        For ah! her breast is cold and dry.<br/>
        —But all shall soon be o'er,<br/>
        And I shall grieve no more.<br/></p>
<p>Now, rage ye winds! 'tis but on me,<br/>
        Pour on, ye rains—Ye thunders, reel!<br/>
        My baby sleeps too sound to feel.<br/>
            Drench'd with the rain,<br/>
        I'll lay me by my Tom once more,<br/>
        Tho' louder still the tempests roar,<br/>
            And all the biting blasts sustain.<br/></p>
<p>—Ah me! my shivering, fainting heart!<br/>
    My Tom! my Tom! we shall not part.<br/>
        Far from our home, from friends afar,<br/>
            My Tom, my little babe, and I<br/>
        Shall rest in one cold bed—Ah! ruthless War!<br/>
            My heart!—O Heaven!—I faint, I die.<br/></p>
