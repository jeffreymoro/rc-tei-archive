    <p>1795.10<br/><b>Sonnet to W. Wilberforce</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Cambridge Intelligencer</i> (February 28, 1795)<br/></p>
    <p>February 28, 1795.</p>
    <p>Hail, Wilberforce!<a href="#1">[1]</a> pursue thy glorious plan,<br/>
        Unbought defender of thy kind! proceed.<br/>
    Still teach a guilty Court the <i>Rights of Man</i>;<br/>
        Not made to suffer only, and to bleed—<br/>
    Though he has bled of late, and largely too,<br/>
        At their command.—Tell them that GOD design'd<br/>
    A nobler object when he made mankind,<br/>
        And trace the noble purpose to their view.<br/>
    Inculcate <i>Faith</i>, and <i>Hope</i>, and <i>Charity</i>;<br/>
        To soothe <i>Revenge</i>, and quell resisting pride.<br/>
    Shew them how JESUS liv'd, and bid them see<br/>
        (Still more illustrious lesson!) how he died!<br/>
    There let them learn, that Man was made for Peace,<br/>
        So shall the fury of the battle cease.</p>

                <span class="footnote_text">1. William Wilberforce (1759-1833), philanthropist and crusader against slavery, founded the "Proclamation Society" in 1787 to rid society of vice. Although a close friend of Pitt, Wilberforce opposed the war with France and considered peace to be possible after the fall of Robespierre. As a member of the House of Commons from Hull, he rose to speak in favor of Grey's motion for peace on January 26, 1795. Wilberforce, however, was a staunch anti-Jacobin and supported the coercive measures against radical groups in 1795.</span>
