    <p>1807.4<br/><b>To the Inhabitants of the British Empire,<br/><i>On the present critical and singular Conjuncture<br/>
    of Affairs</i></b><br/>
    "Britannicus" <a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, LII (July, 1807), p. 53<br/></p>
    <p>The CHOSEN YOUTH shall faint; the STRONG shall fall;<br/>
    Bow THE HIGH TOW'R, THE FIRM-COMPACTED WALL;<br/>
    But THEY who in THE LORD their trust repose,<br/>
    Shall gather strength to vanquish all their foes:<br/>
    Like feathers in the moulting eagle's wing,<br/>
    Shall hope renew'd within their bosoms spring;<br/>
    Unwearied shall they move with stedfast aim;<br/>
    Nought shall THEM turn aside, or bring to shame:<br/>
    THEIR GOD SHALL RISE, HIS SERVANTS' CAUSE TO PLEAD:<br/>
    Their SURE PROTECTOR HE in time of need:<br/>
    Let them, UNDOUBTING, on HIS AID rely,<br/>
    Nor fear the failure of the wish'd supply.<br/>
                                       ISAIAH, chap. xl<br/>
                 Paraphrased by BRITANNICUS.<br/></p>

A letter to the editor from the author carries the following statement:"The enemy is indeed now become paramount lord of all Europe, excepting the British Islands; and of all Asia, excepting India, China, and Japan: yet is the strength of the British empire unimpair'd, and capable of opposing his colossal power, with every prospect of success, while acting on the defensive."</span>
