    <p>1799.2<br/><b>The Soldier's Funeral</b><a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    Robert Southey<br/><i>The Annual Anthology,</i> I (1799), pp. 269-271<br/></p>
    <p>It is the funeral march. I did not think<br/>
    That there had been such magic in sweet sounds!<br/>
    Hark! from the blacken'd cymbal that dead tone—<br/>
    It awes the very rabble multitude,<br/>
    They follow silently, their earnest brows<br/>
    Lifted in solemn thought. 'Tis not the pomp<br/>
    And pageantry of death that with such force<br/>
    Arrests the sense,—the mute and mourning train,<br/>
    The white plume nodding o'er the sable hearse,<br/>
    Had past unheeded, or perchance awoke<br/>
    A serious smile upon the poor man's cheek<br/>
    At pride's last triumph. Now these measur'd sounds<br/>
    This universal language, to the heart<br/>
    Speak instant, and on all these various minds<br/>
    Compel one feeling.<br/></p>
    <p>                                    But such better thoughts<br/>
    Will pass away, how soon! and there who here<br/>
    Are following their dead comrade to the grave,<br/>
    Ere the night fall, will in their revelry<br/>
    Quench all remembrance. From the ties of life<br/>
    Unnaturally rent, a man who knew<br/>
    No resting place, no dear delights of home,<br/>
    Belike who never saw his children's face,<br/>
    Whose children knew no father, he is gone,<br/>
    Dropt from existence, like the withered leaf<br/>
    That from the summer tree is swept away,<br/>
    Its loss unseen. She hears not of his death<br/>
    Who bore him, and already for her son<br/>
    Her tears of bitterness are shed: when first<br/>
    He had put on the livery of blood,<br/>
    She wept him dead to her.<br/></p>
    <p>                                    We are indeed<br/>
    Clay in the potter's hand! one favour'd mind<br/>
    Scarce lower than the Angels, shall explore<br/>
    The ways of Nature, whilst his fellow-man<br/>
    Fram'd with like miracle the work of God,<br/>
    Must as the unreasonable beast drag on<br/>
    A life of labour, like this soldier here,<br/>
    His wonderous faculties bestow'd in vain,<br/>
    Be moulded by his fate till be becomes<br/>
    A mere machine of murder.<br/></p>
    <p>                                  And there are<br/>
    Who say that this is well! as God had made<br/>
    All things for man's good pleasure, so of men<br/>
    The many for the few! Court-moralists,<br/>
    Reverend lip-comforters that once a week<br/>
    Proclaim how blessed are the poor, for they<br/>
    Shall have their wealth hereafter, and tho' now<br/>
    Toiling and troubled, tho' they pick the crumbs<br/>
    That from the rich man's table fall, at length<br/>
    In Abraham's bosom rest with Lazarus.<br/>
    Themselves meantime secure their good things here<br/>
    And dine with Dives. These are they O Lord!<br/>
    Who in thy plain and simple gospel see<br/>
    All mysteries, but who find no peace enjoined,<br/>
    No brotherhood, no wrath denounced on them<br/>
    Who shed their brethren's blood,—blind at noon day<br/>
    As owls, lynx-eyed in darkness!<br/></p>
    <p>                                  O my God!<br/>
    I thank thee that I am not such as these<br/>
    I thank thee for the eye that sees, the heart<br/>
    That feels, the voice that in these evil days<br/>
    That amid evil tongues, exalts itself<br/>
    And cries aloud against the iniquity.</p>
