    <p>1808.6<br/><b>The New French Grammar Analysed</b><br/>
    "Hafiz"<br/>
    [Thomas Stott]<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine,</i> LXXVIII (May, 1808), pp. 439-440<br/><i>The Hull Packet</i> (April 25, 1809)<br/></p>
    <p>Ye Preceptors, no longer perplex Pupil's senses,<br/>
    With old systems of <i>Cases, Moods, Genders</i>, and <i>Tenses</i>—<br/>
    Napoleon's <i>Construction</i> is now the new book,<br/>
    On which Master and Pupil should studiously look;<br/></p>
    <p>For if they neglect it, in spite of their rules,<br/>
    Europe's Masters and Scholars will find themselves fools—<br/>
    Europe's Masters and Scholars will go to their graves,<br/>
    The dullest of Dunces, the vilest of Slaves!<br/></p>
    <p>Napoleon's a <i>Noun</i> that can vary his <i>Case</i><br/>
    With an unprecedented assurance of face—<br/>
    'Tis <i>Dative</i> or <i>Ablative</i>, just as he likes—<br/>
    But <i>Vocative caret</i> whenever he strikes.<br/></p>
    <p>Altho' in the <i>Genitive</i> none have him seen,<br/>
    Since his fond <i>Conjugation</i> with fair Josephine,<br/>
    Yet few can excel him in arts of <i>seduction</i>,<br/>
    Notwithstanding <i>this Case</i> may not suit his <i>construction</i>.<br/></p>
    <p>In the <i>Nominative</i> none can such energy boast,<br/>
    As many a Potentate knows to his cost!<br/>
    In the gloomy <i>Accusative</i>, too, he displays<br/>
    A promptness that puzzles, destroys, and dismays.<br/></p>
    <p>A lofty <i>Pronoun</i>, indeclinable He,<br/>
    Whose Imperial I supersedes Royal <i>We</i>!<br/>
    For <i>We</i>, among Kings, consultation implies,<br/>
    But who dares an absolute Tyrant advise?<br/></p>
    <p>An <i>Irregular Verb</i>, but by few understood,<br/>
    Save when he is in the <i>Imperative Mood</i>:<br/>
    Then, presto! his will must be done in a wink,<br/>
    There's no time left to loiter, remonstrate, or think.<br/><br/>
    His <i>Indicative</i> some new aggression foreshews—<br/>
    His <i>Potential</i> means plunder to friends and to foes—<br/>
    His <i>Subjunctive</i> denotes turning <i>Saints</i> into <i>Cash</i>—<br/>
    His <i>Optative</i> aims at these Islands a dash:<br/></p>
    <p>But his cloudy <i>Infinitive</i> mocks speculation—<br/>
    Ambition ne'er form'd such a strange <i>Conjugation</i>!<br/></p>
    <p>Of <i>Adverbs</i> about him still strut a vain crowd,<br/>
    Submissive as Spaniels, as Turkey-cocks proud.<br/><i>Prepositions</i> unnumber'd his mandate can muster,<br/>
    And curious <i>Conjunctions</i>, like bees in a cluster.<br/></p>
    <p>But dull <i>Interjections</i> are kept at a distance,<br/>
    Except on occasions that need their assistance:<br/>
    They then must take care, as their silence they burst,<br/>
    That their <i>Notes</i> sound the praise of Napoleon the First.<br/></p>
    <p>Ye Linguists of Britain! then keep a strict watch,<br/>
    Lest he in his <i>Syntax</i> you napping should catch.<br/>
    Entrapp'd, all your logic will thenceforth be vain—<br/>
    Your <i>Pens</i> and your <i>Tongues</i> he at once will enchain.</p>
    <br/>
