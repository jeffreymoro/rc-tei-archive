        <p>1796.12<br/><b>On the Death of Lieutenant-Colonel Buller,<br/>
            Killed in Flanders in 1795</b><br/>
            “Mr. Sheridan”<br/>
            [Richard Brinsley Sheridan]<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, XXIX (1796), pp. 398-399<br/></p>
        <p>Written by Mr. Sheridan,<br/>
            At the Request of His Present Lady.<br/></p>
        <p>Scarce hush'd the sigh, scarce dried the ling'ring<br/>
                                        tear,<br/>
            Affection pour'd upon a Brother's bier;<a href="#2">[2]</a><br/>
            Another loss bid LAURA's sorrows flow,<br/>
            As keen in anguish as a sister's woe.<br/>
                Unknown to me the object of her grief—<br/>
            I dare not counsel, did she ask relief;<br/>
            Yet may the wish no vain intrusion prove,<br/>
            To share her grief, for all who shar'd her love.<br/></p>
        <p>    Yet, GALLANT VICTIM! in this HATEFUL<br/>
                                       STRIFE,<br/>
            Which PRIDE maintains '<i>gainst</i> MAN'S and<br/>
                                 FREEDOM's LIFE,<br/>
            If quick and sensible to LAURA'S worth,<br/>
            Thy heart's first comment was affection's<br/>
                                        birth;<br/>
            If thy soul's day rose only in her sight,<br/>
            And absence was thy clouded spirit's night,<br/>
            If 'mid whatever busy tumults thrown<br/>
            Thy silent thoughts still turn'd to her alone;<br/>
            If, while ambition seem'd each art to move,<br/>
            Thy secret hope was LAURA, Peace, and Love;<br/>
            If such thy feelings, and thy dying prayer,<br/>
            To wish that happiness thou could'st not share;<br/>
            Let me with kindred claim thy name revere,<br/>
            And GIVE THY MEMORY A BROTHER'S TEAR!<br/></p>
        <p>    But, ah! not tears alone fill LAURA's eyes,<br/>
            RESENTMENT KINDLES WITH AFFLICTION'S SIGHS:<br/>
            Insulted Patience borrows Passion's breath,<br/>
            To CURSE THE PLOTTERS OF THESE SCENES OF DEATH!<br/>
            Yet sooth'd to Peace, sweet mourner, tranquil be,<br/>
            And every harsh emotion leave to me!<br/>
            Remember, sad and soft regret be thine,<br/>
            The WRATH OF HATE, the BLOW OF VENGEANCE MINE.<br/></p>
        <p>    And oh, by Heav'n! THAT HOUR SHALL SURELY COME,<br/>
            When, fell destroyers! ye shall meet your doom!<br/>
            Yes, MISCREANT STATESMEN! by the proud disdain<br/>
            Which honour feels at base CORRUPTION's REIGN,<br/>
            By the loud clamours of a NATION's WOES,<br/>
            By the still pang DOMESTIC SORROW KNOWS,<br/>
            By ALL THAT HOPE HAS LOST OR TERROR FEARS,<br/>
            By ENGLAND's INJURIES, and LAURA's TEARS:<br/>
            The hour shall come, when, Fraud's short<br/>
                                    triumphs past,<br/>
            A PEOPLE's VENGEANCE shall strike home at last!!!<br/><br/>
                Then, then shall fell Remorse, the dastard<br/>
                                        fiend,<br/>
            Who ne'er pollutes the noble Soldier's end,<br/>
            And dark Despair around the SCAFFOLD wait,<br/>
            And NOT ONE LOOK DEPLORE the TRAITOR'S FATE!<br/>
            But while Remembrance shakes his <i>coward</i> frame,<br/>
            And starts of Pride contend with inward shame;<br/>
            The mute reproach, or execration loud,<br/>
            Of SOBER JUSTICE, or the SCOFFING CROWD,<br/>
            Alike shall hail the BLOW that seals his doom,<br/>
            And GIVES TO INFAMY HIS MEM'RY AND HIS TOMB.<br/></p>
        <p>    Turn from the hateful scene, dear LAURA,<br/>
                                        turn,<br/>
            And thy lov'd Friend with milder sorrow mourn!<br/>
            Still dwell upon his fate; for still thou'lt find<br/>
            The contrast lovely, and 'twill soothe thy mind—!<br/>
            Fall'n with the brave, e'er number'd with the slain—<br/>
            His mind UNWOUNDED CALMS HIS BODY'S PAIN!<br/>
            Half rais'd he leans. See FRIENDSHIP bending o'er,<br/>
            Her sigh suppress'd, as to his view she bore<br/>
            Thy much-lov'd image: whose all-soothing smile<br/>
            Could Pain disarm, and Death's last pang<br/>
                                        beguile—!<br/></p>
        <p>    Hopeless, but not dismay'd, with fearless eye<br/>
            He reads the doom that tells him "HE MUST<br/>
                                        "DIE—"<br/>
            Lays his BRAVE HAND UPON HIS BLEEDING BREAST,<br/>
            And FEELS HIS GLORY WHILE HE FINDS HIS REST!<br/>
            Resigns the transient breath which Nature gave,<br/>
            And SURE OF PROUDER LIFE O'ERLOOKS THE<br/>
                                        GRAVE.—<br/>
            Sweet is THE MEED that waits his laurel'd<br/>
                                        BIER,<br/>
            'Tis <i>Valour's</i> HOPE, 'tis <i>Honour's</i> PRAISE<br/>
                                        SINCERE,<br/>
            'Tis FRIENDSHIP's SIGH, and gentle BEAUTY's<br/>
                                        TEAR!!</p>
