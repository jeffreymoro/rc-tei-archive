    <p>1813.2<br/><b>The Soldier's Adieu</b><br/>
    “Junius”<br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, LXII (February, 1813), p. 141<br/></p>
    <p>Farewell to those fields where in childhood I wander'd,<br/>
        And fresh as the morning I stray'd unconfin'd;<br/>
    Farewell to that brook whose stream gently meander'd<br/>
        Through the sweet-smiling valley I'm leaving behind.<br/></p>
    <p>Farewell to the spot where the sun at retiring<br/>
        Smil'd with its last rays on the cot that was mine;<br/>
    Where I paus'd from my toil, and, the scene oft admiring,<br/>
        My soul has been rais'd to its Author divine.<br/></p>
    <p>No more shall the soft village bells with your chiming<br/>
        Invite me to meet my dear girl at the door;<br/>
    Or when in sweet converse the hill we've been climbing,<br/>
        Has bid us return e'er our converse was o'er.<br/></p>
    <p>Fond sources of pleasure! sweet faded delusion!<br/>
        I'll cherish thy image wherever I roam,<br/>
    Though departed the joy I'll still court the illusion,<br/>
        And forget all my cares whilst I think of my home.<br/></p>
    <p>When twilight the mild sun of ev'n is o'ertaking,<br/>
        And the morn sips the dew-drops that's scatter'd afar,<br/>
    I'll pray for thy peace, tho' the tempest is shaking<br/>
        The spot where I stand, the poor victim of war.<br/></p>
    <p>And thy weal, much-lov'd Albion, I'll still be defending,<br/>
        Unaw'd by the foe my soul justly abhors:<br/>
    Yes! for thee will I strive, though my heart should be rending,<br/>
        And with my last breath yield a pray'r for thy cause.<br/></p>
    <br/>
