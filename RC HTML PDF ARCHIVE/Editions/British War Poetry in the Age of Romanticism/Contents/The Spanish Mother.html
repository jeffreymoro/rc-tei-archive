    <p>1809.6<br/><b>The Spanish Mother</b><br/>
    “A Young Lady”<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXIX (May, 1809), p. 453<br/></p>
    <p>    Go, Carlos, go, thy Country calls thee,<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
        Nor must she call her Sons in vain;<br/>
        And, oh! whatever fate befalls thee,<br/>
        Forget not thou'rt a Chief of Spain.<br/></p>
    <p>    Those sighs I heave, those tears I shed,<br/>
        Prove how I prize the life I gave,<br/>
        Yet would I rather know thee dead<br/>
        Than see thee live of France the slave.<br/>
    But Hope, sweet Hope! amid this parting pain<br/>
    Whispers, "in happier hours we'll meet again."<br/></p>
    <p>    This glaive be thine; it once was wielded<br/>
        By an arm well known to Fame;<br/>
        The foe it crush'd, the friend it shielded,<br/>
        And thousand blest the Hero's name.<br/></p>
    <p>    Then be my Carlos like his sire,<br/>
        Lost, sainted object of my love,<br/>
        In war, a swift consuming fire.<br/>
        In peace, mild, gentle as the dove.<br/>
    So look'd he once, so smiled he on me—<br/>
    My Son, my Son, how can I part from thee!<br/><br/>
        Thro' long, long years of pain and sorrow,<br/>
        A beam of joy—thou'st been to me,<br/>
        And Hope still pointed to to-morrow,<br/>
        And pictur'd all my Boy would be.<br/></p>
    <p>    And when my griefs were near forgot,<br/>
        And when my cares were almost past;<br/>
        If—oh! it is a fearful thought;—<br/>
        If I should lose thee, now at last—<br/>
    My Son, my Son, when perils round thee wait<br/>
    On thine, remember, hangs thy Mother's fate.<br/></p>
    <p>    Last of a line well known in story<br/>
        Whose valour was their Country's pride,<br/>
        Who for that Country fought with glory,<br/>
        And in her battles nobly died;<br/>
        Let sad, yet high remembrance dwell<br/>
        On those who're laid for ever low—<br/>
        And now a fond, a long farwell;—<br/>
        My Son, to Conquest proudly go—<br/>
    Thy Mother bids thee—all her weakness o'er—<br/>
    Return a Hero, or return no more.</p>

The Spanish defended Saragossa, but were forced to capitulate on February 21, 1809. Nevertheless, the Spanish continued to wage war against the French invaders.</span>
