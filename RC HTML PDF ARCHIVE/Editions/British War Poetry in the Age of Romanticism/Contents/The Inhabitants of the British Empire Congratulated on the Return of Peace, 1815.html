    <p>1815.12<br/><b>The Inhabitants of the British Empire<br/>
    Congratulated on the Return of Peace, 1815</b><br/>
    John Turner<br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, LXVIII (Dec. 1815), pp. 535-536<br/></p>
    <p>By the Author of the Triumph of Britannia.<br/><br/>
    Come, let us rejoice! since the wars are all over,<br/>
    And the intercourse free, between Calais and Dover:<br/>
    Now the Gaul and the Briton in friendship may meet,<br/>
    And converse, without censure, in Southwark's high street:<br/><br/>
    For the race of Napoleon, the tyrant, is run:<br/>
    No more the fond mother shall mourn her lost son;<br/>
    The widow no more shall her husband bewail;<br/>
    No more shall, with sorrow, recount her sad tale.<br/></p>
    <p>The orphan no more shall his father bemoan,<br/>
    Or in silence emphatic suppress the deep groan:<br/>
    The maiden no more shall in tears her eyes steep;<br/>
    No more shall the absence of him she loves weep:<br/></p>
    <p>Now since Discord the councils of Europe has fled,<br/>
    Long-languishing Commerce shall lift up her head;<br/>
    From our sight so long banish'd, we now shall behold<br/>
    Peruvia's fine silver, and Chili's pure gold.<br/></p>
    <p>Though high-sounding the verse, when of triumphs we sing,<br/>
    Just and grateful to valour, due plaudits to bring:<br/>
    Yet how far more delightful, the sweet soften'd strain<br/>
    Rais'd to welcome our heroes return'd from the main.<br/></p>
    <p>Oh! long may they live! and while living enjoy<br/>
    The fruit of their labours, with nought to alloy:<br/>
    Oh! long may be theirs, all the comforts of peace,<br/>
    And Brittania in honour and blessings increase.<br/></p>
