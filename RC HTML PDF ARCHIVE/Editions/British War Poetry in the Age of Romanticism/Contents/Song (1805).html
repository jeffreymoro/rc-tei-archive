    <p>1805.2<br/><b>Song</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXV (February 1805), p. 158<br/></p>
    <p>Tune, "Why Moses, why Aaron."<br/></p>
    <p>Here's a health to right honest John Bull!<br/>
        When he's gone we shan't find such another;<br/>
    With hearts and with glasses brimful,<br/>
        Here's a health to Old England his mother!<br/>
                      CHORUS—Here's a health, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>She gave him a good Education,<br/>
        Bade him keep to his Church and his King;<br/>
    Be loyal and true to the nation,<br/>
        And then go, be merry, and sing;<br/>
                                 Here's a health, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>Now John is a good-humour'd fellow,<br/>
        Industrious, honest, and brave;<br/>
    Not afraid of his betters when mellow,<br/>
        Since betters he knows he should have.<br/>
                                 Here's a health, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>For there must be fine Lords and fine Ladies;<br/>
        There must be some little, some great;<br/>
    Their wealth the supply of our trade is,<br/>
        Our hands the support of their state.<br/>
                                 Here's a health, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>Some are born for the court and the city,<br/>
        And some for the village and cot;<br/>
    But, oh! 'twere a dolorous ditty,<br/>
        If all became equal by lot.<br/>
                                 Here's a health, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>If our ships had no pilots to steer,<br/>
        What would come of poor Jack in the shrouds?<br/>
    If our troops no commanders to fear,<br/>
        They'd soon be arm'd robbers in crouds.<br/>
                                 Here's a health, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>Then the plough and the loom must stand still,<br/>
        If they made us gentlemen all;<br/>
    Or all clodhoppers, then who wou'd fill<br/>
        The Parliament, Pulpit, and Hall?<br/>
                                 Here's a health, &amp;c.<br/><br/>
    "Rights of man" makes a very fine sound,<br/>
        Equal riches, a plausible tale;<br/>
    But whose labour would then till the ground?<br/>
        All would drink, but who'd brew the best ale?<br/>
                                 Here's a health, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>When half naked, half starv'd in the street,<br/>
        We were wand'ring about <i>sans culottes</i>;<br/>
    Would Equality go fetch us meat,<br/>
        Or Liberty lengthen our coat?<br/>
                                 Here's a health, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>That knaves are for lev'lling, no wonder;<br/>
        'Tis easy to guess at their views;<br/>
    'Tis they who'd get all by the plunder,<br/>
        'Tis they who have nothing to lose.<br/>
                                 Here's a health, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>Then away such nonsensical stuff,<br/>
        Full of treason, confusion, and blood!<br/>
    Every Briton has freedom enough,<br/>
        To be happy as long as he's good.<br/>
                                 Here's a health, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>To be rul'd by a merciful King,<br/>
        To be guarded by Juries and Laws;<br/>
    And when the work's finish'd to sing,<br/>
        "This, this is true Liberty's cause."<br/>
                                 Here's a health, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>Then halloo, boys, halloo boys, ever,<br/>
        For just such a nation are we;<br/>
    'Tis our pleasure, O may it cease never!<br/>
        'Tis our pride to be loyal and free.<br/>
                                 Here's a health, &amp;c.</p>
