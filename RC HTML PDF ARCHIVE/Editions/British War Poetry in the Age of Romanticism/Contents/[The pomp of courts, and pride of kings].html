    <p>1799.5<br/><b>[The pomp of courts, and pride of kings]</b><br/>
    [Arthur O’Connor]<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Monthly Mirror</i>, VII (February 1799), p. 127</p>
    <p>The following curious lines, which, though apparently loyal, breathe the very spirit of Jacobinism, have been handed to us as the production of one of the <i>United Irishmen</i>, and a favourite song at their grand meetings. The figures denote the order in which the lines should follows according to the <i>mental</i><br/>
    reservation of the Irish <i>Patriots</i>:—</p>
    <p> 1. The pomp of courts, and pride of kings,<br/>
     3. I prize above all earthly things;<br/>
     5. I love my country, but my king,<br/>
     7. Above all men his praise I'll sing.<br/>
     9. The royal banners are display'd,<br/>
    11. And may success the standard aid:<br/>
     2. I fain would banish far from hence<br/>
     4. The Rights of Man and Common Sense.<br/>
     6. Destruction to that odious name,<br/>
     8. The plague of princes, Thomas Paine,<br/>
    10. Defeat and ruin seize the cause<br/>
    12. Of France, her liberty, and laws.</p>
