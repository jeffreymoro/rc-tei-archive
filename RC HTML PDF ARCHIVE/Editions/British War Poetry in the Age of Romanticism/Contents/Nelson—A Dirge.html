    <p>1812.3<br/><b>Nelson—A Dirge</b><br/>
    John Mayne <a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXIV (September, 1812), p. 263<br/><i>The Monthly Magazine</i>, XXXIV (September 1, 1812), p. 137<br/><i>The London Chronicle,</i> CXII (September 17, 1812), p. 276<br/><i>The Scots Magazine</i>, LXXII (November 1812), p. 864<br/></p>
    <p>Saw ye the streets when NELSON died,<br/>
        When his funereal train drew near,<br/>
    The troops arrang'd on every side,<br/>
        The people gazing in the rear?<br/></p>
    <p>I saw the streets when NELSON died:<br/>
        When his funereal car drew near,<br/>
    Not one brave heart but deeply sigh'd,<br/>
        Not one fair cheek without a tear!<br/><br/>
    A Nation's grief bedew'd his grave;<br/>
        Devotion mourn'd him as her own;<br/>
    For, in the battle, truly brave,<br/>
        He fear'd th' OMNIPOTENT alone!<br/></p>
    <p>Oh! how it sooth'd the Hero's shade,<br/>
        Though weeping still at Trafalgar,<br/>
    When in the grave his dust was laid<br/>
        With all the pride and pomp of war!<br/></p>
    <p>Intomb'd in yonder hallow'd fane,<br/>
        With requiems due his ashes rest;<br/>
    Archangels, with a solemn strain,<br/>
        Inshrin'd his spirit with the blest!<br/></p>
    <p>NELSON! to men and angels dear,<br/>
        Thy name shall never, never die!<br/>
    Britain embalms it with a tear,<br/>
        And Fame records it with a sigh!<br/></p>

                        <span class="footnote_text">1. A Scottish poet, Mayne began his career as a printer in the office of the <i>Dumfries Journal</i>. He went to London in 1787 where he became proprietor and joint editor of <i>The</i><i>Star</i>. His long poem, <i>Siller Gun</i>, expanded over a period 1777-1836, was considered by Walter Scott to be superior to anything of Ferguson and close to Burns (<i>Lady of the Lake</i>, v. 20.).</span>
