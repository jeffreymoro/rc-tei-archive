    <p>1799.1<br/><b>Buonaparte</b><a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Meteors</i>, I (1799), pp. 17-25<br/></p>
    <p>Good courteous reader, I am sure the name<br/>
        Of Buonaparte must have reach'd thine ear;<br/>
    But, lest thou be deceived in his fame,<br/>
        E'en from my Muse his glories shalt thou hear.<br/></p>
    <p>And first, this hero, like to other men,<br/>
        Has capabilities to eat and drink:<br/>
    In stature, he is five feet nine, or ten,<br/>
        A goodly size, as many ladies think.<br/></p>
    <p>A year or two ago his face was pale,<br/>
        But now, they say, it is a dingy brown;<br/>
    And thence at Paris sprung an idle tale,<br/>
        They said 'twas Gen'ral Toussaint come to town.<br/></p>
    <p>In science he is deep—his rapid pen<br/>
        At once describes a vict'ry and a bust;<br/>
    And fighting in a swamp and marshy fen,<br/>
        He tells how many thousands bit the dust.<br/></p>
    <p>His travelling has of course begot a skill<br/>
        In lands and soils; but this I will advance,<br/>
    That let his knowledge be whate'er it will,<br/>
        He knows the difference 'twixt Cayenne &amp; France.<br/></p>
    <p>But we must trace the hist'ry of his life;<br/>
        Observe how, inch by inch, his greatness grew;<br/>
    At ten years old, we find him deep in strife,<br/>
        Vowing in a balloon to take a view.<br/></p>
    <p>There first his mighty genius was unfurl'd,<br/>
        (Admire his wise foresight and prudence true)<br/>
    He wish'd to see the huge unwieldy world,<br/>
        His infant ardour panted to subdue.<br/><br/>
    Light o'er his head his youthful hours roll,<br/>
        He hastes to Genoa<a href="#2">[2]</a>—What do we behold!<br/>
    The hero asking, "What's o'clock?" no soul<br/>
        The hero can resolve; each watch is sold.<br/></p>
    <p>On ev'ry side the dreadful clamours rise;<br/>
        No watches, shirts, or shoes do we possess;<br/>
    Nor thee, nor the Directory we prize,<br/>
        Unless ye save us from our sad distress.<br/></p>
    <p>"<i>Courage</i>! my lads; <i>allons</i>! see yonder plains<br/>
        "And armies given us by Fate's decree;<br/>
    "The Austrian spoils shall well reward your pains,<br/>
        "Watches enough, and Wurmser's<a href="#3">[3]</a> watch for me."<br/></p>
    <p>Soon <i>ca ira</i> and civic hymns resound,<br/>
        In horrid joy the reg'ments dance and jump;<br/>
    And, as imagination wins the ground,<br/>
        Each feels his bay'net in a hostile rump.<br/></p>
    <p>'Tis said dame Fortune is not over chaste,<br/>
        Nor does she much delight in ancient men;<br/>
    She found our hero most unto her taste,<br/>
        And smil'd on Wurmser only now and then.<br/></p>
    <p>Thus victory to victory succeeds,<br/>
        Armies retreat, and towns are render'd up;<br/>
    The fields are spoil'd—and poor Italia bleeds,<br/>
        And soon at Mantua<a href="#3">[4]</a> will the victor sup.<br/></p>
    <p>He came—and told the people they were free,<br/>
        Deliver'd from the tyranny of knaves,<br/>
    Bade them to plant the emblematic tree<br/>
        Whose shadow would disdain to shelter slaves.<br/><br/>
    Bade them to be the right good friends of France,<br/>
        And plac'd some thousand men within their walls,<br/>
    Lest that by any accidental chance,<br/>
        They chang'd their minds, and struggled in street<br/>
                                     brawls.<a href="#5">[5]</a><br/></p>
    <p>Next with th' Emp'ror's courtiers, <i>tete-a-tete</i><br/>
        At Campo Formio<a href="#6">[6]</a> he plans a peace,<br/>
    Which done, he vows that either soon or late,<br/>
        He'll go and drive the English troops like geese.<br/></p>
    <p>His dreadful grenadiers, his boast and pride,<br/>
        Borne on huge rafts shall strike us all with fears;<br/>
    Sail up the Thames upon the faithless tide,<br/>
        And knock the antique Tower 'bout our ears.<a href="#7">[7]</a><br/></p>
    <p>March thence unto the Bank, whose facile doors<br/>
        Shall yield up all to their rapacious claw,<br/>
    Swift bounds the echo from the Gallic shores<br/><i>    Voila</i> bank notes, <i>at par</i> with assignats!<br/></p>
    <p>But he, or the Directory soon found<br/>
        This plan beneath the genius of France;<br/>
    And then, the Turks and Mam'lukes to confound<br/>
        He led his grenadiers a pretty dance.<a href="#8">[8]</a><br/></p>
    <p>Tost on the seas full many a stormy day,<br/>
        At length his navy reach'd the Egyptian strand,<br/>
    Only at Malta—stopping by the way,<br/>
        To play the Devil, did the hero land.<a href="#9">[9]</a><br/></p>
    <p>Safe in Aboukir's bay the navy rode<br/>
        Approaching victories the warriors greet,<br/>
    Nor could they find one Scavan to forebode<br/>
        That Nelson hasten'd with his conqu'ring fleet.<br/></p>
    <p>Brave Nelson came—and while his vengeance flew<br/>
        And claim'd the victory as Britain's right,<br/>
    Great Buonaparte took a bird's-eye view,<br/>
        Securely mounted on a turret's height.<br/></p>
    <p>The navy lost—no logic can prevail<br/>
        On Afric's citizens to change one mind,<br/>
    Those people thought he look'd just like a snail<br/>
        Who came abroad, and left his shell behind.<br/></p>
    <p>Yet generalship like his was never found,<br/>
        Hail, Ali Buonaparte! <i>Vive l'Hero!</i><br/>
    His faith like any weathercock veer'd round,<br/>
        A pious Musselman from top to toe!<br/></p>
    <p>But here the Devil interferes, and bids<br/>
        Each thing run counter to the prophet's will;<br/>
    Still must be battle near the pyramids,<br/>
        And in their mosques some more old women<br/>
                                     kill.<br/></p>
    <p>Lo! on a dromedary, full of pride<br/>
        To Syria now the hero bends his way;<a href="#10">[10]</a><br/>
    Those soldiers who can <i>steal</i> a camel, <i>ride</i>,<br/>
        The rest march after in their best array.<br/></p>
    <p>Rejoice, ye Jews! the Israelitish walls,<br/>
        Require but workmen to be built apace,<br/>
    A mighty <i>Rabbi</i> loudly on you calls,<br/>
        In ev'ry Syrian town to raise Duke's Place.<br/></p>
    <p>Gen'ral again, he summons Acre with<br/>
        Fraternal offers; strange, they wont go down;<br/>
    But that uncivil Knight, Sir Sydney Smith,<a href="#11">[11]</a><br/>
        Was rude enough to fortify the town.<br/><br/><i>He</i> taught the Turks to banish idle fears,<br/>
        And make incursions on the hostile French;<br/>
    They sally—and find Jacobins have ears,<br/>
        Which as superfluous lux'ries they retrench.<br/></p>
    <p>To desperation drove, the town they storm,<br/>
        And storm again; but it is all in vain:<br/>
    At length they take their leave, without much form,<br/>
        And <i>storming</i>, march to Egypt back again.<br/></p>
    <p>In the retreat the Arabs were unkind,<br/><i>    Honor 'mongst thieves</i>—yet they committed theft,<br/>
    But soon the hero has the bliss to find<br/>
        The pyramids stand just where they were left.<br/></p>
    <p>He calls a council; finds the season past,<br/>
        When men can fly to India in a day;<br/>
    And after much debate, concludes at last,<br/>
        From Egypt he had better slip away.<br/></p>
    <p>And as the Hebrew youths in days of old,<br/>
        Went <i>into</i> Egypt to preserve their lives,<br/>
    So <i>out</i> of Egypt, Buonaparte bold,<br/>
        Escap'd to Paris, where I hear he thrives.<a href="#12">[12]</a></p>
