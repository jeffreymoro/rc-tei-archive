    <p>1813.1<br/><b>The Apes:<br/>
    A Fable from the Italian</b><br/>
    “E. R.”<br/><i>The Monthly Magazine,</i> XXXIV (January 1, 1813), pp. 523-524<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (January 2, 1813)<br/></p>
    <p>In a charming balcony o'er-shaded with trees,<br/>
    In the court of a palace, an ape liv'd at ease;<br/>
    And treasures, not jewels nor gold, she possess'd,<br/>
    In a bag-full of walnuts supremely was bless'd.<br/>
    Other monkeys press'd round for a savoury meal,<br/>
    But she kept all the kernels and threw them the peal;<br/>
    In vain ev'ry art, each intreaty, they try'd,<br/>
    Till the place of remonstrance stern fury supply'd;<br/>
    To keep at a distance her terrible foes<br/>
    From her bag of dear walnuts, she levell'd her blows;<br/>
    A long, long, and wearisome war she maintain'd,<br/>
    And, thankful to Fortune, the victory gained.<br/>
    But, turning her eyes, her rich bag to explore,<br/>
    Every walnut was lost in defending the store.<br/>
        Oh! war-waging Britain! protectress of Spain<br/>
        Thy courage how dauntless! thy glory how vain!</p>
    <p>
