    Caleb Whitefoord <a href="#2">[2]</a><br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, LVII (May, 1810), p. 381<br/></p>
    <p>When our brave NELSON had o'er come the foe,<br/>
    Death at that moment laid the victor low!<br/>
    A second life, oh West! thy pencil gives,<br/>
    Again the hero on thy canvass lives;<br/>
    Death, the great conq'ror stopp'd brave Nelson's breath,<br/>
    West with victorious colours conquers Death.</p>
