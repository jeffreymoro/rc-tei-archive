    <p>1801.4<br/><b>Billy Moor</b><br/>
    “Nauticus”<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXI (June 1801), pp. 548-549<br/></p>
    <p>An honest tar, and fresh from sea,<br/>
    With heart just where it ought to be,<br/>
        Thus hail'd young Billy Moor:<br/>
    "What cheer, my lad?—Misfortune's gale<br/>
    Hath torn, I see, thy tatter'd sail;<br/>
        For thou art wreck'd, and poor."<br/></p>
    <p>The simple boy his story true<br/>
    Told, with a blushing sweetness too;<br/>
        Then heav'd an heart-sick sigh!—<br/>
    "But God is good, though man's unkind;<br/>
    Pass on—my sufferings never mind;<br/>
        He soon will let me die!"<br/></p>
    <p>Jack's heart, with manly feeling yearn'd,<br/>
    More than his purse in pocket burn'd;<br/>
        And that, for once, was cramm'd:<br/>
    First wip'd the spray from either eye—<br/>
    "Die, messmate!" was the tar's reply,<br/>
        "If thou do'st, I'll be - - - - - -.<br/></p>
    <p>Bear up! I have thee safe in tow,<br/>
    I'll fit thee straight to face the foe,<br/>
        And cope with Death, d'ye see!"<br/>
    He had him rigg'd—the next spring-tide:<br/>
    His locker full, and well supplied,<br/>
        Bore Billy Moor to sea.<br/><br/>
    When there, the boy with grateful heart<br/>
    Applauded, play'd his stated part,<br/>
        And scorn'd to flinch, or run:<br/>
    But oft would bless the happy day<br/>
    That bore him from distress away<br/>
        To serve Jack Mizen's gun.</p>
