    <p>1803.7<br/><b>Serious Advice to Bonaparte</b><br/>
    Richard Braine<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXIII (August 1803), pp. 763-764<br/></p>
    <p>By Richard Braine, Greenwich.<br/></p>
    <p>Pray have you not read what Elizabeth said<br/>
    To her Peers when in Parliament sitting:<br/>
    "My Lords, I am told that proud Philip, grown bold,<br/>
    To invade us his fleet is now fitting;<br/>
    Your assistance pray lend, our rights to defend,<br/>
    Though I fear not this proud fellow's bluster;<br/>
    Not his Armada great, which rides in such state,<br/>
    Nor all the proud Dons he can muster."<br/>
        "I fear not," said she, "the harm he'll<br/>
                             do me,<br/>
    Though fair winds and brisk gales here may blow him;<br/>
    My cause is so just in Him whom I trust,<br/>
    Will undoubtedly let me o'erthrow him;<br/>
    But still I rely on your aid to supply<br/>
    Ways and means on this rightful occasion:<br/>
    I ask your assistance to make such resistance,<br/>
    Will baffle this proud Don's invasion."<br/>
        With heart and with hand, at this good<br/>
                    Queen's demand.<br/>
    What she asked was readily granted.<br/>
    No sooner equipt, she to Tilbury tript,<br/>
    Where her forces for victory panted;<br/>
    But the battle was won; for bold Drake beat<br/>
                           this Don,<br/>
    Sunk, burnt, and blew up with explosion,<br/>
    Three-fourths of this host, to proud Don Philip's<br/>
                             cost,<br/>
    And confirm'd Bessy Queen of the Ocean.<br/>
        Bonaparte, pray read this; nor at all take<br/>
                            amiss<br/>
    Those hints which I now lay before you;<br/>
    For the very same fate doth now you await<br/>
    Which proud Philip receiv'd, I assure you:<br/>
    Though we have not Queen Bess, we her courage possess,<br/>
    And a King who is dear to us all, Sir;<br/>
    In defence of his right each bold Briton will fight,<br/>
    Till the last drop of blood from him fall, Sir.</p>
