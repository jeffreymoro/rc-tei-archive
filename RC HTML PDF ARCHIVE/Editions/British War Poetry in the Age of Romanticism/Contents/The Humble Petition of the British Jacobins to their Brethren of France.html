    <p>1793.7<br/><b>The Humble Petition of the British Jacobins to their Brethren of France</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXIII (July 1793), frontispiece</p>
    <p>While to you we true children of Liberty pray,<br/>
        Great Tag, Rag, and Bobtail, attend;<br/>
    Who with heads on your pikes so facetiously play,<br/>
        Mirth and murder so merrily blend!</p>
    <p>O ye boasts of proud France, ye bright lights of the earth,<br/>
        Who, in fine philosophical speeches,<br/>
    Prove the only criterion of virtue and worth<br/>
        Consists in the bareness of breeches!</p>
    <p>Brother Jacobins, listen; and, if you can cease<br/>
        To gaze on your glorious Convention,<br/>
    Where the point of the dagger best propagates peace,<br/>
        Where concord grows out of contention;</p>
    <p>Cast a glance of compassion on Britons, who lie<br/>
        By old superstitions opprest;<br/>
    For, ah! still like the night-mare, an incubus fly,<br/>
        Sits Monarchy squat on our breast!</p>
    <p>Come, come, at our call; nor thus let us beneath<br/>
        Such hateful incumbency groan.<br/>
    In the hearts of our rulers your poignards, oh, sheathe,<br/>
        And hoist a red cap on our ________!<a href="#1">[1]</a></p>
    <p>Ah! consider how many long months are past over,<br/>
        And how many ling'ring long days,<br/>
    Since you promised to hasten from Calais to Dover,<br/>
        Wretched Britons from slavery to raise;</p>
    <p>To reclaim us at length from political vice,<br/>
        To write reformation in blood;<br/>
    To bestow on us liberty not without lice,<br/>
        All, all, for our ultimate good.</p>
    <p>For, Britons, alas! are a nation of slaves,<br/>
        More full of plumb-pudding than wit,<br/>
    Warm with rapture, while Burke against anarchy raves,<br/>
        Ever licking the spittle of Pitt!</p>
    <p>Ah! think, gallant Frenchmen, while thus you delay,<br/>
        What misfortunes your friends here betide:<br/>
    Ah! think how the tyrants their leaders dismay,<br/>
        Forc'd in holes, like true adders, to hide!<br/><br/>
    See, see, your own Frost<a href="#2">[2]</a>, through the pill'ry on high,<br/>
        Thrust out his deplorable phiz;<a href="#3">[3]</a><br/>
    While Mock'ry with loll'd tongue stands insultingly by,<br/>
        While dangers and death round him whiz!</p>
    <p>See the sad Presbyterian, so gentle and meek,<br/>
        To the wilds of America roam;<br/>
    With his wife and his daughters, preparing to seek,<br/>
        Near naked lewd Indians, an home!</p>
    <p>Sweet soul, of whose grievances great is the sum,<br/>
        Who from Test-laws<a href="#4">[4]</a> can get no release,<br/>
    Who would deluge his country with blood, to become<br/>
        An Exciseman or Justice of Peace!</p>
    <p>Oh! then to our aid of those heroes, that die<br/>
    Without dread of the claws of old Scratch,<a href="#5">[5]</a><br/>
    Who laugh and blaspheme, as to slaughter they fly,<br/>
    A few odd hundred thousand dispatch!</p>
