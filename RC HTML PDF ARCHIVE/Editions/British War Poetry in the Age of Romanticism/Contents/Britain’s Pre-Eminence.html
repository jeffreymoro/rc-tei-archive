    <p>1798.13<br/><b>Britain's Pre-Eminence</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine,</i> LXVII (December 1798), pp. 1066-1067<br/></p>
    <p>    When Danish fury terror spread,<br/>
    And desolation, through our isle;<br/>
    His gallant bands great Alfred led,<br/>
    And rescued from his foes the spoil.<br/></p>
    <p>    In arts of peace, no less than war,<br/>
    Excelling, wholesome laws he made;<br/>
    His wisdom and parental care<br/>
    The basis of our freedom laid.<br/><br/>
        As rose the fabric by degrees,<br/>
    So gradual grew the infant state,<br/>
    Which now the world, admiring, sees,<br/>
    Alike in arms and commerce great.<br/></p>
    <p>    Rich ships, impell'd by ev'ry gale,<br/>
    Bring to her crowded ports their stores;<br/>
    Her fleets at large triumphant sail,<br/>
    And with their thunders guard her shores.<br/></p>
    <p>    Rous'd by our vict'ries on the main,<br/>
    Once more shall Austria take the field,<br/>
    Fight her lost glory to regain,<br/>
    And make proud Gallic legions yield.<br/></p>
    <p>    The realms enslav'd by France shall brave<br/>
    The victor's rage, and burst their chains;<br/>
    And Turk and Russian join to save<br/>
    From lawless pow'r their wide domains.</p>
