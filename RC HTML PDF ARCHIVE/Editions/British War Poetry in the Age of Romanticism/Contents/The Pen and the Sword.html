    <p>Inscribed to the Right Hon. R. B. Sheridan.<br/></p>
    <p>And dar'st thou then with me compare,<br/>
    Frail fleeting passenger of air!<br/>
    Say, am not I my country's rock,<br/>
    The lion in the battle's shock?<br/>
    I pour impetuous from afar<br/>
    The mighty torrent of the war,<br/>
    Like Kissoun's waters, Phison's flood,<br/>
    Spreads far the whelming tide of blood!<br/>
    Forsaken parents well can tell<br/>
    How fierce the raging currents swell;<br/>
    Deserted lands the tide-mark form,<br/>
    And nations perish in the storm.<br/>
    Bright is the forked lightning's stream;<br/>
    As bright, as fatal too, my beam!<br/>
    From me the bravest warrior flies,<br/>
    Or pausing bleeds, and sinks, and dies.<br/>
    And as the dews of Heav'n that fall<br/>
    On vines that clothe the cottage wall,<br/>
    Send life through ev'ry drooping cell,<br/>
    The tendrils curl, the clusters swell;<br/>
    To baths of blood my pow'rs restore,<br/>
    My nourishment the hero's gore!<br/>
    From me the lion's princely whelp<br/>
    Expects and finds its only help;<br/>
    Her prey from me the vulture seeks,<br/>
    And pays me with her dismal shrieks;<br/>
    And with the wild wolf's deepen'd howl,<br/>
    Makes music for my restless soul.<br/>
    Fear not! while I exist ye ne'er<br/>
    Shall pangs of thirst and hunger share;<br/>
    Still be the warrior's flesh your food,<br/>
    Still be your drink the hero's blood!<br/>
    And dar'st thou, frail and brittle reed!<br/>
    Match thy weak word with my proud deed?<br/>
    Can'st thou resist the eddying storm;<br/>
    Will not the flames consume thy form?<br/>
    And I, whom thou hast dar'd to brave,<br/>
    My very touch would be thy grave.<br/>
    Yes, such thou art, the pen replied—<br/>
    Yes, such is war's ensanguin'd tide!<br/>
    Thine be the fame to latest times,<br/>
    To shine supreme in blood and crimes.<br/>
    Oh! innocents untimely slain;<br/>
    Oh! matrons kill'd in child-birth pain!<br/>
    Babes from their mother's bosom borne!<br/>
    Sons from their dying father's torn!<br/>
    Nations of orphans and of slaves!<br/>
    Unpeopl'd earth and peopl'd graves!<br/>
    'Tis yours to tell what endless fame<br/>
    This all-consuming sword may clams.<br/>
    My pure, unblemished rights to share!<br/>
    Learn thy contracted sphere to scan;<br/>
    If strength were pow'r, then what were man?<br/>
    The elephant had rul'd the world,<br/>
    And monarchs from their thrones had hurl'd.<br/>
    'Tis mind, 'tis reason's sovereign sway,<br/>
    That nations own and states obey.<br/>
    And what art thou? and what am I?<br/>
    The globe shall hear the proud reply.<br/>
    Me, science, wisdom, virtue claim,<br/>
    And gain a never ending fame.<br/>
    Through me the eloquence that dies<br/>
    Fast as the fleeting shadow flies,<br/>
    To ages yet unborn, shall shew<br/>
    The Priest's pure zeal, the Patriot's glow.<br/>
    Through me, the high behest, ye share,<br/>
    That bids frail man his fellow spare;<br/>
    And still the heav'nly thunders roll<br/>
    "Commit no murder" on the soul!<br/>
    Thou dwell'st among the mountain rocks,<br/>
    Haunt of the chamois, and the fox;<br/>
    Thou sleep'st upon the rugged bed,<br/>
    Where foaming torrents erst have spread;<br/>
    Thou roam'st along the blasted heath,<br/>
    Or shades of plunder and of death,<br/>
    Where murd'rers ply their dreadful trade,<br/>
    And bathe in blood thy reeking blade.<br/>
    Such is thy fate! and dar'st thou then<br/>
    Compare therewith the blameless pen?<br/>
    Scourge of the weak, but wisdom's slave,<br/>
    Dar'st thou to threat an early grave?<br/>
    My waving banners once unfurl'd,<br/>
    Have launch'd thee o'er a conquer'd world;<br/>
    My breath can bid the havoc cease,<br/>
    And sheath thy gory blade in peace.</p>
