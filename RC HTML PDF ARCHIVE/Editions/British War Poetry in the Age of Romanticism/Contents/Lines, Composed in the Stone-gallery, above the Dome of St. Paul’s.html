    <p>1801.11<br/><b>Lines<br/></b> “Carolus"<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXI (November 1801), p. 1028<br/></p>
    <p>Composed in the Stone-gallery, above the Dome of<br/>
    St. Paul's, on the Occasion of the Discomfiture<br/>
    of the English Boats by the Batteries of Boulogne.</p>
    <p>Why mourns my heart, with sympathetic pain,<br/>
    Those lives just lost on Boulogne's hostile coast;<br/>
    Why grieves alone for British seamen slain,<br/>
        The Frenchman's terror, and their country's boast?<br/>
    Why, when my mind views thousands fall'n beneath<br/>
        The murd'rous cannon's foul, convulsive ire,<br/>
    Does no soft tear lament the work of death,<br/>
        While foreign nations light the funeral pyre!<br/></p>
    <p>O Reason! say, why glows the patriot breast,<br/>
        Proud with the triumphs of its country's arms!<br/>
    Why, by her failures, are those thoughts imprest,<br/>
        That fill the trembling nerves with wild alarms?<br/></p>
    <p>For, soon Eternity's dark veil shall shade<br/>
        The selfish hopes of little busy man;<br/>
    The Briton's ire, the Gaul's fierce wrath shall fade,<br/>
        And fall to grace their Maker's final plan.</p>
