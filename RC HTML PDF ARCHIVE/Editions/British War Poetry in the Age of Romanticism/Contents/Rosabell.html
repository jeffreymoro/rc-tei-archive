    <p>1806.8<br/><b>Rosabell<br/>
    A Ballad</b><br/>
    John Mayne <a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (October 28, 1806)<br/></p>
    <p>The troops were all embark'd on board;<br/>
        The ships were under weigh;<br/>
    And loving wives, and maids ador'd,<br/>
        Were weeping round the Bay.<br/></p>
    <p>They parted from their dearest friends,<br/>
        From all their heart desires;<br/>
    And ROSABELL to HEAV'N commends<br/>
        The Man her soul admires!<br/></p>
    <p>For him she fled from soft repose;<br/>
        Renounc'd a Parent's care;<br/>
    He sails to crush his Country's foes—<br/>
        She wanders in despair!<br/></p>
    <p>A Seraph, in an Infant's frame,<br/>
        Reclin'd upon her arm;<br/>
    And sorrow, in the comely Dame,<br/>
        Now heighten'd every charm:<br/></p>
    <p>She thought, if Fortune had but smil'd—<br/>
        She thought upon her Dear;<br/>
    But when she look'd upon his child,<br/>
        O! then ran many a tear!<br/></p>
    <p>"Ah! who will watch thee as thou sleep'st?<br/>
        "Who'll sing a lullaby,<br/>
    "Or rock thy cradle, when thou weep'st,<br/>
        "If I shou'd chance to die!"<br/></p>
    <p>On board the ship, resign'd to Fate,<br/>
        Yet planning joys to come,<br/>
    Her love, in silent sorrow sate,<br/>
        Upon a broken drum:<br/></p>
    <p>He saw her, lonely, on the beach;<br/>
        He saw her on the strand;<br/>
    And, far as human eye can reach,<br/>
        He saw her wave her hand!<br/></p>
    <p>"O, ROSABELL! tho' forc'd to go,<br/>
        "With thee my soul shall dwell;<br/>
    "And HEAV'N, who pities human woe,<br/>
        "Will comfort ROSABELL!"<br/></p>

He went to London in 1787 where he became proprietor and joint editor of <i>The</i><i>Star</i>. His long poem, <i>Siller Gun</i>, expanded over a period 1777-1836, was considered by Walter Scott to be superior to anything of Ferguson and close to Burns (<i>Lady of the Lake</i>, v. 20.).</span>
