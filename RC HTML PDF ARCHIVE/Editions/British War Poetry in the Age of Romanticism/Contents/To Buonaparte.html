    <p>1804.4<br/><b>To Buonaparte</b><br/>
    “G. C.”<br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, XLV (February 1804), p. 143<br/></p>
    <p><i>"The English are nothing but a Nation of Shopkeepers,<br/>
    &amp;c.</i> Vide MONITEUR.<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/></p>
    <p>When the Corsican Chief, with a view to degrade,<br/>
    Says, we're nothing but shopmen, and sneers at our trade:<br/>
    Let none to the obvious assertion object,<br/>
    Nor a charge contradict so extremely correct;<br/>
    'Tis true, Buonaparte—and we wish you to know,<br/>
    That the firm of our partnership's, <i>one King and Co.</i><br/>
    Tho' our <i>first rate</i> productions so oft you decline,<br/>
    And always seem hurt when we send you <i>a line</i>,<br/>
    Yet try us for once, we're quite ready to deal<br/>
    With a capital stock of lead, iron, and steel,<br/>
    And a warehouse long open'd, and constantly fill'd<br/>
    With the <i>choicest</i> of <i>Spirits</i>, most ably distill'd,<br/>
    Not smuggled from France, but, according to my sense,<br/>
    Of full <i>British proof</i>, which <i>we sell with a licence</i>.<br/>
    Should none of these articles prove to your liking,<br/>
    We can shew you some others, tho' nothing so striking.<br/>
    Perhaps you've a wish for our virgins and wives,<br/><i>But these if we sell we must sell with our lives;</i><br/>
    And as for our lives, Buonaparte, I much fear,<br/>
    The price that we ask is a little too dear<br/>
    Ten French for one English—we cannot abate,<br/>
    So <i>high</i> are the <i>duties</i> they owe to the state.<br/>
    These terms if you like, you are welcome to come,<br/>
    Assur'd that you always will find us at <i>home</i>.<br/>
    For the sale we're prepar'd—when you please we'll<br/>
                                 begin it;<br/><i>Upon honour we serve</i>, you shall not wait a minute.</p>
