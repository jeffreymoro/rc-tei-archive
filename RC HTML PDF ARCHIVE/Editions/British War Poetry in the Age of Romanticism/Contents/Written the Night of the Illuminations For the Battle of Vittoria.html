    <p>1813.10<br/><b>Written the Night of the Illuminations<br/>
    For the Battle of Vittoria</b><a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    “C. E.”<br/><i>The Morning Chronicle</i> (August 14, 1813)<br/></p>
    <p>"Hark! the loud peal, the thund'ring gun,<br/>
    "Another glorious field is won,<br/>
    "Another wreath crowns WELLINGTON,<br/>
                     "And Freedom's sacred cause.<br/></p>
    <p>"With nerve of steel, spirit of flame,<br/>
    "Mighty is he, that Chief of fame;<br/>
    "And Europe shouts, with loud acclaim,<br/>
                     "Vittoria, hail! all hail!<br/><br/>
    "And all our soldiers nobly fought;<br/>
    "Nor was the victory dearly bought;<br/>
    "Some fell-but fell as soldiers ought;—<br/>
                     "As all might wish to die!"<br/></p>
    <p>While shouts and blazes rend the sky,<br/>
    So swells the voice of Triumph high,<br/>
    From thousands in mad revelry,<br/>
                     Thousands who know not war;<br/></p>
    <p>Who never in the death-field stood;<br/>
    Nor viewed that fearful scene of blood;<br/>
    Nor heard the ravens scream on their food,<br/>
                     Blackening the noon-day sky.<br/></p>
    <p>But golden tho' this laurel be,<br/>
    Twin'd in the glittering wreath I see<br/>
    The dark leaves of the cypress tree,<br/>
                     Saddening its lovely hue,<br/></p>
    <p>Even at this hour, when Joy's bright blaze<br/>
    Bursts splendid on the entranced gaze,<br/>
    And countless tongues pour boundless praise;<br/>
                     Even at this very hour,<br/></p>
    <p>How many eyes with tears o'erflow!<br/>
    How many hearts are sunk in woe,<br/>
    For those, who in that fight laid low,<br/>
                     To home return no more!<br/></p>
    <p>Silent and cold the Heroes lie;<br/>
    Earth for their bed; their canopy<br/>
    Magnificent—the moonlight sky;<br/>
                     While Heaven's dews weep around.<br/></p>
    <p>'Tis o'er with them—the world is o'er;<br/>
    Slumb'ring upon a foreign shore,<br/>
    The trumpet call they hear no more;<br/>
                     It may not break their rest.<br/></p>
    <p>Spirits, brave spirits, be sweet your sleep;<br/>
    Vigils of joy tonight we keep:<br/>
    But England o'er her fallen will weep,—<br/>
                     The hour of triumph past.<br/></p>
    <p>And those who in that battle bled,<br/>
    On the four winds of the world shall spread<br/>
    The name and the fame of the sacred dead—<br/>
                     Sacred and mourned for ever.</p>
