    <p>1799.8<br/><b>Dialogue<br/>
    Betwixt Peace and War</b><br/>
    “Musaeus”<br/><i>The Monthly Mirror</i>, VII (April 1799), pp. 209-210<br/></p>
    <p>                       Peace.<br/></p>
    <p>    War makes the vulgar multitude to drink<br/>
    In at the ear, the foul and muddy sink<br/>
    Of factious tales, by which they dizzy grow,<br/>
    That the clear sight of truth they do not know,<br/>
    But reeling stand, know not what way to take,<br/>
    And when they chuse, 'tis wrong, so War they make.<br/></p>
    <p>                        War.<br/></p>
    <p>    Thou flatt'ring and most unjust Peace, which draws<br/>
    The vulgar by thy rhet'rick to hard laws,<br/>
    Which makes them silly, and content to be<br/>
    To take up voluntary slavery.<br/>
    Thou mak'st great inequalities beside;<br/>
    Some bear like asses, some on horse-back ride.<br/></p>
    <p>                       Peace.<br/></p>
    <p>    O War, thou cruel enemy to life,<br/>
    Unquiet neighbour, breeding always strife;<br/>
    Tyrant thou art, to rest wilt give no time,<br/>
    And blessed peace thou punishest as crime;<br/>
    All natural affections are by thee<br/>
    Massacred, none escape thy cruelty;<br/>
    The root of all religion thou pull'st up,<br/>
    Dost ev'ry branch of ceremony lop;<br/>
    Civil society to manners base<br/>
    Thou turn'st, no laws nor customs can get place;<br/>
    Each mind within itself cannot agree,<br/>
    But all do strive for superiority:<br/>
    In the whole world thou dost disturbance make;<br/>
    To save themselves none know what ways to take.<br/></p>
    <p>                        War.<br/></p>
    <p>    O Peace, thou idle drone, which lov'st to dwell,<br/>
    If it but keep thee safe, in a poor cell;<br/>
    Thy life thou sleep'st away, thoughts lazy lie:<br/>
    Sloth buries Fame, makes all great actions die.<br/><br/>
                           Peace.<br/></p>
    <p>    I am the bed of rest, and couch of ease,<br/>
    My conversation doth all creatures please;<br/>
    The parent I of learning and of arts,<br/>
    Religion's nurse, and comfort to all hearts;<br/>
    I am the guardian, virtue safe do keep,<br/>
    Under my roof she may securely sleep;<br/>
    I am adorn'd with pastimes and with sports,<br/>
    Each sev'ral creature still to me resorts.<br/></p>
    <p>                        War.<br/></p>
    <p>    A school am I, where all men may grow wise;<br/>
    For prudent wisdom in experience lies;<br/>
    A theatre, where noble minds do stand,<br/>
    A mint of honour, coin'd for valour's hand;<br/>
    I am a throne, which is for valour fit,<br/>
    And a great court, where royal fame may sit;<br/>
    A field, in which ambition much doth run;<br/>
    Courage still seeks me, cowards only shun.<br/></p>
    <p>                                             Yours, &amp;c.</p>
