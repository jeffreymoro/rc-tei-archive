    <p>1793.24<br/><b>The Genius of France</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Cambridge Intelligencer</i> (December 14, 1793)</p>
    <p><br/>
    'Twas night<a href="#1">[1]</a>—that night by fiercest furies led,<br/>
    When lawless crowds the blood of thousands shed;<br/>
    When mad revenge took justice' sacred name,<br/>
    And men, though patriots call'd, breath'd faction's flame;<br/>
    Indignant Gallia's awful genius rose,<br/>
    The wreath of Liberty adorn'd her brows;<br/>
    Alas! that wreath, new wove, began to fade,<br/>
    Each flower desponding, bow'd its languid head:<br/>
    Her faded form, her wounded breast she shew'd,<br/>
    While tears adown her cheek spontaneous flow'd;<br/>
    "How long, my sons," she cried, "shall discord reign,<br/>
    "And you, regardless, wear her fatal chain?<br/>
    "How long shall naughty tyrants taunting cry,<br/>
    "Behold the boasted Gallic Liberty!<br/>
    "How long shall all the wise and good lament,<br/>
    "To see fair freedom's sons on ruin bent!<br/>
    "How long shall widows, orphans, sires, their cause,<br/>
    "Unheeded see, and mourn the trampled laws?<br/>
    "Impatient long, through many a gloomy year<br/>
    "Constrain'd the yoke of slavery to bear,<br/>
    "My country saw, 'neath sad oppression groan,<br/>
    "And servile bend before the tyrant's throne;<br/>
    "What heavenly joy my inmost soul suffus'd,<br/>
    "When the brave band that tyrant's law refus'd;<br/>
    "When France, with honest indignation warm<br/>
    "Felt rising freedom nerve each conquering arm;<br/>
    "Bid every breast the patriot's ardour feel,<br/>
    "And rear the trophy on the fall'n Bastille.<br/>
    "My sons are free! I cried—at length are blest!—<br/>
    "Vain hope if still domestic strifes infest.<br/>
    "If from my shores unhappy myriads fly,<br/>
    "And seek a shelter from a foreign sky;<br/>
    "If commerce fail, if order sink her head,<br/>
    "And faith and mutual confidence be dead;<br/>
    "If patriot magistrates oppose in vain,<br/>
    "And raving anarchy assume the rein;<br/>
    "If rage command in banish'd reason's place,<br/>
    "And injur'd justice hide her mournful face.<br/>
    "If temples be defil'd by shameless bands,<br/>
    "Nor sepulchres escape their impious hands;<br/>
    "If wet with gore still smoke the tepid ground,<br/>
    "And bleeding innocence still shriek around:<br/>
    "If patriots perish by the forc'd decree,<br/>
    "And madmen rule—France cannot then be free.<br/>
    "Oh! cease these horrors—calm domestic ire,<br/>
    "And bid <i>Alecto</i><a href="#2">[2]</a> to the shades retire:<br/>
    "Heal every wound which marks my mangled breast,<br/>
    "And let my troubled soul at length have rest:<br/>
    "When shouts the demagogue, (for such there are,<br/>
    "Who, seeming friends, provoke intestine war,)<br/>
    "Disdain his call, nor let his treacherous tongue<br/>
    "To slaughter lead the wild misguided throng:<br/>
    "Unite, be firm, expiring laws restore,<br/>
    "Let order reign and tumult swell no more.<br/>
    "If freedom's bands unite, let tyrants league—<br/>
    "Let exil'd despots with low arts intrigue:<br/>
    "Let haughty BRUNSWICK<a href="#3">[3]</a> threaten to enslave,—<br/>
    "Their impious arms, their servile hosts we brave:<br/>
    "Advance, ye robbers, come with all your powers,<br/>
    "Charge with o'erwhelming crowds, infest our towers;<br/>
    "Unsheathe your swords, let cannons thundering roar,<br/>
    "Let carnage rage, let meadows stream with gore,<br/>
    "Nought shall appal, 'midst foremost ranks you see,<br/>
    "Avenger bold, the goddess LIBERTY.<br/>
    "She shakes her lance—the vanquish'd legions fly,<br/>
    "Nor stand the lightnings of her beaming eye:<br/>
    "To conquest sure she leads her dauntless train,<br/>
    "And liberty shall echo through the plain.<br/>
    "At that blest name new fervour warns my heart—<br/>
    "Each manly virtue, and each liberal art<br/>
    "To her belong—to her, my sons, you owe<br/>
    "Each good that's worth the wise man's wish below:<br/>
    "Go then, nor waste in civil broils your fire,<br/>
    "One soul (and that be freedom's) all inspire;<br/>
    "Let each a bulwark prove, his country save—<br/>
    "Live free, or rather die that live a slave."</p>
