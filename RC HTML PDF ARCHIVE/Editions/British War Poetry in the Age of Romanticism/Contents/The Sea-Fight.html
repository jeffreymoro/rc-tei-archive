    <p>1809.9<br/><b>The Sea-Fight</b><br/>
    Samuel Elsdale <a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXIX (July, 1809), p. 655<br/></p>
    <p><i>Lines descriptive of an Engagement which took place off</i> Hispaniola, <i>between the</i> English <i>Privateer the</i> Revenge, <i>of</i> 14 <i>Guns, Capt. Wetherall</i>, <i>and a</i> French <i>Merchantman, of Six Hundred Tons burden, and mounting</i> 24 <i>Guns</i>.<br/></p>
    <p>The stars had fled, the sun arose,<br/>
    Along the deep the sea breeze blows,<br/>
    With rippling track the current flows,<br/>
                            The British flag flies gloriously.<br/></p>
    <p>When, lo! a vessel hove in sight,<br/>
    'Twas French; both crews prepare for fight,<br/>
    And summon all their skill and might,<br/>
                            To gain the conquest speedily.<br/></p>
    <p>The English was a privateer,<br/>
    Renown'd for valour far and near;<br/>
    Their Captain Wetherall loud they cheer,<br/>
                            To lead the combat manfully.<br/></p>
    <p>The French for merchandize was made,<br/>
    The Captain late retir'd from trade,<br/>
    For wife and only son afraid,<br/>
                            Fought for his life, love, property.<br/><br/>
    Of murd'rous guns they number'd more,<br/>
    But British hearts, true to the core,<br/>
    Who ne'er in battle flinch'd before,<br/>
                            Rush to close battle furiously.<br/></p>
    <p>With deafening shouts they board the foe,<br/>
    Twice the French Captain aim'd a blow,<br/>
    Two of the English sunk below,<br/>
                            The rest retreated hastily.<br/></p>
    <p>"Turn, cowards, turn," bold Wetherall cried;<br/>
    Furious he boards, and at his side<br/>
    Seldale, whose courage oft was tried,<br/>
                            Assails the foe impetuously,<br/></p>
    <p>The Frenchman's sword, in vengeance drest,<br/>
    Had laid full low the foremost crest,<br/>
    But Seldale pierc'd the hero's breast,<br/>
                            And thus secur'd the victory.<br/></p>
    <p>O cruel, fatal, bloody War!<br/>
    Where'er the Furies drive thy car,<br/>
    Nor husband, sire, nor son they spare,<br/>
                            Fell Slaughter reigns promiscuously.<br/></p>
    <p>Great God of Heaven! to thee we kneel;<br/>
    Thy guardian care may England feel,<br/>
    Secure from hostile fire and steel,<br/>
                            From force and secret treachery!<br/></p>
    <p>Soft Pity weave thy golden chain!<br/>
    May widows, mothers, ne'er complain<br/>
    For husbands, sons, untimely slain;<br/>
                            But ev'ry soul breathe harmony!<br/></p>
    <p>May love 'twixt man and man increase,<br/>
    Stern war and ruthless carnage cease,<br/>
    The world obey the Prince of Peace,<br/>
                            And Mercy reign triumphantly!</p>
