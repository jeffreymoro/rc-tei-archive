    <p>1815.8<br/><b>Ode<br/><i>On the</i> Surrender <i>of</i> Paris to <i>the Allies</i>,<br/><i>March</i> 30, 1814</b><br/>
    Samuel Ashby<br/><i>The New Monthly Magazine</i>, IV (August 1815), pp. 35-36<br/></p>
    <p>'Tis done! th' immortal deed is done!<br/>
        Gallia's imperial city bends;<br/>
        Her Tyrant's dread dominion ends;<br/>
    France from his ruffian grasp is won!<br/>
    Hark! how her shores resound the stroke,<br/>
    The fell Usurper's spell that broke;<br/>
    Burst is the charm, whose magic might<br/>
        Had bound her arm in Slavery's chain,<br/>
    Suppress'd her voice, and seal'd her sight,<br/>
        And spread the desolating reign!<br/>
    Rous'd from her trance, proud Gallia sees,<br/>
        Kings, heroes leagued, surround her walls;<br/>
        Her Tyrant's iron sceptre falls;<br/>
    He falls! so righteous Heaven decrees!<br/>
    Hark! how her shout of joy ascends,<br/>
    Her Victors hail'd Deliverers! Friends!<br/><br/>
    Hail! heir of martyr'd Louis, hail!<br/>
        I see thy glory's Sun emerge<br/>
        Bright from yon gilt horizon's verge;<br/>
    Its beams o'er adverse night prevail!<br/>
    'Tis heaven illumes thy sacred cause,<br/>
        Directs thee to thy native throne;<br/>
    Redeems thy kingdom, empire, laws,<br/>
        Restores the diadem, thine own!<br/>
    Go! Call'd of heaven, thy rights assume,<br/>
        Go! from thy country's Spoiler wrest<br/>
        The ravag'd laurels of his crest,<br/>
    And seize his helmet's regal plume!<br/>
    I see its wreath of crimson die,<br/>
    Blanch in the light'ning of thine eye!<br/>
    I see his haughty visage fall;<br/>
        His tow'ring eagle quits the sky;<br/>
    Perils his coward soul appal;<br/>
        I see him vanquish'd, see him fly!<br/>
    Now is thy royal banner rear'd,<br/>
    By honour's gallant sons rever'd,<br/>
    Where pure thy native lilies grow,<br/>
    Unstain'd with blood as alpine snow;<br/>
    While Gallia shouts from shore to shore,<br/>
    A bas le Tyran! Vive le Roi!<br/></p>
    <p>Now, Louis, let thy nobler soul,<br/>
        A more than mortal vengeance dare;<br/>
    Yield not to rage's fierce controul,<br/>
        But bid thy prowess greatly spare!<br/>
    Nor stoop thou to thy fallen foe,<br/>
        Nor let thy sword efface his shame;<br/>
    Forbid a miscreant's blood to flow,<br/>
        Nor grant the death—a soldier's fame!<br/>
    But, for thy wrongs, thy country's woes,<br/>
        The manes of her sainted King,<br/>
    Leave him the rack of guilt's repose,<br/>
        Life, with remorse's scorpion sting!<br/></p>
    <p>Britain rejoice! the meed is thine;<br/>
        Europe thy great example caught;<br/>
        With thy subduing spirit fought;<br/>
    Her's with thy victor palms intwine;<br/>
    To thee her states deliverance own,<br/>
    Her laurels grace thy triumph's crown!<br/>
    Britannia, Europe's guardian Queen,<br/>
        The trophy-blazon'd field surveys;<br/>
    Exulting views the dazzling scene,<br/>
        Concent'ring midst her glory's rays;<br/>
    Her songs of praise to heaven ascend;<br/>
    She bids triumphal arches bend;<br/>
    Genii with olive deck her car,<br/>
        Her lion on her shield repose,<br/>
        The lily flourish with the rose,<br/>
    Her conq'ring heroes cease from war!<br/>
    Now be each hostile standard furl'd,<br/>
    Freedom and Peace restore the world.</p>
