    <p>1794.2<br/><b>To My Country</b><br/>
    "A. B."<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXIV (February 1794), pp. 163-164<br/></p>
    <p>        The Bees and the Wasps.</p>
    <p>    The vernal Sun's enliv'ning ray<br/>
            To labour cheer'd a hive of bees;<br/>
        Their patient toil, from day to day,<br/>
            The prize of industry atchieves. [sic]<br/>
    In vain bleak Winter scoul'd upon his throne;<br/>
    Their cells were fill'd, their summer's task was done.<br/><br/>
        In full satiety they liv'd;<br/>
            Their king beneficent in mind;<br/>
        No want perplex'd, no anguish griev'd,<br/>
            But peace and plenty were conjoin'd.<br/>
    In revelry they sipp'd the luscious store;<br/>
    On in sweet slumbers pass'd the winter o'er.</p>
    <p>    How bless'd a government so mild!<br/>
            But lasting bliss is not on earth;<br/>
        Fell faction and rebellion wild,<br/>
            Receive from pamper'd lux'ry birth.<br/>
    Indulgence, sloth, and brooding spleen malign,<br/>
    The happy hive to wretched strife consign.</p>
    <p>    An upstart bee first shew'd his sting,<br/>
            And humming discontent began—<br/>
        "Shall we, my friends, support a king,<br/>
            "Who owes his title to our clan?<br/>
    "Behold his size, his awful regal state—<br/>
    "His growth expands from our laborious fate.</p>
    <p>    "Shall we submit to royal pride;<br/>
            "Obey his mandate, view his scorn?—<br/>
        "To arms, my friends: for war provide,<br/>
            "To free equality we're born.<br/>
    "Let hostile swarms provoke the civil strife,<br/>
    And bee with bee contend for death or life."</p>
    <p>    But, mark! sedate, the wisest bee<br/>
            Surrounds the throne with noble ire;<br/>
        The lawless throng shout liberty,<br/>
            And to their vaunting chief retire.<br/>
    The vaunting chief persuades the rebel throng<br/>
    T'assail the monarch, whether <i>right or wrong</i>.</p>
    <p>    Nor parent tie or kindred claim,<br/>
        When host join host, regard;<br/>
        Each combatant to kill or maim,<br/>
        Sedition's glory and reward.<br/>
    The father, son and brother, strew the ground,<br/>
    And death insatiate heaps the bloody mound.</p>
    <p>    At length the wasps, a murd'ring crew,<br/>
            The rebel-bees to join invite;<br/>
        The fierce invaders quickly slew,<br/>
            And stole the honey with delight;<br/>
    Pretended friends t'espouse the rebel cause,<br/>
    Entic'd by plunder, and to give new laws.</p>
    <p>    The silly bees too late perceiv'd<br/>
            Their treasure rifled by false friends,<br/>
        And, oh! by Faction's glare deceiv'd,<br/>
            Destruction o'er the hive impends.<br/>
    In loyal union 'gainst the wasps combine;<br/>
    Respect their king, and patriots patriots join.<br/></p>
    <p>    The factious crowd now wait their doom;<br/>
            The humbled chieftian prostrate falls;<br/>
        Gaunt civil war for peace makes room,<br/>
            And the drain'd hive for justice calls,<br/>
    Rebellion's guilt is punish'd; but the smart<br/>
    Reaches too deep, and strikes the kingdom's heart.</p>
