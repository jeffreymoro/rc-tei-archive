    <p>1797.8<br/><b>Lines<br/>
    Written by Anna Seward,<br/>
    After Reading Southey's "Joan of Arc."</b><a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    Anna Seward<br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, XXXII (August 1797), pp. 118-119<br/></p>
    <p>Base is the purpose of this Epic Song,<br/>
    Baneful its powers: but, oh, the Poesy<br/>
    ("What can it less when Sun-born GENIUS sings?")<a href="#2">[2]</a><br/>
    Wraps in reluctant ecstasy the soul<br/>
    Where Poesy is felt! e'en tho' it paint,<br/>
    In all the lurid traits of NERO's heart,<br/>
    The high heroic spirit of that Monarch<br/>
    Who grac'd the Crown he wore, BRITANNIA's Boast—<br/>
    "HARRY OF MONMOUTH!"—He who ne'er expos'd<br/>
    His ardent legions on the deathful plain<br/>
    Where flam'd not his broad shield, and his<br/>
                        white plumes<br/>
    Play'd in the battle's van. What claim'd<br/>
                           he then<br/>
    From France, at the sword's point, but ceded<br/>
                            rights?<br/>
    Howe'er perfidiously withheld, tho' pledg'd<br/>
    For aye to England, after the proud day<br/>
    Of Cressy'd thund'ring<a href="#3">[3]</a> field. Then GALLIA'S<br/>
                             Star<br/>
    Sunk—and the Planet of the "argent Shores"<br/>
    Rose glitt'ring on the Zenith's azure height,<br/>
    What time, upon the broken spears of France,<br/>
    And prostrate helms, immortal GLORY stood—<br/>
    And, with the Lilies of that vaunting clime,<br/>
    Like a gay Bride, entwin'd the victor brows<br/>
    Of our great Edward.<a href="#4">[4]</a> Oh, unnat'ral Boy;<br/>
    Oh, beardless Paricide!—thy treach'rous<br/>
                            Muse<br/>
    In Comet splendour, in MEDUSA'S beauty<br/>
    Balefully deck'd, an impious task essays,<br/>
    Lab'ring to turn to deadliest Aconite<br/>
    The Laurel wreaths of Azincour; to brand<br/>
    The hallow'd lustre of thy ENGLAND'S name<br/>
    With slavish Meanness, with rapacious Avarice,<br/>
    And the Wolf's rage. ENGLAND, whose martial<br/>
                            fire<br/>
    Applauding ages have pronounc'd, adorn'd<br/>
    With fair Munificence, and temper'd still<br/>
    By dove ey'd Mercy's sway. O, dark of heart<br/>
    As luminous of fancy, quit, for shame<br/>
    Quit, th' insidious pretence to Virtue—<br/>
    To Gospel Faith, and Piety! Dry thy tears<br/>
    For age-past woes (they are the Crocodile's);<br/>
    And o'er the murder of the ROYAL VICTIMS,<br/>
    And o'er the Christian Faith's apostacy,<br/>
    With blood of Innocents, and Martyr-flames<br/>
    Witness'd in France, cry—"VIVE LA LIBERTE!"<br/>
    Dip thy young hands in her ensanguin'd chalice,<br/>
    Brimm'd with the gore of Age, Infants, and<br/>
                         Beauty,<br/>
    And, throwing her RED CAP aloft in air,<br/>
    Laugh with the fierce Hyena!</p>
