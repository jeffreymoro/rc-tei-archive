    <p>1800.6<br/><b>A New Song</b><br/>
    “G. F. S.”<br/><i>The Courier</i> (December 27, 1800)<br/></p>
    <p>To the tune of "<i>The tight little island</i>."<br/></p>
    <p>Tho' of Emp'rors and Kings, and all such fine things,<br/>
        Historians and novelists bawl-o;<br/>
    Yet none e'er shone in store, with half so much glory,<br/>
        As the great Russian Emperor Paul-o.<br/></p>
    <p>Then oh! sing of Emperor Paul-o, magnanimous Emperor<br/>
                                  Paul-o,<br/>
    No one ever was known so deserving the throne,<br/>
        As the valorous Emperor Paul-o!<br/></p>
    <p>    When a promise he made, that he France would invade,<br/>
            And soon humble ev'ry proud Gaul-o,<br/>
        Ev'ry one 'gan to raise his weak voice in the praise<br/>
            Of our ally, the great Emperor Paul-o;<br/>
    What a friend was the Emperor Paul-o, quite a bulwark was<br/>
                                  Petersburgh Paul-o!<br/>
    And 'twas every one's sure hope, the Saviour of Europe<br/>
        Would be found in the Emperor Paul-o!<br/></p>
    <p>    Just when he was so hearty, up jumps Bonaparte,<br/>
            For in truth, Sir, his hopes were quite small-o;<br/>
        Yet by dint of intrigue, he soon broke up the league<br/>
            Between us and the Emperor Paul-o.—<br/>
    Oh faithless Emperor Paul-o! Changeable Emperor Paul-o!<br/>
    It must raise our surprise to hear so many lies<br/>
        From his Honour the Emperor Paul-o.<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/></p>
    <p>    Then he fram'd a pretence, without reason or sense,<br/>
            To make us give Malta up all-o,<br/>
        For he thought that his might would put Britons in<br/>
                                  fright,<br/>
            As he was the great Master Paul-o;<br/>
    No, no, my dear sweet Master Paul-o, you're quite in the<br/>
                                  wrong, Mr. Paul-o,<br/>
    We're too much enlighten'd to be at all frighten'd<br/>
        By the threats of the Emperor Paul-o,<br/></p>
    <p>    Upon this he began to enlist every man,<br/>
            And his troops all together to call-o,<br/>
        And his messengers far-go to lay an embargo,<br/>
            By orders of Emperor Paul-o:<br/>
    For says he, I'm the Emperor Paul-o; they shall suffer<br/>
                                  says Emperor Paul-o,<br/>
    And my standard unfurl'd shall astonish the world,<br/>
        For there's war between Britain and Paul-o!<br/></p>
    <p>    So it's in contemplation to make proclamation<br/>
            To our Admirals, both short, Sir, and tall-o,<br/>
        To seize on his fleet, the moment they see't,<br/>
            And retaliate on Emperor Paul-o.<br/></p>
    <p>So take care, my dear Emperor Paul-o; you'll repent of<br/>
                                  this, Emperor Paul-o;<br/>
    For if we send Nelson, he surely will tell soon,<br/>
        Some news of the vessels of Paul-o.<br/></p>
    <p><i>Oxfordshire, 19th Dec</i>.</p>
