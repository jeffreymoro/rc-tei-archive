    <p>1803.6<br/><b>The Voice of the British Isles</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The European Magazine</i>, XLIV (August 1803), pp. 137-138<br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXXIII (July 1803), p. 666<br/></p>
    <p>To the Tune of <i>"Hearts of Oak."</i><br/></p>
    <p>                                I.<br/></p>
    <p>Away, my brave boys! haste away to the shore;<br/>
    Our foes, the base French, boast they're straight<br/>
                            coming o'er,<br/>
    To murder, and plunder, and ravish; and burn—<br/>
    Let them come—we'll take care they shall never<br/>
                               return:<br/>
        For around all our shores, hark! the notes<br/>
                             loudly ring,<br/>
            United, we're ready,<br/>
            Steady, boys, steady,<br/>
        To fight for our Liberty, Laws, and our King.<br/><br/>
                                    II.<br/></p>
    <p>They boast in the dark they will give us the slip;<br/>
    The attempt may procure them a dangerous dip:<br/>
    Our bold tars are watching in Ocean's green lap,<br/>
    To give them a long <i>Jacobinical nap</i>.<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
        But should they steal over, with one voice we'll<br/>
                                  sing,<br/>
           United, we're ready, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>                               III.<br/></p>
    <p>They knew that, UNITED, we sons of the waves<br/>
    Would ne'er bow to Frenchmen, nor grovel like slaves;<br/>
    So, ere they durst venture to touch on our strand,<br/>
    They sent black <i>Sedition</i> to poison our land,<br/>
        But around all our shores <i>now</i> the notes loudly<br/>
                                  ring,<br/>
            United, we're ready, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>                               IV.<br/></p>
    <p>They swore we were slaves, were all lost and undone,<br/>
    That a <i>Jacobin nostrum</i>, as sure as a gun,<br/>
    Would make us all equal, and happy, and free,<br/>
    'Twas only to dance round <i>their</i> Liberty's tree.<br/>
        No! No! round our shores let the notes loudly<br/>
                                  ring,<br/>
            United, we're ready, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>                                 V.<br/></p>
    <p>'Twas only to grant them the kiss call'd <i>fraternal</i>,<br/>
    A kiss which all Europe has found most <i>infernal</i>;<br/>
    And then they maintain'd the effect could not miss—<br/>
    We should all be as <i>blest</i> as the DUTCH and the SWISS!<br/>
        No! no! round our shores let the notes loudly<br/>
                                  ring,<br/>
            United, we're ready, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>                                VI.<br/></p>
    <p>With lies, and with many a Gallican wile,<br/>
    They spread their dire poison o'er Erin's green isle;<br/>
    But now each <i>Shillalah</i> is ready to thwack,<br/>
    And baste the lean ribs of the Gallican Quack.<br/>
    All around Erin's shores, hark! the notes loudly<br/>
                                 ring,<br/>
            United, we're ready, &amp;c.<br/><br/>
                                   VII.<br/></p>
    <p>Stout Sandy, our brother, with heart and with hand,<br/>
    And his well-tried <i>Claymore</i>, joins the patriot band.<br/>
    Now JACK, PAT, and SANDY, thus cordial agree,<br/>
    We sons of the waves shall forever be free,<br/>
        While around all our shores, hark! the notes loudly<br/>
                                 ring,<br/>
            United, we're ready, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>                              VIII.<br/></p>
    <p>As they could not deceive, they <i>now</i> threaten to pour<br/>
    Their hosts on our land, to lay waste and devour;<br/>
    To drench our fair fields and our cities in gore,<br/>
    Nor cease to destroy till Britannia's no more.<br/>
        Let them come if they dare—hark! the notes loudly<br/>
                                 ring,<br/>
            United, we're ready, &amp;c.<br/></p>
    <p>                               IX.<br/></p>
    <p>My sweet rosy Nan is a true British wife,<br/>
    And loves her dear Jack as she loves her own life;<br/>
    Yet she girds on my sword, and smiles while I glow,<br/>
    To meet the proud French, and to lay their heads low:<br/>
        And chaunts 'tween each buss, while the notes loudly<br/>
                                ring,<br/>
            My Jack! thou art ready:<br/>
            Steady, boy, steady,<br/>
        Go! fight for thy Liberty, Laws, and thy King.<br/></p>
    <p>                               X.<br/></p>
    <p>And Ned, my brave lad, with a true British heart,<br/>
    Has forsaken his plough, has forsaken his cart;<br/>
    E'en Dolly has quitted, to dig in a trench,<br/>
    All, all, for the sake of a cut at the French;<br/>
        While he sings all day long, let the notes loudly<br/>
                               ring,<br/>
            I'm ready! I'm ready!<br/>
            Steady, boys, steady,<br/>
        To fight for my Liberty, Laws, and my King!<br/><br/>
                                   XI.<br/></p>
    <p>Away, then, my boys! haste away to the shore,<br/>
    Our foes, the base French, boast they're straight<br/>
                           coming o'er,<br/>
    To murder, and plunder, and ravish, and burn—<br/>
    They may come—but, by Jove! they <i>shall</i> never return;<br/>
        For around all our shores, hark! the notes loudly<br/>
                                ring,<br/>
            United, we're ready,<br/>
            Steady, boys, steady,<br/>
        To fight for our Liberty, Laws, and our King!</p>
