    <p>1797.9<br/><b>Ode to Peace</b><br/>
    "Crito"<br/>
    [Rev. John Duncombe]<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/><i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, LXVII (August 1797), pp. 693-694<br/></p>
    <p>O'er desolated fields, where move<br/>
    To War's dread notes th' embattled host,<br/>
    O Peace! display thy olive-wreath,<br/>
    And bid the gentle voice of Love<br/>
    (Soft as the Zephyr's vernal breeze)<br/>
    From coast to coast,<br/>
    In Rancour's hostile bosom breathe,<br/>
    That warring passions there may cease,<br/>
    And all the World be Harmony and Peace!<br/>
    Then, from the castle's massy gate,<br/>
    No more shall War's dread squadrons pour;<br/>
    No more shall the awful charge of fate,<br/>
    Around the peasant's hapless bow'r,<br/>
    Shall by the trumpet's breath be blown,<br/>
    Till all the kindled rage of battle glows:<br/>
    But, Peace! in thy propitious reign,<br/>
    The sons of Industry compose<br/>
    A rural wreath, to deck thy radiant throne,<br/>
    Of <i>Flora's</i> blushing flow'rs and <i>Autumn's</i> golden grain.<br/>
    For all th' aspiring upland's brow,<br/>
    And all the vale that winds below,<br/>
    Th' unweary'd hand of Cultivation own,<br/>
    And Population's chearful voice is heard in<br/>
                            ev'ry town!<br/></p>
    <p>Then boldly, ev'n on desert seas,<br/>
    Adventure's sail shall court the breeze,<br/>
    And to uncultur'd nations bear<br/>
    The civil bliss that <i>Britons</i> share;<br/>
    While Commerce, with her sails unfurl'd,<br/>
    Brings to her ports the product of the world,<br/>
    Till all the tide of wealth expand<br/>
    In various channels through the land;<br/>
    While laws that Freedom's flame inspires<br/>
    Protect the property that Toil acquires;<br/>
    And <i>Britain's</i> gen'rous bosom warms,<br/>
    In grateful feelings, round her patriot king,<br/>
    From whose paternal cares these heav'nly<br/>
                        blessings spring;<br/>
        Or with resentment glows<br/>
    At treach'rous <i>Gaul's</i> ambitious aim,<br/>
    Whose cold malignant heart ne'er knows<br/>
    The patriot light that gilds a Brunswick's name!<br/><br/>
    Tho', gentle Peace, thou fly the plain<br/>
    Where Valour leads the warrior train,<br/>
    And Discord, in his iron car,<br/>
    Swells high th' impetuous rage of War;<br/>
    Yet, to the <i>Muse's</i> raptur'd eye,<br/>
    Two of the gentle train are near,<br/>
    Soft Pity that bestows its sigh,<br/>
    And Sympathy that prompts the tear.<br/>
    Sweet mourning nymphs! 'tis yours to learn<br/>
    Each deeply-plaintive tale at Sorrow's<br/>
                         sacred urn.<br/></p>
    <p>Oft, <i>Mourners!</i> to yon living tomb,<br/>
    Where sad the captive soldier lies,<br/>
    While sickly damps around him rise,<br/>
    Pensive and sad in shadowy stole ye come;<br/>
        Or join yon hoary form,<br/>
    Who, from domestic comfort torn,<br/>
    By Sorrow's frequent vigils worn,<br/>
    Expos'd to Age's wint'ry storm,<br/>
        Without a friend,<br/>
    Sighs to the passing gales that bend<br/>
    The arbour, where Youth's visionary ray<br/>
    Had promis'd fairer views to Life's retiring day.<br/>
    And long his sacred griefs shall fall<br/>
    On this bleak desert, cold and wild;<br/>
    For, at Affection's ardent call<br/>
    No more returns his absent child;<br/>
    That child 'midst Valour's ranks has bled,<br/>
    And many an ev'ning sun has gilt his<br/>
                      grassy bed!<br/></p>
    <p>What are the triumphs <i>Gallia</i> boasts;<br/>
    The blood-stain'd wreaths that crown her hosts,<br/>
    To the mild joys that civil arts bestow,<br/>
    The calm of social life, and Freedom's<br/>
                    temperate glow?<br/>
    And, Britain! in this radiant sphere, 'tis thine<br/>
    In Glory's tranquil dignity to shine;<br/>
    Save when Ambition grasps the lance,<br/>
    And, in tumultuous fury hurl'd,<br/>
    Shake with convulsing arms the world:<br/>
    Then from the wave encircled shore,<br/>
    As far as Neptune's billows roar,<br/>
    'Midst Vict'ry's wreaths thou bidd'st the<br/>
                floating war advance!<br/><br/>
    Tho' now the British thunder roll,<br/>
    In awful peals, from Pole to Pole;<br/>
    Yet, in the Muse's radiant eye,<br/>
    Thy sacred form, O Peace! is nigh;<br/>
    And, from her soft, prophetic tongue,<br/>
    These gentle accents breathe along:<br/>
    "No more the clarion's martial sound<br/>
    "Shall vibrate o'er the tented ground;<br/>
    "But thither Love and Joy repair,<br/>
    "And shed a sweet contagion there;<br/>
    "No more the Pencil's glowing dies<br/>
    "Shall bid the Epic Field arise;<br/>
    "The eye from Valour's imag'd deeds,<br/>
    "At Pity's soft impulse, recedes;<br/>
    "The hero's name, in notes of fire,<br/>
    "No more shall tremble from the lyre,<br/>
    "But, in the <i>Reed's</i> sweet warbling lays,<br/>
    "Shall live some theme of rural praise;<br/>
    "While, circling round the social hearth,<br/>
    "Soft fly the choral songs of mirth;<br/>
    "And 'midst the sylvan shades are heard<br/>
    "(When on the crimson'd hill<br/>
    "The Sun has left his farewell rays.)<br/>
    "The breathing lute, the Ev'ning's plaintive bird,<br/>
    "The breeze that 'midst the trembling foliage plays,<br/>
    "And the sweet plaintive voice of many<br/>
    "a murm'ring rill."</p>
