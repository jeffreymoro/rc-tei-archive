<p>1797.7<br/><b>A Family Dialogue,<br/>
    On a Son's Wishing to Go to Sea</b><br/>
    Anon<br/><i>The Morning Post</i> (August 22, 1797)<br/></p>
<p>Tell me, dear Giles, your favorite views,<br/>
    Your wish is mine, I'd have you chuse,<br/>
    Tis time to fix, you're growing old,<br/>
    For twice six years are nearly told.<br/>
    The learn'd professions are but three,<br/>
    Say, which of these you wish to be.<br/></p>
<p>    "Not of the law, I cannot drudge,"<br/>
    "I'm sure I ne'er should be a judge;"<br/>
    "Not of the church, perhaps to clear,"<br/>
    "As you do, fifty pounds a year;"<a href="#1">[1]</a><br/>
    "Throw physic to the dogs for me,"<br/>
    "My choice, my object is the sea."<br/></p>
<p>    And can you tear yourself away<br/>
    From your young friends at school, at play,<br/>
    From quoits, from cricket, from the chance,<br/>
    The comforts of your native place,<br/>
    And each lov'd parent's fond embrace?<br/>
    And can you wish, instead of these,<br/>
    The toils, the dangers of the seas,<br/>
    The cot, the watch, the inclement air,<br/>
    The darken'd mess-room's scanty fare,<br/>
    The six years servitude below,<br/>
    And all the hardships sailors know?<br/></p>
<p>    "Full well I know the change is great,"<br/>
    "But yet be mine a sailor's fate."<br/>
    "Quick let me sail, when haughty Spain"<br/>
    "Claims the wide empire of the main."<br/>
    "I burn to go 'midst war's alarms"<br/>
    "When Britain calls her sons to arms,"<br/>
    "And Howe commands, and Jervis leads"<br/>
    "Her gallant fleet to glorious deeds."<br/>
    "O grant my wish, and let my choice"<br/>
    "Be sanction'd by a father's voice."<br/></p>
<p>    No more you wishes I oppose,<br/>
    Go and engage your country's foes,<br/>
    Pursue your brave but dangerous plan,<br/>
    In age a child, in mind a man.<br/><br/>
    Should heaven regard a father's prayer,<br/>
    And save a mother from despair,<br/>
    Protect amidst the bloody strife<br/>
    Our infant hero's valued life,<br/>
    A future war may place your name,<br/>
    Conspicuous in the lists of fame,<br/>
    In many an arduous conflict tried,<br/>
    The dread of France, your country's pride.<br/>
    If to our wish that day be given,<br/>
    We ask no other boon of Heaven.</p>
