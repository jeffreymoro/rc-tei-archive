    <p>1804.21<br/><b>The Frogs and Crane</b><br/>
    “J. H.”<br/><i>The Anti-Gallican</i> (1804), p. 236<br/></p>
    <p>Aesop,<a href="#1">[1]</a> strange fabulist! what tiny frog<br/>
        Dares leap the giant bulk; with lying prate<br/>
        Seduce the squalid multitude—elate<br/>
    To crush distinction and contemn King Log?<br/>
    Like lunatics, bid Stranger rule the bog;<br/>
        Themselves, allies, subscrib'd to anger sate—<br/>
    Whose subjects, deaf, dumb, blind, sculk round <i>in-cog</i>.<br/>
    Sees human sacrifices wait his word;<br/>
        Crippling, from Holland's dykes to Egypt's springs,<br/>
        Stadtholders, Pope, Electors, Beys and Kings;<br/>
    Mocks half the globe, a self-created lord?<br/>
    Why on such man her cap would Folly place,<br/><i>With, "Hail, dread Emperor of the croaking race."</i></p>

                        <span class="footnote_text">1. This poem refers to Aesop's fable in which the frogs, who lived quite pleasant lives, petitioned Jupiter for a king. Jupiter first sent them a log, but when the frogs petitioned for a different king, he sent a stork, which devoured the frogs.
