<p>Melissa Sites swiftly secured and then encoded copies of Shelley's poem, a list of relevant critical articles, and the essays that appear here in full. Eleanor Shevlin prepared and mounted the images that appear in this electronic edition and also constructed the cover and contents pages to conform to<i>Romantic Circles</i> format for electronic editions.</p>
