<p><b><a name="L1-28" id="L1-28">lines 1-28.</a></b> Here we transcribe the original manuscript in <b>Shelley</b>'s mid-Jan. 1812 letter to <b>Elizabeth Hitchener</b> (<b>British Library</b> Add. MS. 37,496, f. 80 verso); there is a facsimile of the portion of that letter containing this poetic text, together with another literal transcription, in <i>MYR: Shelley</i>, VIII, ed. D. H. Reiman &amp; M. O'Neill (Garland, 1997), 50-56.</p>
<p>Although the text of these stanzas in F. L. Jones's <i><b>Letters</b></i> (I, 235-37) places some characters at the ends of the first 28 lines within brackets, as though they were illegible or missing from the right-hand edge of the manuscript page, the only damage and repair that actually affecting these lines are along the fold of the letter paper at the <i>left-hand</i> edge of the column of poetry--at the <i>beginnings</i> of those lines. Jones must, therefore, have relied upon an imperfect photocopy of the manuscript.</p>
<p><b><a name="L6" id="L6">line 6.</a></b> <i>earth</i> : the initial <i>e</i> may be a capital letter, written minutely.</p>
<p><b><a name="L14" id="L14">line 14.</a></b> We think that the first word is more likely <i>Grinning</i>--as the editors of the letters have it--than "Receiving" (<i>1989</i>). This reading accords with the syntax, since the basix meaning of <i>applause</i> is "approval publicly expressed" and Satan is the active agent throughout this stanza. M. O'Neill, when transcribing the MS for <i>MYR: Shelley</i>, VIII, was dubious about the reading but left "Receiving" in the text, while discussing his doubts in a note.</p>
<p><b><a name="L16" id="L16">line 16.</a></b> <b>Shelley</b> first underscored <i>they</i>, and then canceled the underline.</p>
<p><b><a name="L20" id="L20">line 20.</a></b> <b>Shelley</b> left a blank after <i>were</i> to be filled later--presumably by a word rhyming with <i>prayer</i> (<b>18</b>).</p>
<p><b><a name="L22" id="L22">line 22.</a></b> <i>thats</i> (sic).</p>
<p><b><a name="L25-28" id="L25-28">lines 25-28.</a></b> This is the stanza that <b>Shelley</b> directly recollected (though perhaps unwittingly) from <a href="/editions/shelley/devil/devil.stc1799.html"><i>The Devil's Thoughts</i></a> (see <a href="/editions/shelley/devil/brnotes.html#B84-87">note to <b>lines 84-87</b></a> of the Broadside). In the letter version, however, <b>Shelley</b> miswrote <i>the Devil</i> for "a lawyer" in <b>line 25</b>; in <b>26</b> <i>his</i> is superimposed on <i>the</i>.</p>
<p><b><a name="L29" id="L29">line 29.</a></b> Beginning with this line, <b>Shelley</b> continued his writing on the opposite side of the address panel; from here on, the repair to the worn fold is along the <i>right-hand</i> edge of the text, where the damage does affect the final letters of some words.</p>
<p><b><a name="L32" id="L32">line 32.</a></b> <i>twisted</i> : though <i>1989</i> reads this word as "twirled" (and emends <i>twisted</i> in the final text to "twirled" as a possible typo), the crucial letters seem to us to be <i>st.</i></p>
<p><b><a name="L36" id="L36">line 36.</a></b> <i>human<strike>s</strike></i>: <b>Shelley</b> canceled the terminal "s" in his draft.</p>
<p><b><a name="L41" id="L41">line 41.</a></b> <i>bond Street beau</i> (sic).</p>
<p><b><a name="L42" id="L42">line 42.</a></b> <i>For</i>: this word might be read as "Nor" were there not an identical <i>For</i> at the beginning of <b>line 23</b>; <i><strike>al</strike>tho</i>: first two letters are canceled.</p>
<p><b><a name="L43-44" id="L43-44">lines 43-44.</a></b> <b>Shelley</b>, the son of an M.P., had probably seen Castlereagh in person and would certainly have known political caricatures of him.</p>
<p><b><a name="L47" id="L47">line 47.</a></b> <i>hore</i> (given as "horse" in <i>1927</i> [Julian, <i>Letters</i> ], and <i>1964J</i> and as "Iron" in <i>1989</i>): this Germanic word comes directly from Old English. The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> gives it only as an obsolete noun meaning "Dirt, filth, defilement, foulness"; but though the noun had dropped out of use, probably because of its closeness to "hoar" and "whore," <b>Shelley</b> here uses it adjectively, meaning filthy or foul--a usage that may have persisted in rural Sussex.</p>
<p><b><a name="L48" id="L48">line 48.</a></b> <i>and</i>: written minutely and unclearly, but not "&amp;" (as in <i>1989</i>).<br/>
