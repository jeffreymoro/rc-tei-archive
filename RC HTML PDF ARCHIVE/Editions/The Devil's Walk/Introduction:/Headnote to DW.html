    <h3>The Devil's Walk, A Ballad:</h3>
    <p>The first evidence that <b>Shelley</b> had begun this poem appears at the end of his letter to <b>Elizabeth Hitchener</b> of ?16 January 1812 (Jones, ed. <b><i>The Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</i></b> I, 235-37; <b>British Library</b> Add. MS 37496, f. 80v), in which <b>Shelley</b> included seven irregular ballad stanzas (49 lines) on the theme of Satan's encounters with members of the British establishment, introducing the poetry thus: "Here follows a few stanzas which may amuse you. I was once rather fond of the Devil."</p>
    <p>The stanzas are modeled on <a href="/editions/shelley/devil/devil.stc1799.html"><i>The Devil's Thoughts</i></a>, a poem that <b>Southey</b> and <b>Coleridge</b> had composed jointly and published (anonymously) in the <i>Morning Post</i>, 6 Sept. 1799. (That text appears in the notes to J.D. Campbell's <i>Poetical Works of <b>Samuel Taylor Coleridge</b></i> [1893 etc.], 621-22.) <b>Shelley</b> probably first read <i>The Devil's Thoughts</i> while seeing <b>Southey</b> at Keswick, beginning near Christmas 1811. Before they met, <b>Shelley</b> had been prejudiced against <b>Southey</b> by reports that he had grown more conservative, but after they talked a few times, he wrote to <b>Hitchener</b>: "Southey tho' far from being a man of great reasoning powers is a great Man. . . . He is a man of virtue, he never will belie what he thinks" (Jones, ed. <b><i>Letters</i></b> I, 212). <b>Southey</b>'s contemporary letters show that he and <b>Shelley</b> discussed the relation of <b>Southey</b>'s youthful political and religious beliefs to <b>Shelley</b>'s current ones. If during these conversations <b>Shelley</b> confessed to <b>Southey</b> his school-boy attempts to raise the Devil, <b>Southey</b> likely tried to maintain his rapport with the youthful enthusiast by showing him his own early anti-establishment poems, including <i>The Devil's Thoughts</i>.<br/>
