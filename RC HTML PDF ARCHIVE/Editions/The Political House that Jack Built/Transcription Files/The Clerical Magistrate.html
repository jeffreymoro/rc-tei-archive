<p><em><strong>Note</strong></em><strong>:</strong> <cite>The Clerical Magistrate</cite> is a separate poem, attached as a kind of coda to <cite>The Political House that Jack Built.</cite> Judging by internal evidence, it seems likely that the poem was originally intended as an accumulation in <cite>The Political House</cite> but, perhaps in the process of composition, it took on a life of its own. The central themes of the poem--religious hypocrisy and the incompatibility of religious and civil authority--were issues that frequently drew Hone's satirical attention. The figure depicted in Cruikshank's image and attacked in Hone's verse is the Reverend Charles Ethelston of Manchester.&#160; As both a clergyman in the English church and a local magistrate who recommended hanging as an appropriate punishment for the more prominent radicals of the Peterloo meeting, he became an obvious symbol of the incompatibility of "quietness, peace, and love" supposedly associated with the church and the vindictive punishments more typical of an embattled civil authority.</p>
<p>The text reproduced here comes from the forty-fourth edition of Hone's <cite>Political House.</cite> I have regularized the lineation for ease of reading. The images are clickable links to facsimile pages. The first epigraph comes from <em>The Form of Ordination</em> for a priest in the English church; the second comes from William Cowper's <em>The Task</em>, Book II, lines 332-36, and line 408. The postscript lines following the closing image of the Cap of Liberty are from Book V, 446-48.</p>

    <p class="indent5"><strong>THIS IS A PRIEST,</strong> made 'according to Law',<br/>
        Who, on being ordain'd, vow'd, by rote, like a daw,<br/>
        That, he felt himself call'd, by the Holy Spirit,<br/>
        To teach men the Kingdom of Heaven to merit;<br/>
        That, to think of the World and the flesh he'd cease,<br/>
        And keep men in quietness, love and peace;<br/>
        And, making thus his profession and boast,<br/>
        Receiv'd, from the Bishop, the Holy Ghost:<br/>
        Then--not having the fear of God before him--<br/>
        Is sworn in a Justice, and one of the <i>Quorum;</i><br/>
        'Gainst his spiritual Oath, puts his Oath of the Bench,<br/>
        And, instead of his Bible, examines a wench;<br/>
        Gets Chairman of Sessions--leaves his flock, sick, or dying,<br/>
        To license Ale-houses--and assist in the trying<br/>
        Of prostitutes, poachers, pickpockets and thieves;--<br/>
        Having <i>charged</i> the Grand Jury, dines with them, and gives<br/>
        "CHURCH AND KING without day-light;" gets <i>fresh</i>, and puts in-<br/>
        To the stocks vulgar people who fuddle with gin:<br/>
        Stage coachmen, and toll-men, convicts as he pleases;<br/>
        And beggars and paupers incessantly teazes:<br/>
        Commits starving vagrants, and orders Distress<br/>
        On the Poor, for their Rates--signs warrants to press,<br/>
        And beats up for names to a Loyal Address:<br/>
        Would indict, for Rebellion, those who Petition;<br/>
        And, all who look peaceable, try for Sedition;<br/>
        If the People were legally Meeting, in quiet,<br/>
        Would pronounce it, decidedly--<i>sec. Stat.</i>--a Riot,<br/>
        And order the Soldiers 'to aid and assist',<br/>
        That is--kill the helpless, Who cannot resist[.]<br/>
        He, though vowing 'from all worldly studies to cease',<br/>
        Breaks the Peace of the Church, to be Justice of Peace;<br/>
        Breaks his vows made to Heaven--a pander for Power;<br/>
        A Perjurer--a guide to the People no more;<br/>
        On God turns his back, when he turns the State's Agent;<br/>
        And damns his own Soul, to be friends with the ------.<br/></p>
