<p>The name 'Winzy' might suggest that the protagonist of this story is a comic character; but the Scottish word 'winze' means curse and is here used to emphasize the tragic curse of eternal life suffered by the Mortal Immortal. And by portraying Bertha as a ridiculous coquette who deserves the embarrassment she experiences, Mary Shelley insures that the reader's sympathy will be reserved for Winzy. His histrionics at the end of this first-person narrative may seem laughable, but again such action follows logically from his desire for purpose either in life or in death. As in the cases of <i>Frankenstein</i> and the less well-known tales of Valerius and Roger Dodsworth, two mortals who cheat death through their reanimation, the author uses a supernatural action as a mere device to introduce a study in character. But it is the idea of an <i>elixir vitae</i> rather than the portrayal of Winzy's loneliness which has made 'The Mortal Immortal' the most frequently anthologized of Mary Shelley's stories.
