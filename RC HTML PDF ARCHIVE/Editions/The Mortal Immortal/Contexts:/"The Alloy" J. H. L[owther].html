<h2 align="center">THE ALLOY</h2>
<p align="center">by J. H. L[owther]</p>
<p align="center">"A KISS ere we part,"<br/>
Cries the girl I adore;<br/>
"Come, come to my heart,<br/>
And embrace me once more."</p>
<p align="center">Alas! My Louise,<br/>
What pure transports can flow<br/>
From moments like these,<br/>
Which conduct us to wo?</p>
<p align="center">Felicity vain!<br/>
When reduced thus in measure,<br/>
'Tis too near to pain,<br/>
To be longer a pleasure!</p>
