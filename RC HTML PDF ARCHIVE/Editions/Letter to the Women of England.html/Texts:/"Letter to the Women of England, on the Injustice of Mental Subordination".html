<center>__________</center>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Custom, from the earliest periods of antiquity, has endeavoured to place the female mind in the subordinate ranks of intellectual sociability. WOMAN has ever been considered as a lovely and fascinating part of the creation, but her claims to mental equality have not only been questioned, by envious and interested sceptics; but, by a barbarous policy in the other sex, considerably depressed, for want of liberal and classical cultivation. I will not expatiate largely on the doctrines of certain <a href="#philosophical_sensualists">philosophical sensualists</a>, who have aided in this destructive oppression, because an <a href="#wollstonecraft">illustrious British</a></p>

<p><a href="#wollstonecraft">female</a>, (whose death has not been sufficiently lamented, but to whose genius posterity will render justice) has already written volumes in vindication of "<i>The Rights of Woman.</i>" <b><a href="#page2"> * </a></b> But I shall endeavour to prove that, under the present state of mental subordination, universal knowledge is not only benumbed and blighted, but true happiness, originating in enlightened manners, retarded in its progress. Let WOMAN once assert her proper sphere, unshackled by prejudice, and unsophisticated by vanity; and pride, (the noblest species of pride,) will establish her claims to the participation of power, both mentally and corporeally.</p>

<p>[page 3]</p>
<p>In order that this letter may be clearly understood, I shall proceed to prove my assertion in the strongest, but most undecorated language. I shall remind my enlightened country-women that they are not the mere appendages of domestic life, but the partners, the equal associates of man: and, where they excel in intellectual powers, they are no less capable of all that prejudice and custom have united in attributing, exclusively, to the thinking faculties of man. I argue thus, and my assertions are incontrovertible.</p>
<p>Supposing that destiny, or interest, or chance, or what you will, has united a man, confessedly of a weak understanding, and corporeal debility, to a woman strong in all the powers of intellect, and capable of bearing the fatigues of busy life: is it not degrading to humanity that such a woman should be the passive, the obedient slave, of such an husband? Is it not repugnant to all the laws of nature, that her feelings, actions, and opinions,</p>

<p>[page 4]</p>
<p>&#160;should be controuled, perverted, and debased, by such an help-mate? Can she look for protection to a being, whom she was formed by the all wise CREATOR, to protect? Impossible, yet, if from prudence, or from pity, if for the security of worldly interest, or worldly happiness, she presumes to take a lead in domestic arrangements, or to screen her wedded shadow from obloquy or ruin, what is she considered by the imperious sex? but an usurper of her husband's rights; a domestic tyrant; a vindictive shrew; a petticoat philosopher; and a disgrace to that race of mortals, known by the degrading appellation of the <i>defenceless sex</i>.</p>
<p>The barbarity of custom's law in this <i>enlightened</i> country, has long been exercised to the prejudice of woman: <b><a href="#page4"> * </a></b> and<br/>

<p>[page 5]</p>
<p>even the laws of <a href="#honour">honour</a> have been perverted to oppress her. If a man receive an insult, he is justified in seeking retribution. He may chastise, challenge, and even destroy his adversary. Such a proceeding in MAN is termed honourable; his character is exonerated from the stigma which calumny attached to it; and his courage rises in estimation, in proportion as it exemplifies his revenge. But were a WOMAN to attempt such an expedient, however strong her sense of injury, however invincible her fortitude, or important the preservation of character, she would be deemed a murdress. Thus, custom says, you must be free from error; you must possess an unsullied fame: yet, if a slanderer, or a libertine, even by the most unpardonable falshoods, deprive you of either reputation or repose, you have no remedy. He is received in the most fastidious societies, in the cabinets of nobles, at the toilettes of coquets and prudes, while you must bear your load of obloquy, and sink beneath the uniting</p>

<p>[page 6]</p>
<p>efforts of calumny, ridicule, and malevolence. Indeed we have scarcely seen a single instance where a professed libertine has been either shunned by women, or reprobated by men, for having acted either unfeelingly or dishonorably towards what is denominated the <i>defenceless sex</i>. Females, by this mis-judging lenity, while they give proofs of a degrading triumph, cherish for themselves that anguish, which, in their turn, they will, unpitied, experience.</p>
<p>Man is able to bear the temptations of human existence better than woman, because he is more liberally educated, and more universally acquainted with society. Yet, if he has the temerity to annihilate the bonds of moral and domestic life, he is acquitted; and his enormities are placed to the account of <i>human frailty</i>. But if WOMAN advance beyond the boundaries of decorum,</p>

<p>[page 7]</p>
<p>&#160;Such partial discriminations seem to violate all laws, divine and human! If WOMAN be the weaker creature, her frailty should be the more readily forgiven. She is exposed by her personal attractions, to more perils, and yet she is not permitted to bear that shield, which man assumes; she is not allowed the exercise of <i>courage</i> to repulse the enemies of her fame and happiness; though, if she is wounded, -- she is <i>lost for ever</i>!</p>
<p>Supposing that a WOMAN has experienced every insult, every injury, that her vain-boasting, high-bearing associate, man, can inflict: imagine her, driven from society; deserted by her kindred; scoffed at by the world; exposed to poverty; assailed by malice; and consigned to scorn: with no companion but sorrow, no prospect but disgrace; she has no remedy. She appeals to the feeling and reflecting part of mankind; they pity, but they do not seek to redress her: she<br/>

<p>[page 8]</p>
<p>flies to her own sex, they not only condemn, but they avoid her. She talks of punishing the villain who has destroyed her: he smiles at the menace, and tells her, <i>she is,</i> a WOMAN.</p>
<p>Let me ask this plain and rational question, -- is not woman a human being, gifted with all the feelings that inhabit the bosom of man? Has not woman affections, susceptibility, fortitude, and an acute sense of injuries received? Does she not shrink at the touch of persecution? Does not her bosom melt with sympathy, throb with pity, glow with resentment, ache with sensibility, and burn with indignation? Why then is she denied the exercise of the nobler feelings, an high consciousness of honour, a lively sense of what is due to dignity of character? Why may not woman resent and punish? Because the long established laws of custom, have decreed her <i>passive!</i> Because she is by nature organized to feel every wrong more</p>

<p>How many vices are there that men perpetually indulge in, to which women are rarely addicted. Drinking, in man, is reckoned a proof of good fellowship; and the <i>bon vivant</i> is considered as the best and most desirable of companions. Wine, as far as it is pleasant to the sense of tasting, is as agreeable to woman as to man; but its use to excess will render either brutal. Yet man <i>yields</i> to its influence, because he is the <i>stronger-minded</i> creature; and woman <i>resists</i> its power over the senses, because she is the <i>weaker.</i> How will the <i>superiorly</i> organized sex defend this contradiction? Man will say his passions are stronger than those of women; yet we see women rush not only to ruin, but to death, for objects they love; while men exult in an unmeaning display of caprice, intrigue, and seduction, frequently, without even a zest for the vices they</p>

<p>exhibit. The fact is simply this: the passions of men originate in sensuality; those of women, in <a href="#sentiment">sentiment</a>: man loves corporeally, woman mentally: which is the nobler creature?</p>
<p>Gaming is termed, in the modern vocabulary, a masculine vice. Has vice then a <i>sex</i>? Till the passions of the mind in man and woman are separate and distinct, till the sex of vital animation, denominated soul, be ascertained, on what pretext is woman deprived of those amusements which man is permitted to enjoy? If gaming be a vice (though every species of commerce is nearly allied to it), why not condemn it wholly? why suffer man to persevere in the practice of it; and yet in woman execrate its propensity? Man may enjoy the convivial board, indulge the caprices of his nature; he may desert his home, violate his marriage vows, scoff at the moral laws that unite society, and set even religion at defiance, by oppressing the defenceless; while woman is condemned to</p>

<p>bear the drudgery of domestic life, to vegetate in obscurity, <a href="#abhors">to <i>love</i> where she abhors</a>, to <i>honour</i> where she dispises, and to <i>obey,</i> while she shudders at subordination. Why? Let the most cunning sophist, answer me, WHY?</p>
<p>If women sometimes, indeed too frequently, exhibit a frivolous species of character, we should examine the evil in which it originates, and endeavour to find a cure. If the younger branches of some of our nobility are superficially polished, and wholly excluded from essential knowledge, while they are regularly initiated in the mysteries of a gaming table, and the mazes of intrigue, can we feel surprized at their soon discovering an aptitude to evince their hereditary follies? We know that <a href="#princes">women, like princes</a>, are strangers to the admonitions of truth; and yet we are astonished when we behold them emulous of displaying every thing puerile and unessential; and aiming perpetually at arbitrary power, without one</p>

<p>mental qualification to authorize dominion. From such women, the majority of mankind draw their opinions of sexual imbecility; and, in order that their convenient plea may be sanctioned by example, they continue to debilitate the female mind, for the sole purpose of enforcing subordination.</p>
<p>Yet, the present era has given indisputable proofs, that WOMAN is a thinking and an enlightened being! We have seen <a href="#wollstonecraft">a Wollstonecraft,</a> <a href="#macaulay">a Macaulay,</a> <a href="#sevigne">a S&#233;vign&#233;</a>; and many others, now living, who embelish the sphere of literary splendour, with genius of the first order. The aristocracy of kingdoms will say, that it is absolutely necessary to extort obedience: if all were masters, who then would stoop to serve? By the same rule, man exclaims, if we allow the softer sex to participate in the intellectual rights and privileges we enjoy, who will arrange our domestic drudgery? who will reign (as <a href="#stephano">Stephano</a> says, while we are vice-roys over them)</p>

<p>in our household establishments? who will rear our progeny; obey our commands; be our affianced vassals; the creatures of our pleasures? I answer, women, but they will not be your slaves; they will be your associates, your equals in the extensive scale of civilized society; and in the indisputable rights of nature <b><a href="#page13"> * </a></b> .</p>
<p>In the common occurrences and occupations of life, what in man is denominated high-spirit, is in WOMAN termed vindictive. If a man be insulted and inflicts a blow upon his assailant, he is called a brave and noble-minded creature! If WOMAN acts upon the same principle of resistance, she is branded as a <a href="#xantippe">Zantippe</a>, though in such a situation she would scarcely meet with a Socrates, even if,</p>

<p>in the scale of comparison, she possessed stronger corporeal, as well as mental, powers, than the object of her resentment.</p>
<p>How comes it, that in this age of reason we do not see statesmen and orators selecting women of superior mental acquirements as their associates? Men allow that women are absolutely necessary to their happiness, and that they "had been brutes" without them. But the poet did not insinuate that none but silly or ignorant women were to be allowed the <i>supreme honour</i> of unbrutifying man, of rendering his life desirable, and of <a href="#smoothing">"smoothing the rugged path of care"</a> with their endearments. The ancients were emulous of patronizing, and even of cultivating the friendship of enlightened women. But a British Demosthenes, a Pythagoras, a Leontius, a Eustathius, or a Brutus, would rather pass his hours in dalliance with an unlettered courtezan, than in the conversation of a Theano, a</p>

<p>Let me ask the rational and thinking mortal, why the graces of feminine beauty are to be constituted emblems of a debilitated mind? Does the finest symmetry of form, or the most delicate tint of circulation, exemplify a tame submission to insult or oppression? Is strength of intellect, in woman, bestowed in vain? Has the SUPREME DISPOSER OF EVENTS given to the female soul a distinguished portion of energy and feeling, that the one may remain inactive, and the other be the source of her destruction? Let the moralist think otherwise. Let the contemplative philosopher examine the proportions of human intellect; and let us hope that the <a href="#immortality">immortality of the soul</a> springs from causes that are not merely <i>sexual.</i></p>

<p><a name="return16" id="return16"> </a> Cicero says, "There was, from the beginning such a thing as Reason; a direct emanation from nature itself, which prompted to good, and averted from evil." Reason may be considered as a part of soul; for, by its powers, we are taught intuitively to hope for a future state. Cicero did not confine the attribute of Reason to sex; such doctrine would have been completely Mahometan!</p>
<p>The most celebrated painters have uniformly represented angels as of no sex. Whether this idea originates in theology, or imagination, I will not pretend to determine; but I will boldly assert that there is something peculiarly unjust in condemning woman to suffer every earthly insult, while she is allowed a sex; and only permitting her to be happy, when she is divested of it. There is also something profane in the opinion, because it implies that an all-wise Creator sends a creature into the world, with a sexual distinction,</p>

If men would be completely happy by obtaining the confidence of women, let them unite in confessing that mental equality, which evinces itself by indubitable proofs that the soul has no sex. If, then, the cause of action be the same, the effects cannot be dissimilar.</p>
<p>In what is woman inferior to man? In some instances, but not always, in <a href="#corporeal">corporeal strength</a>: in activity of mind, she is his equal. Then, by this rule, if she is to endure oppression in proportion as she is deficient in muscular power, <i>only,</i> through all the stages of animation the weaker should give precedence to the stronger. Yet we should find a Lord of the Creation with a puny frame, reluctant to confess the superiority of a lusty peasant girl, whom nature had endowed with that bodily strength of which luxury had bereaved him.</p>

<p>The question is simply this: Is woman persecuted and oppressed because she is the <i>weaker</i> creature? Supposing that to be the order of Nature; let me ask these human despots, whether a woman, of strong mental and corporeal powers, is born to yield obedience, merely because <i>she is a woman,</i> to those shadows of mankind who exhibit the <a href="#effeminacy">effeminacy</a> of women, united with the mischievous foolery of monkies?

<p>If woman be the <i>weaker</i> creature, why is she employed in laborious avocations? why compelled to endure the fatigue of household drudgery; to scrub, to scower, to labour, both late and early, while the powdered lacquey only waits at the chair, or behind the carriage of his employer? Why are women, in many parts of the kingdom, permitted to follow the plough; to perform the laborious business of the</p>

I have seen, and every inhabitant of the metropolis may, during the summer season, behold strong Welsh girls carrying on their heads strawberries, and other fruits from the vicinity of London to Covent-Garden market, in heavy loads which they repeat three, four, and five times, daily, for a very small pittance; while the <i>male</i> domesticks of our nobility are revelling in luxury, to which even their lords are strangers. Are women thus compelled to labour, because they are of the WEAKER SEX?</p>

<p>Man is said to possess more personal courage than woman. How comes it, then, that he boldly dares insult the <i>helpless</i> sex, whenever he finds an object unprotected? I here beg leave to present a true story, which is related by a polished and impartial traveller.---</p>
<p>"A <a href="#foreign_lady">foreign lady</a> of great distinction, of a family to whom I had the honour to be well known, was appointed to be married to a young gentleman of equal rank: the settlements were all made, the families agreed, and the day was come for the union. The morning of the same day, the ceremony of the marriage being fixed for the same evening, the lover being young,</p>

<p>thoughtless, and lost with passion, when alone with the bride, insinuated, in the softest and most endearing terms, that he was her husband in every sense but a few trifling words, which were to pass that night from the mouth of the priest; and, that if she loved him, as he presumed she did, she certainly would not keep him one moment in anxiety; much less ten or twelve hours, which must be the case, if she waited for the ceremony of the church. The lady, astonished at what she had heard, discovered in her looks not only the warmest resentment, but resolved in her heart to be amply revenged; and having had an excellent education, was well acquainted with the world, and no stranger to the artifices of designing men in affairs of love; after recovering a little her surprise, determined to keep her temper, and promised with a smile, obedience to her lover's will, and begged him to name the place proper for such a design; which, being mutually agreed on for four in the afternoon, the indiscreet lover, ravished at</p>

<p>his expectation, met, agreeable to appointment, the lady, in a garden leading to the house, where they proposed the interview. When walking together, with all seeming tenderness on both sides, the lady, on a sudden, started from her lover, and threw him a pistol, holding another in her right hand, and spoke to him to this effect: 'Remember for what infamous purpose you invited me here: you shall never be a husband of mine; and such vengeance do I seek for the offence, that, on my very soul, I vow, you or I shall die this hour. Take instantly up the pistol, I'll give you leave to defend yourself; though you have no right to deserve it. In this, you see, <i>I</i> have honour; though <i>you</i> have none.'</p>
<p>"The lover, amazed at this unforeseen change, took up the pistol, in obedience to her commands; directing it towards the earth, threw himself at her feet, and was going to say a thousand things in favour of his passion; the lady gave attention a few</p>

<p>minutes, pointing the pistol to his breast; while the lover, with a voice confused, and every other appearance of despair, begged her pity and her pardon; declared his love for her was such, that he was deprived of all power of reflection; that he had no views of offending; that all he said was for want of thought, that his reason was absent, and that her beauty was the cause of all.---'Beauty!' says the lady, interrupting him, 'Thou art a villain! I'll hear no more, for one of us must die this moment. '---The lover perceiving her violent anger, and finding that all his soft phrases had no effect on her, in his distraction raised the pistol then in his hand a little higher; thinking, by its appearance in that situation, to affect his admired lady with some terror, while he continued to pursue his defence; but alas! no sooner did the angry fair perceive the pistol of her lover raised breast high, but, that instant being the crisis of her resentment, she fired upon him, and shot him through the heart. He fell; and in falling, being</p>

<p>deprived of both speech and reason, his pistol went off, and the consequence was, her collar bone was broke, and much blood followed. She clapped her handkerchief to the wound, ran to her coach, which was waiting at the garden door, ordered her servant to take care of the dead body, and directed some others to conduct her with the utmost expedition to her father's house; to whom she related the whole affair. Proper assistance was instantly sent for; and I being that day at table with the physician of the Court, who was also of this family, went with him; saw the wound, and was well instructed in the particulars of this adventure. The lady was never so much as called to a trial for the death of her lover; because all the circumstances proved the truth of what she had related: her promising to marry him that night, was so powerful an argument of her love for the deceased, that no other motive could have produced so dreadful an event. The lady was cured of her wound, threw herself into a con-</p>

<p>This short story will prove that the mind of WOMAN, when she feels a correct sense of honour, even though it is blended with the very excess of sensibility, can rise to the most intrepid defence of it. Yet had such a circumstance taken place in Britain, the perpetrator of this heroic act of indignant and insulted virtue, would probably have suffered an ignominious death, or been shut up during the remainder of her days as a confirmed <i>maniac</i> <b> &gt;<a href="#page25">*</a> </b>; for HERE woman is placed in</p>

<p>It has lately been the fashion of the time, to laugh at the encreasing consequence of women, in the great scale of human intellect. Why? Because, by their superior lustre, the overweening and ostentatious splendour of some men, is placed in a more obscure point of view.

<p>"<a href="#ackland">Lady Harriet Ackland</a> had accompanied her husband to Canada, in the beginning of the year 1776. In the course of the campaign, she traversed a vast space of country, in different extremities of season, and with difficulties that an European</p>

<p>traveller will not easily conceive, to attend in a poor hut at Chamblee upon his sick bed.</p>
<p>"In the opening of the campaign of 1777, she was restrained from offering herself to a share of the fatigue and hazard expected before Ticonderago, by the positive injunctions of her husband. The day after the conquest of that place, he was badly wounded, and she crossed the Lake Champlain to join him.</p>
<p>"As soon as he recovered, Lady Harriet proceeded to follow his fortunes through the campaign; and at Fort Edward, or at the next camp, she acquired a two-wheeled <a href="#tumbrel">tumbrel</a>, which had been constructed by the artificers of artillery, something similar to the carriage used for the mail in the great roads of England. Major Ackland commanded the British grenadiers which were attached to Frazer's corps; and consequently were always the most advanced post of the army; their si-</p>

<p>tuations were often so alert, that no person slept out of their clothes.</p>
<p>"In one of these situations, a tent, in which the Major and Lady Harriet were asleep, suddenly took fire. An orderly serjeant of grenadiers, with great hazard of suffocation, dragged out the first person he caught hold of; it proved the Major. It happened in the same instant, that Lady Harriet had, unknowing what she did, and perhaps not perfectly awake, providentially made her escape, by creeping under the walls of the back part of the tent. The first object she saw, on the recovery of her senses, was the Major, on the other side; and, in the same instant, again in the fire, in search of her. The serjeant again saved him; but not without the Major being very severely burned in the face, and different parts of the body: every thing they had with them in the tent was consumed.</p>
<center><img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/robinson/dbltgrn.gif" height="6" width="400" align="bottom"/></center>
<p>[page 48]</p>
<p>"This accident happened a little before the army passed Hudson's river. It neither altered the RESOLUTION nor the chearfulness of Lady Harriet; and she continued her progress, a partaker of the fatigues of the advanced corps.</p>
<p>"The next call upon her FORTITUDE was of a different nature; and more distressing, as of longer suspense. On the march of the 19th of September, the grenadiers being liable to action every step, she had been directed by the Major to follow the route of the artillery and baggage, which was not exposed. At the time the action began, she found herself near a small uninhabited hut, where she alighted.</p>
<p>"When it was found that the action was becoming general and bloody, the surgeons of the hospital took possession of the same place, as the most convenient for the care of the wounded. Thus was this lady, in hearing of one continued fire</p>
<center><img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/imported/editions/robinson/dbltgrn.gif" height="6" width="400" align="bottom"/></center>
<p>[page 49]</p>
<p>of cannon and musketry for four hours together, with the presumption, from the post of her husband at the head of the grenadiers, that he was in the most exposed part of the action. She had three FEMALE companions; the Baroness of Reidefel, and the wives of two British officers, Major Harnage, and Lieutenant Reynell: but in the event, their presence served but little for comfort. Major Harnage was soon brought to the surgeons, very badly wounded; and a little after came intelligence, that Lieutenant Reynell was shot, dead. Imagination will want no help to figure the state of the whole group.</p>
<p>"From the date of that action, to the 7th of October, Lady Harriet, with her usual serenity, stood prepared for new trials! And it was her lot, that their severity increased with their numbers. She was again exposed to the hearing of the whole action; and at last received the shock of her individual misfortune, mixed</p>

<p>with the intelligence of the general calamity, that the troops were defeated, and that Major Ackland, desperately wounded, was a prisoner.</p>
<p>"The day of the 8th was passed by Lady Harriet and her companions in inexpressible anxiety: not a tent, not a shed was standing, except what belonged to the hospital: their refuge was among the wounded and the dying. The night of the 8th the army retreated; and at day-break on the 9th, reached very advantageous ground. A halt was necessary to refresh the troops, and to give time to the batteaux loaded with provisions, to come a-breast.</p>
<p>"When the army was upon the point of moving after the halt, I received a message from Lady Harriet, submitting to my decision a proposal of passing to the camp of the enemy, and requesting General Gates' permission to <i>attend her husband</i>! Lady Harriet expressed an earnest solici-</p>

<p>tude to execute her intentions, if not interfering with my designs.</p>
<p>"Though I was ready to believe, for I had experienced, <i>that patience and fortitude, in a supreme degree, were to be found, as well as every other virtue</i>, under the most tender forms, I was astonished at the proposal, after so long an agitation of spirits; exhausted not only for want of rest, but absolutely for want of food; drenched by rains for twelve hours together; that a woman should be capable of such an undertaking as delivering herself to the enemy, probably in the night, and uncertain of what hands she might fall into, appeared an effort, <i>above human nature</i>!</p>
<p>"The assistance I was enabled to give, was small indeed. I had not even a cup of wine to offer her; but I was told she had found, from some kind and fortunate hand, a little rum and dirty water. All I could furnish to her was an open boat, and a few lines, written upon dirty and wet</p>

But her distresses were not yet at an end.</p>
<p>&amp;quotThe night was advanced before the boat reached the enemy's outposts; and the centinel would not let it pass, nor even come on shore. In vain Mr. Brudenell offered the flag of truce; and represented the state of the extraordinary passenger. The guard, apprehensive of treachery, and punctilious to his orders, threatened to fire into the boat, if she stirred before day-light. Her anxiety and suffering were thus protracted through</p>

<p>This question does not admit of argument; it is self-evident.

The tyranny of man; who saw the necessity of subjugating a being, whose natural gifts were equal, if not superior to his own.

There are but three classes of women desirable associates in the eyes of men: handsome women; licentious women; and good sort of women. --- The first for his vanity; the second for his amusement; and the last for the arrangement of his domestic drudgery.

<p>Not many centuries past, the use of books was wholly unknown to the commonality of females; and scarcely any but superior nuns, then denominated <i>"learned women"</i> could either read or write. Wives were then considered as household idols, created for the labour of domestic life, and born to yield obedience. To brew, to bake, and to spin, were then deemed indispensably necessary qualifications: but to think, to acquire knowledge, or to interfere either in theological or political opinions, would have been the very climax of presumption! Hence arose the evils of bigotry and religious imposition. The reign of credulity, respecting supernatural warnings and appearances, was then in its full vigour. The idle tales of ghosts and goblins, and the no less degrading and inhuman persecutions of age and infirmity, under the idea of <a href="#witchcraft">witchcraft</a>, were not only countenanced, but daily put in prac-<br/>

We do not read in history of any act of cruelty practiced towards a <i>male bewitcher</i>; though we have authentic records to prove, that many a weak and defenceless woman has been tortured, and even murdered by a people professing Christianity, merely because a pampered priest, or a superstitious idiot, sanctioned such oppression. The <i>witcheries</i> of mankind will ever be tolerated, though the frenzy of fanaticism and the blindness of bigotry sink into oblivion.</p>

Men soon found by experience, that society was embellished, conversation enlivened, and emulation excited, by an intercourse of ideas. The younger branches of male nobility in France, were given to the care of female preceptors; and the rising generations of women, by habit, were considered as the rational associates of man. Both reason and society benefited by the change; for though the monasteries had less living victims, though monks had fewer proselytes, the republic of letters had more ornaments of genius and imagination.</p>

They are familiarized to the limpid element at so early a period that a child of four years old, dropped into the sea, not only betrays no symptoms of fear, but seems to enjoy its situation. The women consider swimming as one of their favourite diversions; in which they amuse themselves when the impetuosity of the dreadful surf that breaks upon their coast, is encreased to its utmost fury, in a manner equally perilous and extraordinary. And yet these courageous females are denominated of the <i>weaker</i> sex.</p>

<p>I agree that, according to the long established rule of custom, domestic occupations, such as household management, the education of children, the exercise of rational affection, should devolve on woman. But let the partner of her cares consider her zeal as the effect of reason, temporizing sensibility, and prompting the exertions of mutual interest; not as the constrained obsequiousness of inferior organization. Let man confess that a wife, (I do not mean an <i>idiot</i>), is a thinking and a discriminating helpmate; not a bondswoman, whom custom subjects to his power, and subdues to his convenience. A wife is bound, by the laws of nature and religion, to participate in all the various vicissitudes of fortune, which her husband may, through life, be compelled to experience. She is to combat all the storms of an adverse destiny; to share the <a href="#sorrows">sorrows of adversity, imprisonment, sick-</a></p>

She is obliged to labour for their mutual support, to watch in the chamber of contagious disease; to endure patiently, the peevish inquietude of a weary spirit; to bear, with tacit resignation, reproach, neglect, and scorn; or, by resisting, to be stigmatized as a violator of domestic peace, an enemy to decorum, an <i>undutiful</i> wife, and an unworthy member of society. Hapless woman! Why is she condemned to bear this load of persecution, this Herculean mental toil, this labour of Syssiphus; this more than Ixion's sufferings, as fabled by heathen mythologists?

<p>idol. Yet from the conduct of some learned modern philosophers, (in every thing but love), the spirit of cynical observation might trace something like jealousy and envy, or a dread of rivalry in mental acquirements. We have seen living husbands, as well as lovers, who will agree with the author of some whimsical stanzas, printed in the year 1739, of which I remember the following lines,</p>
<p>"Now all philosophers agree,<br/>
That WOMEN should not LEARNED be <b><a href="#page68"> * </a></b>:<br/>

Women are of a tyrant kind;<br/>

Their equal strength, would soon rebel;<br/>
They would usurp and ne'er submit,<br/>

<p>Constrained obedience is the poison of domestic joy: hence we may date the disgust and hatred which too frequently embitter the scenes of wedded life. And I should not be surprized, if the present system of mental subordination continues to gain strength, if, in a few years, European husbands were to imitate those beyond the Ganges. There, wives are to be purchased like slaves, and every man has as many as he pleases. The husbands and even fathers are so far from being jealous, that they frequently offer their wives and daughters to foreigners <b><a href="#page69"> * </a></b>.</p>

<p>However contradictory it may seem, to contracted minds, I firmly believe that the strongest spell which can be placed upon the human affections, is a consciousness of freedom. Let the husband assume the complacency of the friend, and he will, if his wife be not naturally depraved, possess not only her faith but her affection. There is a resisting nerve in the heart of both man and woman, which repels compulsion. Constraint and attachment, are incompatible: the mind of woman is not more softened by sensibility than sustained by pride; and every violation of moral propriety, every instance of domestic infidelity, every divorce which puts asunder 'those whom God has joined,' is a proof of that maxim being a false, I may say a ludicrous one, which declares that <a href="#command">MAN was born to <i>command</i>, and WOMAN to <i>obey!</i></a> excepting in proportion as the</p>

<p>intellectual power devolves on the husband.</p>
<p>If a woman receives an insult, she has no tribunal of <i>honour</i> to which she can appeal; and by which she would be sanctioned in punishing her enemy. What in man, is laudable; in woman is deemed reprehensible, if not preposterous <a href="#page71"> * </a>. What in man is noble daring, in woman is considered as the most vindictive persecution. Supposing a woman is calumniated, robbed at a gaming table, falsely accused of mean or dishonourable actions, if she appeals to a stranger; "it is no business of his! such things happen every day! the world has nothing to do with the quarrels</p>

<p>of individuals!" If she involves a dear friend, or a relation in her defence; she is "a dangerous person; a promoter of mischief; a revengeful fury." She has therefore no remedy but that of exposing the infamy of her enemy; (for sexual prejudices will not allow her to fight him <i>honourably</i>), even then, all that she asserts, however disgraceful to her opponent, is placed to the account of womanish revenge. The dastardly offender triumphs with impunity, because he is the noble creature man, and she a <i>defenceless</i>, persecuted woman.</p>
<p>Prejudice (or policy) has endeavoured, and indeed too successfully, to cast an odium on what is called a <a href="#masculine"><i>masculine</i> woman</a>; or, to explain the meaning of the word, a woman of enlightened understanding.

I again recur to the prominent subject of my letter, viz. that woman is denied the first privilege of nature,&#160; <!--SELECTION--><a href="#self-defence">the power of SELF-DEFENCE</a>.<!--/SELECTION--> There are lords of the creation, who would not hesitate to rob a credulous woman of fortune, happiness, and reputation, yet they would deem themselves justified in punishing a petty thief, who took from them a watch or a pocket handkerchief. <i>Man</i> is not to be deprived of <i>his</i> property; <i>he</i> is not to be pilfered of the most trifling article, which custom has told him is necessary to <i>his</i> ideas of luxury. But WOMAN is to be robbed of that peace of mind which depended on the purity of her character; <i>she</i> is to be duped out of all the proud consolations of independence; defrauded</p>

<p>If a man is stopped on the highway, he may shoot the depredator: and he will receive the thanks of society. If a WOMAN were to act upon the same principle, respecting the more atrocious robber who has deprived her of all that rendered life desirable, she would be punished as a <i>murderer</i>. Because the highwayman only takes that which the traveller can afford to lose, and the loss of which he will scarcely feel; and the WOMAN is rendered a complete bankrupt of all that rendered life supportable. The swindler and the cheat are shut out from society; but the avowed libertine, the very worst of defrauders, is tolerated and countenanced by our most fastidious British females.

<p>tious: <i>men</i> will be profligate, as long as <i>women</i> uphold them in the practice of seduction.</p>
<p>If, in the common affairs of life, a man be guilty of perjury, on conviction he is sentenced to undergo the penalty of his crime, even though the motive for committing it, were unimportant to the community at large, and only acting against the plea of individual interest. But if a man takes an oath, knowing and premeditatedly resolved to break it, at the altar of the Divinity, his crime is tolerated, and he pleads the force of example, in extenuation of his apostacy. Man swears to love and to cherish his wife, never to forsake her in sickness, or in health, in poverty or wealth, and to keep to her <i>alone</i> so long as they both shall live. Let me ask these law makers, and these law <i>breakers</i>, these sacriligious oath takers, whether nine out of ten, are not conscious of committing perjury at the moment when they make a vow so universally broken?</p>

<p>But man is permitted to <i>forswear</i> himself, even at the altar dedicated to the SUPREME BEING! He is allowed, even <i>there</i>, to consider the <i>most</i> sacred of ceremonies as merely a political institution, of which he may exclusively avail himself as far as it tends to the promotion of his interest, while neither the publicity, nor the number of his infidelities, attach the badge of worldly censure to his conduct. He is still the lordly reveller; the master of his pleasures; the tolerated breaker of his oath: he pleads the frailty of human nature, though he, as the stronger creature, is supposed to possess an omnipotent source of mental power; he urges the sovereignty of the passions, the dominion of the senses, the sanction of long established custom. He is a man of universal gallantry; he is consequently courted and idolized by the generality of women, though all his days and all his actions prove, that woman is the victim of his falsehood.</p>

<p>Now examine the destiny of the <i>weaker</i> sex, under similar circumstances. WOMAN is to endure <a href="#neglect">neglect, infidelity, and scorn</a>: she is to endure them patiently. She is not allowed to plead the frailty of human nature; she is to have no passions, no affections; and if she chance to overstep the boundaries of chastity, (whatever witcheries and machinations are employed to mislead her;) if she violates that oath, which, perhaps the pride of her kindred, family interest, ambition, or compulsion, extorted from her, CUSTOM, that pliant and convenient friend to man, declares her infamous. While women, who are accessaries to her disgrace, by countenancing her husband's infidelities, condemn the wife with all the vehemence of indignation; because woman is the weaker creature, and most subjected to temptation! because man errs voluntarily; and woman is seduced, by art and by persecution, from the paths of Virtue.</p>

<p>There is scarcely an event in human existence, in which the oppression of woman is not tolerated. The laws are made by man; and self-preservation is, <i>by them</i>, deemed the primary law of nature. Hence, woman is destined to be the passive creature; she is to yield obedience, and to depend for support upon a being who is perpetually authorised to deceive her. If a woman be married, her property becomes her husband's; and yet she is amenable to the laws, if she contracts debts beyond what that husband and those laws pronounce the necessaries of existence. If the comforts, or even the conveniences of woman's life rest on the mercy of her ruler, they will be limited indeed. We have seen innumerable instances, in cases of divorce, where the weaker, the defenceless partner is allotted a scanty pittance, upon which she is expected to live <i>honourably</i>; while the husband, the lord of the creation, in the very plenitude of wealth, in the very zenith of</p>

<p>splendour, is permitted openly to indulge in every <i>dishonourable</i> propensity. Yet, he is commiserated as the injured party; and she is branded with the name of infamous: though he is deemed the <i>stronger</i>, and she the <i>weaker</i> creature.</p>
<p>Frailty, through all the stages of social intercourse, appears to be most enormous in those who are supposed to have least fortitude to sustain the powers of self-resistance. Yet, such is the force of prejudice, the law of custom, against woman, that she is expected to <i>act</i> like a philosopher, though she is not allowed to <i>think</i> like one. If she pleads the weakness of her sex, her plea is not admitted; if she professes an equal portion of mental strength with man, she is condemned for arrogance. Yet, if a General be sent into the field of battle with a force inferior to that of the enemy, and is vanquished, the plea of inequality in resisting powers is admitted, and <i>his</i> honour is exonerated from every imputation: WOMAN encounters an all-</p>

Yet, the framers of those laws are indefatigable in promoting their violation. Man says to woman, without chastity you are declared infamous; and at the same moment, by a subtle and gradual process, he undermines the purity of her heart, by a bold defiance of all that tends to the support of religion and morality. Man thus commits a kind of mental suicide; while he levels that image to the lowest debasement, which he has ostentatiously set up for universal idolatry.</p>
<p>It is not by precept, but by example, that conviction strikes deeply into the thinking mind. Man is supposed to be the more wise and more rational creature; his faculties are more liberally expanded</p>

<p>by classical education: he is supposed to be more enlightened by an unlimited intercourse with society. He is permitted to assert the dignity of his character; to punish those who assail his reputation; and to assume a superiority over all his fellow creatures. He is not accountable to any mortal for the actions of his life; he may revel in the follies, indulge the vices of his <i>superior</i> nature. He pursues the pleasures or the eccentricities of his imagination, with an avidity insatiable: and he perpetually <i>proves</i> that human passions subjugate <i>him</i> to the degradations of human frailty; while woman, the <i>weaker</i> animal, she whose enjoyments are limited, whose education, knowledge, and actions are circumscribed by the potent rule of prejudice, she is expected to <i>resist</i> temptation; to be invincible in fortitude; strong in prescient and reflecting powers; subtle in the defence of her own honour; and forbearing under all the conflicts of the passions. Man first degrades, and then deserts her. Yet, if driven by fa-</p>

<p>mine, insult, shame, and persecution, she rushes forth like the wolf for prey; if, like Milwood, she finds it "necessary to be rich" in this sordid, selfish world, she is shunned, abhorred, condemned to the very lowest scenes of vile debasement; to exist in misery, or to perish unlamented. No kindred breast will pity her misfortunes; no pious tear embalm her ashes: she rushes into the arms of death, as her last, her only asylum from the monsters who have destroyed her.</p>
<p>Woman is destined to pursue no path in which she does not find an enemy. If she is liberal, generous, careless of wealth, friendly to the unfortunate, and bountiful to persecuted merit, she is deemed prodigal, and over-much profuse; all the good she does, every tear she steals from the downcast eye of modest worth, every sigh she converts into a throb of joy, in grateful bosoms, is, by the world, forgotten; while the ingenuous liberality of her soul excites the imputation of folly and ex-</p>

<p>travagance. If, on the contrary, she is wary, shrewd, thrifty, economical, and eager to procure and to preserve the advantages of independence; she is condemned as narrow-minded, mean, unfeeling, artful, mercenary, and base: in either case she is exposed to censure. If liberal, unpitied; if sordid, execrated! In a few words, a generous woman is termed a <i>fool</i>; a prudent one, a <i>prodigal</i>.</p>
<p>If WOMAN is not permitted to assert a majesty of mind, why fatigue her faculties with the labours of any species of education? why give her books, if she is not to profit by the wisdom they inculcate? The parent, or the preceptress, who enlightened her understanding, like the dark lantern, to spread its rays internally only, puts into her grasp a weapon of defence against the perils of existence; and at the same moment commands her not to use it. Man says you <i>may</i> read, and you <i>will</i> think, but you shall not evince your knowledge, or employ your thoughts,</p>

<p>Let him not hope for a luxurious mental harvest, where the sun of cultivation is obscured by impenetrable prejudice; that cloud which has too long spread over the mind of woman a desolating darkness. So situated, woman is taught to discriminate just sufficiently to know her own unhappiness. She, like Tantalus, is placed in a situation where the intellectual blessing she sighs for is within her view; but she is not permitted to attain it: she is conscious of possessing equally strong mental powers; but she is obliged to yield, as the weaker creature. Man says, "you shall be initiated in all the arts of pleasing; but</p>

Sensual Egotists! woman is absolutely necessary to your felicity; nay, even to your existence: yet she must not arrogate to herself the power to interest your actions. You idolize her personal attractions, as long as they influence your senses; when they begin to pall, the magick is dissolved; and prejudice is ever eager to condemn what passion has degraded.</p>

The best novels that have been written, since those of <a href="#smollet">Smollet, Richardson, and Fielding</a>, have been produced by women: and their pages have not only been embellished with the interesting events of domestic life, portrayed with all the elegance of phraseology, and all the refinement of sentiment, but with forcible and eloquent, political, theological, and philosophical reasoning. To the genius and labours of some enlightened British women posterity will also be indebted for the purest and best translations from the French and German languages.

<p>P.S. Should this Letter be the means of influencing the minds of those to whom it is addressed, so far as to benefit the rising generation, my end and aim will be accomplished. I am well assured, that it will meet with little serious attention from the MALE disciples of MODERN PHILOSOPHY. The critics, though they have liberally patronized the works of British women, will perhaps condemn that doctrine which inculcates mental equality; lest, by the intellectual labours of the sex, they should claim an equal portion of power in the TRIBUNAL of BRITISH LITERATURE. By the profound scholar, and the unprejudiced critic, this Letter will be read with candour; while, I trust, <i>its purpose</i> will be deemed beneficial to society.</p>

The Clan Rose inhabited Kilravock Castle in Nairnshire, Scotland, from the fifteenth century when it was built to the present day (when once again, and for only the second time, the Clan Chief is a woman). Rose married her cousin Hugh Rose (1746-1780) in June 1779 but retained her status as Clan Chief until she died. A son, also named Hugh Rose, was born February 8, 1780, and became the 20th Clan Chief. In her personal copy of Robinson's <i>Letter</i>, Elizabeth Rose made significant additions to Robinson's <a href="/editions/robinson/mrletterlistfrst.htm">List of British Female Literary Characters</a> at the end of this Letter, indicated in coral-colored text in this hypertext edition.

Both plays are particularly notable for their rebellious and outspoken (and ultimately defeated) female protagonists: see <a href="#ruin_ensues">note on <i>Jane Shore.</i></a> Calista's speech reads:</p>
<blockquote>"How hard is the condition of our sex,<br/>
Thro' ev'ry state of life the slaves of man!<br/>
In all the dear delightful days of youth<br/>
A rigid father dictates to our wills,<br/>
And deals out pleasure with a scanty hand.<br/>
To his, the tyrant husband's reign succeeds;<br/>
Proud with opinion of superior reason,<br/>
He holds domestick bus'ness and devotion<br/>
All we are capable to know, and shuts us,<br/>
Like cloyster'd ideots, from the world's acquaintance,<br/>
And all the joys of freedom. Wherefore are we<br/>
Born with high souls, but to assert our selves,<br/>
Shake off this vile obedience they exact,<br/>
And claim an equal empire o'er the world?" (<i>The Fair Penitent</i> (1791 edition) III.i.40-53)</blockquote>

<p><a name="philosophical_sensualists" id="philosophical_sensualists"> </a><b>philosophical sensualists:</b> Probably a reference to Jean Jacques Rousseau, who argued in <i>Emile</i> and other influential works that women and men were essentially different, and specifically that women were intellectually inferior to men. As Robinson notes in this sentence, Rousseau was one of Wollstonecraft&#8217;s chief targets in <i>Rights of Woman</i>, where she consistently characterized him as a philosopher led more by "his voluptuous reveries" than his reason (133). Catharine Macaulay similarly described Rousseau, "[a]mong the most strenuous asserters of a sexual difference in character" (205), as a sensualist and "licentious pedant": "it is not reason, it is not wit; it is pride and sensuality that speak in Rousseau, and, in this instance, has lowered the man of genius to the licentious pedant" (<i>Letters on Education</i>, Part I, Letter XXII ("No characteristic Difference in Sex"), 206).</p>

<p>&#160;<a name="wollstonecraft" id="wollstonecraft"> </a><b>illustrious British female,:</b> Probably the best-known and most influential feminist of the eighteenth century, Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-1797) was a contemporary of Robinson&#8217;s. The two women were acquainted through Wollstonecraft's husband, William Godwin. Wollstonecraft&#8217;s <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i> (1792), a feminist manifesto arguing in favor of equality between the sexes and women&#8217;s cultivation of reason through education, deeply influenced Robinson (<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/wollstonecraft/">link to <i>Vindication</i></a>). Robinson obviously intends her <i>Letter</i> to speak to the same issues as Wollstonecraft's <i>Vindications</i>, though from a different angle. Robinson may have also intended this publication to help vindicate her friend's reputation and ideas when, after her death in 1797, Wollstonecraft's reputation declined due to the publication of <i>Memoirs</i> (written by Godwin) which provided the "scandalous" details of her affair with Gilbert Imlay and her suicide attempts.</p>

<p><a name="honour" id="honour"> </a><b>honour:</b> Eighteenth-century notions of honor were very much linked to one&#8217;s reputation and rank. It is interesting that Dr. Johnson defines honor as both "high rank" and "publick mark of respect." As it related to women, the notion of honor specifically referred to chastity.</p>

<p><a name="ruin_ensues" id="ruin_ensues"> </a><b>"Ruin ensues":</b> Spoken by Jane Shore in Nicholas Rowe&#8217;s <i>The Tragedy of Jane Shore</i>, published in London in 1714; Robinson played Alicia, the royal mistress gone mad who betrays the heroine (herself a mistress of royalty), in <i>The Tragedy of</i> <i>Jane Shore</i> on 27 January 1783 at Covent Garden, and again in Edinburgh in 1787. Beyond its theme of a strong and outspoken woman seduced and victimized by powerful men, this play holds particular significance for Robinson because it was her recitation from it that first drew the actor Thomas Hull&#8217;s attention to her as a potential actress, when she was 15. Sarah Siddons and Mary Ann Yates, two of the most highly regarded tragic actresses of the eighteenth century, were renowned for their portrayal of Jane Shore, who was a historical figure seduced by King Edward IV, and carried off as his mistress; she then became Hastings&#8217; mistress, and was a pawn in the power struggles of Richard, Duke of Gloucester (Richard III), which after a series of betrayals resulted in her death: see <a href="#wherefore">note to <i>Rowe&#8217;s The Fair Penitent</i>.</a> Jane Shore&#8217;s speech in full reads:</p>
<p>"Mark by what partial Justice we are judg'd;<br/>
Such is the Fate unhappy Women find,<br/>
And such the Curse intail'd upon our kind,<br/>
That Man, the lawless Libertine may rove,<br/>
Free and unquestion'd through the Wilds of Love;<br/>
While Woman, Sense and Nature's easy Fool,<br/>
If poor weak Woman swerve from Virtue's Rule,<br/>
If strongly charm'd, she leave the thorny way,<br/>
And in the softer Paths of Pleasure stray;<br/>
Ruin ensues, Reproach and endless Shame,<br/>
And one false Step entirely damns her Fame.<br/>
In vain with Tears the Loss she may deplore,<br/>
In vain look back to what she was before,<br/>
She sets, like Stars that fall, to rise no more." (I.ii).</p>

<p><a name="abhors" id="abhors"> </a><b>to <i>love</i>, where she <i>abhors</i>:</b> This condemnation of the sexual inequalities of marriage laws echoes Maria's letter to the judge in Wollstonecraft's <i><a href="http://www.hti.umich.edu/bin/pd-idx?type=header&amp;id=WollMMaria">The Wrongs of Woman, or Maria. A Fragment</a></i> (1798). Maria, who has suffered cruelly at the hands of her husband, complains about the "dogs of law" and pleads for a divorce:</p>
<p>"'Married when scarcely able to distinguish the nature of the engagement, I yet submitted to the rigid laws which enslave women, and obeyed the man whom I could no longer love. . .I exclaim against the laws which throw the whole weight of the yoke on the weaker shoulders, and force women, when they claim protectorship as mothers, to sign a contract, which renders them dependent on the caprice of a tyrant, whom choice or necessity has appointed to reign over them" (194, 195).</p>
<p><a name="princes" id="princes"> </a><b>women, like princes:</b> Robinson's complaint here is similar to Wollstonecraft's comparison of women, soldiers, and aristocratic men in <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i>: all possess a superficial education that neglects the cultivation of their Reason:</p>
<p>"As a proof that education gives this appearience of weakness to females, we may instance the example of military men, who are, like them, sent into the world before their minds have been stored with knowledge or fortified by principles. . .soldiers, as well as women, practise the minor virtues with punctilious politeness. Where is the the sexual difference, when the education has been the same? All the difference that I can discern, arises from the superior advantage of liiberty, which enables the former to see more of life" (131).<br/>
"In short, women, in general, as well as the rich of both sexes, have acquired all the follies and vices of civilization, and missed the useful fruit" (177).</p>

<p><b>Catherine Macaulay</b> (1731-1791) was a notable eighteenth-century historian whose most famous work was her eight-volume <i>History of England from the Accession of James I</i>, published between 1763 and 1783. Thomas Gray called it "the most sensible, unaffected and best history of England that we have had yet" (DNB). Macaulay was also an early critic of Burke&#8217;s <i>Reflections</i> with her <i>Observations on the Reflections</i>. Unfortunately, her marriage at age 47 to a man 26 years her junior caused a scandal which resulted in much public criticism and the loss of many close friends. Macaulay&#8217;s <i>Letters on Education</i> (1790) deeply influenced Wollstonecraft, who described her as "the woman of the greatest abilities, undoubtedly, that this country has ever produced " in <i>A Vindication on the Rights of Woman</i> (231).</p>

<p>page 14</p>
<p><a name="smoothing" id="smoothing"> </a><b>"smoothing the rugged path of care":</b> The exact source of this quote is unknown, although Robinson may be adapting the lines "Lest Philomel will daign a Song/ In her sweetest, saddest plight,/ Smoothing the rugged brow of night" from Milton&#8217;s <i>Il Penseroso</i> (56-58). This may also be an adaptation of lines from James Beattie&#8217;s poem "The Minstrel" (1776), in which the poet praises pastoral bards: "Your voice each rugged path of life can smooth;/ For well I know, where-ever ye reside,/ There harmony, and peace, and innocence abide" (Book I, 376-78).</p>

<p><a name="mental" id="mental"> </a><b>mental aristocracy:</b> This concept of an "Aristocracy of Genius," as she calls it in her <i>Monody on the Death of the Late Queen of France,</i> is found throughout Robinson&#8217;s works. In the preface to <i>Sappho and Phaon</i>, Robinson writes at length on how women should "ennoble themselves by the unperishable lustre of MENTAL PRE-EMINENCE!"</p>
<p><a name="immortality" id="immortality"> </a><b>immortality of the soul:</b> Women's spiritual equality to men remained a touchstone of feminism in the eighteenth century and earlier, found in Mary Astell's <i>A Serious Proposal to the Ladies</i>, Priscilla Wakefield's <i>Reflections on the Present Condition of the Female Sex</i> (1798), and Wollstonecraft's <i>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i> (pages 112, 131, 154-5, 176): see <a href="#princes">note on women, like princes.</a></p>

<p><a name="corporeal" id="corporeal"> </a><b>corporeal strength:</b> The nature of man&#8217;s domination over women was often seen by eighteenth century feminists such as Priscilla Wakefield, Catherine Macaulay, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Robinson as derived from men&#8217;s superior physical strength. Wollstonecraft&#8217;s <i>Rights of Woman</i> discusses at length the nature of corporeal and mental strength, and the connection between them, and declares that "I wish to persuade women to endeavour to acquire strength, both in mind and in body" (VRW 111); see in particular chapters 2 and 3. These feminist thinkers advocated increased physical exercise for girls and women: see <a href="#sports">note on sports</a>.</p>

<p><a name="effeminacy" id="effeminacy"> </a><b>effeminacy:</b> Robinson is using a strategy similar to Wollstonecraft&#8217;s in <i>Rights of Woman</i> and <i>Rights of Men</i>, where Wollstonecraft urged both men and women to aspire to "a manly spirit of independence" (Rights of Men 46); see also <a href="#page361">Robinson&#8217;s note to page 36.</a> Both Robinson and Wollstonecraft in effect sever sex from gender, and desire that women have access to types of virtue, strength, and honor that were typically gendered masculine.

<p><a name="hannibals" id="hannibals"> </a><b>modern Hannibals:</b> Hannibal was a celebrated Carthaginian general who posed a long-time threat to Rome in the second century B.C., fighting in battles ranging from Spain to Italy to Africa.

<p><a name="my_travels" id="my_travels"> </a><b>my travels:</b> The high point of Robinson&#8217;s travels abroad occurred when she visited France in 1781. The Prince of Wales had deserted her earlier that year, and she went to Paris to "amuse her mind and beguile her thoughts from the recollection of past scenes" (<i>Perdita: The Memoirs of Mary Robinson,</i> p. 121). While in Paris she was "f&#234;ted by Parisian aristocracy" (<i>Memoirs,</i> p. xii). Her conquests included the profligate D&#8217;uc D&#8217;Orl&#233;ans, Louis XVI&#8217;s cousin, as well as Marie Antoinette: see <a href="#antoinette">note on Marie Antoinette.</a> Unfortunately, her subsequent trips to the Continent during the next decade were decidedly less glamorous: Plagued by a series of severe misfortunes which included financial problems, partial paralysis and a possible miscarriage, Robinson followed her then lover Colonel Banstre Tarleton into "Continental exile" for four years in 1784. Her last trip to France was in 1792 when she decided to take her mother and daughter on another Continental tour. However, when she arrived in Calais the war in France prevented them from proceeding any further, and she returned to England a few months later.</p>

<p>page 20</p>
<p><a name="foreign_lady" id="foreign_lady"> </a><b>A foreign lady of great distinction:</b> Robinson&#8217;s "true story" here, in which a continental woman responds to her seducer by claiming the right to a duel, hence to a "heroic act," and dies in a convent, serves as a contrast to the very different fate of "Miss [Ann] Broderick" in Britain, whose heroism condemned her to spend "the remainder of her days as a confirmed <i>maniac</i>." Broderick shot her lover in 1794, and was found not guilty by reason of insanity. The judge instructed the jury that while passion or jealousy were not sufficient grounds for declaring her insane, the fact that she laughed aloud after shooting him, "was a striking, and almost infallible symptom of insanity" (<i>The Trial of Miss Broderick, for the Wilful Murder of George Errington, Esq.</i> (Edinburgh: J. Robertson, 1795) 13).</p>

<p>page 26</p>
<p><a name="subtle" id="subtle"> </a><b>subtle and unrelenting enemy:</b> This allusion to the "subtle serpent" in Milton&#8217;s <i>Paradise Lost</i> is yet another pointed reminder from Robinson that Satan is not the only cause of women&#8217;s misfortunes -- that men as well must take the blame for the persecution and suffering of women.</p>

<p>page 27</p>
<p><a name="scaffold" id="scaffold"> </a><b>when they ascended the scaffold:</b> Helen Maria Williams&#8217;s influential <i>Letters from France</i> served as a monument to women&#8217;s bravery when facing the guillotine, particularly Madame Roland and Charlotte Corday. Williams gives a lengthy and positive description of Corday as an "extraordinary woman" (129), and adds that "it is difficult to conceive the kind of heroism which she displayed in the way to execution" (133); Robinson echoes Williams&#8217; statement that "She [Corday] ascended the scaffold with undaunted firmness, and, knowing that she had only to die, was resolved to die with dignity " (Williams, <i>Letters Containing a Sketch of the Politics of France</i> (1795) 134-135).</p>
<p><a name="antoinette" id="antoinette"> </a><b>Marie Antoinette:</b> Marie Antoinette (1755-93) was Louis XVI's Austrian-born queen. She was at first popular in France, but was later vilified for her rash expenditures, ostentatiosness, and public flirtations. Robinson herself met Marie Antoinette and was extremely impressed by her, as she shows in this passage from her <i>Memoirs</i>:</p>
<p>"A small space divided the Queen from Mrs. Robinson, whom the constant observation and loudly whispered encomiums of her Majesty most oppressively flattered. She appeared to survey, with peculiar attention, a miniature of the Prince of Wales, which Mrs. Robinson wore on her bosom, and of which, on the ensuing day, she commissioned the Duke of Orleans to request the loan. Perceiving Mrs. Robinson gaze with admiration on her white and polished arms, as she drew on her gloves, the Queen again uncovered them, and leaned for a few moments on her hand. The Duke, on returning the picture, gave to the fair owner a purse, netted by the hand of Antoinette, and which she had commissioned him to present, from her, to <i>la belle Angloise</i>"(123).</p>
<p>Like Robinson, Marie Antoinette was the subject of pornographic satires. Robinson, who was associated with republican politics in the eyes of her contemporaries, also wrote several poems lamenting the fate of Marie Antoinette: <i>A Monody on the Death of the Late Queen of France</i> (1793), "Marie Antoinette&#8217;s Lamentation..": see <a href="#louis">note on Louis the Sixteenth.</a></p>

<p>page 28</p>
<p><a name="corday" id="corday"> </a><b>CORDAY:</b> One of Robinson's many examples of women's public, often physical, heroism. Charlotte Corday, a Girondin republican from Normandy, assassinated the Jacobin Jean-Paul Marat on July 13, 1793 by stabbing him to death in his bath. Corday was put on trial and guillotined a few days later; both events received wide coverage in the British press and were the subjects of popular prints. Helen Maria Williams's influential <i>Letters from France</i> celebrated Corday's action as heroic and inspired. Corday's assassination of Marat was instrumental in precipitating the violent reaction of the Jacobin government against women, including Jacobin women. The guillotining of Marie Antoinette, Olympe de Gouges (a monarchist and a feminist) and Madame Roland (a Girondin) followed in the next few months, and the Jacobins also banned all women's political associations, such as the well-known Society of Revolutionary Republican Women.</p>

<p><a name="vossius" id="vossius"> </a><b>VOSSIUS:</b> Gerardus Joannes Vossius (1577-1649), German scholar and theologian, was one of the first scholars to use an historical perspective in his treatment of theological dogmas, including the religions of antiquity. Vossius&#8217;s work was known through out western Europe, and he sojourned at several foreign universities, including a stint at Oxford as LL.D from 1629-1632. In Chapter Two of <i>De Philologia</i>, which we have been able to find only in Latin editions, Vossius includes a lengthy numbered list of eminent women, which Robinson here includes almost entirely. In her <i>Memoirs</i>, Robinson does mention that she was schooled by Meribah Lorrington in Latin, but because she does not again allude to her ability to read Latin, her fluency in that language is open to some speculation.</p>

<p><a name="lefebvre" id="lefebvre"> </a><b>"the two Le Fevres":</b> Anne Lefevre (1654-1720), wife of editor Andre Dacier, was known as "the greatest French woman Hellenist" of her era. She translated and edited well-known versions of the Iliad (1711) and the Odyssey (1716) in addition to other classics including works by Sappho and Aristophanes (Oxford). The other "Le Fevre" to whom Robinson refers is unidentified, though she was likely the wife of Jean Leclerc, a political activist in post-revolutionary France who succeeded Marat after his assasination by Charlotte Corday.</p>
<p><a name="phillips" id="phillips"> </a><b>Katherine Phillips</b> (1632-64), or "Orinda," as she calls herself in her poems, was best known for writing poems in which she exalts Platonic friendships between women. The poetic figures "Rosania" and "Lucasia" both represent Phillips&#8217;s close friends in real life. Phillips represented a refined and sensitive femininity which was in opposition to the perceived coarseness of Aphra Behn (Greer).</p>
<p><a name="centlivre" id="centlivre"> </a><b>Susannah Centlivre</b> (1667?-1723) was a successful actress and playwright in the early eighteenth century. Known for her " sprightly" comedies, Centlivre published a total of 19 plays in her lifetime, including <i>The Busy Body</i> (1709) and <i>The Platonic Lady</i> (1707). In about 1706 she married Joseph Centlivre, principal cook to Queen Anne and George I. Due to the numerous plays which she presented and performed at court, Centlivre became quite beloved in royal and aristocratic circles. (DNB)</p>
<p><a name="behn" id="behn"> </a><b>Aphra Behn:</b> Very little is known about the life of Aphra Behn (1640-1689), poet, novelist, and playwright. Her novel <i>Ooronoko</i> is based on her experiences in the West Indies, where she lived for a time during her youth. She briefly worked as a spy for Charles II, then married, but was soon left penniless by her husband. According to the DNB, Behn was the first female writer to "live by the pen, " but other accounts suggest a long history of debt and borrowing (Greer 242). Behn also endured much public criticism due to her support of the Stuart cause as well as to her friendships with numerous men. Nevertheless, she enjoyed fame as a writer and has been commended as "the George Sand of the Restoration," receiving the commendations of and befriending contemporary writers such as Dryden, Otway, and Southerne (DNB).</p>
<p><a name="singer" id="singer"> </a><b>Elizabeth Singer Rowe</b> (1674-1737) enjoyed widespread admiration as a writer of great piety and virtue; she was considered by Dr. Johnson the first English writer to successfully employ "the ornaments of romance in the decoration of religion" (DNB). Singer is best known for her volume of poetry, <i>Poems on Several Occasions by Philomela</i> (1696), as well as her devotional prose. Her elegy to her husband was Pope&#8217;s inspiration for "Eloisa and Abelard" (1720) and is printed as an appendix to that poem (Greer).</p>

<p>page 43</p>
<p><a name="sappho" id="sappho"> </a><b>Sappho:</b> Sappho (c.610-c.580 B.C.), the most famous female poet of classical times, was greatly admired by Mary Robinson. Born on the island of Lesbos, Sappho was famous for her beauty, her lyrical poems, and her passions for both men and women. Although it was rumored that her unrequited love for the youth Phaon made her commit suicide by leaping into the sea from Mount Leucas, there is no evidence to support this theory. Robinson writes of the ill-fated romance in <i>Sappho and Phaon,</i> casting Sappho as the supreme example of the heightened sensibility that is born with poetic genius, and attributing her amoral reputation to the envy of little minds. Jerome McGann notes how Robinson conflates her troubled life and poetic genius with that of Sappho: "Throughout <i>Sappho and Phaon</i> Robinson builds a shrewd retort to the facile slanders regularly directed at herself. Robinson&#8217;s and Sappho&#8217;s histories come to reflect each other because (and as) their poetries are made reflective through <i>Sappho and Phaon</i>. It is the poetic sensibility that exposes these relations, according to Robinson, and the poetry of sensibility that puts them into most effective (social) action." McGann goes on to suggest that not only does Robinson become the "avatar" of Sappho, but she also makes the point in <i>Sappho and Phaon</i> that it is poets like themselves, and not polemicists like Wollstonecraft, who have "the power to wed the longest kind of philosophical view . . . with full, intense and immediate awareness." (<i>The Poetics of Sensibility</i>, p.116) See Robinson's <i><a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/britpo/sappho/sappho.html">Sappho and Phaon</a></i></p>
<p><a name="legitimate" id="legitimate"> </a><b>Mrs Robinson&#8217;s legitimate sonnets:</b> In <i>Sappho and Phaon</i>, Robinson&#8217;s fervent discourse on the nature of the "legitimate sonnet" is the cornerstone of her discussion of the poetics of sensibility, and helps to establish her claim for Sappho as the exemplar of strong poetic feeling. According to Robinson, the difference between the sonnets of her day (known as English or Shakespearean sonnets) and sonnets in the "legitimate" or Petrarchan mode, is that the modern sonnet is a self-contained unit which "confines the poet&#8217;s fancy," and the legitimate sonnet is one link in a chain of poems that tells a story. Robinson&#8217;s "little wreath" of sonnets is patterned on the legitimate sonnet, a form that she believes only Milton of all the British poets has used with any success. In <i>The Poetics of Sensibility</i>, Jerome McGann points out that her alignment with Milton is deliberate: "Her claim here establishes the importance of &#8216;major form,&#8217; a poetic vehicle capable of dealing with matters that transcend the merely personal"(105). By appropriating a form that was typically gendered masculine, Robinson elevates the poetry of sensibility to a place normally reserved for the work of the major poets. See Robinson's <i><a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/britpo/sappho/sappho.html">Sappho and Phaon</a></i> for more of her ideas concerning legitimate sonnets.</p>

Popular ballads and musical revues featured the motif of the Woman Warrior, and Hannah Snell (1723-1792) captured the public&#8217;s imagination as a real-life Woman Warrior. At age 20, she married a Dutch sailor who disappeared seven months after their marriage. Determined to find her husband, Snell borrowed the name and a suit of her brother-in-law, and enlisted as a foot soldier in the army. Still disguised as a man, she became a sailor, sailing to the East Indies as the assistant steward and cook for the officers. She was involved in several skirmishes, and was wounded in the groin. Not wanting her sex to be discovered by the army doctors, Snell found a black woman who was willing to extract the bullet and keep her secret. She spent seven years in the service until she heard that her husband had been executed in Genoa. At age 27, she abandoned her disguise and became an instant celebrity. Her story was published as "<i>The Female Soldier: or the Surprising Adventures of Hannah Snell</i> " by R. Walker in 1750. She appeared on stage in uniform. Because of the wound she had received in the line of duty, she received an annuity. She also supplemented her income by purchasing a tavern, and calling it the "Female Warrior." By the end of her colorful life, she had married three times, and died insane at the age of 69. See Diane Dugaw&#8217;s <i>Warrior Women and Popular Balladry.</i></p>

<p><a name="unsex" id="unsex"> </a><b>unsex</b> a woman: Robinson was named as one of the "unsexed" women writer's in Richard Polwhele's <i><a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/britpo/unsex/unsex.html">The Unsex'd Females</a></i> (1798), along with Wollstonecraft, Mary Hays, Helen Maria Williams, Anna Barbauld, and others. Polwhele thus described Robinson:</p>
<p>"Robinson to Gaul her Fancy gave,<br/>
And trac'd the picture of a Deist's grave."</p>
<p>The Deist referred to may be a character in her novel <i>Walzingham</i>, which had been attacked by conservatives for its support of the French Revolution.</p>
<p>In a note, Polwhele praises Robinson's poetry, but criticizes her novels, philosophy, and lifestyle:</p>
<p>"Would that, for the sake of herself and her beautiful daughter. . .would that for the sake of public morality, Mrs. Robinson were persuaded to dismiss the gloomy phantom of annihilation; to think seriously of a future rebribution; and to communicate to the world a recantation of errors that originated in levity, and have been nursed by pleasure."</p>

<p><a name="witchcraft" id="witchcraft"> </a><b>witchcraft:</b> Robinson argues that the persecution of women as witches stemmed from the bigotry and fear of men as women attempted to leave their allotted sphere through books and learning. Although the last trial in England for witchcraft was in 1712, trials and executions of witches did not finally cease until the end of the eighteenth-century. The total number of women who were persecuted and tried as witches has been estimated from 100,000 to as much as several million.</p>

<p><a name="excellentlines" id="excellentlines"> </a><b>some excellent lines, from the pen of a British woman:</b> Although Mary Robinson claims that this poem is written by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1689-1762), it is not found in her extant works. Montagu did wage a very acrimonious battle of words with Alexander Pope, including her infamous response to Pope in 1733 titled <i>VERSES Addressed to the IMITATOR of the FIRST SATIRE of the Second Book of Horace</i>. Although he began as a potential suitor, the relationship between Pope and Montagu ended abruptly in 1722. It was rumored that this took place when Pope finally confessed his love to Lady Montagu, and she laughed at him. Pope retaliated by referring to her in a couplet in his satire of Horace:</p>
<p>"From furious Sappho scarce a milder Fate (than poison or hanging),<br/>
P-x&#8217;d her Love, or libell&#8217;d by her Hate."<br/>
In her response, <i>VERSES Addressed to the IMITATOR</i>, Lady Montagu showed herself to be more than equal to the task of ridiculing her former suitor. As Carol Barash points out in her article on Lady Montague in the <i>Dictionary of Literary Biography</i>(DLB 95, 145-55), she turned his deformity (Pope was a hunchback) into a symbol of what she viewed as his own twisted humanity:</p>
<p>"Thine is just such and Image of (Horace's) Pen,<br/>
As thou thy self art of the Sons of Men:<br/>
Where our own Species in Burlesque we trace,<br/>
A Sign-Post Likeness of the noble Race;<br/>
That is at once Resemblance and Disgrace."<br/>

Donoghue argues that it was easier for men to discuss Sappho&#8217;s possible bisexuality in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but that "a literary woman could not be seen to defend something that could damage her own status" <i>(Passions Between Women,</i> p. 250).</p>

<p><a name="genlis" id="genlis"> </a><b>F&#233;licit&#233; de Genlis</b> (1746-1830)wrote poetry and prose, and was extremely influential in Britain as an educator. According to her pupil Louis-Philippe, the one-time mistress and tutor for many years of the children of the Duc D&#8217;Orleans was the first woman to use a man&#8217;s desk to write at instead of the "secr&#233;taires" that other literary women used.</p>
<p><a name="maintenon" id="maintenon"> </a><b><a href="/editions/robinson/mrainsi90frst.htm#maintenon">Madame de Maintenon:</a></b> Using the example of Madame de Maintenon, Robinson again underscores her point that women are made the scapegoats of men&#8217;s own degenerate natures. Madame de Maintenon (1635-1719) was the secret wife of Louis XIV. Although a very pious and private woman, she was accused of having both the king and France completely under her control. This rumor was somewhat exaggerated: Although it was true that the ministers discussed all their state business with her before they met with the king, he did not consult her on the most important issues. Robinson has an extended passage praising Madame de Maintenon in <i><a href="/editions/robinson/mrainsi90frst.htm">Ainsi va le Monde</a></i>.</p>
<p><a name="restraint" id="restraint"> </a><b>freezing restraint:</b> The "other nations" which Robinson suggests impeded intellectual progress through this freezing restraint implicitly refers to Great Britain.

<p><a name="influence" id="influence"> </a><b>The influence they obtained:</b> Robinson here counters the widespread British characterization of <i>ancien regime</i> French culture and politics as dominated by a corrupt "reign of beauty," or a "mistress system, " in which women ruled men, and by extension the nation, through the sexual power they held over them. Robinson&#8217;s portrayal of these women&#8217;s influence as civilizing and enlightening is very different from Wollstonecraft&#8217;s portrayal of the French court in her <i>An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution</i> (1794<i>)</i>, where she described Marie Antoinette as "absolute mistress" ruling "the court of the passive Louis" and holding "messalinian feasts" at the Trianon (<i>Political Writings</i>, 314, 315).</p>

<p><a name="louis" id="louis"> </a><b>Louis the Sixteenth:</b> Robinson&#8217;s meeting with Louis XVI did not excite her imagination as much as her introduction to his wife, Marie Antoinette. In her memoirs, Robinson does mention his appetite at the "<i>grand couvert</i>" where "the King acquitted himself with more alacrity than grace" (<i>Memoirs</i>, p. 123) These words might describe his political career as well. Louis XVI (1754-1793) became king at age 20. At first, his reign appeared to be successful. His minister Turgot, the great statesman, attempted to solve France&#8217;s severe financial problems by a series of reforms. However, these measures made Turgot very unpopular, and eventually led to his dismissal. His successor, Necker, tried to continue his reforms but he too was dismissed in 1781. The country&#8217;s financial crisis began at this point, when Louis XVI&#8217;s wife, Marie Antoinette, began to assert her influence over her husband. Throughout his life, Louis XVI was reported to be a weak-minded man. His diary shows that he cared little for the business of running a country: The entry in his diary on July 14, 1789 was "nothing." He was executed on January 21, 1793.</p>
<p><a name="bastille" id="bastille"> </a><b>a Bastille:</b> The Bastille was the fortress-prison in Paris, seized by a crowd on July 14, 1789, the date that marks the beginning of the French Revolution. Since the reign of Louis XIV, it had become a state prison where the king could incarcerate any of his subjects with a <i>lettre de cachet</i>, without a trial or jury, for as long as he chose. In 1789, the Bastille contained only seven prisoners, but it had become the symbol for royal repression and despotism.</p>
<p>Wollstonecraft famously linked the Bastille with women's imprisonment--political, economic, and intellectual--in <i><a href="http://www.hti.umich.edu/bin/pd-idx?type=header&amp;id=WollMMaria">The Wrongs of Woman, or Maria</a></i>, where Maria declares, "marriage had bastilled me for life" (154-5). Helen Maria Williams also wrote an important poem on the subject in her 1790 novel <i>Julia</i>: <a href="http://orion.it.luc.edu/~acraciu/hmwbast.htm">"The Bastille: A Vision,"</a> and Robinson&#8217;s 1790 poem <i>&amp;quotAinsi va le Monde,"</i> dedicated to her fellow Della Cruscan Robert Merry, celebrated the French Revolution as well, with a <a href="/editions/robinson/mrainsi90frst.htm">lengthy passage on the Bastille.</a></p>

<p>The Areopagites were an Athenian assembly of judges who were responsible for punishing people who blasphemed against the gods, murdered, or transgressed any of the laws of their city. These judges conducted their enquiries against individuals in the open air because murderers and their accusers were not at that time permitted to be under the same roof. Furthermore, all trials and hearings took place at night so that the judges would not be swayed by seeing either the accused or the accuser. This determination not to take sides was taken so seriously that it was a law that each side of the case must be stated in plain and simple language so that the judges could not be swayed by persuasive rhetoric. As one can imagine, their authority and power were so absolute that the assembly easily lent itself to corruption.</p>

<p><a name="sorrows" id="sorrows"> </a><b>to share the sorrows of adversity, imprisonment:</b> It was Robinson&#8217;s misfortune to have had just such an "adverse destiny." Before their marriage, Robinson&#8217;s husband had contracted a large debt, and when they set up their household as a wedded couple he continued his extravagant spending habits which eventually landed him, his wife, and baby daughter in debtor&#8217;s prison where they lived for nine months. During their interment, her husband continued to amuse himself -- with racquet-ball and other women -- while Mary tended to her little girl and wrote poetry.</p>
<p>Robinson&#8217;s account of those months is exceedingly poignant: "What I suffered during this tedious captivity!--My little volume of Poems sold but indifferently: my health was considerably impaired; and the trifling income which Mr. Robinson received from his father was scarcely sufficient to support him. I will not enter into a tedious detail of vulgar sorrows, of vulgar scenes; I seldom quitted my apartment, and never till the evening, when for air and exercise I walked on the racquet-ground with my husband" (<i>Memoirs,</i> p. 79).</p>

<p><a name="laura" id="laura"> </a><b>Laura of Petrarch:</b> The sixteenth century saw a revival of the sonnet form fathered by Italian Renaissance poet Petrarch; by the eighteenth century, the form was again revived and revised, this time serving as "the ground on which male and female Romantic poets met" (Daniel Robinson 99). Women poets like Anna Seward, Charlotte Smith, and Helen Maria Williams "deliberately claimed [the sonnet form] in order to legitimize themselves as poets" (99). However, whereas these women tended to hide their gender by taking on male names like Petrarch and Werther, Mary Robinson" apparently sees no reason to hide her gender from the Renaissance tradition; so, instead of writing as Petrarch, she reaches back farther to an even more golden age of literature to adopt the persona of Sappho, the Lesbian Muser, while maintaining her own modern voice" (117). In keeping with this deliberate revision of the traditionally male-voiced sonnet, Robinson writes several poems from the perspective of Laura, the subject of Petrarch&#8217;s most famous series of sonnets.</p>

Cf. Wollstonecraft: "from every quarter I have heard exclamations against masculine women; but where are they to be found? If by this appellation men mean to inveigh against their ardour in hunting, shooting, and gaming, I shall most cordially join in the cry; but if it be against the imitation of manly virtues, or, more properly speaking, the attainment of those talents and virtues, the exercise of which ennobles the human character, and which raise females in the scale of animal being, when they are comprehensively termed mankind;-- all those who view them with a philosophic eye must, I should think, wish with me, that they may every day grow more and more masculine" <i>(Rights of Woman,</i> 110); see also her comments on "<i>male</i> spirits" in female bodies, p. 145. See also Mary Hays: "If therefore we are to understand by a masculine woman, one who emulates those virtues and accomplishments, which as common to human nature, are common to both sexes; the attempt is natural, amiable, and highly honorable to that woman, under whatever name her conduct may be disguised or censured" (<i>Appeal to the Men of Great Britain in Behalf of Women</i> (1798) 173-174; see also p 179-181).</p>

<p><a name="neglect" id="neglect"> </a><b>neglect, infidelity, and scorn:</b> The neglet and infidelities of her husband were the source of much of Robinson&#8217;s unhappiness. Her portrait of him in her memoirs is that of a dissolute and unfeeling man who flaunted his mistresses, and only returned her affection when it was in his best interest to do so. Although there is a thread of sadness and melancholy that runs throughout her memoirs, Robinson avoids blaming her husband directly except in the most trying of times when she cannot help but mourn her fate:</p>
<p>"Alas! I never knew the sweet soothing solace of wedded sympathy; I never was beloved by him whom destiny allotted to be the legal ruler of my actions. I do not condemn Mr. Robinson; I but too well know that we cannot command our affections. I only lament that he did not observe some decency in his infidelities; and that, while he gratified his <i>own</i> caprice, he forgot how much he exposed his <i>wife</i> to the most degrading mortifications" (<i>Memoirs,</i> p. 91)</p>

<p><a name="sports" id="sports"> </a><b>minor sports:</b> Wollstonecraft suggested, "Let us then, by being allowed to take the same exercise as boys, not only during infancy, but youth, arrive at perfection of body, that we may know how far the natural superiority of man extends" (<i>Rights of Woman</i> 208). Cf. Priscilla Wakefield: "There is no reason for maintaining any sexual distinctions in the bodily exercises of children; if it is right to give both sexes all the corporeal advantages, which nature has formed them to enjoy, let them both partake of the same rational means of obtaining a flow of health and animal spirits, to enable them to perform the stations of life. Let girls be no longer confined to sedentary employments in a nursery, or at best permitted to take a gentle walk in the garden, as an apology for more vigorous exertions" (<i>Reflections on the Present Condition of the Female Sex</i> (1798): 20-21). See also <a href="#corporeal">note on corporeal strength</a>.</p>
<p><a name="masculine_sports" id="masculine_sports"> </a><b>masculine sports:</b> When Mary Wollstonecraft and Mary Hays praised women who were labeled <a href="#masculine">"masculine women"</a>, because of their intellectual and political aspirations, they specifically did not want women to take on what they considered the vices of masculinity, including physical aggression and violence, as expressed both in hunting and war. Cf. Hays: "if on the other hand we mean by a masculine woman, one who apes the exercises, the attributes, the unrestrained passions, and the numberless improprieties, which men fondly <i>chuse</i> [sic] to think suitable enough for their own sex-- [...] I must say that knowldege has no tendency whatever to produce such awkward imitations; and I must confess, that such are masculine in the worst sense of the word, and as we should imagine consequently disagreeable" " (<i>Appeal to the Men of Great Britain in Behalf of Women</i> (1798) 179-180). Hays, like Wollstonecraft and Macaulay, singles out women hunting (as opposed to women merely riding horses for exercise) as an undesirable effect of women taking up such "masculine" vices: "be it man or woman who indulges in it [hunting], [it] can only be regarded as the sport of savages, who have scarcely reflection enough to consider, that the inferior animals have perhaps sensations of pain, and the desire of self-preservation.... Let women then leave to the other sex, such barbarous amusements, as that of hunting poor innnocent creatures to death!" (<i>Appeal to the Men of Great Britain in Behalf of Women</i> (1798) 181).

Portia, the wife of Brutus, was another Roman woman with a high tolerance for pain. She gave herself a severe wound in the thigh in order to display her bravery, thus proving herself worthy of being included in Brutus&#8217;s conspiracy against Julius Caesar. Not wishing to live on after Brutus&#8217;s death, she swallowed burning coals and died in about 42 B.C. (LCD).</p>
<p><a name="university" id="university"> </a><b>UNIVERSITY FOR WOMEN:</b> In addition to Wollstonecraft, numerous women writers in this era argued in favor of education for women. Most notable is Mary Astell&#8217;s <i>A Serious Proposal to the Ladies</i> (1694), in which Astell suggests the establishment of a female community where "celibate women could lead fulfilling lives and girls could be educated until they were ready for marriage" (Rogers 72). Astell emphasizes the need for close friendships between women and based her arguments for education "more on self-development than on their usefulness to others" (Rogers 74). The most extended vision of an such an educational female utopia is Sarah Robinson Scott&#8217;s <i>Millennium Hall</i> (1762).

Wollstonecraft attributes the debased position of women to "men who, considering females rather as women than human creatures, have been more anxious to make them alluring mistresses than affectionate wives and rational mothers" (<i>VRW</i> 109). Wollstonecraft feels that women are intentionally given superficial educations. She gives more credit to her fellow women:</p>
<p>"My own sex, I hope, will excuse me, if I treat them like rational creatures, instead of flattering their <i>fascinating</i> graces, and viewing them as if they were in a state of perpetual childhood, unable to stand alone. I earnestly wish to point out in what true dignity and human happiness consists--I wish to persuade women to endeavor to acquire strength, both of mind and body" (<i>VRW</i> 111).</p>
<p>Emma, protagonist of Hays's <i>Memoirs of Emma Courtney</i>, subscribes to Mr. Francis's (a Godwin figure) notion that women, like men, should be educated rationally:</p>
<p>"Our duties, then, are obvious--If selfish and violent passions have been generated by the inequalities of society, we must labour to counteract them, by endeavouring to combat prejudice, to expand the mind, to give comprehensive views, to teach mankind their true interest, and to lead them to habits of goodness and greatness" (51).</p>

She published <i>Miscellany Poems</i> (1722), <i>Codrus, or, The Dunciad Dissected</i> (1727), and <i>The Metamorphosis of the Town: Or, a View of the Present Fashions</i> (1730).</p>

<p><a name="damer" id="damer"> </a><b>Mrs. Damer:</b> Anne Seymour Damer (1749-1828) was a classical sculptress learned in Latin and Greek and a publicly acknowledged lesbian. After her husband's suicide, she devoted herself to sculpture (mainly busts), continued her friendship with Horace Walpole, and met Josephine, who invited her to Paris to meet Napoleon, to whom she presented a sculpture. Damer, who enjoyed wearing men's clothing and had a long relationship with Mary Berry, is mocked in the anonymous <i>A Sapphic Epistle</i> (1782).</p>
<p><a name="cowley" id="cowley"> </a><b>Mrs. Cowley:</b> Hannah Cowley (1743-1809) began her successful career as a playwright on a dare, after her husband doubted she could write as well as other popular dramatists. Her plays <i>The Runaway</i> (1776), <i>Who's the Dupe?</i> (1779), <i>The School for Eloquence</i> (1780), and many more, were extremely popular; Mary Robinson played Victoria in Cowley's comedy, <i>A Bold Stroke for a Husband</i> in 1783. Cowley's anxiety about the originality of her plays prompted her to accuse Hannah More of plagiarism in a "newspaper war." Cowley was also known for her Della Cruscan poetry, which she wrote under the name of "Anna Matilda". Robinson was also closely associated with the Della Cruscan circle of Robert Merry.</p>
<p><a name="lee" id="lee"> </a><b>Miss Lee:</b> Sophia Lee (1750-1824) combatted her family's poverty by devoting the profits of her successful opera <i>The Chapter of Accidents</i> (1780) to the foundation of a school for young ladies at Belvidere House, Bath, where she and her sisters could teach. She also published an important Gothic novel, <i>The Recess, or a Tale of other Times</i> (1785), and other less successful plays.</p>
<p><a name="more" id="more"> </a><b>Miss Hannah More:</b> Hannah More (1745-1833) is chiefly known for her moral and religious writings. She worked with her sisters at a boarding school they established in Trinity Street, Bristol (which Robinson attended for a short period), and where More learned Italian, Spanish, and Latin. Her plays include <i>The Search for Happiness</i> (1762), which she intended as a piece of enough moral worth for schoolchildren to memorize, <i>Percy</i> (1777), the play which aroused Hannah Cowley's accusal of plagiarism, and <i>The Fatal Falsehood</i> (1779). A fierce abolitionist and anti-Jacobin, More also published political pieces, educational tracts (including <i>Strictures on the Modern System of Female Education, with a View of the Principles and Conduct prevalent among Women of Rank and Fortune</i> in 1799), and poems. She was a close friend of Samuel Johnson, and was the patron of the poet Anne Yearsley.</p>

<p><a name="thickness" id="thickness"> </a><b>Mrs. Thickness:</b> Ann Thickness (1737-1824), was an accomplished author and musician. As a young woman, she left home in defiance of her father's command that she not sing in public; she went on to hold several lucrative subscription concerts. After her husband's death, she was imprisoned during the Reign of Terror while visiting France. She is best known for <i>Sketches of the Lives and Writings of the Ladies of France</i> (1778-81) and <i>The School for Fashion</i> (1800).</p>
<p><a name="piozzi" id="piozzi"> </a><b>Mrs. Piozzi</b>: Hester Lynch Piozzi (1741-1821), close friend of Samuel Johnson, was learned in Latin and modern languages. She had a rich and varied romantic life: after the death of her first husband, Henry Thrale, whom she married to please her family, she married the Italian musician Gabriel Piozzi in 1784, in spite of her daughters' disapproval; when an eighty-year-old widow, she took a fancy to the young actor William Conway. Her major publications include <i>Anecdotes of the late Samuel Johnson</i> (1788), and <i>Observations and Reflections made in the course of a Journey through France, Italy, and Germany</i> (1789).</p>
<p><a name="montagu" id="montagu"> </a><b>Mrs. Montagu:</b> Elizabeth Montagu (1720-1800) founded an intellectual and social group that conducted regular meetings and events, later called the "blue-stockings"; its members included Elizabeth Carter, Hester Thrale, Hannah More, Fanny Burney, and others. Montagu's publications include her pieces in George Lyttleton's <i>Dialogues of the Dead</i> (1760) and her famous "Essay on the Writing and Genius of Shakespeare compared with the Greek and French Dramatic Poets, with some Remarks upon the Misrepresentations of Monsieur de Voltaire" (1761).

She was one of the most influential chroniclers of the French Revolution in her series of <i>Letters from France</i>. Moreover, her loyalty to France and her cohabitation with John Hurford Stone aroused the contempt of many of her compatriots, though her salon in Paris was visited by many leading British writers, as well as the leading political figures of France. Other publications include <i>Poems</i> (1786) and <i>Julia, a Novel</i> (1790).</p>

<p><a name="female_philosopher" id="female_philosopher"> </a><b>female philosopher:</b> Although Wollstonecraft has become the best-known feminist of this era, the latter eighteenth century saw the development of a feminist movement based on numerous feminist tracts. Mary Hays&#8217;s An Appeal to the Men of Great Britain in Behalf of Women (1798) is a strong argument encouraging ambition rather than passiveness in women. Other contributions to this movement include Woman Not Inferior to Man and Woman&#8217;s Superior Excellence Over Man (1740) by "Sophia"; Priscilla Bell Wakefield&#8217;s Reflections on the Present Condition of the Female Sex System of Female Education (1799).<br/>

Portia, the wife of Brutus, was another Roman woman with a high tolerance for pain. She gave herself a severe wound in the thigh in order to display her bravery, thus proving herself worthy of being included in Brutus&#8217;s conspiracy against Julius Caesar. Not wishing to live on after Brutus&#8217;s death, she swallowed burning coals and died in about 42 B.C. (LCD).</p>

<p><a name="montague" id="montague"> </a><b>Lady Mary Wortley Montague:</b> Not only was Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1689-1762) known for her published letters and poems, but she was responsible for bringing the practice of inoculation to England. When her husband was made ambassador to Turkey in 1716, she accompanied him to Constaninople where she observed the success of inoculation on the inhabitants of that country. Lady Montagu, like so many others in the eighteenth-century had suffered the ravages of that disease, and it had killed her brother as well. After she returned to England, during a smallpox epidemic in 1721, she had her own daughter inoculated. Despite the presence of four doctors, this radical treatment was widely condemned: "The faculty all rose in arms to a man, foretelling failure and the most disastrous consequences; the clergy descanted from their pulpits on the impiety of thus seeking to take events out of the hand of Providence; the common people were taught to hoot at her as an unnatural mother, who had risked the lives of her own children" (Lady Mary Wortley Montagu: Essays and Poems, pp. 35-35). However, she did have a few supporters such as Princess Caroline who had her own children inoculated, and despite the controversy, the practice of inoculation became widespread.</p>
<p>Robinson, who had lost her sister Elizabeth to small pox when she was very young, was a strong supporter of the practice of inoculation, and had her own daughter inoculated. Robinson wrote a poem about her daughter&#8217;s recovery from inoculation, "Invocation to Oberon." In her poem, inoculation is performed by Oberon who gathers all kinds of magical ingredients to ease her daughter Maria&#8217;s recovery.</p>

<p><a name="salmon" id="salmon"> </a><b>Salmon:</b> Thomas Salmon (1679-1767) was an historical and geographical writer who wrote a very popular book, Modern History, or the Present State of all Nations (1739), which detailed the cultures and customs of people throughout the world in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>page 65</p>
<p><a name="hamilton" id="hamilton"> </a><b>Lady Hamilton, and <a href="#williams">Helen Maria Williams</a>:</b> As Robinson indicates, both women were better appreciated in Europe than in Britain; their revolutionary sympathies and their emigration to France rendered them unpopular after the French Revolution became unpopular among most British. Lady Mary Hamilton (1739-1816) was born in Edinburgh, married twice, and settled with her second husband in France before the Revolution. She is best remembered for her novel Munster Village (1798), an all-female utopia.</p>

<p>page 69</p>
<p><a name="sposos" id="sposos"> </a><b>sposos, Italian cecisbeos:</b> " Sposos" is Italian for "husbands," or "bridegrooms"; a "cicisbeo" is the recognized gallant of a married woman. It is probable that Robinson was recalling the lines in her friend Richard Sheridan&#8217;s play, The School for Scandal, in which Joseph Surface proposes himself as "a mere Platonic cicisbeo" to Lady Teazle (1777, II, iii).</p>

<p>page 71</p>
<p><a name="eon" id="eon"> </a><b>Madame D&#8217;Eon:</b> The French Chevalier D&#8217;Eon (1728-1810) came to England in 1752 and began to dress as a woman in the 1760s, which generated widespread popular interest in his "true" sex, with newspapers such as The Morning Post even offering money for the "truth." A Court case in 1777 which attempted to decide D&#8217;Eon&#8217;s true sex, for the sake of the many gambling bets at stake, ruled that he was female. In the 1790s D&#8217;Eon fenced, in women&#8217;s clothing, before large crowds in England. A medical exam after D&#8217;Eon&#8217;s death in 1810 declared that he was male. Wollstonecraft includes D'Eon in her Rights of Woman as one of the exceptional women, along with the likes of Sappho and Macaulay, who transcend the limitations of their gender and therefore do not serve as models for what she terms women closest to "nature," in her mind middle-class women (Rights of Woman 197). These "exceptional women" are preciely the kind of woman with which Robinson&#8217;s Letter is concerned. See Gary Kates, "D'Eon Returns to France: Gender and Power in 1777," Body Guards: The Cultural Politics of Gender Ambiguity, eds. Julia Epstein and Kristina Straub (New York and London: Routledge, 1991).</p>

<p><a name="french_author" id="french_author"> </a><b>power of guardianship:</b> Robinson is likely referring to the practice of couverture, which severely restricted women&#8217;s legal rights. According to Davidoff&#8217;s and Hall&#8217;s Family Fortunes, "a married woman only existed under her husband&#8217;s protection, within his personality. She could not sign Bills of Exchange, make contracts, sue or be sued, collect debts or stand surety and therefore she could not act as a partner, since for all practical purposes, on marriage a woman died a kind of civil death" (200).</p>

<p><a name="britons" id="britons"> </a><b>The ancient Britons:</b> The convention of the "free Britons" was well established by Robinson&#8217;s time and commonly used to contrast Britain&#8217;s tradition of constitutional monarchy to French absolute monarchy and then republicanism; here Robinson uses the concept of the "ancient Britons" to support feminist reform, as anti-abolitionists used the concept from the 1780s onward to oppose Britain&#8217;s involvement in the slave trade, and Chartists used it later for their program of political reform (see Linda Colley, Britons: Forging the Nation 1707-1837).</p>
