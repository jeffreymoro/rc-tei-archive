<center>TO THE PUBLIC,</center>

<center>FINDING that a Work on a subject similar<br/>
to the following, has lately been published<br/>
at Paris, Mrs. Robinson is induced to avow<br/>
herself the Author of this Pamphlet. The<br/>
first Edition was published in February last,<br/>
under the fictitious Signature of <i>Anne<br/>
Frances Randall</i>; and the mention of Mrs.<br/>
Robinson's works was merely inserted with<br/>
a view to mislead the reader respecting the<br/>
REAL AUTHOR of the Pamphlet.</center>
