    <p>&#8216;You have well described it. Every man felt the same. I have often mentioned it to my comrades. Say what you like, said I, but slay my mother, if ever since the old man strangled himself, things did not seem, as it were, in their natural propinquity. &#8217;Twas the phrase I used.&#8217;</p>
