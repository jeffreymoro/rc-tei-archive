    <p>&#8216;YOU see, my lords,&#8217; said Alroy, ere the council broke up, &#8216;we must attack them singly. There can be no doubt of that. If they join, we must combat at great odds. &#8217;Tis in detail that we must rout them. I will myself to Persia. Ithamar must throw himself between the Sultan and Abidan, Medad fall back on Ithamar. Scherirah must guard the capital. Honain, you are Regent. And so farewell. I shall set off to-night. Courage, brave companions. &#8217;Tis a storm, but many a cedar survives the thunderbolt.&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;My own Scherirah!&#8217; said the Caliph, as they retired, &#8216;stay awhile. I would speak with you alone. Honain,&#8217; continued Alroy, following the Grand Vizir out of the chamber, and leaving Scherirah alone, &#8216;Honain, I have not yet interchanged a word with you in private. What think you of all this?&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;No, Sir, it has left me once, and never shall again. You have touched upon a string that makes me sad. There is a burden on my conscience, why, or what, I know not. I am innocent, you know I am innocent, Honain!&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;You see, Scherirah, how the wind blows, brave heart. There's much to do, no doubt. I am in sad want of some right trusty friend, on whose devoted bosom I can pillow all my necessities. I was thinking of sending you against this Arslan, but perhaps &#8217;tis better that I should go myself. These are moments one should not seem to shrink, and yet we know not how affairs may run; no, we know not. The capital, the surrounding province: one disaster and these false Moslemin may rise against us. I should stay here, but if I leave Scherirah, I leave myself. I feel that deeply; &#8217;tis a consolation. It may be that I must fall back upon the city. Be prepared, Scherirah. Let me fall back upon supporting friends. You have a great trust. Oh! use it wisely! Worthily I am sure you must do.&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;I'll answer for my own. They are rough fellows, like myself, a little too blunt, perhaps, your Highness. We are not holiday guards, but we know our duty, and we will do it.&#8217;</p>
