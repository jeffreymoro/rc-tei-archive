    <p>&#8216;NOBLE Captain,&#8217; said Kisloch, &#8216;we trust that you will permit us to enlist in the band. This is not the first time we have served under your orders in this spot. Old co-mates i&#8217;faith, who have seen the best and the worst. We suspected where you might be found, although, thanks to the ever felicitous invention of man, it is generally received that you died in battle. I hope your Majesty is well,&#8217; added Kisloch, bowing to Schirene.</p>
