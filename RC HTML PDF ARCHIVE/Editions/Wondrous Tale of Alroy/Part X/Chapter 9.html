    <p>&#8217;TWAS midnight. Schirene reposed in the arms of Alroy. The Caliph, who was restless and anxious for the arrival of Scherirah, was scarcely slumbering, when the sound of a voice thoroughly aroused him. He looked around; be beheld the spectre of Jabaster. His hair stood on end, his limbs seemed to loosen, a cold dew crept over his frame, as he gazed upon the awful form within a yard of his couch. Unconsciously he disembarrassed his arms of their fair burden, and, rising on the couch, leant forward.</p>

    <p>&#8216;Nothing, sweet! A soldier&#8217;s wife must bear strange sights, yet I would save you some. One of my men, forgetful you were here, burst into my tent in such a guise as scarce would suit a female eye. I must away, my child. I&#8217;ll call thy slaves. One kiss! Farewell! but for a time.&#8217;<br/>
