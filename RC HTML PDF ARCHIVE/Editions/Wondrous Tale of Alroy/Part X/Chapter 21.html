    <p>&#8216;Keep straight forward. That is right. It is no use going that way. The Bazaar is shut. There is Fakreddin,<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote178">*</a> there is Osman Effendi.<a href="/editions/alroy/novel/ednotes.html#ednote179">*</a> He has got a new page.&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;Come along, don&#8217;t quarrel. That is a Karasmian. They think they are to do what they like. We are five to one to be sure, but still there is nothing like peace and quiet. I wish Abdallah were here with his stout shoulders. Only think of his selling sherbet!&#8217;<br/>
