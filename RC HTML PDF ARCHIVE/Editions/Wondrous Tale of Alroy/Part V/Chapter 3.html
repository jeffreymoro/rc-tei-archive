    <p>THE arched chamber was of great size and beautiful proportion. The ceiling, encrusted with green fretwork, and studded with silver stars, rested upon clustered columns of white and green marble. In the centre of a variegated pavement of the same material, a fountain rose and fell into a green porphyry basin, and by the side of the fountain, upon a couch of silver, reposed Honain.</p>

    <p>&#8216;There is nothing stranger than sympathy,&#8217; soliloquised the physician of the Caliph, with a meditative air; &#8216;all resolves itself into this principle, and I confess this learned doctor treats it deeply and well. An erudite spirit truly, and an eloquent pen; yet he refines too much. &#8217;Tis too scholastic. Observation will teach us more than dogma. Meditating upon my passionate youth, I gathered wisdom. I have seen so much that I have ceased to wonder. However we doubt, there is a mystery beyond our penetration. And yet &#8217;tis near our grasp. I sometimes deem a step, a single step, would launch us into light. Here comes my patient. The rose has left his cheek, and his deep brow is wan and melancholy. Yet &#8217;tis a glorious visage, Meditation&#8217;s throne; and Passion lingers in that languid eye. I know not why, a strong attraction draws me to this lone child.</p>
