                    <h5>Robert O&#8217;Kell. &#8220;The Autobiographical Nature of
                        Disraeli&#8217;s Early Fiction.&#8221; <i>Nineteenth-Century
                            Fiction</i> 31 (1976): 260-66.</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>. . . It is clear now that Disraeli found in the issue of
                            Catholic Emancipation not just a topical setting to exploit,
                            but a disguise for his own ambiguous feelings about his
                            Jewish heritage. He had, in fact, abandoned the manuscript
                            of <i>The Wondrous Tale of Alroy</i> (1833) in order to
                            write <i>The Young Duke</i> in 1829, and this is strong
                            circumstantial evidence that his Jewish heritage was at
                            least at that time a preoccupation directly linked in his
                            thinking to the Catholic question. It is, however, a
                            comparison between <i>Alroy</i> (which Disraeli completed
                            after his defeat in the second Wycombe election, marked by
                            overt anti-Semitism) and <i>Contarini Fleming</i> that
                            confirms the importance of religious allegiance to the
                            problem of personal identity in the life and in the fiction.
                            Both novels, for example, reflect an initial isolation of
                            the hero, a sense of expectancy with which his maturity is
                            anticipated, and a sense of guilt which his actions create.
                            But in <i>Alroy</i> it is not very helpful to attempt to
                            make the distinction between explicit and implicit themes
                            that illuminates <i>Contarini Fleming</i>, for it is clear
                            throughout that the central theme is the ambiguity and
                            conflict in the hero&#8217;s character. In that regard
                                <i>Alroy</i> is the product of a greater degree of
                            conscious awareness of himself on the part of the author.
                            While in its fantasy structure the novel confirms the
                            pattern of early conflict and tension in the author&#8217;s
                            personality, it also proves that Disraeli was undertaking a
                            reassessment of his behavior which led him to renewed
                            attempts, in his fiction and in his political life, to
                            establish his sincerity.<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup><br/>
                            <br/></li>
                        <li>In the person of the emotionally autobiographical David
                            Alroy, Disraeli creates a hero who is an ideal, noble, and
                            divinely chosen savior of his people and who essentially
                            represents a personal defiance of reality parallel to the
                            public postures his creator had recently adopted on the
                            hustings. But, just as there is a deep insecurity underneath
                            the bravado of Disraeli&#8217;s early political campaigns,
                            there is a fear of failure within the imaginative projection
                            of the ideal. Even before he is fully possessed of the
                            supernatural power of the messiah to free the Jewish people,
                            Alroy is twice tempted to abandon that pure identity. The
                            first entirely materialistic suggestion, that he be
                            disguised and pass as Lord Honain&#8217;s son and so acquire
                            great social success and power in the Moslem world, he
                            rejects to pursue the &#8220;eternal glory&#8221; of his
                            religious quest. But when, at the emotional climax of the
                            novel, disguised as a deaf-mute eunuch he meets the daughter
                            of the Caliph, the Princess Schirene, whose mother was a
                            Christian, Alroy&#8217;s feverish and agitated response
                            reveals the complexity of his character. Suddenly, seizing
                            the rosary given to him by the Princess and pressing it to
                            his lips, he soliloquizes:
                                <blockquote>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Spirit of
                                my dreams, she comes at last; the form for which I have
                                sighed and wept; the form which rose upon my radiant
                                vision when I shut my eyes against the jarring shadows
                                of this gloomy world.<br/>
                                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Schirene! Schirene! here
                                in this solitude I pour to thee the passion long stored
                                up: the passion of my life, no common life, a life full
                                of deep feeling and creative thought. 0 beautiful! 0
                                more than beautiful! for thou to me art as a dream
                                unbroken: why art thou not mine? why lose a moment in
                                our glorious lives, and balk our destiny of half its
                                bliss?<br/> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fool, fool,
                                hast thou forgotten? The rapture of a prisoner in his
                                cell, whose wild fancy for a moment belies his fetters!
                                The daughter of the Caliph and a Jew!<br/>
                                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Give me my fathers&#8217;

                                magic but her name. By heavens! I will enter this
                                glorious city a conqueror, or die.<br/>
                                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why, what is Life? for
                                meditation mingles ever with my passion: why, what is
                                Life? Throw accidents to the dogs, and tear off the
                                painted mask of false society! Here am I a hero; with a
                                mind that can devise all things, and a heart of
                                superhuman daring, with youth, with vigour, with a
                                glorious lineage, with a form that has made full many a
                                lovely maiden of our tribe droop her fair head . . . and
                                I am, nothing.<br/> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Out on
                                Society! &#8217;twas not made for me. I&#8217;ll form my
                                own, and be the deity I sometimes feel.
                                (Pt5Ch6)</blockquote> This passage is the true climax of
                            the novel not simply because it reflects most intensely the
                            violent ambivalence in the hero&#8217;s mind about himself
                            and his situation, although it certainly does that. The
                            opening confession of a long felt need for erotic
                            fulfillment quickly gives way to an expression of social
                            alienation and failure which is then immediately followed by
                            a declaration of his talent and uniqueness. But this too is
                            an unstable mood quickly dissipated by the remembrance of
                            the racial stigma under which he lives with a sense of
                            degrading captivity. The frustration engendered by this
                            thought creates the impulse toward action: &#8220;Give me my
                            father&#8217;s sceptre.&#8221; But the romantic confidence
                            is subverted by the fear of failure implicit in the
                            alternative of dying rather than conquering, and the initial
                            defiance turns to despair at being &#8220;nothing.&#8221;
                            This conviction reflects the social impotence of the Jew so
                            aptly expressed in the metaphor of the captive and the
                            disguise of the eunuch. Thus the disparity between the
                            knowledge of innate superiority and the lack of recognition
                            breeds the final defiance of sublime egotism.<br/>
                            <br/></li>
                        <li>All of this pattern suggests that the fascinating
                            correlation with events in Disraeli&#8217;s social and
                            political career is justified and that <i>Alroy</i> is
                            indeed part of the secret history of his feelings.<sup><a
                                    href="#note2">2</a></sup> The most important point
                            in the analysis of this particular passage, however,
                            concerns Alroy&#8217;s and, by implication, Disraeli&#8217;s
                            motivations. Significantly, the soliloquy occurs after Alroy
                            has found in the beauty of Schirene and the magnificence of
                            the Caliph&#8217;s palace concrete temptations more
                            persuasive than Honain&#8217;s abstractions. The tale at
                            this point embodies both literally and metaphorically the
                            impotence of the hero. Admittedly in the former case it is a
                            matter of disguise, but that fact in itself has thematic
                            significance. Disguise of the hero enters the novel in three
                            places. In the first, on the journey to Bagdad, it is a
                            matter of denying the fact that he is a Jew, which
                            ironically is a fact that would seem to endanger his life,
                            but actually saves him in two separate encounters. The
                            second incident is the visit to Schirene, the significance
                            of which has already been shown. The third action in
                            disguise is also a visit to the Princess, after Alroy has
                            conquered the &#8220;glorious city,&#8221; in which she
                            discovers that Honain&#8217;s slave is in fact a noble and
                            powerful prince. The act of disguise is thus associated with
                            the racial stigma and the impotence of Alroy&#8217;s
                            position at the moment of temptation, and the fantasy
                            structure works toward the revelation of his ideal, truly
                            heroic identity, as formulated in the penultimate paragraph
                            of this passage. The defiant resolutions thus show that this
                            &#8220;true&#8221; identity is for him no longer that of the
                            altruistic mystical messiah and that his deepest wish
                            fulfillment would be a worldly recognition of his personal power.<br/>
                            <br/></li>
                        <li>The remainder of <i>Alroy</i> is a dramatization of the
                            conflict within the hero&#8217;s character as to which
                            identity is the stronger: the Prince of the Captivity on a
                            messianic mission to free his people, or the worldly prince
                            of &#8220;superhuman daring&#8221; in search of an empire
                            and its tribute and willing, if necessary, to adopt the
                            Romantic hubris of making himself a deity. The symbiotic
                            relationship between these identities is, however, the most
                            interesting aspect of that dramatization. When Alroy at the
                            height of his messianic power has completely conquered the
                            Moslem world Lord Honain comes to deliver formally the city
                            of Bagdad into his hands: <blockquote>we must bow to your
                                decree with the humility that recognises superior force.
                                Yet we are not without hope. We cannot forget that it is
                                our good fortune not to be addressing a barbarous
                                chieftain, unable to sympathise with the claims of
                                civilisation, the creations of art, and the finer
                                impulses of humanity. We acknowledge your irresistible
                                power, but we dare to hope everything from a prince
                                whose genius all acknowledge and admire, who has spared
                                some portion of his youth from the cares of government
                                and the pursuits of arms to the ennobling claims of
                                learning, whose morality has been moulded by a pure and
                                sublime faith, and who draws his lineage from a sacred
                                and celebrated race, the unrivalled antiquity of which
                                even the Prophet acknowledges. (Pt7Ch19)</blockquote>
                            This is obviously an exhilarating fantasy for Disraeli as he
                            lived through the frustrations of political defeat in the
                            summer of 1832, for it clearly represents a transformation
                            of the hero&#8217;s most humiliating captivity into a
                            seemingly limitless victory. Interestingly, it blends the
                            purity of the religious role with a worldly recognition. But
                            significantly, although Honain (representing the
                            city&#8217;s inhabitants) has been forced to recognize
                            Alroy&#8217;s position by an overwhelming demonstration of
                            the latter&#8217;s superiority, his words of submission
                            stress the qualities of innate genius which bring forth the
                            admiration for the King&#8217;s nobility, manifested in
                            learning, morality, and the appreciation of the arts of
                            civilization. The sensitive reader can see, however, that
                            the fantasy is not the complete victory it might seem. The
                            concluding references to Alroy&#8217;s &#8220;pure and
                            sublime faith&#8221; and &#8220;sacred and celebrated
                            race&#8221; only serve to show how completely those
                            attributes have come to subserve the glorification of the
                            hero&#8217;s genius. That Disraeli clearly perceives his
                            hero&#8217;s sin of pride is, of course, borne out by the
                            remaining plot.<br/>
                            <br/></li>
                        <li>The marriage of the King and the daughter of the Caliph
                            represents the dramatic climax of the novel. Although his
                            fall from grace has already been prefigured astrologically,
                            Alroy is now at the height of his fortunes, and, as the
                            lovers retire to consummate the marriage, the author
                            intrudes to point the moral: &#8220;Now what a glorious man
                            was David Alroy, lord of the mightiest empire in the world,
                            and wedded to the most beautiful princess, surrounded by a
                            prosperous and obedient people, guarded by invincible
                            armies, one on whom Earth showered all its fortune, and
                            Heaven all its favour; and all by the power of his own
                            genius!&#8221; (231). The abandonment of any pretense at
                            performing Hebrew rituals, the rumor of Alroy&#8217;s
                            attendance at a mosque, his alliance with his former
                            enemies, and, finally, his assumption of the title,
                            &#8220;Caliph,&#8221; and his public display of effete
                            decadence eventually provoke the faithful into a conspiracy
                            against the life of &#8220;this haughty stripling&#8221;
                            (237); Alroy&#8217;s empire is quickly consumed by rebellion
                            and he becomes the captive of his rival. In narrating these
                            events Disraeli&#8217;s chief concern is the portrayal of
                            the hero&#8217;s consciousness of what he has done. Indeed,
                            the conflict between Alroy&#8217;s two symbiotic selves and
                            their respective commitments to his sister, Miriam, and to
                            the Princess Schirene (and all they represent: altruism,
                            innocence, religious and sexual purity versus expediency,
                            hypocrisy, religious betrayal, and self-glorification) is
                            the subject of his thoughts as, alternately despairing and
                            defiant, he awaits his fate in his dungeon cell.
                            Significantly, it is the question of Alroy&#8217;s Jewish
                            faith and race that leads to his ultimate act of defiance.
                            For when Honain reveals the conditions for Alroy&#8217;s
                            release, that he should plead guilty to the charge of having
                            had &#8220;intercourse with the infernal powers,&#8221; that
                            he should confess to having &#8220;won the Caliph&#8217;s
                            daughter by an irresistible spell&#8221; which at last is
                            broken, and that he should deny his &#8220;Divine
                            mission&#8221; in order &#8220;to settle the public
                            mind,&#8221; the captive raises no objections. But when
                            Honain adds the final condition of &#8220;form,&#8221; that
                            he will be expected to &#8220;publicly affect to renounce
                            our faith, and bow before their Prophet,&#8221; Alroy leaps
                            into indignation: &#8220;Get thee behind me, tempter! Never,
                            never, never! . . . I&#8217;ll not yield a jot. Were my doom
                            one everlasting torture, I&#8217;d spurn thy terms! Is this
                            thy high contempt of our poor kind, to outrage my God! to
                            prove myself the vilest of the vile, and baser than the
                            basest?&#8221; (303). The explicit irony, that he has
                            already done this in the service of his own exalted egotism,
                            only serves to prove the complete dichotomy of Alroy&#8217;s
                            sense of his own identity. In the strength of his reemergent
                            purity he can immediately again assert his own glory and
                            resolve to die a hero for Schirene&#8217;s sake (304). But
                            this momentary attempt to join the glorification of his God
                            and the glorification of himself into one destiny cannot
                            succeed; he falls into a trance and is saved from his final
                            temptation by the ghost of the faithful priest, Jabaster. In
                            the denouement Alroy finds consolation in the presence of
                            his pure and holy sister and defies his conqueror&#8217;s
                            threats of torture even as the sword flashes down to behead him.<br/>
                            <br/></li>
                        <li>In some sense the ending of his life is a triumph for Alroy.
                            He dies forgiven by his God for his sin of pride, comforted
                            by his sister, and secure in the belief that he is
                            ultimately true to his real and primary identity. At the
                            same time, however, it is obviously a Pyrrhic victory in
                            that his divine mission to free his people has come to
                            nought, and in that he dies after having completely fallen
                            from the heights of glory. It is not necessary to doubt the
                            hero&#8217;s sincerity of his return to innocence to
                            recognize that it is an escape from the consequences of a
                            personal failure. But it is important to recognize the final
                            act of defiance as an attempt to turn defeat into victory
                            without ever having consciously to admit that defeat.
                            Consequently that defiance, even though supported with a
                            sense of righteous purity, leaves the central conflict
                            between Alroy&#8217;s two senses of his own identity unresolved.<br/>
                            <br/></li>
                        <li>Looking at <i>Alroy</i> as an embodiment of a fantasy
                            structure created by Disraeli, it is reasonable to conclude
                            that the author felt within himself the need both to deny
                            and to affirm his Jewishness, and by implication, the
                            innocence and purity that characterize his hero. The many
                            striking parallels between the author and his
                            hero&#8212;between Disraeli&#8217;s desire to liberate the
                            Conservative Party and Alroy&#8217;s desire to liberate his
                            people, between Disraeli&#8217;s recognition that hypocrisy
                            is a necessary ingredient of worldly success and
                            Alroy&#8217;s betrayal of his faith, between
                            Disraeli&#8217;s confidential attachment to his sister,
                            Sarah, and Alroy&#8217;s reliance upon Miriam&#8217;s
                            recognition of his purest self, and finally between
                            Disraeli&#8217;s defiant response to political defeat and
                            Alroy&#8217;s defiant mockery of his conqueror&#8212;all
                            suggest that Disraeli did indeed feel in his own early
                            career similar tensions to those he attributes to his hero
                            and that his struggle for &#8220;purity&#8221; in the
                            context of personal distinction remained an unresolved issue
                            in 1832. Clearly, though, Disraeli&#8217;s fictions do not
                            simply serve as an escape through fantasy from the
                            unpleasant social and political realities of his early
                            career. <i>Alroy</i>, for example, is a medium for exploring
                            imaginatively the ambivalence Disraeli felt about both of
                            his senses of himself and an imaginative assessment of the
                            costs of choosing either of those identities. But,
                            nevertheless, it is a less than satisfactory fantasy because
                            in its attempt to accommodate the conflicting goals of
                            purity and success within the characterization of a less
                            than perfect hero, it cannot permit a complete wish
                            fulfillment and remain honest. The unsatisfactory conclusion
                            of the fantasy did, however, provide Disraeli with the
                            impetus to return in subsequent novels to the subject of his
                            ambivalence about his racial heritage in the disguised form
                            of his heroes&#8217; concern with Catholicism.<sup><a
