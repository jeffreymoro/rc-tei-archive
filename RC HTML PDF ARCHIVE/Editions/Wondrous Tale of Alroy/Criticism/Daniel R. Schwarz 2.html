                        <li><i>Alroy</i> is Disraeli's ultimate heroic fantasy. He uses
                            the figure of the twelfth-century Jewish prince Alroy as the
                            basis for a tale of Jewish conquest and empire. Disraeli
                            found the medieval world in which Alroy lived an apt model
                            for some of his own values. He saw in that world an emphasis
                            on imagination, emotion and tradition; respect for political
                            and social hierarchies; and a vital spiritual life. Alroy
                            anticipates Disraeli's attraction for the Middle Ages in
                            Young England. Writing of the flowering of medieval Jewry
                            under Alroy enabled him to express his opposition to
                            rationalism and utilitarianism. In fact, the
                            &#8216;historic&#8217; Alroy was a self-appointed messiah in
                            twelfth-century Kurdistan who asserted mythical and magic
                            powers and who was finally executed and disgraced.<br/>
                            <br/></li>
                        <li>Since completing <i>Vivian Grey</i>, Disraeli had been
                            fascinated by Alroy, the Jew who had achieved power and
                            prominence during Jewish captivity. But perhaps he needed
                            the inspiration of his 1830 trip to Jerusalem to finish
                                <i>Alroy</i>. On a journey with William Meredith that
                            lasted almost 15 months, Disraeli visited Gibraltar, Malta,
                            Corfu, Constantinople, Cairo, Alexandria and Jerusalem, a
                            city that was to be vital to his definition of his spiritual
                            identity as a Jewish hero possessing a particular spiritual
                            insight. At his several stops, his behaviour and dress were
                            flamboyant, a studied effort to impress his various hosts
                            with his energy, wit and confidence; the experience was to
                            stand him in good stead later on in his political career,
                            for as Blake puts it, 'the world will take a man at his
                                    own.&#8217;<sup><a
                                    href="#note1"
                                    >1</a></sup> In Greece he thought of himself as an
                            heir to Odysseus: 'Five years of my life have been already
                            wasted and sometimes I think my pilgrimage may be as long as
                            that of Ulysses.'<sup><a
                                    href="#note2"
                                    >2</a></sup> His tone also reveals a kind of
                            Romantic listlessness that sometimes interrupts the
                            hyperactive mood of his letters from his Grand Tour.<br/>
                            <br/></li>
                        <li>Disraeli wrote in the preface to <i>The Revolutionary
                                Epick</i> (1834) that the purpose of <i>Alroy</i> was
                            'the celebration of a gorgeous incident in the annals of
                            that sacred and romantic people from whom I derive my blood
                            and name'.<sup><a
                                    href="#note3"
                                    >3</a></sup> Undoubtedly the tale of a Jew becoming
                            the most powerful man in an alien land appealed to Disraeli,
                            who at the age of 29 had still to make his political mark or
                            artistic reputation. Indeed, David Alroy's first name evokes
                            visions of the David and Goliath legend, which embodies
                            another victory for a Jewish underdog. Disraeli uses the
                            factual Alroy as a basis for his romance, but extends
                            Alroy's power and prowess and introduces supernatural
                            machinery and ersatz kabbalistic lore and ritual.<br/>
                            <br/></li>
                        <li>The fictional editor's notes, interweaving personal
                            recollections of the East with abstruse knowledge of Jewish
                            lore, mediate between the text and the audience.
                                <i>Alroy</i> fuses the myths of the Chosen People, of
                            return to the homeland and of the long-awaited messiah. As
                            is appropriate in Judaic tradition, Alroy turns out to be a
                            heroic man, but not without human limitations. His demise
                            may be Disraeli's unconscious affirmation of the Jewish
                            belief that the Messiah has not yet come to redeem mankind.
                            When Jabaster, a wisdom figure who anticipates Sidonia,
                            rebukes him for not following his mission ('you may be King
                            of Bagdad, but you cannot, at the same time, be a Jew'), a
                            spirit shrieks, 'MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN', the words
                            upon the wall that Daniel interprets to mean that God had
                            weighed Belshazzar and his kingdom and found them
                                    wanting.<sup><a
                                    href="#note4"
                                    >4</a></sup> Significantly, Alroy regains the Jewish
                            title Prince of Captivity after he is overthrown as Caliph.
                            In his final suffering and humility, he has achieved the
                            stature that the Jewish exiled prince, Disraeli's metaphor
                            for himself, deserves.<br/>
                            <br/></li>
                        <li><i>The Wondrous Tale of Alroy</i> indicates Disraeli's
                            commitment to his Jewish background. <i>Alroy</i> represents
                            Disraeli's own dreams of personal heroism and political
                            power in the alien British culture. Alroy embodies not only
                            his concept of himself as a potential leader, but his notion
                            that the nation requires strong, visionary leaders who are
                            true to its traditional manners and customs.<br/>
                            <br/></li>
                        <li>Disraeli wanted to establish the authenticity of his
                            wondrous tale. For that reason he created as his
                            editor-speaker a Jewish historian and scholar&#8212;the kind
                            of bibliophile his father Isaac was. But he must have known
                            that very few readers would discover that he had taken
                            liberties with the Alroy legend and really knew only
                            scattered bits and snips of kabbalah. One wonders whether
                            the notes are in part an elaborate joke at the expense of
                            readers apt to take the editor and themselves too seriously
                            and accept as serious scholarship what is often mumbo jumbo.
                            Is there not a note of deadpan humour in the following from
                            the 1845 preface: 'With regard to the supernatural machinery
                            of this romance, it is Cabalistical and correct'?<br/>
                            <br/></li>
                        <li>In <i>Alroy</i>, finally, the Jewish desire for a messiah is
                            not fulfilled, but Alroy has significance for others, and
                            particularly other Jews, as an historical figure. His sister
                            Miriam&#8217;s epitaph suggests Carlyle's notion of the
                            value of an heroic figure: 'Great deeds are great legacies,
                            and work with wondrous usury. By what Man has done, we learn
                            what Man can do; and gauge the power and prospects of our
                            race. . . . The memory of great actions never dies.'<sup><a
                                    href="#note5"
                                    >5</a></sup> Disraeli the imaginative poet is the
                            heir to Alroy the imaginative man. Perhaps, by telling his
                            story of the Jew who rose to prominence in a foreign land,
                            it became more plausible to imagine himself as a political
                            leader. But if Alroy is an objectification of Disraeli's
                            ambition, does he not also reflect Disraeli's anxieties and
                            doubts, specifically his fear of his own sensual weakness
                            and a certain paranoia about betrayal? Perhaps he wondered
                            whether, like Alroy, he would be found somewhat wanting when
                            his opportunity came.<br/>
                            <br/></li>
                        <li>Yet <i>Alroy</i> indicated Disraeli's commitment to his
                            Jewish origins. His surrogate, the narrator, glories in the
                            Jewish victories and in the triumph of the Prince of
                            Captivity over his oppressors and regrets his fall due to
                            pride and worldliness. Disraeli's notes, which are a
                            fundamental part of reading <i>Alroy</i>, show not only his
                            knowledge of Jewish customs, but his wide reading in matters
                            Jewish. They are there not only to demonstrate to both
                                <i>himself</i> and his readers that he has the
                            intellectual and racial credentials to narrate Jewish
                            history and legend, but they give us the perspective of a
                            Jewish scholar who is trying to provide an authoritative
                            edition of the Alroy legend.<br/>
                            <br/></li>
                        <li>Like Oscar Wilde, another flamboyant outsider, Disraeli used
                            his literary creations as masks to disguise his wounded
                            sensibilities and as devices to objectify aspects of himself
                            that society would not tolerate. In his fiction, he freed
                            himself from conventions and traditions, from priggishness
                            and condescension, and found room for his fantasies. He
                            discovered an alternative to the turmoil of his personal
                            life in the act of creating the imagined worlds of his
                            novels. But Disraeli's early novels are more than the
                            creations of an egoistic, ambitious but frustrated young man
                            who found a temporary outlet for his imagination in the
                            fictions he created. For the roles one imagines are as
                            indicative of one's real self as supposedly 'sincere'
                            moments, intense personal relationships or daily routines.
                            In the early novels the title character and the narrator
                            represent the two sides of Disraeli. While the title
                            character embodies Byronic fantasies of passionate love,
                            heroism and rebellion against society's values, the narrator
                            judges him according to standards that represent traditional
                            values and the community's interest. In the first four books
                            of <i>Vivian Grey</i> and in <i>The Young Duke</i>, the
                            narrator represents the political and social health of
                            England; in <i>Alroy</i> the narrator speaks for the
                            interests of the Jews even after Alroy has betrayed them. In
                                <i>Contarini</i> and in the later books of <i>Vivian
                                Grey</i>, Disraeli speaks for a commitment to public
                            life based on ideals rather than cynical self-interest.<br/>
                            <br/></li>
                        <li>Disraeli's first four novels mime his psyche. His emotions,
                            fantasies, aspirations and anxieties become fictional names,
                            personalities and actions. These novels are moral parables
                            told by himself for himself about ambitious egoists. He
                            dramatises the political rise and setback of an unscrupulous
                            young man; the moral malaise and subsequent enlightenment of
                            a young English duke; the flamboyant career of a young count
                            who is torn between politics and poetry as well as between
                            feeling and intellect; and finally the biography of Alroy, a
                            Jewish prince who conquers much of Asia only to lose his
                            kingdom and his life as he compromises his principles.<br/>
                            <br/></li>
                        <li>Disraeli uses his early novels, in particular <i>Alroy</i>
                            and <i>Contarini</i>, as a means of controlling himself, of
                            understanding himself and of exorcising flamboyant postures
                            and forbidden emotions. For example, Alroy reflects
                            Disraeli's fantasies of conquest and his will to power. In
                            his early novels, the distinction between external events
                            and the interior visions of the title character is blurred.
                            The reason is that both are reflections of the author's
                            subjective life and both are dramatisations of his evolving
                            imagination. In <i>Alroy</i>, both the divine machinery and
                            the title character's adventures are metaphorical vehicles
                            for Disraeli's attitudes and states of mind, and have as
                            little to do with the phenomenal world as do William
                            Blake&#8217;s prophecies.<br/>

                        <li>Disraeli's career as artist and politician should be seen in
                            the context of the Romantic movement. His imaginative use of
                            travel followed in the footsteps of the Romantics,
                            especially Byron, who regarded the continent, and in
                            particular Italy and Greece, as exotic, passionate,
                            impulsive and liberated from sexual restraints. As Harold
                            Fisch has remarked, <blockquote>Insofar as his novels are
                                the expression of his personal life, his feelings, his
                                scarcely avowed hidden ideals, he achieves an
                                appropriately resonant statement. His novels have the
                                subtle egoism of all true romantics, of Shelley, of
                                Wordsworth, of Milton. His subject is himself: he is
                                Coningsby; he is Contarini Fleming; he is Alroy; he is
                                Tancred; and he is the Wandering Jew, Sidonia. From
                                these varied characters we are able to reconstruct the
                                inner vision of Disraeli, the rich landscape of his
                                dreams, his irrepressible vision of grandeur, of power,
                                but power used for glorious and elevating ends . . .
                                Disraeli is certainly an egoist, but if that means that
                                he is impelled by a sense of personal dedication, of
                                election, of being favoured and gifted to an almost
                                unlimited degree, and of being charged with grand tasks
                                and opportunities, then it is the sort of egoism which
                                finds its parallel in the lives of the great romantic
                                poets and dreamers, of Milton, Wordsworth and
                                      Shelley.<sup><a

                                      >6</a></sup></blockquote> In the early novels, he
                            could be the Romantic figure that so tantalised his
                            imagination without sacrificing the public image that he
                            wished to cultivate. To be sure, he might dress
                            unconventionally and play the dandy, but that kind of
                            socially sanctioned rebelliousness was different in kind
                            rather than degree from the imagined social outlawry of
                            Vivian Grey, Alroy and Contarini.<br/>

                        <li><i>Contarini Fleming</i> and <i>Alroy</i> are meant as
                            visions rather than restatements of known truths. Disraeli
                            tries to extend into prose the fusion of politics and
                            philosophy&#8212;as well as the range and imaginative
                            energy&#8212;of the Miltonic epic and Romantic masterworks
                            such as Blake's prophecies, <i>The Prelude</i>,
                                <i>Prometheus Unbound</i> and <i>Don Juan</i>. While
                            Disraeli's works at times seem bathetic when viewed in the
                            context of this tradition, there can be no doubt that he saw
                            himself in the line of Romantic visionaries as described by
                            M. H. Abrams: <blockquote>The Romantics, then, often spoke
                                confidently as elected members of what Harold Bloom
                                calls 'The Visionary Company&#8217;, the inspired line
                                of singers from the prophets of the Old and New
                                Testament, through Dante, Spenser, and above all Milton
                                . . . whatever the form, the Romantic Bard is one
                                &#8216;who present, past and future sees&#8217;; so that
                                in dealing with current affairs his procedure is often
                                panoramic, his stage cosmic, his agents
                                quasi-mythological, and the logic of events apocalyptic.
                                Typically this mode of Romantic vision fuses history,
                                politics, philosophy and religion into one grand design,
                                by asserting Providence&#8212;or some form of natural
                                teleology&#8212;to operate in seeming chaos of human
                                history so as to effect from present evil a greater
                                      good.<sup><a
