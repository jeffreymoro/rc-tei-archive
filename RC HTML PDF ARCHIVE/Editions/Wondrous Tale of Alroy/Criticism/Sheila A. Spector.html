                                        their Muslim oppressors. In creating what he called a

                                        of Jewish rites and ceremonies, including an elaborate
                                        overlay of kabbalistic machinery that, despite his assertion
                                        to the contrary, does not particularly reflect the mystical
                                        practices of the Jews, thus provoking the critical response
                                        to his only Jewish novel. Yet, to measure what the author

                                        to a narrowly defined Jewish context. Rather, as a

                                        viewed as a Christian apologetic, a fictionalized defense of
                                        Disraeli&#8217;s own apostasy.<br/>

                                    <li>Psychologically, converts have frequently felt constrained
                                        to justify in writing their reasons for abandoning Judaism.
                                        Although, in contrast to Disraeli&#8217;s, their literary
                                        works are usually hostile, for the most part they serve two
                                        purposes. First, given the political realities of the
                                        diaspora, the apologetics are used to ingratiate converts
                                        with their new co-religionists, often by revealing to the
                                        public Jewish &#8220;secrets&#8221; that eventually would be
                                        turned against the Jewish populace. Second, these treatises
                                        serve an evangelical purpose. Possibly to rationalize their
                                        own choice, possibly to please their new spiritual advisors,
                                        apostates often feel compelled to persuade others to join
                                        them in their move from one faith to the other. As a result,
                                        some of the most virulent forms of anti-Semitism have
                                        emanated from those who experienced for themselves the
                                        effects of such religious discrimination.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>Such was not the case with Disraeli. Having been baptized at
                                        the age of twelve, by parents who themselves remained
                                        Jewish, Disraeli was technically part of both worlds, and
                                        consequently, felt he belonged in neither. While there is no
                                        evidence that his Anglican faith was anything other than
                                        sincere, he still retained an ethnic connection with what he
                                        called the Jewish race, believing that &#8220;Christianity
                                        is Judaism for the multitude.&#8221;<sup><a

                                        conversion, which gained him access to the political career
                                        he was about to embark upon when he published <i>The
                                            Wondrous Tale of Alroy</i> in 1833, would likely
                                        generate accusations of opportunism, that he had abandoned
                                        his faith for the sake of secular success. However, as the
                                        son of a second-generation Englishman with Mendelssohnian
                                        sympathies, Disraeli was historically a man out of his time.
                                        Internally, a separatist reformed synagogue would not be
                                        organized until 1840, while externally, English Jews would
                                        not gain full emancipation until 1871, when they would be
                                        permitted to take degrees at Oxford and Cambridge.<sup><a

                                        was persuaded in 1817, it would be best to have his children baptized.<br/>

                                    <li>In contrast to its Continental counterparts, the
                                        Anglo-Jewish community was slow to institute the kinds of

                                        disabilities until, in 1858, Baron Lionel de Rothschild
                                        could take his seat in Parliament, and in 1871, the
                                        Universities Tests Act would be passed. Existing in an
                                        amorphous state in which they were neither granted full
                                        privileges of citizenship nor forced to suffer the extreme
                                        hardships of anti-Semitism, English Jewry was bifurcated
                                        into two completely different groups. The older Sephardic
                                        community, some of whose members had been in England for
                                        centuries, had assimilated to the extent that they could,
                                        their knowledge of the modern European languages providing
                                        access to the intellectual world of post-Enlightenment
                                        England; yet, because of public prejudice and civil
                                        disabilities, they were still looked down upon as Jews.
                                        Basically, they had the sensibilities of Reformed Jews,
                                        though without any internal institutional support. In
                                        contrast, the newer Ashkenazic community, which for the most
                                        part lacked the educational background and linguistic
                                        facility of the Sephardim, required the security of a
                                        traditional synagogal hierarchy, maintained through a strict
                                        adherence to biblical rites and customs. Hence Isaac
                                        D&#8217;Israeli&#8217;s dilemma. While neither he nor his
                                        father believed in the tenets of rabbinic Judaism, both felt
                                        an emotional tie to their heritage, maintaining membership
                                        in the London Congregation of Spanish and Portuguese Jews.
                                        Yet, after his own father&#8217;s death, when embroiled in a
                                        controversy with the Wardens at the Bevis Marks Synagogue,
                                        Isaac formally broke with a community whose theology had
                                        always conflicted with his own.<sup><a

                                        Anglo-Jewry, Isaac seems never to have come to terms with
                                        his decision to have his children baptized, publishing
                                        anonymously <i>The Genius of Judaism</i> in 1833, the same
                                        year Benjamin published <i>Alroy</i>. For his part, Benjamin
                                        seems to have accepted the necessity of his conversion, in
                                            <i>The Wondrous Tale of Alroy</i> satirizing a panorama

                                        diaspora, suggesting that as an &#8220;ideal

                                        the vehicle for displacing contemporary criticism onto a
                                        neutral culture. Within that context, Alroy, as the scion of
                                        the House of David, attempts to accommodate his personal
                                        desires with his social obligations, all within the
                                        exigencies of the real world. To that end, in the first half
                                        of the novel, he interacts with all of the disparate types
                                        found in a traditional Jewish community, including the
                                        secular leader, the virtuous woman, the rabbi, the
                                        kabbalist, the prophetess, and the <i>marrano</i>, or
                                        crypto-Jew, so that in the second half, he can try to
                                        consolidate their ultimately contradictory attitudes toward
                                        Judaism into a viable theocracy. As is to be expected, he
                                        will fail. However, Alroy&#8217;s experience provides
                                        Disraeli with what was apparently the necessary
                                        rationalization for his apostasy. Yet, in contrast to more
                                        conventional apologetics, he does not evangelize his Jewish
                                        readers but, instead, he seems to suggest that internal
                                        reform&#8212;along with civil emancipation&#8212;might help
                                        others avoid being forced to make the choice he and his
                                        father had to confront.<br/>

                                    <li>Providing the context for the action are the male and female
                                        symbols of stability within the Jewish social structure: the
                                        lay leader, and the virtuous woman, that is, the secular
                                        head of the community and the female head of the household.
                                        Because, historically, Jews had been ghettoized into their
                                        own communities, they established their own internal
                                        political structure, a leader being required both to
                                        maintain order among the Jews and to intercede among the
                                        Christians of the larger community. By identifying Bostenay
                                        as the &#8220;exilarch&#8221; of his novel, Disraeli
                                        associates the action with the entire history of the Jewish
                                        diaspora, the title <i>Resh Galuta</i>, as an exilarch with
                                        hereditary ties to the House of David, dating back to the
                                        Second Temple era.<sup><a

                                                >11</a></sup> Consequently, Bostenay&#8217;s
                                        official functions, including the protection of orphans like
                                        David and his sister Miriam, and the payment of tribute to
                                        the Turkish overlords, are historically authentic,
                                        reflecting the exilarch&#8217;s primary duties; but they
                                        also project the obligations to be imposed on their later
                                        Western manifestation, the <i>parnas</i>, who, like the
                                        official of the Bevis Marks Synagogue, imposed a fine on
                                        Isaac D&#8217;Israeli for refusing to serve as warden.
                                        Significantly, by naming his character Bostenay (or
                                        Bustenai), the name of the first exilarch, Disraeli not only
                                        associates the secular head of the community with the full
                                        history of Jewish exile, but more specifically, introduces
                                        the concept of inter-marriage, Bustenai supposedly having
                                        been married to the Persian emperor&#8217;s daughter.
                                        Applying the corrective of historical reality, Disraeli uses
                                        the actual Bustenai&#8217;s inter-marriage to undermine the
                                        pretext used by the fictional Jabaster and Esther for
                                        plotting against Alroy at the climax of the novel, implying
                                        that the former was actually more interested in restoring
                                        the biblical cult, and the latter in avenging a perceived
                                        sexual rejection. Within the novel, Bostenay is not really
                                        part of the action per se, but represents the Jewish
                                        community at large, literally interceding on its behalf,
                                        symbolically living at the mercy of external forces over
                                        which he has no control. In periods of prosperity, the
                                        exilarch lived like a prince, though when the novel opens,
                                        Bostenay undergoes the indignity of paying tribute to the
                                        Turks. When the nephew triumphs, his uncle prospers; at
                                        Alroy&#8217;s death, Bostenay is again degraded to the level
                                        of servant.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>As Alroy&#8217;s female counterpart, his sister Miriam is
                                        the virtuous Jewish woman whose piety and valor are
                                        celebrated in folklore. In the beginning of the novel, she
                                        provides the impetus for the action, Alschiroch&#8217;s
                                        attack symbolizing the eternal condition of the Jew in
                                        exile, being vulnerable to some form of rape by the
                                        sultan&#8217;s brother. In defending Miriam, Alroy assumes
                                        his obligations as messiah-king; his ensuing exile to the
                                        wilderness, like Moses&#8217; before him, initiates the
                                        process of revelation as he accepts his larger obligations
                                        to his people. Symbolically, Miriam, as the archetypal
                                        Jewish woman, embodies the historical goal of Jewish
                                        messianism, to restore the Jewish nation. Consequently, she
                                        must die when Alroy is executed: the failure of the movement
                                        signifies the death of the traditional (i.e., pre-Reform)
                                        Jewish community.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>Within the context established by Bostenay and Miriam, the
                                        core of traditional Judaism emerges as the real object of
                                        Disraeli&#8217;s satire. Focusing on what he portrays as a
                                        rigid, irrational rabbinate, trapped by the combination of a
                                        superstitious adherence to archaic rites and customs, and a
                                        preference for revealed, as opposed to natural, religion,
                                        Disraeli implies that traditional Jews are incapable of
                                        adapting to the exigencies of the contemporary world.
                                        Personifying these non-rational Jewish archetypes are Zimri,
                                        the chief rabbi of Jerusalem; Jabaster, the kabbalistic
                                        zealot; and Esther, the prophetess.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>The most extensive satire is directed against the Talmudic
                                        sophistry of an unenlightened rabbinate, as portrayed by
                                        Zimri, Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem, presumably the religious
                                        authority to whom Alroy must prove himself before he can be
                                        anointed the messiah-king. But by locating the rabbinic
                                        examination in medieval Jerusalem, Disraeli conveys the
                                        impotence of an institution supposedly designed to
                                        regenerate the Jewish community. As the embodiment of
                                        rabbinic Judaism, Zimri is physically old, intellectually
                                        constricted, and, consequently, spiritually blind. When they
                                        first meet, Alroy mistakes the &#8220;old man, in shabby
                                        robes, who was passing&#8221; (Pt3Ch2), for a doddering
                                        derelict:

                                        the scene undermines the basic tenets of rabbinic Judaism.
                                        Taking place in a Jerusalem controlled by
                                        &#8220;Franks&#8221; who do not deign to speak to Jews, the
                                        setting provides a constant reminder of the central
                                        contradiction inherent in the messianic myth. Despite the
                                        facts that Jews live in Israel, that remnants of the temple
                                        exist&#8212;&#8220;We have our temple yet,&#8221; as Zimri
                                        boasts&#8212;and that the ancient Jewish rituals are adhered
                                        to, still, the majority of Jews live in exile.
                                        Significantly, the putative intellectual leader of the Jews
                                        is a silly old man who makes no sense, speaking &#8220;flat
                                        talk.&#8221; Even more important, though, the rabbi fails to
                                        recognize the future messiah, telling Alroy, &#8220;You will
                                        never do for Jerusalem.&#8221; Ironically, the rabbi is
                                        right. Alroy will not become the traditional messiah of
                                        rabbinic belief.<br/>

                                    <li>The next chapter satirizes Talmudic learning for being
                                        ahistorical and circular. In the scene, Rabbi Zimri
                                        discusses Talmud with his elder, the 109-year-old Rabbi
                                        Maimon: <blockquote>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;No
                                            one reasons like Abarbanel of Babylon,&#8221; said Rabbi

                                            all,&#8221; said Rabbi Maimon, &#8220;and holds that
                                            they were taken up to heaven.&#8221;<br/>

                                            said Rabbi Maimon.<br/>

                                            we must look for the Tombs of the Kings in the south of

                                            writes is worth attention,&#8221; said Rabbi Zimri.<br/>

                                            subjects,&#8221; continued Maimon, his blear eyes
                                            twinkling with complacency. &#8220;Your guest, Rabbi
                                            Zimri, must read the treatise of the learned Shimei, of

                                            work!&#8221; exclaimed Zimri.<br/>

                                            three nights after reading that work,&#8221; said Rabbi
                                            Maimon.<br/> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;It
                                            contains twelve thousand five hundred and thirty-seven
                                            quotations from the Pentateuch, and not a single
                                            original observation.&#8221;<br/>
                                            &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;There were giants
                                            in those days,&#8221; said Rabbi Zimri; &#8220;we are
                                            children now.&#8221;<br/>
                                            &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;The first chapter
                                            makes equal sense, read backward or forward,&#8221;
                                            continued Rabbi Maimon. (Pt3Ch4)</blockquote> In
                                        addition to mixing up historical names and titles of
                                        treatises, the two rabbis turn basic logic topsy turvy. They
                                        accept contradictory precepts&#8212;&#8220;&#8216;Hillel
                                        proves that there are two Tombs of the Kings,&#8217; said
                                        Rabbi Maimon, &#8216;and that neither of them are the right

                                        laud triteness&#8212;&#8220;and not a single original
                                        observation&#8221;; and basically, they strive for the
                                        irrational: &#8220;The first chapter makes equal sense, read
                                        backward or forward.&#8221;<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>The synagogue scene that follows depicts the moribund nature
                                        of Zimri&#8217;s religion. Located in a dark cemetery, which
                                        they must descend to enter, the synagogue is actually the
                                        inner chamber of a claustrophobic tomb that leaves the
                                        congregants essentially brain dead. After prayers, when
                                        Rabbi Zimri expounds the law, he poses a riddle that none of
                                        the Jerusalem Jews can solve: &#8220;it is written, that he
                                        took a rib from Adam when he was asleep. Is God then a
                                        robber?&#8221; (Pt4Ch2). It takes an outsider, an African
                                        pilgrim, to respond: &#8220;Rabbi, some robbers broke into
                                        my house last night, and stole an earthen pipkin, but they
                                        left a golden vase in its stead&#8221; (Pt4Ch2). The scene
                                        and the solution both reflect the need for new blood in the
                                        congregation, the riddle clearly indicating the need for
                                        change, the earthen pipkin symbolizing the old, moribund
                                        tradition, and the golden vase its evolution into a modern
                                        vessel whose use and beauty far surpass the original object.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>For his part, the African then poses a riddle about a
                                        laughing girl and dreaming boy who marry, which he must
                                        solve himself: <blockquote>&#8220;Now hear the
                                            interpretation,&#8221; said the African. &#8220;The
                                            youth is our people, and the damsel is our lost Sion,
                                            and the tomb of Absalom proves that salvation can only
                                            come from the house of David. Dost then hear this, young
                                            man?&#8221; said the African, coming forward and laying
                                            his hand on Alroy. &#8220;I speak to thee because I have
                                            observed a deep attention in thy conduct.&#8221;
                                            (Pt4Ch2)</blockquote> More than simply the intellectual
                                        limitations of the congregation, the riddle turns back on
                                        the messianic prayers just uttered in the synagogue. Not
                                        only do the congregants not understand that the solution to
                                        the riddle is the basic tenet of their faith, but more
                                        important, they fail to recognize that Alroy is quite
                                        literally the answer to their prayers. Yet, even after the
                                        African compliments Alroy, Zimri keeps talking, preventing
                                        Alroy from accompanying the African out of the synagogue. In
                                        the next chapter, Alroy must leave Jerusalem to find the
                                        Tomb of the Kings, where he will be made messiah.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>Rabbi Zimri is not only ineffectual, but his bumbling idiocy
                                        prevents the achievement of the messianic dream he espouses.
                                        He never recognizes, much less acknowledges, Alroy as
                                        messiah; instead, he buries himself in the ancient lore that
                                        makes equal sense backward and forward. Consequently, Alroy,
                                        in order to complete his obligations to the Jewish
                                        community, must leave both Jerusalem and its chief rabbi,
                                        symbols of a moribund rabbinate that inhibits the evolution
                                        of modern Judaism.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>Unlike his satiric approach to the rabbinate,
                                        Disraeli&#8217;s treatment of revealed religion is far more
                                        complex. Without actually attacking the possibility of
                                        either mysticism or prophecy, he confuses the issue,
                                        portraying Jabaster, the mystical zealot, and Esther, the
                                        prophetess, as fully human beings whose personal ambitions
                                        and drives are so intertwined with their Divine revelations
                                        that it becomes impossible to differentiate between the two.<br/>

                                    <li>Jabaster, Alroy&#8217;s spiritual advisor, embodies the
                                        contradictions inherent in the question of revelation in the
                                        modern world. On the surface, he is depicted like the
                                        archetypal mystical ascetic, a Bar Kokhba living in the
                                        wilderness where he will be free to practice his ritualistic
                                        beliefs. Before the time of the novel, he had been
                                        Alroy&#8217;s teacher who, having recognized early on young
                                        David&#8217;s messianic potential, educated him in the
                                        supernatural lore associated with his Divine mission. At the
                                        beginning of the novel, Jabaster prepares Alroy for the
                                        quest in search of Solomon&#8217;s scepter, providing him
                                        with both the talisman that controls access to the Tomb, and
                                        the ring that will protect him from the Muslims. Then,
                                        immediately after Alroy locates the scepter, he is
                                        transported back to Jabaster&#8217;s cave, from where they
                                        will begin the proto-messiah&#8217;s miraculously successful
                                        campaign against the Turks.<br/>

                                    <li>Interlaced with the mystical signs, however, are indications
                                        of a frustrated man, hoping to fulfill his own ambitions
                                        through the agency of his student. In an early soliloquy,
                                        Jabaster admits that in his own youth, he had attempted to
                                        lead his own crusade, but lacking Divine sanction, he had
                                        failed. Then, during Alroy&#8217;s early messianic wars,
                                        Jabaster&#8217;s Jewish troops falter, requiring the
                                        assistance of Scherirah and his band of multi-cultural
                                        mercenaries. Yet, after their success, Jabaster attempts to
                                        persuade Alroy to impose a rigid theocracy on the empire,
                                        permits his own troops to desecrate Muslim holy places, and
                                        resists Alroy&#8217;s wish to include on the council
                                        representatives of all of the empire&#8217;s disparate
                                        peoples. Then, when Alroy marries Schirene and chooses
                                        Bagdad over Jerusalem, Jabaster plots against the putative
                                        messiah, intending himself to slay the scion of the House of David.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>The point is less Jabaster&#8217;s human weaknesses than the
                                        ambiguity of the situation as a whole. Because the
                                        supernatural and purely human are so thoroughly mixed in
                                        Jabaster, it is impossible to know which of his demands are
                                        Divinely sanctioned, and which result from his own
                                        prejudices. Obviously, from an orthodox perspective,
                                        Alroy&#8217;s inter-marriage could be interpreted as
                                        anathema, some biblical antecedents, such as Samson and
                                        Solomon, providing evidence of a religious prohibition.
                                        Similarly, the choice of Bagdad over Jerusalem could also be
                                        interpreted as the kind of violation that resulted in the
                                        diaspora. Yet, Jabaster&#8217;s troops would have died like
                                        the Zealots of Masada had Scherirah not saved them; and as
                                        the extensive scene with Rabbi Zimri suggests, any attempt
                                        to restore the biblical cult in the Jerusalem of the twelfth
                                        century (itself modeled after the Jerusalem of the
                                        nineteenth century that Disraeli visited while writing the
                                        novel) would have been absurd. Most significant, though,
                                        Jabaster&#8217;s messianic ideology caused him to violate
                                        its most basic tenet&#8212;he was actually prepared to kill
                                        the messiah-king, thus privileging his own supposed
                                        revelation, which had already been proven unreliable, over
                                        that of the man who had been given Solomon&#8217;s scepter.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>Like Jabaster, Esther the prophetess embodies the same
                                        confusing mixture of Divine revelation and human desire, her
                                        prophecies directly paralleling her emotional state. That
                                        is, as long as she felt that she might have a chance with
                                        Alroy, her interpretations of his mission were positive.
                                        When first introduced in Part VII, she is overcome with her
                                        vision of the messiah&#8217;s imminent success, as
                                        &#8220;foaming and panting, she rushed to Alroy, threw
                                        herself upon the ground, embraced his feet, and wiped off
                                        the dust from his sandals with her hair&#8221; (104). But
                                        once he announces his engagement to Schirene, Esther&#8217;s
                                        prophecies grow increasingly more antagonistic; she endorses
                                        the plot against Alroy and the plan to murder Honain; and
                                        finally, she attempts to assassinate Alroy herself. As she
                                        says, &#8220;An irresistible impulse hath carried me into
                                        this chamber! . . . The light haunted me like a spectre; and
                                        wheresoever I moved, it seemed to summon me&#8221;
                                        (Pt7Ch14). While the subconscious wish-fulfillment seems
                                        obvious, Disraeli leaves open the question of Esther&#8217;s
                                        visionary prowess. After all, Alroy&#8217;s decisions to
                                        marry Schirene and turn to Bagdad do cause Jabaster to set
                                        in motion the dastardly plot. Consequently, even though the
                                        prophecy does come true, we do not know whether it is a
                                        coincidence caused by human machinations, part of Divine
                                        providence, or possibly even both.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>Just as Disraeli questions the validity of the mystic and
                                        prophet, he similarly undermines the integrity of the
                                            <i>marrano</i>, historically the crypto-Jew who
                                        pretended to convert to Christianity in order to escape
                                        punishment by the Inquisition. Although Disraeli would later
                                        romanticize the <i>marrano</i>, even going so far as to
                                        create for himself a pseudo-genealogy in which he claimed to
                                        have been descended from crypto-Jews, in <i>Alroy</i>, he
                                        portrays the anachronistic <i>moranno</i>, Honain, as a
                                        hypocrite, no better than the self-serving pragmatic
                                        utilitarian of nineteenth-century England.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>In his first appearance, Honain projects the impression of a
                                            <i>marrano</i> who chose to go underground because even
                                        though the contemporary Jewish community could not fulfill
                                        his intellectual needs, he still wished to retain ties with
                                        his people, possibly even to help them from the outside. He
                                        first enters when Alroy is embroiled with a merchant in an
                                        argument about the ownership of Jabaster&#8217;s ring. In
                                        sharp contrast to Alroy who, as a Jew, had been vilified by
                                        all who saw him, Honain conveys the impression of an urbane,
                                        cosmopolitan, international intellectual, eliciting the
                                        respect of everyone present. Immediately recognizing the
                                        ring as the token he had given his brother, Honain knows
                                        that Alroy is Jewish and, through a Solomonic judgment,
                                        retrieves the ring and saves its bearer, whom he brings to
                                        his home. But once they are in private, Honain reveals his
                                        hypocrisy: <blockquote>&#8220;Listen to me, Alroy,&#8221;
                                            said Honain in a low voice, and he placed his arm around
                                            him, &#8220;I am your friend. Our acquaintance is very
                                            brief: no matter, I love you; I rescued you in injury, I
                                            tended you in sickness, even now your life is in my
                                            power, I would protect it with my own. You cannot doubt
                                            me. Our affections are not under our own control; and
                                            mine are yours. The sympathy between us is entire. You
                                            see me, you see what I am; a Hebrew, though unknown; one
                                            of that despised, rejected, persecuted people, of whom
                                            you are the chief. I too would be free and honoured.
                                            Freedom and honour are mine, but I was my own messiah. I
                                            quitted in good time our desperate cause, but I gave it
                                            a trial. Ask Jabaster how I fought. Youth could be my
                                            only excuse for such indiscretion. I left this country;
                                            I studied and resided among the Greeks. I returned from
                                            Constantinople, with all their learning, some of their
                                            craft. No one knew me. I assumed their turban, and I am,
                                            the Lord Honain. Take my experience, child, and save
                                            yourself much sorrow. Turn your late adventure to good
                                            account. No one can recognise you here. I will introduce
                                            you amongst the highest as my child by some fair Greek.
                                            The world is before you. You may fight, you may love,
                                            you may revel. War, and women, and luxury are all at
                                            your command. With your person and talents you may be
                                            grand vizir. Clear your head of nonsense. In the present
                                            disordered state of the empire, you may even carve
                                            yourself out a kingdom, infinitely more delightful than
                                            the barren land of milk and honey. I have seen it,
                                            child; a rocky wilderness, where I would not let my
                                            courser graze.&#8221; (Pt1Ch2)</blockquote> Devoid of
                                        principles, Honain has become the deaf-mute eunuch he has
                                        Alroy pretend to be. He lies, panders, and even kills his
                                        own brother, all for the sake of power and wealth. Motivated
                                        strictly by self-interest, Honain manipulates Alroy, during
                                        the period of Jewish ascendancy, into replacing Jabaster
                                        with him as chief advisor. But after the Turks begin to
                                        rally, he negotiates Alroy&#8217;s capture, to the last
                                        minute trying to persuade Alroy to accept Islam, not out of
                                        any religious conviction, but to curry favor with Alp
                                        Arslan. Contrary to the more usual Jewish interpretation,
                                        Disraeli portrays the <i>marrano</i> as being far worse than
                                        the convert, who at least retains some semblance of
                                        religious principle.<br/>
                                        <br/></li>
                                    <li>Within this context, Alroy emerges as a Romantic hero doomed
                                        to failure. Descended from David, he accepts his obligation
                                        to lead the messianic wars, though once he triumphs, there
                                        is no way to establish himself as a messiah-king over a
                                        Jewish nation that can reclaim Jerusalem, rebuild the Temple
                                        and restore the biblical cult. Rather, the rabbinate, as
                                        represented by Rabbi Zimri, is moribund. The conquest of
                                        Jerusalem would require another war, this one against the
                                        Western Europeans, and given Jabaster&#8217;s military
                                        inadequacies in the crusade against the Turks, not to
                                        mention his subsequent discrimination against Muslims, there
                                        is no reason to believe that his forces alone would triumph
                                        against all of the non-Jews in Palestine. Finally, even if
                                        Alroy did regain Jerusalem, he still would not be certain
                                        which elements of the newly revealed religion reflected
                                        Divine Will, and which were projections of human
                                        wish-fulfillment. The only other alternative open to him,
                                        the push toward Bagdad, is motivated by the utilitarian
                                        self-interest of the morally vacuous Honain, whose lack of
                                        principles could guarantee only the survival of the slyest.<br/>

                                    <li>Unavailable to Alroy&#8212;and to Disraeli&#8212;were the
                                        prerequisites for Reform Judaism, an evolved theology
                                        adapted to the exigencies of the contemporary world.
                                        Internally, the leaders of both the fictional Jewish
                                        community of twelfth-century Asia, and the historical
                                        community of early nineteenth-century England, adhered to
                                        tradition and opposed change, both religious establishments
                                        preventing the Jews from substituting newer forms of worship
                                        for what some considered to be archaic rites and ceremonies.
                                        Externally, constitutional restrictions against religious
                                        freedom forced the Jews to choose between the possibility of
                                        worshiping as they chose or participating in the secular
                                        world. Consequently, modern-thinking Jews who had been
                                        exposed to post-Enlightenment learning had no viable
                                        options. Unable to practice Judaism in the way he saw fit,
                                        the ideal hero, David Alroy, chose death. In contrast,
                                        Benjamin Disraeli, the real man living in the real world,
                                        accepted the necessity of conversion, working from the
                                        outside to remove the last disabilities against the Jews in
                                        Victorian England.<sup><a

Published in 1833, <i>The Wondrous Tale of Alroy</i>, as it was originally entitled, was intended primarily for a Christian audience, its anti-theocratic, anti-utilitarian theme anticipating the contemporary debate about dis-establishing the constitutional relationship between the Church of England and Great Britain. By the twentieth century, however, the focus had shifted, the Jewish content of the novel having taken precedence over its Christian theme. In &#8220;A Masterpiece for the Week: Disraeli&#8217;s &#8216;Alroy,&#8217;&#8221; (<i>The Jewish World</i>, No. 3005 [11 Tamuz 5673/16 July 1913], 9-10), Israel Abrahams explicitly associates <i>Alroy</i> with the Anglo-Jewish community, and now, as can be seen from John Vincent&#8217;s assertion that &#8220;<i>Alroy</i> is important because of its Jewishness&#8221; (<i>Disraeli</i> [Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1990], 68), the Christian significance has been effectively erased. The title of this chapter derives from a passage quoted in Disraeli&#8217;s earliest biography: &#8220;In Vivian Grey I have portrayed my active and real ambition; in Alroy my ideal ambition&#8221; (William Flavelle Monypenny and George Earle Buckle, <i>The Life of Benjamin Disraeli Earl of Beaconsfield</i>, 6 vols. [London: Murray, 1910-20] 1:185). As will be seen from this chapter, the word ideal can be subject to much interpretation.</p>

Elkan Nathan Adler [New York: Dover, 1987; reprint of 1930 ed], 50-52). A spurious account, attributed to Maimonides, is included in the <i>Chronologia Sacra-Profana A Mundi Conditu ad Annum M.5352 vel Christi 1592</i>, dicta [Tsema David] of David Ben Solomon Gans (1541-1613), as derived from the <i>Shevet Yehudah</i> (1553) of Solomon ibn Verga (second half of the fifteenth-first quarter of sixteenth century). Despite its lack of authenticity, Disraeli was attracted to this version, a portion of which he included (in Latin) in his last footnote.

Katz notes that as a result of the D&#8217;Israeli incident, the Anglo-Jewish community began instituting some of the changes that would eventually consolidate into a Reform Movement: &#8220;While this is probably wishful thinking along, certainly the Reform Movement went some way towards achieving the ideals expressed by Isaac d&#8217;Israeli.

                                <p class="indent"><sup>11</sup> According to tradition, the exilarch (Resh Galuta), scion of the House of David, was, among other things, guardian of orphans and illegitimate children (H. H. Ben-Sasson, ed., <i>A History of the Jewish People</i> [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1976], 281). If not technically allegorical, most of the names used in the novel are at least evocative of Jewish or Muslim history. In addition to biblical references, like Miriam and Esther, Disraeli incorporates a broad range of Jewish allusions. From the post-biblical period, there are Rabbi Hillel (first century B.C.E. to beginning of the first century C.E.) and Rabbi Shammei, his contemporary (approximately 50 B.C.E. to 30 C.E.). Rabbi Akiva (c. 50-135 C.E.), one of the greatest scholars of his age, is frequently associated with the zealots who, under the leadership of Bar Kokhba (d. 135 C.E.) defended Masada. From later history, Pumbedita is the location of an academy established in the mid-third century. Shimei, of Damascus, supposed author of <i>Effecting Impossibilities</i>, might be a reference to Joseph ben Judah ibn Shim&#8217;on (twelfth-thirteenth centuries), physician, poet, and philosopher. Rabbi Maimon is a possible allusion to the Maimon family&#8212;Maimon ben Joseph (d. 1165/1170) and his son Moses ben Maimon (Maimonides; 1135-1204). Similarly, Disraeli&#8217;s Abarbanel seems based on Abrabanel or Abravanel, the family name of prominent Jews in fifteenth-century Spain who, during the time of the Forced Conversion of 1497, were baptized, but in the seventeenth century, reverted to Judaism and revived the name. Aaron Mendola, of Granada, may be a play on Raphael Meldola (1754-1828), one of the rabbis involved in the dispute between Isaac D&#8217;Israeli and the Jewish community. Not a historical figure, Rabbi Zimri might have derived from either of two biblical figures. The first (Numbers 25) became a symbol of the worst rebellion against God and his Word; the second
                                    Zimri, who reigned as king for only seven days (1 Kings 16), symbolized the slave who turned against his master.<br/>

                                    The other names derive from the Eastern diaspora or from Islamic history. Bostenay seems named after Bustenai ben Haninai (c. 618-670), the first exilarch under Islam, and supposedly married to Izdundad, one of the captive daughters of Chosroes II, king of Persia. Scherirah is possibly based on Sherira ben Hanina Gaon (c. 906-1006), head of the academy at Pumbadita from 968-1006, who believed that the exilarchs all descended from Bustanai, from whom he claimed descent. Honain is a possible allusion either to Hunayn (d. 873), a multi-lingual Syrian who translated a number of Greek scientific works into Arabic, or to Hunayn ibn Ishaq (d. 874), the first physician to translate Greek medical works into Arabic. Alschiroch seems to be an ironic allusion to <u>Sh</u>&#299;rk&#363;h I b. Ayy&#363;b Ab&#363; Sal&#257;h al-Din (Ayy&#363;b&#299;d(e), &#8220;the lion of the mountain&#8221;; c. 1169), uncle of Saladin. Schirene, or Shereen, was the beloved of royal chieftains. Alp Arslan (r. 1063-72) was a Turkish sultan whose dynasty, the Seljuks, reigned from 1038-1157. The only name for which there seems no biblical or historical antecedent is Jabaster, a possible neologism based on the root yavash, &#8220;dry up, make ashamed.&#8221;</p>

As Harold Fisch points out in his essay &#8220;Disraeli&#8217;s Hebraic Compulsions,&#8221; Disraeli never really reconciled the two parts of his identity: &#8220;Here, very accurately stated, is the betrayal of selfhood from which Disraeli suffered&#8212;the betrayal of his innermost Jewish selfhood from which he had partially, but nonetheless effectively, alienated himself. But such betrayals cannot go unnoticed in a man of imagination.
