    <p>THE uproar died away. The shouts of warriors, the shrieks of women, the wild clang of warfare, all were silent. The flames were extinguished, the carnage ceased. The insurrection was suppressed, and order restored. The city, all the houses of which were closed, was patrolled by the conquering troops, and by sunset the conqueror himself, in his hall of state, received the reports and the congratulations of his chieftains. The escape of Abidan seemed counterbalanced by the capture of Jabaster. After performing prodigies of valour, the High Priest had been overpowered, and was now a prisoner in the Serail. The conduct of Scherirah was not too curiously criticised; a commission was appointed to inquire into the mysterious affair, and Alroy retired to the bath<sup><a href="/editions/alroy/novel/autnotes.html#autnote77">77</a></sup> to refresh himself after the fatigues of the victory which he could not consider a triumph.</p>

This form, I fear it has lost its lustre, but still &#8217;tis thine, and once thou saidst thou lovedst it; this form was to have been hacked and mangled; this ivory bosom was to have been ripped up and tortured, and this warm blood, that flows alone for thee, that fell Jabaster was to pour its tide upon the altar of his ancient vengeance.

    <p>&#8216;Stop, stop, Alroy! I pray thee, love, be calm. I came to soothe thee, not to raise thy passions. I did not say Jabaster willed thy death, though Asriel says so; &#8217;tis me he wars against; and if indeed Jabaster be a man so near thy heart, if he indeed be one so necessary to thy prosperity, and cannot live in decent order with thy slave that&#8217;s here, I know my duty, Sir. I would not have thy fortunes marred to save my single heart, although I think &#8217;twill break. I will go, I will die, and deem the hardest accident of life but sheer prosperity if it profit thee.&#8217;</p>
