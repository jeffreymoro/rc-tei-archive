    <p>XI. But the most Famous of all Impostors of the Twelfth Century was <i>David Alroy</i>, or <i>Eldavid</i>.<a href="/editions/alroy/contexts/../novel/ednotes.html#ednote259">*</a> He is commonly placed in the Year 1199 or 1200. But <i>Benjamin</i> of <i>Tudela</i>, who travelled in the year 1173, having mention&#8217;d him as a Man that appear&#8217;d ten Years before, it cannot be doubted but that he was somewhat elder.</p>
    <p>XII. This Impostor was born in a City call&#8217;d <i>Amaria</i>, in which were reckon&#8217;d a thousand Jewish Families that paid Tribute to the King of <i>Persia</i>. He addicted himself at first to the Prince of the Captivity, and to the Head of the Synagogue at <i>Bagdet</i>, who was a famous Man, well versed not only in the Study of the Talmud, but <i>in the knowledge of Magick, so common among the</i> Chaldeans. When he had learn&#8217;d some Secrets, he gain&#8217;d the Jews, the Inhabitants of a Mountain called <i>Haphtan</i>, and excited them to take up Arms, and to that purpose deluded them with the shew of some false Miracles. The King of <i>Persia</i> being inform&#8217;d of this Insurrection, and the Conquests <i>Eldavid</i> made, was afraid of him, and summon&#8217;d him to appear immediately at Court, with a Promise, that if he could prove himself the Messiah, he would submit to him, and acknowledge him to be a King sent from Heaven. <i>Eldavid</i>, contrary to all Expectation, presented himself, and maintain&#8217;d to the King that he was the Messiah. He was put in Prison, and they waited to find him miraculously escap&#8217;d out of it. The thing so happen&#8217;d, as the King was deliberating about the nature of the Punishment to be inflicted on him, news was brought that <i>Eldavid</i> was escap&#8217;d; Couriers were immediately dispatch&#8217;d after him, who related that they had heard his Voice, without seeing him, or being able to take him. The King, who believ&#8217;d that his Guards had been corrupted, march&#8217;d at the Head of his Army as far as the Banks of the River <i>Gozan</i>; there he heard <i>Eldavid</i>&#8217;s Voice, who cried <i>O Fools</i>, but no body could see him: He was perceiv&#8217;d a moment after, dividing with his Cloak the Waters of the River, and passing over it. The Prince&#8217;s Faith was stagger&#8217;d; he was afraid it was the Messiah; but his Officers re&#8217;assur&#8217;d him, by perswading him it
    was all Legerdemain. The Army passed the river without finding the Criminal.</p>
    <p>XIII. The King wrote immediately to all the principal Jews in his Kingdom, to oblige them to deliver up <i>Eldavid</i>, upon pain of being massacred without Mercy, if they did not do it. <i>Zacheus</i> the Prince of the Captivity, wrote to him to save the Nation, by surrendring himself; but he laugh&#8217;d at this request, and would not make himself a Sacrifice for the People. He continued his Disorders, till his Father-in-Law, tempted by the Promise which <i>Zaid Alladin</i> made him, of ten thousand gold Crowns, invited his Son-in-Law to Supper, made him Drunk, and cut off his Head, which was sent to the King of <i>Persia</i>. This Prince did not stand to his word, but demanded that all <i>Eldavid</i>&#8217;s Followers should be deliver&#8217;d up; and upon their refusal, which was grounded upon the Impossibility of the thing, he order&#8217;d abundance of Jews to be murder&#8217;d in his Kingdom.</p>
