    <p>&#8216;Esther,&#8217; said Alroy, advancing, and gently taking her hand, &#8216;the capital of the East will soon unfold its marvels to thy sight. Prepare thyself for wonders. Girl, we are no longer in the desert. Forget thy fitful fancies. Come, choose a husband from my generals, child, and I will give a kingdom for thy dower. I would gladly see a crown upon that imperial brow. It well deserves one.&#8217;</p>
