    <h4><b><i>The American Monthly Magazine</i></b> 1 (1 June 1833): 261.</h4>
    <p>THE WONDROUS TALE OF ALROY; by the author of Contarini Fleming, &amp;C.: Philadelphia, Carey, Lea &amp; Blanchard.&#8212;Another novel from the pen of Mr. D&#8217;Israeli, and apparently possessing the same brilliant style as his preceding works. We did not ourselves admire the last of his romances so much as those of many other writers whom we could mention; nevertheless, a far better judge than we, Lytton Bulwer, has pronounced Contarini Fleming to be the production of no ordinary mind. Mr. D&#8217;Israeli is no less conspicuous in his own country, as an eager supporter of the cause of liberty and knowledge, than as a writer, and is considered by all parties a young man of high and increasing promise.</p>
