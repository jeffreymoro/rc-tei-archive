    <p>&#8216;THE royal brow was clouded,&#8217; said Ithamar to Asriel, as, departing from the council, they entered their magnificent barque.</p>

    <p>&#8216;I have seen him gay on the eve of battle, and lively though calm, with weightier matters than now oppress him. His brow was clouded, but not, methinks, with thought; one might rather say with temper. Mark you, how he rated Jabaster?&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;Roundly! The stern priest writhed under it; and as he signed the ordinance, shivered his reed in rage. I never saw a man more pale.&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;Or more silent. He looked like an embodied storm. I tell you what, Asriel, that stern priest loves not us.&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;Have you just discovered that secret, Ithamar? We are not of his school. Nor, in good faith, is our ruler. I am glad to see the king is so staunch about Abidan. Were he in council he would support Jabaster.&#8217;</p>

    <td>
    <p>&#8216;I would not trust him. As long as there is fighting, he will meddle with nothing else; but, mark my words, Ithamar: in quiet times he will support the priest.&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;Heart and soul. I would your brother were here, Asriel: he alone could balance Jabaster. Alroy loves your brother like himself. Is it true that he marries the Lady Miriam?</p>

    <p>&#8216;Agreed. Jabaster will have it that, in a Hebrew monarchy, the chief priest is in fact the grand vizir.&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;I am not so sure of that. He may choose to command the Syrian expedition in person; he must leave some head at Bagdad. Jabaster is no general.&#8217;</p>
