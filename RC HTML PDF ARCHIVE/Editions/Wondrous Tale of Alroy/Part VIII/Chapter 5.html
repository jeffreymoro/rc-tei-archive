    <p>&#8216;&#8217;Tis here,&#8217; replied the high priest. &#8216;The Hebrew legislator requires but little musing to shape his order. He has a model which time cannot destroy, nor thought improve.&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;Its glory hath departed,&#8217; replied the high priest; &#8216;the bricks have fallen, but we will rebuild with marble; and Sion, that is now without the Christian walls, shall yet sparkle, as in the olden time, with palaces and pavilions.&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;Sire,&#8217; at length exclaimed the high priest in a low and tremulous voice, &#8216;I must pray your pardon that for an instant in this character I have indulged in any other thoughts than those that may concern your welfare. &#8217;Tis past: and you, who know all, will forgive me.&#8217;</p>

At present, Jabaster, we must be moderate, and content ourselves with arrangements which may ensure that order shall be maintained, property respected, and justice administered. Is it true that a gang has rifled a mosque?&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;Sire! of that I would speak. They are no plunderers, but men, perhaps too zealous, who have read and who have remembered that &#8220;Ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall possess, served their gods upon the high mountains, and upon the hill, and under every green tree.

    <p>&#8216;Jabaster, is this a synagogue? Come I to a council of valiant statesmen or dreaming Rabbis? For a thousand years we have been quoting the laws we dared not practise. Is it with such aid that we captured Nishabur and crossed the Tigris? Valiant, wise Jabaster, thou art worthy of better things, and capable of all. I entreat thee, urge such matters for the last time. Are these fellows in custody?&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;Freed them! Hang them! Hang them on the most public grove. Is this the way to make the Moslem a duteous subject? Jabaster! Israel honours thee; and I, its chief, know that one more true, more valiant, or more learned, crowds not around our standard; but I see, the caverns of the Caucasus are not a school for empire.&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;All is quiet between the Tigris and Euphrates. It would be better to recall his division, which has been much harassed. I thought of relieving him by Abidan.&#8217;</p>

    <p>&#8216;I think so, too. We may as well keep Abidan out of the city. If the truth were known, I&#8217;ll wager some of his company plundered the mosque. We must issue a proclamation on that subject. My good Jabaster, we&#8217;ll talk over these matters alone. At present I will leave you with your brother. Scherirah, sup with me tonight; before you quit Asriel, come with me to my cabinet.&#8217;<br/>
