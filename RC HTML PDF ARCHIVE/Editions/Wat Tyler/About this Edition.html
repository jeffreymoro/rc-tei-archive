    This hypertext edition was designed and marked up at the University of Maryland by <a href="mailto:ksinger@wam.umd.edu">Kate Singer</a>, Site Manager at Romantic Circles. Making extensive use of tables and style sheets for layout and presentation, it will work best when viewed with Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator versions 5.0 and 4.7, respectively, and higher. The HTML markup is HTML 4.01/Transitional compliant, as set out by the <a href="http://www.w3c.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a>.<br/></p>
    <p><b><a name="text" id="text"> </a>The Text</b><br/>
    This edition has been collated using five extant editions of the text: The John Fairbarn and William Hone (pirated / unauthorized) editions of 1817, the John Cleave and J.P. Mendham editions of 1835 and 1850 respectively, and the "official" version of the text presented in the 1860 <i>Collected Poetical Works of Robert Southey</i>. There are as many as ten other pirated editions (many based on these five) of the play in existence; acquiring and collating these texts is a long-term goal of the critical edition project. Please see the <a href="/editions/wattyler/works_consulted.html#Collated">Works Consulted</a> page for a complete list of witness editions.<br/>
    <br/>
    The annotations to the text were compiled by the editors to provide literary, historical, and political context to the <i>Wat Tyler</i> edition. The <a href="/editions/wattyler/works_consulted.html#Annotations">Works Consulted</a> contains a complete list of sources and reference materials used in creating these notes.</p>
