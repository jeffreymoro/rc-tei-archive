    <p>Encinctured with a twine of leaves,<br/>
    That leafy twine his only dress!<br/>
    A lovely Boy was plucking fruits,<br/>
    By moonlight, in a wilderness.<br/>
    The moon was bright, the air was free,<br/>
    And fruits and flowers together grew<br/>
    On many a shrub and many a tree:<br/>
    And all put on a gentle hue,<br/>
    Hanging in the shadowy air<br/>
    Like a picture rich and rare.<br/>
    It was a climate where, they say,<br/>
    The night is more belov'd than day.<br/>
    But who that beauteous Boy beguil'd,<br/>
    That beauteous Boy to linger here?<br/>
    Alone, by night, a little child,<br/>
    In place so silent and so wild&#8212;<br/>
    Has he no friend, no loving mother near?</p>
