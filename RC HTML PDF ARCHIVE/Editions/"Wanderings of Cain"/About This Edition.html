<p class="c2">This edition brings together the various fragments in prose and verse that Coleridge wrote towards his unfinished project, <i>The Wanderings of Cain</i>. It seeks to correct standard presentations of the work, which consist solely of Canto II. Contributing texts are taken from a letter to Lord Byron, a notebook, <i>The Bijou</i> literary annual, a footnote in <i>Aids to Reflection</i> and a folio manuscript. Canto II is traditionally regarded as a curiosity that was abandoned in favor of the similar, yet more successful, "Rime of the Ancient Mariner." However, the 30-year span of work in progress between initial composition and part-publication, as well as developments in genre and ideological perspective, show that Coleridge invested <i>The Wanderings of Cain</i> with more importance than his commentators have since attributed to it.</p>
<p class="c2">The source texts are considered to be in the public domain. Please refer to the <a href="/editions/cain/bibliog.html">bibliography</a> for a complete list. The texts of the notebook and the folios are the editor's own transcriptions of the original manuscripts held at the British Library (Notebook 22; Egerton 2800 f1 &amp; f1v) and appear here by permission. Photographs of the Canto II manuscripts and a full account of the work in relation to the development of the prose poem genre in England are included in <i>Such Rare Citings</i>.</p>
<p>The editor would like to record her personal gratitude to Steven Whalen, John Woolford, Robert Renton and Danielle Eubank for their assistance at various stages of this project.</p>

<p class="c2">The cover image for this edition is a detail from William Blake's "The Voice of Abel's Blood" and is a depiction of Cain lying over the body of his brother (cf. <i>Jerusalem</i> 94.). The engraving illustrates the only known drama in Blake's mature writings, <i>The Ghost of Abel</i> (1822), which was composed in response to Lord Byron's play, <i>Cain: a mystery</i> (1821) and dedicated to him.<a href="/editions/cain/byron_cain.html"><b>*</b></a> The image is used courtesy of <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org">The Blake Archive.</a></p>
