    A PROSE composition, one not in metre at least, seems <i>prima facie</i> to
    require explanation or apology. It was written in the year 1798, near
    Nether Stowey in Somersetshire, at which place (<i>sanctum et amabile
    nomen!</i> rich by so many associations and recollections) the Author had
    taken up his residence in order to enjoy the society and close
    neighbourhood of a dear and honoured friend, T. Poole, Esq.<a href=
    "#note1" class="notes">[1]</a>
    The work was to have been written in concert with another,<a href=
    "#note2" class="notes">[2]</a>
    whose name is too venerable within the precincts of genius to be
    unnecessarily brought into connection with such a trifle, and who was then
    residing at a small distance from Nether Stowey. The title and subject were
    suggested by myself, who likewise drew out the scheme and the contents for
    each of the three books or cantos, of which the work was to consist, and
    which, the reader is to be informed, was to have been finished in one
    night! My partner undertook the first canto; I the second: and which ever
    had <i>done first,</i> was to set about the third. Almost thirty years have
    passed by; yet at this moment I cannot without something more than a smile
    moot the question which of the two things was the more impracticable, for a
    mind so eminently original to compose another man's thoughts and fancies,
    or for a taste so austerely pure and simple to imitate the Death of
    Abel?<a href="#note3" class=
    "notes">[3]</a> Methinks I see his grand and noble countenance as at the
    moment when having dispatched my own portion of the task at full
    finger-speed, I hastened to him with my manuscript--that look of humourous
    despondency fixed on his almost blank sheet of paper, and then its silent
    mock-piteous admission of failure struggling with the sense of the
    exceeding ridiculousness of the whole scheme—which broke up in a laugh: and
    the Ancient Mariner was written instead.

    Years afterward, however, the draft of the Plan and proposed Incidents, and
    the portion executed, obtained favor in the eyes of more than one person,
    whose judgment on a poetic work could not but have weighed with me, even
    though no parental partiality had been thrown into the same scale, as a
    make-weight: and I determined on commencing anew, and composing the whole
    in stanzas, and made some progress in realizing this intention, when
    adverse gales drove my bark off the "Fortunate Isles" of the Muses; and
    then other and more momentous interests prompted a different voyage, to
    firmer anchorage and a securer port. I have in vain tried to recover the
    lines from the Palimpsest tablet of my memory: and I can only offer the
    introductory stanza, which had been committed to writing for the purpose of
    procuring a friend's<a href="#note4"
    class="notes">[4]</a> judgment on the metre, as a specimen.

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Encinctured with a twine of leaves,<br />
      That leafy twine his only dress!<br />
      A lovely Boy was plucking fruits,<br />
      By moonlight, in a wilderness.<br />
      The morn was bright, the air was free,<br />
      And fruits and flowers together grew<br />
      On many a shrub and many a tree:<br />
      And all put on a gentle hue,<br />
      Hanging in the shadowy air<br />
      Like a picture rich and rare.<br />
      It was a climate where, they say,<br />
      The night is more belov'd than day.<br />
      But who that beauteous Boy beguil'd,<br />
      That beauteous Boy to linger here?<br />
      Alone, by night, a little child,<br />
      In place so silent and so wild—<br />
      Has he no friend, no loving Mother near?

    I have here given the birth, parentage, and premature decease of the
    "Wanderings of Cain, a poem," — intreating, however, my Readers not to
    think so meanly of my judgment as to suppose that I either regard or offer
    it as any excuse for the publication of the following fragment, (and I may
    add, of one or two others in its neighbourhood) in its primitive crudity.
    But I should find still greater difficulty in forgiving myself, were I to
    record pro <i>taedio</i> publico a set of petty mishaps and annoyances
    which I myself wish to forget. I must be content therefore with assuring
    the friendly Reader, that the less he attributes its appearance to the
    Author's will, choice, or judgment, the nearer to the truth he will
    be.<a href="#note5" class=

  </p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p><a name="note1" id="note1"> </a></p>
<p><b>[1]</b> On the request of his neighbour, Thomas Poole, Coleridge began to write a series of autobiographical letters. One of particular significance with regards <i>The Wanderings of Cain</i> is endorsed 16th October, 1797 [See <i>Griggs</i>, I:353.]. In this letter, Coleridge recounts a childhood fight with his brother Frank over who is the favourite son. The young Coleridge runs at Frank with a knife before running away and spending "a dreadful stormy night" hiding by the river Otter.</p>
<p><a name="note2" id="note2"> </a></p>
<p><b>[2]</b> William Wordsworth, who had recently moved into Alfoxton house in the village of Holford, 3 miles from Nether Stowey, with his sister, Dorothy.</p>
<p><a name="note3" id="note3"> </a></p>
<p><b>[3]</b> Salomon Gessner's, <i>The Death of Abel</i> was a great success when it appeared in English translation (by Mary Collyer) in 1761.</p>

<p><b>[4]</b> <b>Contextual Note:</b> S. T. Coleridge to Lord Byron, 22 October 1815 (from <i>Collected Letters</i> iv: 601-06) .</p>
<p>"['Christabel'] is not yet a Whole: and as it will be 5 Books, I meant to publish it by itself: or with another Poem entitled, the Wanderings of Cain &#8212; of which, however, as far as it was written, I have unfortunately lost the only Copy &#8212; and can remember no part distinctly but the first stanza:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
