"<b>Lead on, my child!" said Cain:</b> "guide me, little <b>child!</b>" And the innocent little child clasped a finger of the hand which had murdered the righteous Abel, and he guided his father. "The fir branches drip upon <b>thee,</b> my son." "Yea, pleasantly, father, for I ran fast and eagerly to bring thee the pitcher and the cake, and my body is not yet cool. How happy the squirrels are that feed on these <b>fir trees</b>! they leap from bough to bough, and the old squirrels play round their young ones in the nest. I clomb a tree yesterday at noon, O my father, that I might play with them, but they <b>leapt</b> away from the branches, even to the slender twigs did they leap, and in a moment I beheld them on another tree. Why, O my father, would they not play with me? I would be good to them as thou art good to me: and I groaned to them even as thou groanest when thou givest me to eat, and when thou coverest me at evening, and as often as I stand at thy knee and thine eyes look at me?" Then Cain stopped, and stifling his <b>groans</b> he sank to the earth, and the child Enos stood in the darkness beside him.</td>

<td><b>And</b> Cain lifted up his <b>voice</b> and cried bitterly, and said, "The Mighty One that persecuteth me is on this side and on that; he pursueth my soul like the wind, like the sand-blast he passeth through me; he is around me even as the <b>air!</b> O that I might be utterly no more! I desire to die&#8212;yea, the things that never had life, neither move they upon the earth&#8212;<b>behold!</b> they seem precious to mine eyes. O that a man might live without the breath of his <b>nostrils. So</b> I might abide in <b>darkness,</b> and blackness, and an empty space! Yea, I would lie down, I would not rise, neither would I stir my limbs till I became as the rock in the den of the lion, on which the young lion resteth his head whilst he sleepeth. For the torrent that roareth far off hath a <b>voice;</b> and the clouds in heaven look terribly on me; the <b>mighty one</b> who is against me speaketh in the wind of the cedar grove; and in silence am I dried up." Then Enos spake to his father, "<b>Arise</b> my father, arise, we are but a little way from the place where I found the cake and the <b>pitcher." And</b> Cain said, "How knowest thou?" and the child answered&#8212;"<b>Behold</b> the bare rocks are a few of thy strides distant from the forest; and while even now thou wert lifting up thy voice, I heard the echo." Then the child took hold of his father, as if he would raise <b>him:</b> and Cain being faint and feeble rose slowly on his knees and pressed himself against the trunk of a fir, and stood upright and followed the child.</td>

For</b> the mighty limbs of Cain were wasted as by fire; his hair was as the matted curls on the <b>Bison's</b> forehead, and so glared his fierce and sullen eye beneath: and the black abundant locks on either side, a rank and tangled mass, were stained and scorched, as though the grasp of a burning iron hand had striven to rend them; and his countenance told in a strange and terrible language of agonies that had been, and were, and were still to continue to be.</td>

<td>The scene around was desolate; as far as the eye could <b>reach</b> it was <b>desolate:</b> the bare rocks faced each other, and left a long and wide interval of <b>thin</b> white sand.

There was no spring, no summer, no <b>autumn:</b> and the winter's <b>snow,</b> that would have been lovely, fell not on these hot rocks and scorching sands. Never morning lark had poised himself over this desert; but the huge serpent often hissed there beneath the talons of the vulture, and the vulture screamed, his wings imprisoned within the coils of the serpent. The pointed and shattered summits of the ridges of the rocks made a rude mimicry of human concerns, and seemed to <b>prophecy</b> mutely of things that then were not; steeples, and battlements, and ships with naked masts. As far from the wood as a boy might sling a pebble of the brook, there was one rock by itself at a small distance from the main ridge. It had been precipitated there perhaps by the groan <b>which</b> the <b>Earth uttered</b> when our first father fell. Before you approached, it appeared to lie flat on the ground, but its base slanted from its point, and between its <b>point</b> and the sands a tall man might stand upright. It was here that Enos had found the pitcher and cake, and to this place he led his father. But ere they <b>had reached the rock</b> they beheld a human <b>shape:</b> his back was towards them, and they were <b>advancing unperceived,</b> when they heard him smite his breast and cry aloud, "<b>Wo,</b> is me! <b>wo,</b> is me!

Have not I often said that I remembered a sweet <b>voice.</b> O my father! this is <b>it:</b>" and Cain trembled exceedingly. The voice was sweet indeed, but it was thin and <b>querulous like</b> that of a feeble slave in misery, who despairs altogether, yet can not refrain himself from weeping and lamentation. <b>And, behold! Enos glided</b> forward, and creeping softly round the base of the rock, stood before the stranger, and looked up into his face. And the Shape shrieked, and turned round, and Cain beheld him, that his limbs and his face were those of his brother <b>ABEL</b> whom he had <b>killed!

<td>Thus as he stood in silence and darkness of <b>Soul</b>, the <b>SHAPE</b> fell at his feet, and embraced his knees, and cried out with a bitter outcry, "Thou eldest born of Adam, whom Eve, my mother, brought forth, cease to torment me! I was feeding my flocks in green pastures by the side of quiet rivers, and thou killedst me; and now I am in misery." Then Cain closed his eyes, and hid them with his <b>hands;</b> and again he opened his eyes, and looked around him, and said to <b>Enos,</b> "What beholdest thou? Didst thou hear a <b>voice</b> my son?" "Yes, my father, I beheld a man in unclean garments, and he uttered a sweet voice, full of lamentation." Then Cain raised up the <b>Shape</b> that was like Abel, and <b>said.</b> "The <b>Creator</b> of our father, who had respect unto thee, and unto thy offering, wherefore hath he forsaken thee?" Then the Shape shrieked a second time, and rent his garment, and his naked skin was like the white sands beneath their feet; and he shrieked yet a third time, and threw himself on his face upon the sand that was black with the shadow of the rock, and Cain and Enos sate beside him; the child by his right hand, and Cain by his left. They were all three under the rock, and within the shadow. The Shape that was like Abel raised himself up, and spake to the <b>child;</b> "I know where the cold waters <b>are</b> but I may not drink, wherefore didst thou then take away my pitcher?" But Cain said, "Didst thou not find favour in the sight of the Lord thy God?" The Shape answered, "The Lord is God of the living only, the dead have another God." Then the child Enos lifted up his eyes and prayed; but Cain rejoiced secretly in his heart. "Wretched shall they be all the days of their mortal life," exclaimed the Shape, "who sacrifice worthy and acceptable sacrifices to the God of the dead; but after death their toil ceaseth. Woe is me, for I was well beloved by the God of the living, and cruel wert thou, O my brother, who didst snatch me
away from his power and his dominion." Having uttered these words, he rose suddenly, and fled over the <b>sands;</b> and Cain said in his heart, "The curse of the Lord is on <b>me;</b> but who is the God of the dead?" and he ran after the Shape, and the Shape fled shrieking over the sands, and the sands rose like white mists behind the steps of Cain, but the feet of him that was like Abel disturbed not the sands. He greatly outrun Cain, and turning short, he wheeled round, and came again to the rock where they had been sitting, and where Enos still stood; and the <b>child</b> caught hold of his garment as he passed by, and he fell upon the <b>ground. And</b> Cain stopped, and beholding him not, said, "he has passed into the dark woods," and <b>he</b> walked slowly back to the <b>rocks;</b> and when he reached it the child told him that he had caught hold of his garment as he passed by, and that the man had fallen upon the <b>ground;</b> and Cain once more <b>sat</b> beside him, and <b>said,</b> "Abel, my brother, I would lament for thee, but that the spirit within me is withered, and burnt up with extreme agony. Now, I pray thee, by thy <b>flocks,</b> and by thy pastures, and by the quiet rivers which thou <b>lovedst</b>, that thou tell me all that thou knowest. Who is the God of the dead? where doth he make his dwelling? what sacrifices are acceptable unto him? for I have offered, but have not been received; I have prayed, and have not been heard; and how can I be afflicted more than I already am?" The Shape arose and <b>answered,</b> "O that thou hadst had pity on me as I will have pity on thee. Follow me, <b>Son</b> of Adam! and bring thy child with <b>thee!</b>"</td>

hand, and Cain by his left. They were all three under the rock, and within the shadow. The Shape that was like Abel raised himself up, and spake to the <b>child;</b> "I know where the cold waters <b>are,</b> but I may not drink, wherefore didst thou then take away my pitcher?" But Cain said, "Didst thou not find favour in the sight of the Lord thy God?" The Shape answered, "The Lord is God of the living only, the dead have another God." Then the child Enos lifted up his eyes and prayed; but Cain rejoiced secretly in his heart. "Wretched shall they be all the days of their mortal life," exclaimed the Shape, "who sacrifice worthy and acceptable sacrifices to the God of the dead; but after death their toil ceaseth. Woe is me, for I was well beloved by the God of the living, and cruel wert thou, O my brother, who didst snatch me away from his power and his dominion." Having uttered these words, he rose suddenly, and fled over the <b>sands;</b> and Cain said in his heart, "The curse of the Lord is on <b>me&#8212;</b>but who is the God of the dead?" and he ran after the Shape, and the Shape fled shrieking over the sands, and the sands rose like white mists behind the steps of Cain, but the feet of him that was like Abel disturbed not the sands. He greatly outrun Cain, and turning short, he wheeled round, and came again to the rock where they had been sitting, and where Enos still stood; and the <b>Child</b> caught hold of his garment as he passed by, and he fell upon the <b>ground; and</b> Cain stopped, and beholding him not, said, "he has passed into the dark woods," and walked slowly back to the <b>rocks,</b> and when he reached it the child told him that he had caught hold of his garment as he passed by, and that the man had fallen upon the <b>ground;</b> and Cain once more <b>sat</b> beside him, and <b>said&#8212;</b>"Abel, my brother, I would lament for thee, but that the spirit within me is withered, and burnt up with extreme agony. Now, I pray thee, by thy
<b>flocks</b> and by thy pastures, and by the quiet rivers which thou <b>lovest</b>, that thou tell me all that thou knowest. Who is the God of the dead? where doth he make his dwelling? what sacrifices are acceptable unto him? for I have offered, but have not been received; I have prayed, and have not been heard; and how can I be afflicted more than I already am?" The Shape arose and <b>answered&#8212;</b>"O that thou hadst had pity on me as I will have pity on thee. Follow me, <b>son</b> of Adam! and bring thy child with <b>thee:" and</b> they three passed over the white sands between the rocks, silent as <b>their</b> shadows.</td>
