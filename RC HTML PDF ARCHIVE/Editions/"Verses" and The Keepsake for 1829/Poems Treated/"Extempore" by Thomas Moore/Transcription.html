EXTEMPORE.



TO ----------, TO WHOSE INTERFERENCE I CHIEFLY OWE 

THE VERY LIBERAL PRICE GIVEN FOR 

 LALLA ROOKH



When they shall tell, in future times,

Of thousands giv'n for idle rhymes

Like these--the pastime of an hour,

They'll wonder at the lavish taste

That could, like tulip-fanciers, waste

A little fortune on a flower!



Yet wilt not thou, whose friendship set

Such value on the bard's renown;

Yet wilt not thou, my friend, regret

The golden shower thy spell brought down;



For thou dost love the free-born Muse,

Whose flight no curbing chain pursues;

And thou dost think the song, that shrines 

That image, --so ador'd by thee,

And spirits like thee,--Liberty,

Of price beyond all India's mines!

         THOMAS MOORE
