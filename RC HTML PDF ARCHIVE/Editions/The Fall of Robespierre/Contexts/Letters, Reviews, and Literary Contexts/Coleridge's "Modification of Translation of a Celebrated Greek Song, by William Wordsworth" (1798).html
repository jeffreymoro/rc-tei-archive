    <p><b>Modification of <i>Translation of a Celebrated Greek Song</i>, by William Wordsworth</b></p>
    <p>The poem (<i>CC</i> 16.1.1.449-51) was published in <i>MP</i> 13 February 1798 over the signature "PUBLICOLA" ("Cultivator of the Public"). Coleridge adapted Wordsworth's translation of a drinking song, which Mays describes as a schoolboy exercise. The Greek original was quoted by Athenaeus in the <i>Deipnosophistae</i> and included by Richard Brunck in <i>Analecta Veterum Poetarum Graecorum</i> (1772-76), where it is attributed to Callistratus (second century BCE).</p>
