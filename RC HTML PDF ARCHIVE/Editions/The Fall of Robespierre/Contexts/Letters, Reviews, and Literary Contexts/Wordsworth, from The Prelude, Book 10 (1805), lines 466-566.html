    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; O friend, few happier moments have been mine<br/>
    Through my whole life than that when first I heard<br/>
    That this foul tribe of Moloch was o'erthrown,<br/>
    And their chief regent levelled with the dust.<br/>
    The day was one which haply may deserve<br/>
    A separate chronicle. Having gone abroad<br/>
    From a small village where I tarried then,<br/>
    To the same far-secluded privacy<br/>
    I was returning. Over the smooth sands<br/>
    Of Leven's ample aestuary lay<br/>
    My journey, and beneath a genial sun,<br/>
    With distant prospect among gleams of sky<br/>
    And clouds, and intermingled mountain-tops,<br/>
    In one inseparable glory clad&#8211;<br/>
    Creatures of one ethereal substance, met<br/>
    In consistory, like a diadem<br/>
    Or crown of burning seraphs, as they sit<br/>
    In the empyrean. Underneath this show<br/>
    Lay, as I knew, the nest of pastoral vales<br/>
    Among whose happy fields I had grown up<br/>
    From childhood. On the fulgent spectacle,<br/>
    Which neither changed, nor stirred, nor passed away,<br/>
    I gazed, and with a fancy more alive<br/>
    On this account&#8211;that I had chanced to find<br/>
    That morning, ranging through the churchyard graves<br/>
    Of Cartmell's rural town, the place in which<br/>
    An honored teacher of my youth was laid.<br/>
    While we were schoolboys he had died among us,<br/>
    And was born hither, as I knew, to rest<br/>
    With his own family. A plain stone, inscribed<br/>
    With name, date, office, pointed out the spot,<br/>
    To which a slip of verses was subjoined&#8211;<br/>
    By his desire, as afterwards I learned&#8211;<br/>
    A fragment from the <i>Elegy</i> of Gray.<br/>
    A week, or little less, before his death<br/>
    He had said to me, 'My head will soon lie low';<br/>
    And when I saw the turf that covered him,<br/>
    After the lapse of full eight years, those words,<br/>
    With sound of voice, and countenance of the man,<br/>
    Came back upon me, so that some few tears<br/>
    Fell from me in my own despite. And now,<br/>
    Thus travelling smoothly o'er the level sands,<br/>
    I thought with pleasure of the verses graven<br/>
    Upon his tombstone, saying to myself,<br/>
    'He loved the poets, and if now alive<br/>
    Would have loved me, as one not destitute<br/>
    Of promise, nor belying the kind hope<br/>
    Which he had formed when I at his command<br/>
    Began to spin, at first, my toilsome songs.'<br/>
    &#160;<br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160; Without me and within as I advanced<br/>
    All that I saw, or felt, or communed with,<br/>
    Was gentleness and peace. Upon a small<br/>
    And rocky island near, a fragment stood&#8211;<br/>
    Itself like a sea rock&#8211;of what had been<br/>
    A Romish chapel, where in ancient times<br/>
    Masses were said at the hour which suited those<br/>
    Who crossed the sands with ebb of morning tide.<br/>
    Not far from this still ruin all the plain<br/>
    Was spotted with a variegated crowd<br/>
    Of coaches, wains, and travellers, horse and foot,<br/>
    Wading, beneath the conduct of their guide,<br/>
    In loose procession through the shallow stream<br/>
    Of inland water; the great sea meanwhile<br/>
    Was at safe distance, far retired. I paused,<br/>
    Unwilling to proceed, the scene appeared<br/>
    So gay and cheerful&#8211;when a traveller<br/>
    Chancing to pass, I carelessly inquired<br/>
    If any news were stirring, he replied<br/>
    In the familiar language of the day<br/>
    That, <i>Robespierre was dead</i>. Nor was a doubt,<br/>
    On further question, left within my mind<br/>
    But that the tidings were substantial truth&#8211;<br/>
    That he and his supporters all were fallen.<br/>
    &#160;<br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160; Great was my glee of spirit, great my joy<br/>
    In vengeance, and eternal justice, thus<br/>
    Made manifest. 'Come now, ye golden times',<br/>
    Said I, forth-breathing on those open sands<br/>
    A hymn of triumph, 'as the morning comes<br/>
    Out of the bosom of the night, come ye.<br/>
    Thus far our trust is verified: behold,<br/>
    They who with clumsy desperation brought<br/>
    Rivers of blood, and preached that nothing else<br/>
    Could cleanse the Augean stable, by the might<br/>
    Of their own helper have been swept away.<br/>
    Their madness is declared and visible;<br/>
    Elsewhere will safety now be sought, and earth<br/>
    March firmly towards righteousness and peace.'<br/>
    Then schemes I framed more calmly, when and how<br/>
    The madding factions might be tranquillized,<br/>
    And&#8211;though through hardships manifold and long&#8211;<br/>
    The mighty renovation would proceed.<br/>
    Thus, interrupted by uneasy bursts<br/>
    Of exultation, I pursued my way<br/>
    Along that very shore which I had skimmed<br/>
    In former times, when, spurring from the Vale<br/>
    Of Nightshade, and St. Mary's mouldering fane,<br/>
    And the stone abbot, after circuit made<br/>
    In wantonness of heart, a joyous crew<br/>
    Of schoolboys, hastening to their distant home,<br/>
    Along the margin of the moonlight sea,<br/>
    We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand.<br/></p>
