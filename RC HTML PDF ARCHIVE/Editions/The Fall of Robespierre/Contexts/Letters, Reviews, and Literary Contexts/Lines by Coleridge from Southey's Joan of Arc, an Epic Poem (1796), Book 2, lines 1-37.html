    <p>No more of Usurpation's doom'd defeat,<br/>
    Ere we the deep preluding strain have pour'd<br/>
    To the Great Father, Only Rightful King,<br/>
    Eternal Father! King Omnipotent!<br/>
    Beneath whose shadowy banners wide unfurl'd<br/>
    Justice leads forth her tyrant-quelling Hosts.<br/>
    Such Symphony requires best Instrument.<br/>
    Seize then my Soul! from Freedom's trophied Dome<br/>
    The Harp which hanging high between the shields<br/>
    Of Brutus and Leonidas, oft gives<br/>
    A fitful music to the breezy touch<br/>
    Of patriot Spirits that demand their fame.<br/>
    For what is Freedom, but the unfetter'd use<br/>
    Of all the Powers which God for use had given?<br/>
    But chiefly this, with holiest habitude<br/>
    Of constant Faith, him First, him Last to view<br/>
    Thro' meaner powers and secondary things<br/>
    Effulgent, as thro' clouds that veil his blaze.<br/>
    For all that meets the bodily sense I deem<br/>
    Symbolical, one Mighty alphabet<br/>
    For infant minds; and we in this low world<br/>
    Placed with our backs to bright Reality,<br/>
    That we may learn with young unwounded ken<br/>
    Things from their shadows. Know thyself my Soul!<br/>
    Confirm'd thy strength, thy pinions fledged for flight<br/>
    Bursting this shell and leaving next thy nest<br/>
    Soon upward soaring shalt thou fix intense<br/>
    Thine eaglet eye on Heaven's eternal Sun!<br/>
    But some there are who deem themselves most free,<br/>
    When they within this gross and visible sphere<br/>
    Chain down the winged thought, scoffing ascent<br/>
    Proud in their meanness: and themselves they cheat<br/>
    With noisy emptiness of learned phrase,<br/>
    Their subtle fluids, impacts, essences,<br/>
    Self-working Tools, uncaus'd Effects, and all<br/>
    Those blind Omniscients, those Almighty Slaves,<br/>
    Untenanting Creation of its God.</p>
