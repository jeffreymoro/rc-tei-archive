            <p><strong>"Robespierre's Will," <i>The True Briton</i> 520 (28 August 1794)</strong></p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; The following is circulated as the last Will and Testament of the late <span class="stagesm">Maximilian Robespierre</span>:</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; I, <span class="stagesm">Maximilian Robespierre</span>, Citizen of Paris, and Member of the Republic of France, one, indivisible and unimpressible, knowing the uncertainty of all things, and, in particular, that of human life, do make this my last will and testament in manner and form as follows:</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; Imprimis &#8212;&#8212; I resign my soul to <i>him</i> who has of late inspired me with so many <i>capital</i> efforts in favour of Liberty, Equality, and the Rights of Man.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; My body I commit to the earth, and knowing I shall be buried at the <i>public expence</i>, my will is, that I have no other monument than the <i>shouts of the populace</i>.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; My <i>heart</i> I leave to be raffled for, between <span class="stagesm">Barrere, Tallien</span> and <span class="stagesm">Collet</span> d'<span class="stagesm">Herbois</span>.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; My <i>principles</i> to be shared in common amongst the first class of Jacobins in France, Great Britain, &amp;c. &#8212; Over and above which, I bequeath <i>my courage</i> to the <i>English Jacobins</i>, being the only quality they seem to want in the perfection of their education.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; My <i>nerves</i> I leave to be manufactured into <i>bell ropes</i>, to celebrate the future successes and triumphs of the Guillotine.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; My <i>poverty</i> as a <i>cloak</i> for modern Patriotism.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; My <i>wreaths</i>, my <i>triumphs and rewards</i>, I leave as <i>encouraging examples</i> to the rising race of Revolutionists.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; To [ ] and English Republican Journal [ ] Writers, &amp;c. &amp;c. I bequeath [one] <i>turned coat</i>, to be <i>skirted in partibus</i> amongst them, as the most <i>appropriate</i> reward I can bestow on them for the zeal with which I am confident they will celebrate my obsequies.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; To my dear and <i>loving friend and coadjutor</i>, Mr. <span class="stagesm">Barrere</span>, my fine seal ring of <i>Judas Iscariot</i>.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; To <i>Monsieur Renard d'Angleterre</i>, for praising <i>my Constitution</i> "as the most glorious fabric ever raised by human abilities and integrity," the <i>Prophet's</i> cap, lined with <i>fustian</i>, which I intended for Catherine D'&#8212;&#8212;, the late pretended mother of G&#8212;&#8212;.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; To Monsieur S*******, <i>le grand Politician d'Angleterre, et tres plus grand Poete Dramatique</i>, all my <i>Political Farces</i>.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; To Citizen <i>Stand-up</i>, all my <i>Essays</i> on <i>fermented lees</i>.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; To <span class="stagesm">Marc Angelo</span>, <i>Le petit fils De Grand Architecte</i>, all the <i>game</i> I shall die possessed of.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; To my friend Monsieur <span class="stagesm">David</span>, (in order to be <i>copied</i>) my fine picture of the <i>Imprisonment</i> of Count <span class="stagesm">Ugilino</span>.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; And finally, to shew that I die in charity with all mankind, I leave and bequeath my <i>late peace of mind</i> &#8212; to mine Enemies.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Signed and sealed with my <i>blood stone</i>, bearing the arms of the Republic, this 26th day of July, 1794.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <span class="stagesm">Maximilian Robespierre</span>.</p>
