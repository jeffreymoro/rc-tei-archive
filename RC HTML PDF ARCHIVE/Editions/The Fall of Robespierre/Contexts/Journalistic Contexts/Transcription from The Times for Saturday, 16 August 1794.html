            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Since the early part of the month of June, when <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Robespierre</span> forced the Convention to revoke the Decree of Adjournment, which a great majority had just then carried, upon the question of the <i>Organization of a Revolutionary Tribunal</i>, two parties declared themselves in its bosom; and when <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Tallien</span> survived the accusation of being a villain, a conspirator, and an <i>Hebertist</i>, which were made against him by Robespierre, it became a matter of doubt which faction would be victorious.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We have followed the various pursuits of both; the perpetual declamations of the Dictator at the Jacobins &#8211; the small effect produced by his presence and speeches; and we have informed the Public of the decline of his influence, and the dangers which threatened his party and person. We have repeatedly called the attention of our readers to all these events, and to predict the approaching catastrophe with which the ruling faction was menaced.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Time has realised these events: &#8211; Either <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Robespierre</span> and his adherents must fall, or the <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Majority</span> of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Convention</span> pass under the edge of the <i>guillotine</i>.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Robespierre's</span> greatest enemies were in the very bosom of the Committee of Public Safety. The first blows were struck by <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Barrere</span> and <span style="font-variant:small-caps">St. Just</span>. On the 27<sup>th</sup> of July, <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Barrere</span> mounted the Tribune in the Convention, and denounced the <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Dictator</span>, whose mouth-piece and apologist he had been for the last six months. Several Members threw themselves upon <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Robespierre</span>, and murdered him with poniards, crying out, "<i>Perish the Tyrant!</i>" The two Factions fought in the Hall, and their mutual fury reached the city, where the conflict is said to have lasted three days, in which time from 10 to 14,000 men fell. Among the Deputies killed are mentioned <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Robespierre</span>, <i>junior</i>, the Dictator's brother, <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Couthon</span>, <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Lavalette</span>, <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Damas</span>, and <span class="stagesm">St. Just</span>. The latter was killed fighting in the streets, at the head of the <i>Anti-Robespierrian</i> Party. <i>Barrere</i> was soon after proclaimed President of the Convention.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Such is the substance of our information, which was received yesterday in letters from Dover, brought thither from Calais by an American vessel, the <i>Alert</i>, Capt. <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Moore</span>, which sailed from thence on Tuesday. The intelligence of the death of <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Robespierre</span>, and of a dreadful conflict in Paris, is also confirmed by several letters received yesterday from Flushing; and seems to be connected with every circumstance that can guarantee the truth of it. Some say, that <i>Robespierre</i>'s body was conveyed to the Revolutionary Tribunal, which declared him guilty of tyranny, and sentenced him to the <i>guillotine</i>. Others pretend, that this cruel man was imprisoned before his denunciation, condemned, and executed. It is added, that the armies are divided in opinion; and that the different corps for or against the party of <i>Robespierre</i>, have come to blows. It is even said, that <i>Pichegru</i> has been carried prisoner to Paris. Further reports speak of the raising of the siege of <i>Sluys</i>; and of a battle having been fought before <i>Maestricht</i>, in which the Prince de <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Cobourg</span> killed 3000 Conventionalists, and took 1200 prisoners; but these last circumstances do not seem to merit equal authenticity with those respecting the <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Revolution</span> at <span class="stagesm">Paris</span>.</p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Notwithstanding the wind has blown fair for the last three days, for the packets coming from <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Holland</span>, the Mail from thence still continues due. The arrival of it, or of some Messenger from the Continent, was most anxiously expected yesterday; but neither had arrived at a late hour last night.</p>
