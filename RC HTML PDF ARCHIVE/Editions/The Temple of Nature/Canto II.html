The thinking few in all ages have complained of the brevity of life, lamenting that mankind are not allowed time sufficient to cultivate science, or to improve their intellect. Hippocrates introduces his celebrated aphorisms with this idea; "Life is short, science long, opportunities of knowledge rare, experiments fallacious, and reasoning difficult."&#8212;A melancholy reflection to philosophers!<br/>

    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Before mankind introduced civil society, old age did not exist in the world, nor other lingering diseases; as all living creatures, as soon as they became too feeble to defend themselves, were slain and eaten [<i>cont. below</i>]<br/></span></p>

    <span class="notes">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b class="citecolor">Combines with Heat, 1. 39.</b> It was shown in note on line 248 of the first Canto, that much of the aerial and liquid parts of the terraqueous globe was converted by the powers of life into solid matter; and that this was effected by the combination of the fluid, heat, with other elementary bodies by the appetencies and propensities of the parts of living matter to unite with each other. But when these appetencies and propensities of the parts of organic matter to unite with each other cease, the chemical affinities of attraction and the aptitude to be attracted, and of repulsion and the aptitude to be repelled, succeed, and reduce much of the solid matters back to the condition of elements; which seems to be effected by the matter of heat being again set at liberty, which was combined with other matters by the powers of life; and thus by its diffusion the solid bodies return into liquid ones or into gasses, as occurs in the processes of fermentation, putrefaction, sublimation, and calcination. Whence solidity appears to be produced in consequence of the diminution of heat, as the condensation of steam into water, and the consolidation of water into ice, or by the combination of heat with bodies, as with the materials of gun powder before its explosion.<br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b class="citecolor">Immortal matter, l. 43.</b> The perpetual mutability of the forms of matter seems to have struck the philosophers of great antiquity; the system of transmigration taught by Pythagoras, in which the souls of men were supposed after death to animate the bodies of a variety of animals, appears to have arisen from this source. He had observed the perpetual changes of organic matter from one creature to another, and concluded, that the vivifying spirit must attend it.</span><br/></p>

But the hieroglyphic figure of Adonis seems to have signified the spirit of animation or life, which was perpetually wooed or courted by organic matter, and which perished and revived alternately. Afterwards the fable of Adonis seems to have given origin to the first religion promising a resurrection from the dead; whence his funeral and return to life were celebrated for many ages in Egypt and Syria, the ceremonies of which Ezekiel complains as idolatrous, accusing the women of Israel of lamenting over Thammus; which St. Cyril interprets to be Adonis, in his Commentaries on Isaiah; Danet's Diction.</span><br/></p>

    <p><span class="notes">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b class="citecolor">A softer sex, l. 114.</b> The first buds of trees raised from seed die annually, and are succeeded by new buds by solitary reproduction; which are larger or more perfect for several successive years, and then they produce sexual flowers, which are succeeded by seminal reproduction. The same occurs in bulbous rooted plants raised from seed; they die annually, and produce others rather more perfect than the parent for several years, and then produce sexual flowers. The Aphis is in a similar manner hatched from an egg in the vernal months, and produces a viviparous offspring without sexual intercourse for nine or ten successive generations; and then the progeny is both male and female, which cohabit, and from these new females are produced eggs, which endure the winter; the same process probably occurs in many other insects.</span><br/></p>

Sect. 39. 6. 3. It is not to be understood, that the first living fibres, which are to form an animal, are produced by imagination, with any similarity of form to the future animal; but with appetencies or propensities, which shall produce by accretion of parts the similarity of form and feature, or of sex, corresponding with the imagination of the father.<br/>

The corol of the flower appears to be a respiratory organ belonging to these anthers and stigmas for the purpose of further oxygenating the vegetable blood for the production of the anther dust and of this honey, which is also exposed to the air in its receptacle or honey-cup; which, I suppose, to be necessary for its further oxygenation, as in many flowers so complicate an apparatus is formed for its protection from insects, as in aconitum, delphinium, larkspur, lonicera, woodbine; and, because the corol and nectary fall along with the anthers and stigmas, when the pericarp is impregnated.<br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr. B. S.

By the use of their wings they have access to each other on different branches or on different vegetables, and by living upon honey probably acquire a higher degree of animation, and thus seem to resemble the anthers of flowers, which probably are supported by honey only, and thence acquire greater sensibility; see Note on Vallisneria, 1. 280 of this Canto.<br/>

So the horns of the stag are sharp to offend his adversary, but are branched for the purpose of parrying or receiving the thrusts of horns similar to his own, and have therefore been formed for the purpose of combating other stags for the exclusive possession of the females, who are observed, like the ladies in the times of chivalry, to attend the car of the victor.<br/>

    <p>part of the tail on the right side of the fish strikes the water at the same time that another oblique plain strikes it on the left side, hence in respect to moving to the right or left these percussions of the water counteract each other, but they coincide in respect to the progression of the fish; this power seems to be better applied to push forwards a body in water, than the oars of boats, as the particles of water recede from the stroke of the oar, whence the comparative power acquired is but as the difference of velocity between the striking oar and the receding water. So a ship moves swifter with an oblique wind, than with a wind of the same velocity exactly behind it; and the common windmill sail placed obliquely to the wind is more powerful than one which directly recedes from it. Might not some machinery resembling the tails of fish be placed behind a boat, so as to be moved with greater effect than common oars, by the force of wind or steam, or perhaps by hand?<br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b class="citecolor">On pinions broad display'd, 1. 375.</b> The progressive motion of birds in the air is principally performed by the movement of their wings, and not by that of their tails as in fish. The bird is supported in an element so much lighter than itself by the resistance of the air as it moves horizontally against the oblique plain made by its breast, expanded tail and wings, when they are at rest; the change of this obliquity also assists it to rise, and even directs its descent, though this is owing principally to its specific gravity, but it is in all situations kept upright or balanced by its wings.<br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the support of the bird in the air, as well as its progression, is performed by the motion of the wings; these require strong muscles as are seen on the breasts of partridges. Whence all attempts of men to fly by wings applied to the weak muscles of their arms have been ineffectual; but it is not certain whether light machinery so contrived as to be moved by their feet, might not enable them to fly a little way, though not so as to answer any useful purpose.<br/></p>

When pain afflicts us, which we cannot avoid, we learn to relieve it by great voluntary exertions, as in grinning, holding the breath, or screaming; now the pleasurable sensation, which excites laughter, arises for a time so high as to change its name, and become a painful one; and we excite the convulsive motions of the respiratory muscles to relieve this pain. We are however unwilling to lose the pleasure, and presently put a stop to this exertion; and immediately the pleasure recurs, and again as instantly rises into pain. Which is further explained in Zoonomia, Sect. 34. 1. 4. When this pleasurable sensation rises into a painful one, and the customs of society will not permit us to laugh aloud, some other violent voluntary exertion is used instead of it to alleviate the pain.<br/>

In the act of sucking, the lips of the infant are closed round the nipple of its mother, till it has filled its stomach, and the pleasure of digesting this grateful food succeeds; then the sphincter of the mouth, fatigued by the continued action of sucking, is relaxed; and the antagonist muscles of the face gently acting, produce the smile of pleasure, which is thus during our lives associated with gentle pleasure, which is further explained in Zoonomia, Sect. 16. 8. 4.</span></p>

            <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 1.</b> Without further preamble, Urania begins the canto by bemoaning the brevity of life, as adumbrated at the end of Canto I. This sets up her ensuing celebration of reproduction as a response to the previous canto's presentation of life as purely mortal, moving from dust to dust. Retrospectively, Canto I becomes the presentation of death which marked the first of the Eleusinian Mysteries's four "scenes," while the present canto corresponds to its second scene, the marriage of Cupid and Psyche by which the fear of death is overcome (see I, 137n). The note corrects a common impression that Hippocrates's "<i>ars longa, vita brevis</i>" celebrates the eternity of art: the context makes clear that "<i>ars</i>" indicates the unattainable goal of complete scientific understanding, rather than completed artistic achievement. The reference is particularly poignant given Darwin's imminent death, in anticipation of which the present poem reads as a determined attempt to put his own scientific house in order.</p>

On the other hand, <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/darwin_temple/addnotes/addnote7.html?width=600&height=600">Additional Note VII</a> (to which 3n refers us) draws heavily on <i>Zoonomia</i>'s psychosomatic physiology to suggest that nowadays ageing can be postponed by a proper balance of stimuli, concluding that constant injections of novelty and surprise to the system may shake it out of its desensitizing habits and defer "the debilities of age, and consequent death" indefinitely (p. 32). The idea that death may be avoided by keeping in the right state of mind was shared by the radical atheists Thomas Holcroft, William Godwin and the latter's disciple Percy Shelley (see William Hazlitt, <i>Memoirs of Thomas Holcroft</i>, pp. 364-5; Desmond King-Hele, <i>Shelley: His Thought and Work</i>, pp. 30, 36).</p>

            <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 45.</b> Together with its note and 43n, the canto's first extended classical simile relates many ancient birth and resurrection myths to the conservation of organic matter after the individual's death. 43n argues that Pythagoras's belief in reincarnation or transmigration of souls was based on the idea that, since organic matter was recycled between organisms, life itself must be also. Similar truths (known as usual to the pre-literate Egyptian magi) about life regularly emerging and disappearing from organic matter underlie the myth of Adonis, slain by a boar and condemned to divide the year between the underworld goddess Proserpine (herself the subject of a similar myth) and his lover Venus (or Dione) who has secured him a partial reprieve. Having established (I, 372n) that Dione's own sea-birth represented the conversion of the seabed's organic deposits into land by volcanic eruptions, Darwin now argues that her affair with Adonis represents the endless migration of life in and out of organic matter. In a sidelong glance at Christianity, Darwin calls the myth the source of (only) "the first religion promising a resurrection from the dead" and reminds us that the Old Testament prophets saw such cults as idolatrous. The simile's closing alternation of "light" and "night" (59-60) echoes the last couplet of the earlier account of Orpheus's partial resurrection of Eurydice (I, 203-4), perhaps another variant on the same theme. For Danet's <i>Dictionary of Antiquities</i>, see I, 83n.</p>

            <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 61.</b> The second section of the canto begins by focussing on primitive, asexual reproduction. The postulation of the parents "unknown to sex" as male "sires" betrays a certain gender-bias, but does prepare for Darwin's later handling of the Adam story. We begin with plants, which can propagate from bulbs, roots and shoots without recourse to the sexually produced seeds.</p>

II, pp. 233-48&#8212;see my note to I, 134n. Here the formula "would it be too bold to imagine that [. . .]?" is changed to the more insinuating "But it may appear too bold in the present state of our knowledge on this subject, to suppose that [ . . .]?," where the final question mark subverts the initial apparent disclaimer of certainty.</p>

Though Darwin is here applying it to supposedly male non-sexual parenting, his personification of Storge (95-102) is perhaps unavoidably female. The Psyche and Cupid who follow in her train (102) will make a fuller reappearance at II, 221, and represent the way sexual love is a later development than parental.</p>

Though there is some poetic licence here, in this belief in willed species-change Darwin's evolutionism resembles that of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829), whom he probably influenced, rather than that of Charles Darwin. 118n refers to one of <i>Zoonomia</i>'s more curious arguments&#8212;related to the idea of voluntary evolution&#8212;that the sex and appearance of the child is determined by what the father was imagining at the moment of conception. Though the 1801 3rd ed. retracts this argument in favour of the more modern view&#8212;worked out in <i>Phytologia</i> (pp. 130-1)&#8212;that elements from both parents contribute equally (vol. II, pp. 277-80), the earlier argument is also retained there in full (vol. II, pp. 263-77). The present note suggests either that Darwin had still not made up his mind upon final revision in 1802, or that most of <i>Temple of Nature</i> was written before 1801, and not completely revised.</p>

However, 122n considers the possibility that humans too "were formerly in an hermaphrodite state," before moving to somewhat stronger evidence that we evolved from quadrupeds thanks to the development of opposable thumbs. This note is (I think) the only time Darwin speculates that we may have evolved from Mediterranean (i.e. African) apes&#8212;a theory held not just by the controversial French philosophes Buffon and Helvetius but by the ur-anthropologist Lord Monboddo (see my note to I, 36) and the poet Richard Payne Knight in <i>The Progress of Civil Society</i>, whose resemblances to Darwin's draft <i><a href="/editions/darwin_temple/progress/progress.html">The Progress of Society</a></i> are discussed elsewhere in this edition. By and large Darwin is uninterested in such speculations, which often emerged from an implicitly racist concern to place Africans at the bottom of the human scale, rather than from verified scientific research.</p>

            <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 216.</b> The word "nascent" often carries a certain ambiguity in this canto (see "nascent world," 120). Here the Muse could be referring back to the way hereditary Consumption and other ills attack the innocent "Youth's reluctant heart" (II, 184), but "nascent heart" could also refer to the dashing of the Muse's and reader's renewed hopes on learning of the promise held out by reproduction; lastly, it could remind us that up to now we have chiefly been considering very primitive species (with references to more developed ones such as man as similetic illustrations only), "nascent" in the sense of being part of the dawn of organic life. The next couplet seems to confirm this by suggesting that we have not yet considered air-breathing species or healthy examples of sexual reproduction.</p>

            <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 223.</b> To establish the topic of successful sexual love, Urania reverts to the marriage of Cupid and Psyche, whom we last glimpsed on line 102. This marriage constitutes the second "scenical representation" of the Eleusinian Mysteries as described in I, 137n: its full-dress presentation here is the clearest indication so far that the poem's four cantos will correspond with the Mysteries' four stages. 223n summarises part of <i>Economy of Vegetation</i>, Additional Note XXII: Psyche's "aurelian" wings (denoting the gold of a chrysalis) identify her with the butterfly, whose "rising from the tomb" of its cocoon made it an ancient symbol for the soul's rebirth after death. Though "Psyche" specifically means "soul," this should perhaps be read alongside 43n's suggestion that Pythagoras's belief in reincarnation of souls was based on the recurrence of the same organic matter in different organisms. Thus her "marriage" to Cupid symbolizes the way life propagates itself through sex rather than more conventional ideas about the soul as a separate immortal essence. It is also, more directly, a depiction of sexual love itself: Cupid's much-emphasized quiver of arrows&#8212;usually denoting his power to make mortals fall in love&#8212;seems here to be a delicate way of talking about sperm; and Psyche's "blushing" tallies with later accounts of female sexual arousal (see e.g. 253-4).</p>

            <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 425.</b> Urania ends her speech by somewhat conventionally warning her virginal followers against Love. This seems hard to take too seriously, unless as a warning simply to hold out until marriage: the "vestal fire" of 432 is a mark of virginity (Rome's Vestal Virgins tended an undying flame), but also perhaps the "secret flame" we have just seen inspired in virgin bosoms by Hymen, the god of respectable married love (421). The length of the two notes to 434 suggests that the virgins' repressed giggles are the real point of the passage. If the virgins are familiar with Lucretius, they will know that <i>De Rerum Natura</i>'s similar warnings against love, at the end of Book IV (1037-1287), do not preclude healthily self-centred sexual activity (1063-72).</p>

            <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 435.</b> The mood of somewhat saucy comedy continues as Urania's attendants serve the poet's Muse with a picnic of "no longer interdicted" fruit from the Tree of Knowledge, washed down with clear spring water (perhaps from the spring of the Pierides or Muses, from which Lucretius drinks the clear water of knowledge in <i>De Rerum Natura</i> I, 925-8: better known as the "Pierian Spring" of Learning from which Pope advises us to "drink deep, or taste not" in <i>An Essay on Criticism</i> (216)). The casual lifting of the ban on the fruit of Knowledge continues the undermining of the Eden myth begun in I, 33-46, and neatly introduces us to the topics of Cantos III and IV: the progress of the mind and the nature of good and evil.</p>

            <p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: l. 447.</b> But the passage also subliminally links the Lucretian/Epicurean preference for water over alcohol (see 435-8) with the vegetarian sympathies of Canto III's reading of Edenic innocence (see my note to III, 449). As a doctor and agrarian economist, Darwin regularly inveighed against excessive consumption of meat and alcohol. See, e.g., Canto IV, 77-82; <i>Phytologia</i>, pp. 467-8.</p>
