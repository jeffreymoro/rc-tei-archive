<p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: Preface Para. 1.</b> The disclaimer of an instructive intention is disingenuous, though Darwin may have felt that many of the "deep researches" behind the poem were more fully laid out in his prose treatises, <i>Zoonomia</i> and <i>Phytologia</i>. The claim to a simply amusing intention echoes the more elaborately playful Prefaces to the two parts of <i>Botanic Garden</i>, but here the apparently simple intention to present natural operations in chronological "course of time" implies a massively ambitious attempt to present the whole known universe as a single coherent system.</p>

<p class="notes"><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: Preface Para. 2.</b> This paragraph is confusing in the context of the present poem, and clearly harks back to Darwin's earlier drafts for <i>The Progress of Society</i> (included elsewhere in this edition), tracing human developments through the five Ages of Hunting, Pasturage, Agriculture, Commerce and Philosophy. In these drafts, the classical gods and heroes are represented as mythologized versions of the achievements of real human beings. Despite Darwin's careful distinction between the Bible's truthful "recording" and the heathens' fictive "celebrating" of such figures, in practice the drafts treat Hercules's feats with the club and David's with the sling on much the same footing. Despite his abandonment of the <i>Progress</i> poem, Darwin may have retained this paragraph in the light of William Warburton's claim that Eleusinian initiates were taught that the gods were "only dead Mortals, subject, in life, to the same Passions and Vices with themselves" (<i>Divine Legation</i>, 149, see I, 137n). <i>Temple of Nature</i> does not, however, usually present the ancient gods as based on specific human beings: more often they are seen as disguised metaphors for physical or mental processes.</p>
