    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 1. Spontaneous vital production not contrary to scripture; to be looked for only in the simplest organic beings; supposed want of analogy no argument against it, as this equally applies to all new discoveries. II. The power of reproduction distinguishes organic beings; which are gradually enlarged and improved by it. III. Microscopic animals produced from all vegetable and animal infusions; generate others like themselves by solitary reproduction; not produced from eggs; conferva fontinalis; mucor. IV. Theory of spontaneous vitality. Animal nutrition; vegetable; some organic particles have appetencies to unite, others propensities to xbe united; buds of trees; sexual reproduction; analogy between generation and nutrition; laws of elasticity not understood; dead animalcules recover life by heat and moisture; chaos redivivum; vorticella; shell snails; eggs and seeds; hydra. Classes of microscopic animals; general remarks.</p>
    <p align="center"><a href="/editions/darwin_temple/addnotes/addnote2.html"><b>NOTE II.</b></a> FACULTIES OF THE SENSORIUM.</p>
    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Fibres possess a power of contraction; spirit of animation immediate cause of their contracting; stimulus of external bodies the remote cause; stimulus produces irritation; due contraction occasions pleasure; too much, or too little, pain; sensation produces desire or aversion, which constitute volition; associated motions; irritation; sensation; volition; association; sensorium.</p>

    <p align="center"><a href="/editions/darwin_temple/addnotes/addnote5.html"><b>NOTE V.</b></a> AMPHIBIOUS ANIMALS.</p>
    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Diodon has both lungs and gills; some amphibious quadrupeds have the foramen ovale open; perhaps it may be kept open in dogs by frequent immersion so as to render them amphibious; pearl divers; distinctions of amphibious animals; lamprey; leech; remora; whale.</p>

    <p align="center"><a href="/editions/darwin_temple/addnotes/addnote7.html"><b>NOTE VII.</b></a> OLD AGE AND DEATH.</p>
    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; I. Immediate cause of the infirmities of age not yet well ascertained; must be sought in the laws of animal excitability; debility induced by inactivity of many parts of the system; organs of sense become less excitable; this ascribed to habit; may arise from deficient secretion of sensorial power; all parts of the system not changed as we advance in life. II. Means of preventing old age; warm bath; fishes; cold-blooded amphibious animals; fermented liquors injurious; also want of heat, food, and fresh air; variation of stimuli; volition; activity. III. Theory of the approach of age; surprise; novelty; why contagious diseases affect a person but once; debility; death.</p>
    <p align="center"><a href="/editions/darwin_temple/addnotes/addnote8.html"><b>NOTE VIII.</b></a> REPRODUCTION.</p>
    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 1. Distinguishes animation frown mechanism; solitary and sexual; buds and bulbs; aphises; tenia; volvox; polypus; oyster; eel; hermaphrodites. II. Sexual. III. Inferior vegetables and animals propagate by solitary generation only; next order by both; superior by sexual generation alone. IV. Animals are improved by reproduction; contagious diseases; reproduction a mystery.</p>
    <p align="center"><a href="/editions/darwin_temple/addnotes/addnote9.html"><b>NOTE IX.</b></a> STORGE.</p>
    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Pelicans; pigeons; instincts of animals acquired by a previous state, and transmitted by tradition; parental love originates from pleasure.</p>
