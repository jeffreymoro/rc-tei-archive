    <h2 align="center"><i>THE PROGRESS OF SOCIETY</i></h2>
    <h3 align="center">By ERASMUS DARWIN</h3>
    <p align="center"><i><br/></i> <b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
    <ol>
    <li>
    <div align="left"><span class="edprose">Darwin's unfinished historical poem <i>The Progress of Society</i> was probably drafted in 1798-9, about the same time as <i>Phytologia</i> (published 1800): one loose sheet of paper contains rough passages from both works. Throughout successive drafts the "Progress" title vies for preference with "The Temple of Nature," only clearly emerging as first choice in the last, most finished version; and one important source of the poem's interest is the light it throws on the published <i>Temple of Nature</i>'s use of the Temple image. In <i>Progress</i>, the Temple of Nature replaces the Garden of Eden after the Fall of Adam and Eve forced Humanity to fend for itself, and contains explanations and depictions of the development of human technology through the five "successive ages" of Hunting, Pasturage, Agriculture, Commerce and Philosophy. In <i>Temple</i>, the Temple of Nature likewise replaces Eden, but now as the site of explanations of the creation of the universe and the evolution of life which are clearly alternative, rather than simply subsequent, to the Biblical Eden story. Despite this crucial change of function, however, the published poem incorporates much of the draft poem's description of the Temple itself, including many details which belong far more clearly to the original version than to the published one.</span></div>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p align="left" class="edprose">These details include the numerous art-works which adorn the Temple's walls. While a promise to explain these remains largely unfulfilled in <i>Temple</i>, in <i>Progress</i> they are clearly accounted for as versions of the actual art-works with which each successive age celebrated its characteristic achievements. In earlier ages at least, these works often depict legendary classical or Biblical figures in line with the idea that such figures actually celebrate human technical advances&#8212;often in weaponry, as with Hercules's club, David's sling or Apollo's bow. The theory that the ancient gods "were derived from men famous in those early times, as in the ages of hunting, pasturage, and agriculture," sometimes called Euhemerism, is rather strangely invoked in the Preface to the published <i>Temple</i>, where this hangover from the mythography of <i>Progress</i> is not at all appropriate: in the published poem, as in <i>Botanic Garden</i>, mythology is usually explained in terms of scientifically observed natural processes, not in terms of specific human models or achievements.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p align="left" class="edprose">To give due prominence to its stress on the technological impetus behind art, myth and poetry, <i>Progress</i> shows examples of these being produced by the "Genies" or spirits of each age, whom we also see inspiring primitive societies with the technologies themselves. Perhaps as a way of avoiding too much realistic stress on the ugly hardship of primitive life, the poem's physical representation of social development is placed almost completely in the hands of these ethereal, fluttering beings, first as they act out the production of such things as fire and the dugout canoe, and then in terms of the myths and works of art through which such achievements are celebrated.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p align="left" class="edprose">The Genies disappear completely from <i>Temple</i>, but the published poem does follow <i>Progress</i> in putting its main informational content into the mouth of an instructress variously called the Priestess of Nature, the Muse Urania and "the Hierophant" or explicator of the ancient Greek Eleusinian Mysteries; though this last term is <i>Progress</i>'s only gesture to the Mysteries which <i>Temple</i> claims as the chief source of its own "machinery." More clearly than in <i>Temple</i>, however, <i>Progress</i> constructs the Temple of Nature as a physical space, with the "halls" of the Ages of Hunting, Pasturage, Agriculture and Commerce facing to the four points of the compass, and that of the Age of Philosophy&#8212;a mixture of the present and a yet-unrealised future&#8212;at their centre. Despite some uncertainty as to the exact placing of the four surrounding halls&#8212;Pasturage moves from South to East in successive drafts&#8212;our experience of the poem is constructed round our "Muse's" accompaniment of the Priestess of Nature to the external doors of each hall in turn, which she flings open to reveal the art-works within, as produced by the Genies whom we have already seen enacting the relevant age's achievements.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p align="left" class="edprose"><i>The Progress of Society</i> is not only of interest for the light it throws on <i>The Temple of Nature</i>. Its central subject&#8212;human history&#8212;is tackled nowhere else in Darwin's oeuvre, and it is interesting to speculate whether he abandoned it in anticipation of the growing difficulty of presenting this material with his usual tone of confident optimism: an optimism promised here by his machinery of sportive genies, and by his opening paean to the improvements of each of his five ages. As discussed in my <a href="/editions/darwin_temple/intro.html">Introduction to <i>Temple</i></a>, one clear model for his attempt at social history can be found in Book 5 of Lucretius's great scientific poem <i>De Rerum Natura</i>, which traces human development through similar stages of hunting, pasturage, agriculture and commerce; for Lucretius, however, the continuance of superstition, war and class-conflict leaves any eventual emergence into the sunlit uplands of an "Age of Philosophy" an unlikely prospect. These elements are just as pronounced in Richard Payne Knight's explicitly Lucretian <i>The Progress of Civil Society: A Didactic Poem</i> (1797), which so strangely anticipates Darwin's own <i>Progress</i>. Apocalyptically climaxing his quasi-Marxist vision of class-war with the French Reign of Terror, Knight adds the further dimension of an ongoing racial war between light-skinned Aryans and what he sees as their dark-skinned, ape-related inferiors.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p align="left" class="edprose">Never buying into the ideas of racial superiority fostered by Knight or other proto-evolutionists such as Lord Monboddo and the Comte de Buffon, Darwin clearly sees the institution of slavery&#8212;which they ideologically support&#8212;as a blot on the very idea of unalloyed progress. In a brief drafted outline for the content of <i>Progress</i> as a whole, slavery emerges in the Age of Agriculture and becomes a systematic trade in the Age of Commerce, which Darwin situates in the bleak Northern Hall and for which he seems to have pre-composed the single line "And gold triumphant rules the world enslaved." The move from this dark vision to a final Age of Philosophy, in which swords are turned to ploughshares amid the "ruins of superstition," while a state of universal liberty induces all to do as they would be done by, seems to combine desperate wishful thinking with the kind of revolutionary rhetoric which had recently led to the government's suppression of Tom Paine's <i>The Rights of Man</i> and <i>The Age of Reason</i>. Had Darwin published a poem in this vein, it is not hard to imagine what ideological enemies like <i>The Anti-Jacobin</i> team&#8212;whose "Loves of the Triangles" had already half-predicted such a poem from him by conflating his own earlier <i>Loves of the Plants</i> with Knight's <i>Progress of Civil Society&#8212;</i>would have done with it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p align="left" class="edprose">The drafts of <i>The Progress of Society</i> fill four small notebooks housed in Cambridge University Library, catalogued as DAR 227.2.22-25. In terms of composition, the order seems to be 23, 24, 22, 25. The text of Canto I given below is based on the most apparently finished version (22); that of Canto II on the rougher, tentative start made in 25, the only version of the canto. These are followed by the outline of the whole poem sketched in the earliest notebook, 23. The other notebook, 24, contains intermediate work on Canto I, and has mainly been used to corroborate, or occasionally fill out, the text derived from 22. My thanks are due to Cambridge University Library's Manuscripts Department for the opportunity to study and copy from these fascinating drafts.</p>

    <h4 align="center"><i>Prologue to the first Canto</i></h4>
    <p align="left">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The observations and industry of mankind have discovered many arts, which have influenced their manners, increased their felicity, or added to their numbers. Amongst these may be numbered the discovery of the uses of fire, the calling on the strength of animals to facilitate labour, the invention of letters, preparing and spinning vegetable substances, the discovery of iron, of the magnet, and of gun-powder. But the situations or circumstances which seem more directly to have mark'd the progress of human society are <i>first</i> the <i>Hunting State</i> with its necessary arms, as the club, bow, and fishing net; in this state of the world their heroism consisted in conquering noxious animals, and their sustenance in catching the inoffensive ones. Hence the great deeds of Hercules, Apollo and [. . . .], who were afterwards worship'd as deities. The world must have been thinly inhabited in this state of mankind; in the wilds of North America it has been estimated, that one family scarce could subsist by hunting within five miles of another. Amongst the crimes of this lawless age murders were not infrequent, but Rapes seem to stand prominent, whence the fables of Apollo and Daphne, Pan and Syrinx, Pluto and Proserpine; which were afterwards ornamented by the poets, and allegorized by the philosophers.<br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To this succeeded the age of Pasturage, afterwards that of Agriculture, then of Commerce and now of Philosophy, as explain'd in the Prologues to the subsequent Cantos.</p>

    And give the fifth, new-born of Time, to light.<br/>
    The silver tissue of their joys disclose,<br/>
    Swell with deep chords the murmur of their woes;<br/>
    Their laws, their labours, and their loves proclaim,<br/>
    And chant their virtues to the trump of Fame.</span><a href="#n4"><span class="notenum">4</span></a> <span class="poetry"><br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Say <i>first</i>, how Man in boundless forests stray'd,<br/>
    And pluck'd wild clusters from the intangled shade;<br/>
    Assail'd with knotted club his bestial foe,<br/>
    Flung the rude stone, and strain'd the stubborn bow.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;10<br/>
    <i>Next</i>, how on shelter'd lawns by gushing springs<br/>
    Dwelt in their leafy tents the Shepherd-Kings;<br/>
    From vale to vale their fleecy squadrons drove<br/>
    And realms reecho'd to the lute and love.<br/>
    Then, how the shining ploughshare turn'd the soil,<br/>
    And harness'd oxen shared the ingenious toil;<br/>
    While towers and towns the admiring fields infold,<br/>
    And plenty laughs amid her waving gold.<br/>
    <i>Last</i>, how as Commerce piled with busy hand<br/>
    Her treasured ores, and bade her sails expand,&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;20<br/>
    O'er earth and ocean roll'd her freighted cars<br/>
    Warm'd by new suns, and led by stranger-stars.<br/>
    <i>Now</i> mild Philosophy assumes his reign,<br/>
    And all the Charities adorn his train;<br/>
    Virtue's soft forms our glowing hearts engage,<br/>
    And Liberty returns, and leads the golden age.<br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thus in dread dreams before Assyria's throne<br/>
    To Night's pale orb a motley spectre shone;<br/>
    Broad iron feet sustain'd the giant-mass,<br/>
    Wide knees of lead, and kimbo arms of brass;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;30<br/>
    In bright expanse his silver chest he raised,<br/>
    And high in air his golden forehead blazed.</span><a href="#n5"><span class="notenum">5</span></a> <span class="poetry"><br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Immortal Love!</i> whose golden fetters, hurl'd</span><a href="#n6"><span class="notenum">6</span></a> <span class="poetry"><br/>
    Round Nature's frame, connect the whirling world;<br/>
    Whether you roll the sun's attractive throne<br/>
    Or gird the planets in your silver zone;<br/>
    With crystal cords to atom atom bind,<br/>
    Link sex to sex, or marry mind to mind;<br/>
    Attend my song!&#8212;with rosy lips rehearse<br/>
    And with your silver arrows write my verse!&#8212;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;40<br/>
    So shall my lines soft-rolling eyes engage,<br/>
    And snow-white fingers turn the volant page,<br/>
    The smiles of Beauty all my toils repay,<br/>
    And youths and virgins chant the living lay.<br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where <i>Eden's</i> sacred bowers triumphant sprung,</span><a href="#n7"><span class="notenum">7</span></a> <span class="poetry"><br/>
    By angels guarded, and by prophets sung,<br/>
    Wav'd o'er the east in purple pride unfurl'd,<br/>
    And rock'd the golden cradle of the World;<br/>
    Four sparkling torrents lav'd with wandering tides<br/>
    Their velvet avenues, and flowery sides;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;50<br/>
    On sun-bright lawns unclad the Graces stray'd,<br/>
    And guiltless Cupids haunted every glade;<br/>
    Till the fair mother of mankind, erelong,<br/>
    Heard unalarm'd the Tempter's serpent-tongue;<br/>
    Eyed the sweet fruit, the mandate disobey'd,<br/>
    And her fond Lord with sweeter smiles betray'd.<br/>
    Conscious awhile with throbbing heart he strove,<br/>
    Spread his wide arms, and barter'd peace for love!&#8212;<br/>
    Now rocks on rocks, in savage grandeur roll'd,</span><a href="#n8"><span class="notenum">8</span></a> <span class="poetry"><br/>
    With circling sweep the blasted plains infold;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;60<br/>
    The incumbent crags eternal tempest shrouds,<br/>
    And livid light'nings cleave the lambent clouds;<br/>
    Loud round their base discordant whirlwinds blow<br/>
    And sands in burning columns dance below.<br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Here high in air, amid the desert soil,<br/>
    Towers a vast <i>Fane</i>, unwrought by mortal toil;</span><a href="#n9"><span class="notenum">9</span></a> <span class="poetry"><br/>
    O'er many a league the ponderous domes extend,<br/>
    And deep in earth the ribbed vaults descend;<br/>
    A thousand jasper steps with circling sweep<br/>
    Lead the slow votary up the winding steep;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;70<br/>
    Ten thousand piers, now joined and now aloof,<br/>
    Spread their long arms, and bear the branching roof.<br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unnumber'd ailes connect unnumber'd halls,<br/>
    And sacred symbols crowd the pictur'd walls;</span><a href="#n10"><span class="notenum">10</span></a> <span class="poetry"><br/>
    With pencil rude forgotten days design,<br/>
    And arts, or empires, live in every line.<br/>
    While chain'd reluctant on the marble ground,<br/>
    Indignant <i>Time</i> reclines, by <i>Sculpture</i> bound;</span><a href="#n11"><span class="notenum">11</span></a> <span class="poetry"><br/>
    And sternly bending o'er a scroll unroll'd,<br/>
    Inscribes the future with his style of gold.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;80<br/>
    &#8212;So erst, when <i>Proteus</i> on the briny shore,&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br/>
    New forms assum'd of eagle, pard, or boar;<br/>
    The wise <i>Ulysses</i></span><a href="#n12"><span class="notenum">12</span></a> <span class="poetry">bound in sea-weed thongs<br/>
    The changeful god amid his scaly throngs;<br/>
    Till in deep tones his opening lips at last<br/>
    Disclosed unwill'd the future and the past.<br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Here o'er piazza'd courts, and long arcades,<br/>
    The bowers of <i>Pleasure</i> root their waving shades;</span><a href="#n13"><span class="notenum">13</span></a><span class="poetry"><br/>
    Blow their bright colours, breathe their rich perfume,<br/>

    Here, on soft beds of thornless roses press'd,<br/>
    In slight undress recumbent Graces rest;<br/>
    The Queen of Beauty arms her quiver'd loves,<br/>
    Schools her bright nymphs, and practises her doves;<br/>
    Calls round her laughing eyes in playful turns<br/>
    The glance that lightens, and the smile that burns;<br/>
    Forms the still tear, the meeting whisper tries,<br/>
    Heaves her white bosom with resistless sighs;<br/>
    Or moulds with rosy lips the magic words,<br/>
    That bind the heart in adamantine cords.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;100<br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Deep-whelm'd beneath, in rock-surrounded caves,<br/>
    <i>Oblivion</i> dwells, and labels all her graves;</span><a href="#n14"><span class="notenum">14</span></a> <span class="poetry"><br/>
    O'er each dark nich a ponderous stone is roll'd,<br/>
    And seven-fold doors the dreadful den infold;<br/>
    No spicy Zephyrs breathe, no sunbeams cheer,<br/>
    Nor song, nor simper, ever enters here;<br/>
    O'er the green floor, and round the dew-damp wall,<br/>
    The slimy snail, and bloated lizard crawl;<br/>
    While on white heaps of intermingled bones<br/>
    The muse of <i>Melancholy</i> sits and moans;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;110<br/>
    Showers her cold tears o'er Beauty's early wreck,<br/>
    Spreads her pale arms, and bends her marble neck.<br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So in rude rocks, beside the Aegean wave,<br/>
    <i>Trophonius</i> scoop'd his sorrow-sacred cave;</span><a href="#n15"><span class="notenum">15</span></a> <span class="poetry"><br/>
    Unbarr'd to pilgrim feet the brazen door,<br/>
    And the sad sage returning smil'd no more.<br/>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;High in the midst the <i>Shrine of Nature</i> stands,</span><a href="#n16"><span class="notenum">16</span></a> <span class="poetry"><br/>
    Extends o'er earth and sea her hundred hands;<br/>
    Tower upon tower her beamy forehead crests,<br/>

    Drawn round her brows a lucid veil depends,<br/>
    O'er her fine waist the purfled woof descends;<br/>
    Her stately limbs the gather'd folds surround,<br/>

    <p class="notes"><b>4.</b> These opening lines are confusingly retained almost verbatim in lines I, 9-14 of the published <i>Temple</i>, which nowhere describes any such five ages specifically. Unless otherwise specified, lines referred to from <i>Temple</i> are in Canto I.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>5.</b> This "image" was dreamed by Nebuchadnezer and interpreted by Daniel. See Daniel, 2, 31-33. Here its changing metals from foot to head&#8212;iron, lead, brass, silver and gold&#8212;denote the five "ages" of society.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n6" id="n6"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>6.</b> The substantial section from ll. 33-182 was retained, with significant additions, in lines 15-214 of&#160;the published <i>Temple</i>. This apostrophe to "Immortal Love" echoes <i>De Rerum Natura</i>'s opening invocation to Venus, which is also imitated in Knight's address to "Almighty Love" in <i>Progress of Civil Society</i>, I, 91-112.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n7" id="n7"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>7.</b> In both this and the published poem, the Temple occupies the site of the Garden of Eden, but with very different implications in each case. Here, the socially productive labour it represents comes appropriately after Adam and Eve's expulsion from Paradise, condemned thenceforth to live by the sweat of their brows. In <i>Temple</i>, Urania's teachings about the real origins of life from the big bang to the evolution of species represents a religiously unorthodox <i>alternative</i> to the creation myth represented by the Garden of Eden.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n8" id="n8"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>8.</b> "With circling sweep" is replaced by "Rocks upon rocks" in the latest draft, but this earlier version makes it far clearer than in <i>Temple</i> (47-52) that these rocks now occupy the site of the Garden of Eden, and that their "circling sweep" encloses a central space where the Temple is to be found. However, <i>Temple</i> adds to this a crucial passage warning off unworthy would-be initiates, and describing the Loves and Graces' "tittering" approach to the Temple through a crystal-walled tunnel beneath the rocks (53-64).</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n9" id="n9"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>9.</b> This first introduction to the temple does not specifically name it the Temple of Nature, as <i>Temple</i> does (I, 66). One of the earliest drafts (in 227.2:23) calls it "Nature's Fane" in the first line, but in this version that identity is less foregrounded.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n10" id="n10"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>10.</b> These symbolic murals are appropriate to the poem's function of explicating the historical significance of the myths they depict. As retained in the published poem, this emphasis on the temple's depictions of gods, heroes and lovers becomes opaque and mysterious.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n11" id="n11"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>11.</b> Time's "binding" by Sculpture suggests the immortalizing of past discoveries by art and mythology.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n12" id="n12"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>12.</b> A mistaken memory from Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>: in the published <i>Temple</i> (85) Ulysses correctly becomes "Atrides," i.e. Menelaus.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n13" id="n13"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>13.</b> Pleasure's presence in the Temple underlines the poem's programme of exploring the "joys" and "woes" specific to each age. Through the figure of Venus (93 below), Pleasure is also linked to the sexual instinct which, presumably, prompts human development in specific directions.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n14" id="n14"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>14.</b> Oblivion, or death,&#160;and the Melancholy aroused by contemplating it (110) perhaps stand for the "woes" of each age, but also for the fear of forgetting our history which led early societies to memorialize it in myth. Knight's parallel poem <i>The Progress of Civil Society</i> (I, 77-82) offsets Pleasure more directly with Pain, as joint stimuli to social progress&#8212;in line with Jeremy Bentham's utilitarian understanding of progress as a simple matter of increasing one at the expense of the other. In the published <i>Temple</i> Darwin seems to pick up this idea, which leads into the important arguments of the last canto; but his retention of Oblivion along with Pain leaves the temple somewhat overcrowded at this point.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n15" id="n15"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>15.</b> Though reduced to four lines here and in the final <i>Temple</i>, Trophonius looms larger in some of the early plans. As an oracle whose cave revealed truths too disturbing for normal minds, he stands fittingly for the "dark side" of Darwin's vision both of history, as here, and of evolutionary destruction, as in <i>Temple</i>.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n16" id="n16"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>16.</b> The positioning of the goddess's shrine is not completely clear, here or in <i>Temple</i>. "High in the midst" suggests it is inside the temple, presumably in the "Central Hall" dedicated to Philosophy in the outline. However, other aspects of the description suggest it is outdoors, and visited before entering the temple building.&#160;&#160;</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n17" id="n17"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>17.</b> "Selvage" = "hem." At this point, <i>Temple</i> inserts the crucial passage (137-154) on the Eleusinian Mysteries,&#160;describing them as copied from the shrine of Nature. This forms the basis of the Preface's claim that the Mysteries provide the "machinery" of the whole poem.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n18" id="n18"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>18.</b> Urania, the Muse of Astronomy who according to Milton inspires <i>Paradise Lost</i>, is also here the "Priestess" or "Hierophant" of Nature who instructs Darwin's own muse. The "trains of virgins" are postulant worshippers of Nature, whose offerings Urania presents at the shrine, half revealing the goddess as she does so.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n19" id="n19"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>19.</b> The speaker here seems to be Darwin's own "Muse" (139), asking Urania to reveal more of Nature. In <i>Temple</i>, the whole poem is structured as a dialogue between this muse and Urania, the latter much to the fore.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n20" id="n20"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>20.</b> The long description which follows relates to the musician-demigod Orpheus's visit to the Underworld, to retrieve his dead wife Eurydice. Though his music charmed the gods Pluto and Proserpina into releasing her, he broke their conditions by looking back to see if she was following him, whereupon she returned to the underworld. More clearly than in <i>Temple</i>, this passage uses Orpheus to symbolize the recovery of the past through the medium of art. This version is in some ways more vivid than the finally published one, particularly in the rather endearing couplet on the three-headed dog Cerberus (159-60), leading from the naturally plural "ears" and "claws" to a witty double-take on "necks."</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n21" id="n21"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>21.</b> The Hierophant is the priestess who interprets the Eleusinian Mystery rituals to the initiates. This name for the Priestess of Nature is the only allusion to Eleusinian matters in the draft poem.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n22" id="n22"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>22.</b> From this point, the draft poem diverges completely from <i>Temple</i>, where the Priestess answers a wholly new set of questions about the formation of life, rather than referring to the request for explanations of the temple's mythological images&#8212;though these questions are, confusingly, retained.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n23" id="n23"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>23.</b> In Darwin's day the word "genie" was close to "genius" (as in "genius of the place") in denoting the tutelary spirit of a place or phenomenon, though more modern overtones of an oriental assisting spirit (or "djinn") may be starting to creep in. So these "Genies of the Chase" are the informing spirits of the Age of Hunting, to be succeeded in Canto II's Age of Pasturage by "Genies of the Pastured Plain," and so on. These genies have a similar prettifying function to <i>Economy</i>'s elemental spirits, and have no parallel in the published <i>Temple of Nature</i>. The following section (189-234) shows them developing the earliest forms of human technology: a clever way of making these discoveries appealing by removing the need to imagine actual primitive people making them.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n24" id="n24"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>24.</b> These genies, which have a similar prettifying function to <i>Economy</i>'s elemental spirits, have no parallel in <i>Temple</i>'s fundamentally literal scientific explanations of the origins of the universe, life and social impulses.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n25" id="n25"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>25.</b> In Rome, the Vestal Virgins tended a sacred fire which must never go out. This twin association of "Vestal" allows Darwin to link his ethereal, presumably virginal, genies to the first discovery of fire-making through rapid friction ("quick attrition") and the subsequent need to conserve the flame for future use.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n26" id="n26"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>26.</b> As the first weapon, the club is a major development. But in describing its making, Darwin gestures at other stone-age technologies, including the stone-age flint scraper and "jasper axe"&#8212;jasper being quartz, whose crystalline structure lends itself to sharp, hard points and edges.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n27" id="n27"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>27.</b> "Adhesive plain" wonderfully indicates the sheer frictional labour of&#160;transporting heavy objects before the invention of the wheel. Again earlier technologies&#8212;fire and flint tools&#8212;are presupposed in the making of the dugout canoe.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n28" id="n28"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>28.</b> The following line is a nod to Pope's <i>Rape of the Lock</i> (II, 28), where fishing is used as a simile for female beauty rather than vice versa, as here.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n29" id="n29"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>29.</b> From the club and spear we have advanced to the bow and arrows, whose venomed tips will reappear in the description of Apollo&#8212;reinforcing the wider point that myths are really descriptions of technological advances.</p>

    <p class="notes"><a name="n31" id="n31"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>31.</b> We are now entering the temple building, via its portico and double door, of which the "valves" are the leaves. If the goddess's shrine "in the midst" was indoors, Urania presumably led us outside to view the genies' activities "in green pavilions or in marble courts" (183). We are now turning from their physical enactments of the skills of the Hunting Age to their artistic depictions of its mythology on the temple's internal walls. An earlier draft (2:23) has "Wide to the West the eternal gates unfold," though the outline in the same notebook puts the Age of Hunting in the "Eastern Hall" and Canto III's Age of Agriculture in the Western one.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n32" id="n32"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>32.</b> As well as enacting the "arts and arms" of the Age of Hunting, its genies record its achievements in works of visual art, including statuary, tapestry, mosaics, designs inset into ceilings ("laqueated" means "recessed") and the pictographic, pre-phonetic "unletter'd word" of hieroglyphics. According to Darwin's often-stated theory, classical mythology was largely based on over-literal misreadings of symbolic images attempting to describe real phenomena: here, technological developments rather than the natural processes foregrounded in <i>Temple</i> as well as <i>The Botanic Garden</i>.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n33" id="n33"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>33.</b> Hounds "open" when they start baying on finding the prey; "affrighted lair"&#8212;the lair whose inhabitant is frightened&#8212;illustrates Darwin's penchant for extreme latinate compression. As goddess of hunting, Diana is appropriately the first of the genies' artistic depictions.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>35.</b> Python was a deadly serpent which was pursuing Apollo's mother, Leto. Once killed, its venom made his arrows especially deadly.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n36" id="n36"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>36.</b> Niobe was a Theban queen who boasted that her twenty children made her a more successful mother than Leto, who only had two. To avenge this slur on their mother, Apollo and Diana shot all of Niobe's children; later, she was turned into a perennially weeping statue.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="notes"><a name="n37" id="n37"> </a></p>
    <p class="notes"><b>37.</b> A ringed "O" (whether or not by Darwin is unclear) in the main manuscript (DAR 227.2.22) directs us to the back of a loose draft page for <i>Phytologia</i> (DAR 227.2.37) containing the best version of the next fourteen lines. With its fierce protest at the gods' injustice, this is a considerable improvement on the deleted version it replaces, which goes thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>In fearful agony another stands,<br/>
    Spreads to the unpitying skies her trembling hands;<br/>
    The shaft descending drinks her rosy breath<br/>
    And her pale throbbing bosom heaves in death.<br/>
    Sink two fair youths in mutual arms caress'd,<br/>
    One barbed arrow nails them breast to breast;<br/>
    Her youngest love beneath her robe she hides,<br/>
    Through her spread arms the cruel arrow glides.<br/>
    Ten blooming youths in anguish bite the ground,<br/>
    And ten fair bleeding sisters sleep around.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Modern usage makes the last line of this particularly unfortunate, but Darwin clearly had trouble hitting the right note: "And ten fair sister beauties bleed around" is one of several other attempts.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>38.</b> Hercules's link with hunting is emphasised by drawing attention to his cudgel and his habitual wearing of the skin of one of his early antagonists, the Nemaean lion.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>39.</b> Hercules received help and guidance from Minerva (Athena) at various times; or this could refer to his final forgiveness by Juno (Hera) after a long period of implacable enmity. In earlier outlines (draft 2:23) Darwin planned to describe Hercules dressing as a woman in servitude to Omphale, but seems to have dropped the idea here.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>40.</b> Samson's eyes are sealed, not only in death but&#160;because he was blinded by the Philistines on being captured (Judges, 16, 21). Earlier, he killed a lion with his bare hands (Judges 14, 5-6) and a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of an ass (15, 15-17). He pulled down the temple on his enemies (16, 29-31) after being betrayed to them by Dalilah (or Delilah), who cut off his strength-giving hair as he slept (16, 4-20).</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>41.</b> This was not intended as the end of the canto. In his first outline (draft 2:23), Darwin also includes the hunters Nimrod, Adonis, the English King William Rufus and Cephalus, on whose accidental shooting of his wife Procris he began a few lines in the same draft:</p>
    <blockquote>Where were ye, Genies of the sylvan chase<br/>
    When Cephalus some [??] address'd<br/>
    And sent the arrow into Procris' breast [?]</blockquote>

This increasingly illegible passage describes the modern process of printing: the "demon" in the following line is clearly the "printer's devil" or apprentice often blamed for mistakes.

The importance of wells as sites of contest and negotiation in the Pastoral Age is stressed in Darwin's first notes for Canto II.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>57.</b> The story of Cain and Abel can easily be read as symbolizing the supersession of pasturage by agricultural crop-growing. In contrast to the pastoral age, whose "woes" apart from war were mainly natural disasters (murrain and famine), the agricultural age involves the socially created evils of slavery, animal labour, iron weapons and alcohol. This fits well with the outline's darkening move from East (dawn of mankind) to South (idyllic noon) to declining West (this agricultural age) to North (the even greater evils of commerce).&#160;</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>58.</b> Despite the triumphs of manufacture, this age of commerce (more or less the present) intensifies the ills of the preceding one: slaves are traded as well as owned, and wine is turned into spirits, which as a doctor Darwin strongly condemned. The only hero is Dedalus: something which possibly bodes ill for the project of explaining myths in terms of technological developments. The keynote line about gold enslaving the world suggests a generally negative reading of the age of capital.</p>

    <p class="notes"><b>59.</b> It is a nuisance that the two things to be abolished are particularly illegible, but crime and war seem reasonable readings. The concluding embrace of Jesus's moral principle "Do as you would be done by" (though not his claim to be the Son of God) echoes that in <i>Plan for the Conduct of Female Education</i>, and is incorporated in the published <i>Temple</i> <i>of Nature</i>. The positioning of the Age of Philosophy at the temple's centre, perhaps alongside the Goddess of Nature herself (but see note 16), suggests that the other four ages have been painful efforts to realize natural laws, which will only be discovered through scientific progress. In the wake of Tom Paine's scandalously anti-Christian <i>The Age of Reason</i>, it is easy to see what a field-day publications like <i>The Anti-Jacobin</i> could have had with this picture.</p>
