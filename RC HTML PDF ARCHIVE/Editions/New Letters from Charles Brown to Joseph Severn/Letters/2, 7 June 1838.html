<div id="greeting">
<p>My dear Severn,</p>
</div>
<div id="letBody">
<p class="body">Here am I, lured from my quiet cottage to the turmoil of a city, for the sake of publishing a volume,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note2" name="2">2</a></sup> which may, in its consequences, bring disquiet into my cottage. One good thing, however, has accrued; &#8212; I have seen your four pictures in the Exhibition.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note3" name="3">3</a></sup> My praise is worth nothing, as I am an interested party; but they are much praised by those who know nothing about you. They are well placed. Your "Crusaders" seems to be the chief favourite; though I prefer the Venetian scene. The composition of the former is most striking. Imagination, which we rarely see now-a-days in painting, is in your painting; not a dreamy one, like Fuseli&#8217;s,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note4" name="4">4</a></sup> but one that makes your treatment of a subject gain imperceptibly on the beholder. The colour fully keeps its purpose with any of the best around them. Wilkie<sup><a class="fn" href="#note5" name="5">5</a></sup> must be merely painting for money, &#8212; his are sad fallings-off. Turner<sup><a class="fn" href="#note6" name="6">6</a></sup> is like a kitchen fire in the dog-days. Going from the Exhibition to the National Gallery,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note7" name="7">7</a></sup> I became intoxicated with admiration; and I endeavoured to account for part of their, &#8212; the old masters! &#8212; superiority. Beyond any modern they contrived to give a roundness to the figures; somehow it seems as if, by turning the frame, we could see the other side of the limbs. How this is managed I know not, but occasionally I perceive they adopted a bold, harsh outline, which, I thought, contributed to the magical effect. This, together with the depth they gave to their pictures, seems to me the grand secret; &#8212; reflect on how it might be done. The Athenaeum has praised you well;<sup><a class="fn" href="#note8" name="8">8</a></sup> but Dilke, in private at
least, and possibly when more are present than I have witnessed, is apt to relate the whole of the transaction between you and him; in vain I protest in your favour; it bears the stain of looking like getting thirty crowns out of him for nothing, to those who do not know you. Eleven years are passed! He declares, and authorises me to tell you, that he will not receive the picture if it comes; and he will not <u>demand</u> the money back again.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note9" name="9">9</a></sup> Thus nothing is left for you but to send him the money; and, even I in your place, I would send it instantly, with the addition of 5 pct per annum, though it were all my money at hand. It matters not whether you are or are not in fault. Dilke is altogether unpleasant towards myself. He is dogmatical, conceited, and rude. Success has turned his brain.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note10" name="10">10</a></sup> For the last fortnight I have kept from his house, except in paying two visits of mere civility; and, though I will not again quarrel with him, I would rather not henceforth be in his company, &#8212; it is a nuisance to my better thoughts. My forthcoming volume is on Shakespeare. It is printed at my own risk. I say nothing of its contents, as I shall send you a copy by M<sup>r</sup> Crauford, who will set off for Florence in about two months. Charles Richards<sup><a class="fn" href="#note11" name="11">11</a></sup> prints it. His nephew, our little Tom is his right-hand man, &#8212; a good, sedate, and clever fellow. He supports, I believe, his mother and youngest brother. The second is my godson, who is to visit my cottage; the eldest daughter is comfortably married; Sophy<sup><a class="fn" href="#note12" name="12">12</a></sup> is in Wales, as a dress maker. I have dined with Haslam, who lives like a most prosperous man; he has a wife and daughter,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note13" name="13">13</a></sup> the latter a nice girl of about sixteen; he sends remembrances, and
no reproaches for not writing. In this town, this city of humbug, I am hurried and flurried in all sorts of ways. I am sick of the eternal wheels, sick of the eternal streets, and abominably sick of the process of printing. Away I go tomorrow, leaving the last proofs to the care of Tom and a young lady-acquaintance of mine. You have so often sent me a moderate letter, that I make no conscience of letting you have one from me. In fact, for the future, I intend to say what I wish in as few words as I can cram it. I say nothing of your sad loss<sup><a class="fn" href="#note14" name="14">14</a></sup> but this: &#8212; the time will come when you will have more pleasure than pain in his remembrance, and, at last, unalloyed pleasure. Give my best love to your wife.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p class="indent"><a id="note1" name="note1"><sup>1</sup></a> Printed: Sharp 186 with errors and omissions, and reproduced in Stillinger 346-347. Above the salutation, Sharp has penciled, "887-9." Brown responds to Severn&#8217;s letter of 21 Nov. 1837 (Scott 345-347). Brown has written "<font class="et"><u>Italia</u> " at the head of the address page, "<font class="et"><u>Italie</u> " at the foot. <em>Address</em>: Al Pittore Inglese / il Sig. Guiseppe Severn, / Via Rasella, / Roma. <em>Postmarks</em>: LONDON 7 JUN 1838; PAID 7 JU 7 1838; ANGLETERRA PAR CALAIS; PONT BEAUVOIS{IN}; ROMA 21 {&#8230;} 1838 [<em>one other illegible</em>]. <a href="#1">[Return to the letter]</a></p>

<p class="indent"><a id="note3" name="note3"><sup>3</sup></a> Severn&#8217;s four pictures at the RA Exhibition of 1838 included: an oil sketch of his altar piece, "The Infant of the Apocalypse Saved from the Dragon" (now in the Tate Gallery, London), "Ariel," "The First Crusaders in Sight of Jerusalem" and "The Finale of a Venetian Masque at the Summer&#8217;s Dawn." The last, which Brown liked best, proved the hardest to sell and was eventually bought for &#163;150 in 1847 by Elizabeth Severn&#8217;s half-brother the Earl of Eglinton (Scott 429n10). <a href="#3">[Return to the letter]</a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="note4" name="note4"><sup>4</sup></a> John Henry Fuseli (1741-1825), Professor of Painting at the RA and Keeper of the RA Schools, had been Severn&#8217;s principal teacher at the Academy.

<p class="indent"><a id="note5" name="note5"><sup>5</sup></a> Sir David Wilkie (1785-1841), Scottish genre painter and the most popular artist of his time. His style changed radically after study visits to Italy and Spain between 1825 and 1828 and he lost his mass appeal. George IV, however, appointed him as his official portrait painter in 1830, after which he developed a lucrative practice as a portrait painter.
