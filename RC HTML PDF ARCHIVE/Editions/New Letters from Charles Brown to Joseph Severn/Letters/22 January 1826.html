<p class="indent"><a id="note2" name="note2"><sup>2</sup></a> Walter Savage Landor (1775-1864), English poet, classicist and essayist, who traveled to Rome on 23 January 1826 with a letter of introduction to Severn (Stillinger 248n3). Brown knew Landor well in Florence and was a witness to the acrimonious breakup of Landor&#8217;s marriage in March 1835 which drove him back to England soon after Brown&#8217;s own return. They kept in touch in England. Brown traveled to Torquay to see Landor in August 1837 and then brought him back for three days to Plymouth where he got to know Brown&#8217;s friend Colonel C. Hamilton Smith (R. H. Super, <em>Walter Savage Landor</em> [New York: New York UP, 1954] 251-2, 281). <a href="#2">[Return to the letter]</a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="note3" name="note3"><sup>3</sup></a> Landor set off from Florence by carriage on 23 January 1826 and stayed in Rome for one month (R. H. Super, <em>ibid</em>, 186). <a href="#3">[Return to the letter]</a></p>
