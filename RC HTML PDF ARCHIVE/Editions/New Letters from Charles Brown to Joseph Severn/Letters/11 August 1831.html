<p>Florence. 11 August 1831.</p>
</div>
<div id="greeting">
<p>My dear Severn,</p>
</div>
<div id="letBody">
<p class="body">Others have taught me to procrastinate in letter-writing, and therefore others ought not to find fault with my procrastination. This is no spiteful hit at you, for I esteem you an angel of a correspondent in comparison with most of my friends. I have been so drilled out of regularity, that now I can scarcely persuade myself to sit down with pen in hand, &#8212; unless some nonsense for myself runs in my head. At last, to put an end to my self reproaches, I have "screwed my courage to the sticking place,"<sup><a class="fn" href="#note2" name="2">2</a></sup> patting my idleness with the promise of sending you a very few lines, with another promise (to you) of a longer scrawl when my scrawling humour shall return.</p>
<p class="body">I am much interested in the news you give of your intention to go to England next spring, to pay a visit to your father;<sup><a class="fn" href="#note3" name="3">3</a></sup> for I am engaged next spring to pay a visit to my mother. Thus I entertain a thousand pleasant anticipations of our taking the journey together. Mind, I shall set off, (wind, weather, and cholera permitting,) in the first week of May, and I insist on going by the Simplon road, which I am anxious to see.</p>
<p class="body">You say I omitted to mention that I had paid for the stove. Look to my letter, &#8212; where I say you&#8217;re my debtor. What more explicit would a man have? Of course it was paid for before it left Florence, &#8212; who will trust me? Now I have received six Roman crowns from M<sup>r</sup> Wilson, and six more from M<sup>r</sup> Glasgow,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note4" name="4">4</a></sup> making exactly six pauls more than you ought to have sent; &#8212; so, if you can understand mercantile phrases, I am at this present D<sup>r</sup> to Jos. Severn six pauls. Pray request your wife to explain this to you, &#8212; for I feel confident it is too much for yourself alone. What a blessing is a wife! &#8212; and what a change we have had from hot to coolish weather! &#8212; not that the change is applicable in any horrid way, &#8212; all I mean is that &#8212; damn the application!</p>
<p class="body">Though I am now in a very lazy, hoity-toity fit, you must know that folks either pretend, or really think I am amazingly industrious. They look at my Hogarth&#8217;s heads, and say, &#8212; "Do 70 of these! &#8212; it is not in the patience of man!" Yet, for all their wise sayings, my 56th is in hand. To confess the truth, when I had done 47, I had a dastardly demon at my ear, whispering, &#8212; "They are good for nothing, &#8212; don&#8217;t go on, &#8212; or wait till you are more inclined to work." "Alas!" I replied, "I know, by experience, that to wait to be inclined to occupation, when a man has bread without it, is waiting for happiness when it is at one&#8217;s fingers&#8217; ends." So, down I sat, like a drudge, till I worked myself again into good humour with my work. In this way I drove off my demon.</p>
<p class="body">You press me to be intimate with the Glasgows. I called on him, and thanked him; but, as for intimacy, why he lives 2 miles from the Bolognese gate, and I two miles from the Roman one, &#8212; six miles apart. What! don&#8217;t you know I&#8217;m a country gentleman? Yes, I have a bit of a villa on the top of a hill, where I am half in love with a farmer&#8217;s girl, and where Charley gets tanned. By the by, he improves rapidly in music, and begins to like it more than he will confess. I took this rustication for six months, sometimes in town, sometimes on the hill, just as the whim suits. Now that the putrid fever is raging in Florence, I think, (as it attacks children more than others, &#8212; so they tell me,) I prefer trees to houses more than ever.</p>
<p class="body">I won&#8217;t talk to you about that infamous law-suit;<sup><a class="fn" href="#note5" name="5">5</a></sup> for I have seen your letter to Wilson, have said all I could, and he has written to you, &#8212; not that any thing we can do or say will avail. Now that I come to the last turn-over,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note6" name="6">6</a></sup> I insist on it this is a long scrawl, &#8212; by no means a few lines, which, in my idleness, I prognosticated. Truth is, writing begets writing. "Let no man," as Sterne says, "say, &#8212; I will write a duodecimo."<sup><a class="fn" href="#note7" name="7">7</a></sup> &#8212; See, &#8212; I have written a folio!</p>
<p class="body">Kirkup is remarkably well, and works almost as &lt;well&gt; closely as myself. M<sup>rs</sup> Wilson has had an inflammation in her bowels, is recovered, and gaining strength. I am rejoiced to hear such continued accounts of the good health of your children. Give a kiss, in my name, to your wife, and, in my ditto, a shake of the hand to each of our friends.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had a letter<sup><a class="fn" href="#note8" name="8">8</a></sup> from Hunt; &#8212; he is in good spirits, and, as far as I can judge, going on better, &#8212; with prudence, I would say, very well.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note9" name="9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>You unconscionable fellow! What can you mean by conjecturing I shall pay you another visit this autumn, when you have broken your intention of coming to me answer by return of post.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note10" name="10">10</a></sup></p>
