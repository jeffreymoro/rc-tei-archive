<h2>TO JOSEPH SEVERN<sup><a class="fn" href="#note1" name="1">1</a></sup></h2>
</div>
<div id="edDate">13 December 1828</div>
<div id="date">
<p>Florence. 13 Dec<sup>r</sup> 1828.</p>
</div>
<div id="greeting">
<p>My dear Severn,</p>
</div>
<div id="letBody">
<p class="body">Your two stoves will be despatched in a few days. They will be under the charge of Ginori&#8217;s<sup><a class="fn" href="#note2" name="2">2</a></sup> own Vetturale, to whom you are to pay the account, upon his delivering the stoves at your house. They are not yet weighed, therefore I cannot tell you what the charge will be, but the rate is fixed at 11 pauls per 100 lbs.</p>
<p class="body">It is very odd, as I have before explained to you the nature of our post office, that you will not agree to address your letters "Posta restante". You used to do so, but then, all at once, you chose the other mode. You did worse the last time, for you addressed it to Kirkup&#8217;s house, whence it was returned with a "<u>non c&#8217;&#232; pi&#250;</u>"<sup><a class="fn" href="#note3" name="3">3</a></sup> upon it, and lay in the office for four days before I could obtain it. None of my letters ever miscarried, when addressed "Posta restante." Are you sure that you wrote to me, before the 6<sup>th</sup> Dec<sup>r</sup>, after your return to Rome? Or did you only intend it? Or did the passage respecting the stoves, addressed to me, in Kirkup&#8217;s letter, make you imagine that you had written a letter to me?</p>
<p class="body">Charley sends his love to both of you, &#8212; as he expresses himself. I, more genteelly, request you will give a kiss, for my sake, to M<sup>rs</sup> Severn;<sup><a class="fn" href="#note4" name="4">4</a></sup> and whisper in her ear that I should like to roam to Rome to see her at home.</p>
<p class="body">Lady W. must certainly be crazy.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note5" name="5">5</a></sup> Now, however, as you have gone through all the nuisance and trouble of cutting acquaintanceship, I think you are right in not submitting to a revival of it. But you have others in Rome a thousand times more crazy than she can be. Such facts have come to my ears! Such goings on among your evangelicals and methodists! They are adopting every species of underhand means for the purpose of converting the Catholics, and I sincerely hope they will be discovered, and turned out of Rome. I have even heard they have a private printing-press there. Now these hypocrites, who scream out against those who dare to differ from the established creed in England, are doing the same, and worse, with their tracts translated into Italian, in another country, and under the nose of the very head of the Catholic religion.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note6" name="6">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="body">I have written to Dilke, as you told me, that he will have his picture before New year&#8217;s day.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note7" name="7">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="body">Kirkup has not been doing any thing particular lately; but he is preparing for something. Landor and family are very well. They would have something to say, if they knew of my writing. Notwithstanding my envy of your happiness, almost amounting to a wish, on my part, to try my luck, yet I will, if you think it may be an addition to your table comforts, send you some of the cooking receipts from D<sup>r</sup> Kitchener&#8217;s books,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note8" name="8">8</a></sup> which I have tried, and found excellent. For instance, Curry powder, and such savoury matters. I will give you one now, as this is the proper season for horse-radish: Half fill a bottle with scraped horse radish; add a little pepper to your liking, and, if you choose, a very little garlick; fill up the bottle with the best vinegar, let it stand ten days, shaking it every day, and strain it. This will cost a very few bagocchi[?]<sup><a class="fn" href="#note9" name="9">9</a></sup> , and is one of the D<sup>r</sup>&#8217;s best relishes, with the advantage of being remarkably wholesome. Let it be called "<u>Brown&#8217;s barba forte</u>!"<sup><a class="fn" href="#note10" name="10">10</a></sup></p>
<p class="body">I hope M<sup>rs</sup> Severn has got quite rid of her cold. We have had cold enough here, but I have not caught any of it.</p>
