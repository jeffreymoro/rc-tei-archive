<div id="greeting">
<p>My dear Severn,</p>
</div>
<div id="letBody">
<p class="body">It was about four years and a half ago that George Keats<sup><a class="fn" href="#note2" name="2">2</a></sup> sent to Dilke a defence of himself, refuting the "cruel charge" (as he called it) which I had made against him. Dilke sent me the purport of it,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note3" name="3">3</a></sup> with a request that I should make you and others acquainted with it. I did so, for I had no evidence by which I could contradict his bold assertions; though, as I told you in Rome,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note4" name="4">4</a></sup> when you put the question to me, I had no faith in his defence. Now, see the danger of villainy, and by what unlooked for chance it is laid bare. Having a bundle of papers, which belonged to Keats, part of his own hand writing, I lately opened it, on the supposition the papers might assist me in the Memoirs.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note5" name="5">5</a></sup> They were chiefly letters between Keats and his brothers. I threw George&#8217;s and Tom&#8217;s aside; but, after awhile, as if by an invisible hand, a passage in one of George&#8217;s own letters was turned towards me, which gave the lie direct to the ground work of his defence! I then searched further, and found an Acc<sup>t</sup> Curr<sup>t</sup> of Abbey&#8217;s;<sup><a class="fn" href="#note6" name="6">6</a></sup> when, by these two documents, I was instantly enabled to prove that every tittle of his defence was false, most impudently and atrociously false. I have sent these proofs to Dilke,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note7" name="7">7</a></sup> requesting him to promulgate them among our acquaintances, that I may be no longer suspected as a rash accuser. How he, who has been so positive in George&#8217;s favour from the first, will take it, I know not; &#8212; I expect his answer every day.</p>
<p class="body">You may rely on my obeying your orders respecting the papers you have promised. You knew Keats before I did, and perhaps you can give me some account of the developement of his mind as a poet.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note8" name="8">8</a></sup> He himself has talked to me a little on this subject; but, if possible, I would have further information. When did your acquaintance with him begin? Nearly two months since I wrote to Richards for assistance;<sup><a class="fn" href="#note9" name="9">9</a></sup> &#8212; no answer. If I knew how to direct a letter to Haslam,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note10" name="10">10</a></sup> I would apply to him; can you tell me his address? &#8212; or will you write to him? When I asked you about the terms for engraving, it never entered my head that you would offer to engrave his miniature;<sup><a class="fn" href="#note11" name="11">11</a></sup> if you can spare time, this offer of your&#8217;s is admirable. Respecting the original, in Miss Brawne&#8217;s possession, I am afraid you cannot have it. Were I to ask her for the loan of it, I believe she would send it; and that belief makes me the more delicate in asking for it; besides, I cannot run the hazard of its being lost on the way. No, Severn, I do not feel myself authorized in making that request. I will send you my copy,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note12" name="12">12</a></sup> and the drawing I made from your representation of him a little before his death; &#8212; together with that foolish little painting I have promised;<sup><a class="fn" href="#note13" name="13">13</a></sup> and all this in a short while. I have been very much occupied in M<sup>rs</sup> Medwin&#8217;s<sup><a class="fn" href="#note14" name="14">14</a></sup> affairs, battling with bankers, and lawyers, with my hands day after day full of documents in Courts of Law; let this be my apology, especially when I tell you I have been of service to that ill treated lady, with whom every one in Florence
sympathises. I have had much conscientious responsibility on my head, little able to think of any thing else. To return to Keats: Dilke urges me, as a proof to the world of my friendship for Keats, and as the only proof that I am not book-making, to declare, from the first, that I will not accept of one penny of the profits which may arise from the Memoirs. I never thought of profit, rather of loss, as I expected to pay a large sum for the engravings. To my mind Dilke&#8217;s advice is good; and I intend, you willing, to set out with a declaration that the book is an offering to his fame by you and me, both refusing to partake in the profits. The only question then is, who is to have them? Should there be any, ought we not to present them to his sister?<sup><a class="fn" href="#note15" name="15">15</a></sup> It is true she does not <u>want</u> them, and therefore we might dispose of them in some other way, something still conducive to his fame; &#8212; what say you?<sup><a class="fn" href="#note16" name="16">16</a></sup> &#8212; what have you to propose?</p>
<p class="body">Give my love to M<sup>rs</sup> Severn, and say I am eternally obliged to her for the copy she is making. I am equally surprised and rejoiced to hear of her excellent painting. Carlino also sends his love, with ten kisses to Claudia. Shall we make up a match between them? Their ages are suitable,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note17" name="17">17</a></sup> &#8212; ask M<sup>rs</sup> Severn what she thinks of it. Kirkup is very well, &#8212; all very well. Did I tell you Marina<sup><a class="fn" href="#note18" name="18">18</a></sup> is married? I cannot, literally <u>cannot</u> answer your question about Trelawny. I&#8217;m turned whist player.</p>
