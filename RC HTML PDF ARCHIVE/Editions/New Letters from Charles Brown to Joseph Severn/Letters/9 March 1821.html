<div id="greeting">
<p>My dear Severn,</p>
</div>
<div id="letBody">
<p class="body">Upon the whole your letter ending 14 &amp; 15<sup>th</sup> Feb<sup>y</sup> gave comfortable news.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note2" name="2">2</a></sup> Keats, tho' without hope of recovery, was calm; and your health was reinstated. Ever since I first read your account of his dreadful relapse, I have never been able to hope. It was then his death took place in my mind, &#8212; and inwardly I mourned for him as lost. That he should have so long lingered, and in pain of body, and in irritation of mind, was a new distress. The hearing of his sufferings was worse than of his hopeless state. I have sat and eagerly wished &amp; prayed to learn he was no more. Yet I was full of fears, as I read over your letter, that my wishes had &lt;at&gt; become realized. Let me have a lock of his hair, &#8212; should it end as my despair tells me it will. Taylor &amp; Haslam have had your letter, &#8212; I expect it back again to-morrow, when M<sup>r</sup> &amp; M<sup>rs</sup> Richards will be here. You refer to Keats' enemies, cursing them as his friend,<sup><a class="fn" href="#note3" name="3">3</a></sup> &#8212; I suppose you mean the villains of the Quarterly &amp; Blackwood. I understand, (&amp; indeed Keats told me,) how he intended to have treated Lockhart.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note4" name="4">4</a></sup> Now Lockhart was violently attacked in the London by John Scott for his atrocious libels on Keats &amp; others. Lockhart challenged Scott, but he was, (it seems to me,) afraid to fight. From this affair arose a quarrel between Scott &amp; one Christie, Lockhart's second, &#8212; they fought near Chalk farm, &amp; Scott is killed. Keats never liked Scott, but in such a cause, how hard that he should die? I tell you this, as it is in a degree part of Keats' history, &amp; possibly you have not heard it. &#8212; They are in good health next door.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note5" name="5">5</a></sup> M<sup>rs</sup> B-- saw your letter, but not her daughter, from
whom the worst is kept back, in (to my mind) a very ill judged way. Meanwhile she fears perhaps worse than is supposed.<sup><a class="fn" href="#note6" name="6">6</a></sup> I observe her gaiety is become boisterous, &#8212; fitter {to make} one start rather than laugh; and, at t{imes she} seems sinking under apprehension. &#8212; H{unt is} getting better, &#8212; he has been extremely {ill, and} asked to fill a page, &amp; you will be {glad to have it. &#8212;} I heard of your friend Holmes two days {ago, &#8212; I went} about to meet him, (hearing he was walki{ng with} Hunt on the heath,) to ask what he had to sa{y} to you, &amp; how your family are, &#8212; but I missed him. &#8212; I have just been next door{, &#8212;}M<sup>rs</sup> B-- sends her remembrance to you, &#8212; Miss B said not a word, and looked so incapable of speaking, that I regretted having mentioned my writing to you before her. I have so many dull thoughts coming across me at every line, that I confess that it is an irksome task to write to Severn. Yet had I any thing more to say, I would not spare myself, for your sake; for know, my dear Severn, I feel towards you as a brother for your kindness to our brother Keats.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="note1" name="note1"><sup>1</sup></a> Printed: Sharp 87-88 with errors and omissions, and reproduced in Stillinger 71-73. The letter arrived at Harvard shortly after Stillinger published his edition (MS: Harvard, MS ENG 1434 [137]). The outer page contains Leigh Hunt's letter to Severn of 8 March 1821 (Sharp 86-87 with facsimile). Information on John Taylor, William Haslam, Edward Holmes and other important figures mentioned in this letter is given in footnotes to subsequent letters. <a href="#1">[Return to the letter]</a></p>

<p class="indent"><a id="note3" name="note3"><sup>3</sup></a> Brown was always more convinced than Severn that the harsh critical attacks on Keats were the cause of his premature death (see, for example, KC, ii. 95-96). Severn had not, in fact, referred to this matter in his letters to Brown but only in those to Taylor and, briefly, to Mrs. Brawne (KC, i. 180 and 188). <a href="#3">[Return to the letter]</a></p>
