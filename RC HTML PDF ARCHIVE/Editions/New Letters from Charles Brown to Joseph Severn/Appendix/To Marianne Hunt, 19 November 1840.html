<div id="greeting">
<p>My dear M<sup>rs</sup> Hunt,</p>
</div>
<div id="letBody">
<p class="body">Last night I received your pretty note, and by the enclosed P.S. you will perceive that, after all, you forgot to give me your address. I send this to Carlino to be forwarded. By another enclosure you will also perceive that I have obeyed your request, in a few lines of the original composition of "Lamia."</p>
<p class="body">Does Hunt still write for the "Monthly Chronicle?"<sup><a class="fn" href="#note2" name="2">2</a></sup> I am about to send to that Magazine the "Life of Keats". I am anxious to know, if convenient by return of post, Hunt&#8217;s influence there, and his advice.</p>
<p class="body">Remember me most kindly to him, and hoping you will keep out of bed, except duly at night-tide.</p>

<div id="closing">
<p class="close">I am ever,<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Your&#8217;s most truly,<br/>
