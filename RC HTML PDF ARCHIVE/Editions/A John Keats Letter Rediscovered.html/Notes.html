<p><a name="one" id="one">1.</a> <i>The Letters of John Keats</i>, ed. Hyder Edward Rollins (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1958), I, 225n. This is not the letter referred to in "A Lost Keats Letter: Genuine or Spurious?" by J. C. Maxwell in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 8 (December 1961), 474, in which Keats is supposed to have told of Charles Lamb falling downstairs and quoting "Iser, rolling rapidly." News of the find by Barbara Jastrebsky and the sale of the letter in May 1996 has now been reported by Betty Gilliam in "Letter from famous poet found at Avoca," <i>Altavista Journal</i>, I (1 May 1996), 9, and "John Keats' letter brings $70,000," <i>Altavista Journal</i>, I (22 May 1996), 6. <a href="#onea">return</a></p>

<p><a name="six" id="six">6.</a> See <i>The Letters of John Keats</i>, ed. Rollins, I, 191, 196, 206, regarding papers containing Keats's reviews of plays. <a href="#sixa">return</a></p>
<p><a name="seven" id="seven">7.</a> Influenced by his love of Chaucer and Spenser and by the Spenserians, Keats was fond of archaic and obsolete words and usages. <i>Geld</i> here may mean, as defined by the <i>OED</i>, simply "to cut out portions of a book," or "to mutilate a book . . . by excising certain portions, especially objectionable or obscene passages." Both meanings are obsolete. Keats did make changes in <i>Endymion</i>, as he did for the publication of "The Eve of St. Agnes," when he was induced to cut out certain passages his friends thought too explicit. <a href="#sevena">return</a></p>
<p><a name="eight" id="eight">8.</a> Keats writes his publisher, John Taylor, 23 January 1818, that the artist Benjamin Robert Haydon has suggested an engraving of a chalk portrait to be done by him (<i>Letters</i>, ed. Rollins, I, 208). <a href="#eighta">return</a></p>

<p><a name="ten" id="ten">10.</a> A garbled version of these lines, attributed by Dalton Barham to James Smith instead of Horace Smith, is given by William G. Lane in "Keats and 'the Smith and Theodore Hook Squad,'" <i>MLN</i>, 70 (1955), 22-24. <a href="#tena">return</a></p>
<p><a name="eleven" id="eleven">11.</a> The last line is cramped at the bottom of the page, and a break in the paper occurs before "mermaid." <a href="#elevena">return</a></p>
