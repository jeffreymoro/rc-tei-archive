<h3>Percy Bysshe Shelley, "Ode to the West Wind" (in <a href="/editions/mws/lastman/bibliog.htm#norton">Reiman and Powers</a> edn.)</h3><br/><h3>I</h3><p>O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being,<br/>
    Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead<br/>
    Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,<br/></p><p>Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,<br/>
    Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O Thou,<br/>
    Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed<br/></p><p>The winged seeds, where they lie cold and low,<br/>
    Each like a corpse within its grave, until<br/>
    Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow<br/></p><p>Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill<br/>
    (Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)<br/>
    With living hues and odours plain and hill:<br/></p><p>Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;<br/>
    Destroyer and Preserver; hear, O hear!<br/></p><h3>II</h3><p>Thou on whose stream, 'mid the steep sky's commotion,<br/>
    Loose clouds like Earth's decaying leaves are shed,<br/>
    Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,<br/></p><p>Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread<br/>
    On the blue surface of thine aery surge,<br/>
    Like the bright hair uplifted from the head<br/></p><p>Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge<br/>
    Of the horizon to the zenith's height,<br/>
    The locks of the approaching storm. Thou Dirge<br/></p><p>Of the dying year, to which this closing night<br/>
    Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre,<br/>
    Vaulted with all thy congregated might<br/></p><p>Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere<br/>
    Black rain and fire and hail will burst: O hear!<br/></p><h3>III</h3><p><a name="villas" id="villas">Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams</a><br/>
    The blue Mediterranean, where he lay,<br/>
    Lulled by the coil of his chrystalline streams,<br/></p><p>Beside a pumice isle in Baiae's bay,<br/><b>And saw in sleep old palaces and towers<br/>
    Quivering within the wave's intenser day</b>,<br/></p><p>All overgrown with azure moss and flowers<br/>
    So sweet, the sense faints picturing them! Thou<br/>
    For whose path the Atlantic's level powers<br/></p><p>Cleave themselves into chasms, while far below<br/>
    The sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear<br/>
    The sapless foliage of the ocean, know<br/></p><p>Thy voice, and suddenly grow grey with fear,<br/>
    And tremble and despoil themselves: O hear!<br/></p><h3>IV</h3><p>If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;<br/>
    If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;<br/>
    A wave to pant beneath thy power, and share<br/></p><p>The impulse of thy strength, only less free<br/>
    Than thou, O Uncontrollable! If even<br/>
    I were as in my boyhood, and could be<br/></p><p>The comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven,<br/>
    As then, when to outstrip thy skiey speed<br/>
    Scarce seemed a vision; I would ne'er have striven<br/></p><p>As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.<br/>
    Oh! lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!<br/><a name="thorns" id="thorns">I fall upon <b>the thorns of life</b>!</a> I bleed!<br/></p><p>A heavy weight of hours has chained and bowed<br/>
    One too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.<br/></p><h3>V</h3><p>Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is:<br/>
    What if my leaves are falling like its own!<br/>
    The tumult of thy mighty harmonies<br/></p><p>Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone,<br/>
    Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,<br/>
    My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!<br/></p><p>Drive my dead thoughts over the universe<br/>
    Like withered leaves to quicken a new birth!<br/>
    And, by the incantation of this verse,<br/></p><p>Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearth<br/>
    Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!<br/>
    Be through my lips to unawakened Earth<br/></p><p>The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind,<br/>
    If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?<br/></p>
