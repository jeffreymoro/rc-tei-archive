<h3>Milton, <a href="/editions/mws/lastman/bibliog.htm#milton">L'Allegro and Il Penseroso</a></h3><br/><h3>L'Allegro</h3><a name="top" id="top">HENCE,</a> loathed Melancholy,<br/>
&#160;&#160; Of <i>Cerberus</i> and blackest midnight born<br/>
In <i>Stygian</i> Cave forlorn.<br/>
&#160;&#160; 'Mongst horrid shapes, and shrieks, and sights unholy,<br/>
Find out some uncouth cell,<br/>
&#160;&#160; Where brooding darkness spreads his jealous wings,<br/>
And the night-Raven sings;<br/>
&#160;&#160; There, under <i>Ebon</i> shades, and low-brow'd Rocks,<br/>
As ragged as thy Locks,<br/>
&#160;&#160; In dark <i>Cimmerian</i> desert ever dwell.<br/>
But <a href="#textmilt">com</a>, thou Goddess fair and free,<br/>
In Heav'n ycleap'd <i>Euphrosyne</i>,<br/>
And by men, heart-easing Mirth;<br/>
Whom lovely <i>Venus</i> at a birth<br/>
With two sister Graces more<br/>
To Ivy-crowned <i>Bacchus</i> bore:<br/>
Or whether (as <a href="#textmilt">som</a> Sager sing)<br/>
The frolick Wind that breathes the Spring,<br/><i>Zephir</i> with <i>Aurora</i> pIaying,<br/>
As he met her once a Maying,<br/>
There on Beds of Violets blew,<br/>
And fresh-blown Roses washt in dew,<br/>
Fill'd her with thee a daughter fair,<br/>
So bucksom, blith, and debonair.<br/>
Haste thee, nymph, and bring with thee<br/>
Jest and youthful Jollity,<br/>
Quips and Cranks, and wanton Wiles,<br/>
Nods, and Becks, and Wreathed Smiles,<br/>
Such as hang on <i>Hebe's</i> cheek,<br/>
And love to live in dimple sleek;<br/>
Sport that wrincled Care derides,<br/>
And Laughter holding both his sides.<br/>
Com, and trip it as you go<br/>
On the light fantastick toe,<br/>
And in thy right hand lead with thee,<br/>
The Mountain Nymph, sweet Liberty;<br/>
And if I give thee honour due,<br/>
Mirth, admit me of thy crue,<br/>
To live with her, and live with thee,<br/>
In unreproved pleasures free;<br/>
To hear the Lark begin his flight,<br/>
And singing startle the dull night,<br/>
From his watch-towre in the skies,<br/>
Till the dappled dawn doth rise;<br/>
Then to com in spite of sorrow,<br/>
And at my window bid good morrow,<br/>
Through the Sweet-Briar, or the Vine,<br/>
Or the twisted Eglantine;<br/>
While the Cock with lively din,<br/>
Scatters the rear of darknes thin,<br/>
And to the stack, or the Barn <a href="#textmilt">dore</a>,<br/>
Stoutly struts his Dames before:<br/>
Oft list'ning how the Hounds and Horn<br/>
Chearly rouse the slumbering morn,<br/>
From the side of som Hoar Hill,<br/>
Through the high wood echoing shrill.<br/>
Som time walking not unseen<br/>
By Hedge-row Elms, on Hillocks green,<br/>
Right against the Eastern gate<br/>
Where the great Sun begins his state,<br/>
Roab'd in flames, and Amber light,<br/>
The clouds in thousand Liveries dight;<br/>
While the Plowman neer at hand,<br/>
Whistles <a href="#textmilt">ore</a> the Furrow'd Land,<br/>
And the Milkmaid singeth blithe,<br/>
And the Mower whets his sithe,<br/>
And every Shepherd tells his tale<br/>
Under the Hawthorn in the dale.<br/>
Streit mine eye hath caught new pleasures<br/>
Whilst the <a href="#textmilt">Lantskip</a> round it measures,<br/>
Russet Lawns, and Fallows Gray,<br/>
Where the nibbling flocks do stray,<br/>
Mountains on whose barren brest<br/>
The labouring clouds do often rest:<br/>
Meadows trim with Daisies <a href="#textmilt">pide</a>,<br/>
Shallow Brooks, and Rivers wide,<br/>
Towers, and Battlements it sees<br/>
Bosom'd high in tufted Trees,<br/>
Wher perhaps som beauty lies,<br/>
The Cynosure of neighbouring eyes.<br/>
Hard by, a Cottage chimney smokes,<br/>
From betwixt two aged Okes,<br/>
Where <i>Corydon</i> and <i>Thyrsis</i> met<br/>
Are at their savory dinner set<br/>
Of Hearbs, and other Country Messes,<br/>
Which the neat-handed <i>Phillis</i> dresses;<br/>
And then in haste her Bowre she leaves,<br/>
With <i>Thestylis</i> to bind the Sheaves;<br/>
Or if the earlier season lead<br/>
To the tann'd Haycock in the Mead,<br/>
Some times with secure delight<br/>
The up-land Hamlets will invite,<br/>
When the merry Bells ring round,<br/>
And the jocund rebecks sound<br/>
To many a youth, and many a maid,<br/>
Dancing in the Chequer'd shade;<br/>
And young and old com forth to play<br/>
On a Sunshine Holyday,<br/>
Till the live-long day-light fail,<br/>
Then to the Spicy Nut-brown Ale,<br/>
With stories told of many a feat,<br/>
How <i>Faery Mab</i> the junkets eat,<br/>
She was pincht, and pull'd she sed,<br/>
And by Friars Lanthorn led<br/>
Tells how the drudging <i>Goblin</i> swet,<br/>
To earn his Cream-bowle duly set,<br/>
When in one night, ere glimps of morn,<br/>
His shadowy Flale hath thresh'd the Corn,<br/>
That ten day-labourers could not end,<br/>
Then lies him down the Lubbar Fend,<br/>
And stretch'd out all the Chimney's length,<br/>
Basks at the fire his hairy strength;<br/>
And Crop-full out of dores he flings,<br/>
Ere the first Cock his Mattin rings.<br/>
Thus done the Tales, to bed they creep,<br/>
By whispering Winds soon lull'd asleep.<br/>
Towered Cities please us then,<br/>
And the busie humm of men,<br/>
Where throngs of Knights and Barons bold,<br/>
In weeds of Peace high triumphs hold,<br/>
With store of Ladies, whose bright eies<br/>
Rain influence, and judge the prize,<br/>
Of Wit or Arms, while both contend<br/>
To win her Grace whom all commend.<br/>
There let <i>Hymen</i> oft appear<br/>
In Saffron robe, with Taper clear,<br/>
And pomp, and feast, and revelry,<br/>
With mask, and antique Pageantry,<br/>
Such sights as youthful Poets dream<br/>
On Summer eeves by haunted stream.<br/>
Then to the well-trod stage anon,<br/>
If <i>Jonsons</i> learned Sock be on,<br/>
Or sweetest <i>Shakespear</i> fancies childe,<br/>
Warble his native Wood-notes wilde.<br/>
And ever against eating Cares,<br/>
Lap me in soft <i>Lydian</i> Aires,<br/>
Married to immortal verse<br/>
Such as the meeting soul may pierce<br/>
In notes, with many a winding bout<br/>
Of lincked sweetness long drawn out,<br/>
With wanton heed, and giddy cunning,<br/>
The melting voice through mazes running;<br/><a name="untwist" id="untwist"> </a><b>Untwisting all the chains that ty<br/>
The hidden soul of harmony.</b><br/>
That <i>Orpheus</i> self may heave his head<br/>
From golden slumber on a bed<br/>
Of heaped <i>Elysian</i> flowres, and hear<br/>
Such streins as would have won the ear<br/>
Of <i>Pluto</i>, to have quite set free<br/>
His half regain'd <i>Eurydice</i>.<br/>
These delights, if thou canst give,<br/>
        Mirth with thee, I mean to live.<br/><br/><hr/><h3>Il Penseroso</h3><p>HENCE, vain deluding joyes,<br/>
&#160;&#160; The brood of Folly without father bred,<br/>
How little you bested,<br/>
&#160;&#160; Or fill the fixed mind with all your toyes;<br/>
Dwell in some idle brain,<br/>
&#160;&#160; And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess,<br/>
As thick and numberless<br/>
&#160;&#160; As the gay motes that people the Sun Beams,<br/>
Or likest hovering dreams<br/>
&#160;&#160; The fickle Pensioners of <i>Morpheus</i> train.<br/>
But, hail, thou Goddess, sage and holy,<br/>
Hail divinest Melancholy,<br/>
Whose Saintly visage is too bright<br/>
To hit the Sense of human sight;<br/>
And therefore to our weaker view,<br/>
Ore laid with black staid Wisdoms hue.<br/>
Black, but such as in esteem,<br/>
Prince <i>Memnons</i> sister might beseem,<br/>
Or that starr'd <i>Ethiope</i> Queen that strove<br/>
To set her beautys praise above<br/>
The Sea Nymphs, and their powers offended,<br/>
Yet thou art higher far descended,<br/>
Thee bright-hair'd <i>Vesta</i> long of yore,<br/>
To solitary <i>Saturn</i> bore;<br/>
His daughter she (in <i>Saturns</i> raign,<br/>
Such mixture was not held a stain)<br/>
Oft in glimmering Bowres, and glades<br/>
He met her, and in secret shades<br/>
Of woody <i>Ida's</i> inmost grove,<br/>
While yet there was no fear of <i>Jove</i>.<br/><a href="#textmilt">Compensive</a> Nun, devout and pure,<br/>
Sober, stedfast, and demure,<br/>
All in a robe of darkest grain,<br/>
Flowing with majestick train,<br/>
And sable stole of <i>Cipres</i> Lawn,<br/>
Over thy decent shoulders drawn.<br/><a href="#textmilt">Com</a>, but keep thy wonted state,<br/>
With eev'n step, and musing gait,<br/>
And looks commercing with the skies,<br/>
Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes:<br/>
There held in holy passion still,<br/>
Forget thy self to Marble, till<br/>
With a sad Leaden downward cast,<br/>
Thou fix them on the earth as fast.<br/>
And joyn with thee calm Peace, and Quiet,<br/>
Spare Fast, that oft with gods doth diet,<br/>
And hears the Muses in a ring<br/>
Ay round about <i>Joves</i> altar sing.<br/>
And adde to these retired leasure,<br/>
That in trim Gardens takes his pleasure;<br/>
But first, and chiefest, with thee bring,<br/>
Him that yon soars on golden wing,<br/>
Guiding the fiery-wheeled throne,<br/>
The Cherub Contemplation,<br/>
And the mute Silence hist along,<br/>
'Less <i>Philomel</i> will deign a Song,<br/>
In her sweetest, saddest plight,<br/>
Smoothing the rugged brow of night,<br/>
While <i>Cynthia</i> checks her Dragon yoke,<br/>
Gently o're th'accustom'd Oke;<br/>
Sweet Bird that shunn'st the noise of folly,<br/>
Most musical, most Melancholy!<br/>
Thee Chauntress oft the Woods among,<br/>
I woo to hear thy Even-Song;<br/>
And missing thee, I walk unseen<br/>
On the dry smooth-shaven Green,<br/>
To behold the wandering Moon,<br/>
Riding neer her highest noon,<br/>
Like one that had bin led astray<br/>
Through the Heav'ns wide pathless way;<br/>
And oft, as if her head she bow'd,<br/>
Stooping through a fleecy cloud.<br/>
Oft on a Plat of rising ground,<br/>
I hear the far-off <i>Curfeu</i> sound,<br/>
Over some wide-water'd shoar,<br/>
Swinging slow with sullen roar;<br/>
Or if the Ayr will not permit,<br/>
Som still removed place will fit,<br/>
Where glowing Embers through the room<br/>
Teach light to counterfeit a gloom,<br/>
Far from all resort of mirth,<br/>
Save the Cricket on the hearth,<br/>
Or the Belmans drowsie charm,<br/>
To bless the dores from nightly harm.<br/>
Or let my Lamp at midnight hour,<br/>
Be seen in some high lonely Towr,<br/>
Where I may oft out-watch the <i>Bear</i>,<br/>
With thrice great <i>Hermes</i>, or unsphear<br/>
The spirit of <i>Plato</i> to unfold<br/>
What Worlds, or what vast Regions hold<br/>
The immortal mind that hath forsook<br/>
Her mansion in this fleshly nook:<br/>
And of those <i>Daemons</i> that are found<br/>
In fire, air, flood, or under ground,<br/>
Whose power hath a true consent<br/>
With Planet, or with Element.<br/>
Some time let Gorgeous Tragedy<br/>
In Sceptr'd Pall com sweeping by,<br/>
Presenting <i>Thebs</i>, or <i>Pelops</i> line,<br/>
Or the tale of <i>Troy</i> divine,<br/>
Or what (though rare) of later age,<br/>
Ennobled hath the Buskind stage.<br/>
But, O sad Virgin, that thy power<br/>
Might raise <i>Musaeus</i> from his bower;<br/>
Or bid the soul of <i>Orpheus</i> sing<br/>
Such notes as warbled to the string,<br/>
Drew Iron tears down <i>Pluto's</i> cheek,<br/>
And made Hell grant what Love did seek;<br/>
Or call up him that left half-told<br/>
The story of <i>Cambuscan</i> bold,<br/>
Of <i>Camball</i>, and of <i>Algarsife</i>,<br/>
And who had <i>Canace</i> to wife,<br/>
That own'd the vertuous Ring and Glass,<br/>
And of the wondrous Hors of Brass<br/>
On which the <i>Tartar</i> King did ride;<br/>
And if ought els, great <i>Bards</i> beside,<br/>
In sage and solemn tunes have sung,<br/>
Of Turneys and of Trophies hung;<br/>
Of Forests, and inchantments drear,<br/>
Where more is meant than meets the ear,<br/>
Thus night oft see me in thy pale career,<br/>
Till civil-suited Morn appeer,<br/>
Not trickt and frounc't, as she was wont<br/>
With the Attick Boy to hunt,<br/>
But Cherchef't in a comely Cloud,<br/>
While rocking Winds are Piping loud,<br/>
Or usher'd with a shower still,<br/>
When the gust hath blown his fill,<br/>
Ending on the rustling Leaves,<br/>
With minute drops from off the Eaves.<br/>
And when the Sun begins to fling<br/>
His flaring beams, me Goddess bring<br/>
To arched walks of twilight groves,<br/>
And shadows brown that <i>Sylvan</i> loves<br/>
Of Pine, or monumental Oake,<br/>
Where the rude Ax with heaved stroke,<br/>
Was never heard the Nymphs to daunt,<br/>
Or fright them from their hallow'd haunt.<br/>
There in close covert by some Brook,<br/>
Where no prophaner eye may look,<br/>
Hide me from Day's garish eie,<br/>
While the Bee with Honied thie,<br/>
That at her flowry work doth sing,<br/>
And the Waters murmuring<br/>
With such consort as they keep,<br/>
Entice the dewy-feather'd Sleep;<br/>
And let some strange mysterious dream,<br/>
Wave at his Wings in Airy stream,<br/>
Of lively portrature display'd,<br/>
Softly on my eye-lids laid.<br/>
And as I wake, sweet musick breath<br/>
Above, about, or underneath,<br/>
Sent by som spirit to mortals good,<br/>
Or th'unseen Genius of the Wood.<br/>
But let my due feet never fail,<br/>
To walk the studious Cloysters pale.<br/>
And love the high embowed Roof,<br/>
With antick Pillars massy proof,<br/>
And storied Windows richly dight,<br/>
Casting a dimm religious light.<br/>
There let the pealing Organ blow,<br/>
To the full-voic'd Quire below,<br/>
In Service high, and Anthems cleer,<br/>
As may with sweetness, through mine ear,<br/>
Dissolve me into exstasies,<br/>
And bring all Heav'n before mine eyes.<br/>
And may at last my weary age<br/>
Find out the peacefull hermitage,<br/>
The Hairy Gown and Mossy Cell,<br/>
Where I may sit and rightly spell<br/>
Of every Star that Heav'n doth shew,<br/>
And every Herb that sips the dew;<br/>
Till old experience do attain<br/>
To something like Prophetic strain.<br/>
These pleasures, <i>Melancholy</i>, give,<br/>
    And I with thee will choose to live.</p><br/><p>(<a name="textmilt" id="textmilt"> </a>com = come; som = some; dore = door; ore = o'er; Lantskip= Landscape; pide = pied; Compensive = Come pensive) <br/><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
