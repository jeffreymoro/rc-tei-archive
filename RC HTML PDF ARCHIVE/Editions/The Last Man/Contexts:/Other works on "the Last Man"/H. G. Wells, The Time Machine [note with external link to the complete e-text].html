<p>H. G. Wells published <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/browse-mixed-new?id=WelTime&amp;tag=public&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed"><i>The Time Machine</i> [external link (UVa ETC)]</a> in 1895, the science-fictional story of a time traveler who visits the future and sees first the strange devolution, and then (as in <i>The Last Man</i>) the eventual extinction of the human race. For the influence of Darwin's theory of evolution on Well's dystopian fiction, see <a href="/editions/mws/lastman/bibliog.htm#stafford">Fiona Stafford</a>.</p><p>The theoretical complexities of time travel, which are related to the prophetic tradition in speculative fiction--as seen in Mary Shelley's <a href="/editions/mws/lastman/intro.htm#pages">"sybilline" frame</a> for <i>The Last Man</i>--have continued to play a central role in popular science fiction.</p>
