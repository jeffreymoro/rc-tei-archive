    seven deadly sins (invidia) when you talk of summer weather: cloud, rain, fogs, dirt
    such are the alternations of our genial sky--it is, this blessed paese a prison
    &amp; the worst of prisons--God only knows when I shall revisit my dolce nido, but I
    sigh bitterly for it--this winter at Rome instead of here--I may not dream of such
    bliss.--<a name="novello" id="novello"> </a>My great consolation here is music;
    the music with Vincenzo &amp; his friends provide me: I go to the chapel; <b>[1]</b>
    I have been with Mrs. W. [<i>Williams</i>] to a concert that they have established
    &amp; I hear it at his house. He has made me a convert to Haydn--Do you know the
    piece, <a href="/editions/mws/lastman/haydn.htm">"A New Created World"--in his
        Creation</a>; what a wonderful stream of sound it is; it puts me in mind of

    Parliament is met here and Canning <b>[1]</b> is making a figure--he does not seem
    at all to like the part he was forced to play with regard to Spain, &amp; said in <a
        name="house" id="house"> </a>the House that he would not tacitly acquiesce in
    such another invasion as that of the French at the risk of any war. They are
    introducing some amelioration in the state of the slaves in some parts of the West
    Indies--during the debate on the subject <a
        href="/editions/mws/lastman/speech.htm">Canning paid a compliment to
        Frankenstein</a> in a manner sufficiently pleasing to me. The town however is
    not full as yet, &amp; the Winter is not begun--And although the Opera house is
    crowded I have not seen there any of the first Grandees. . .

    credited for his liberal policies while he served as Foreign Secretary, from 1822 to
    1827. The Congress of Verona (October 1822) of the Quadruple Alliance gave France a
    mandate to suppress the Spanish revolution begun in 1820 [. . . .] On 31 August 1823
    the revolutionaries were defeated, and Ferdinand VII was restored to the Spanish
    throne. Canning, however, had refused to cooperate with the other members of the
    Alliance in this action, and this led to the dissolution of the Alliance. Canning
    alluded to <i>Frankenstein</i> on 16 March 1824 (<a

    Windsor <b>[1]</b>--where I rambled to my old haunts. Windsor--Eton &amp;c is the
    only spot of English ground for which I have an affection. We were delighted each
    morning too by hearing the King's band practise for an hour &amp; a half--the finest
    band in the world perhaps consisting of 44 wind instruments, whose effect is so much
    finer than those scraping strings--In sacred pieces they rose to the majesty of an
        <a href="/editions/mws/lastman/organ.htm">organ</a>--in lighter airs their
    delicate execution seemed the work of fayry powers. The grand disappointment was
    that I could not obtai[n] a sight of my liege Lord his Sacred Majesty--It was too
    provoking--I prepared my best curls &amp; smiles &amp; curtsey &amp; walked up Each
    day to the castle with my companion vainly--The servants in waiting began to know us
    &amp; one old fat footman commiserated our fate mightily when we asked for the last
    time whether his Majesty was expected &amp; told him that it was our last chance--"I
    am quite sorry, ladies--I am sure his majesty would have been glad to see you--he is
    always glad to see &amp; be seen by ladies."--What a flattering prospect--the while
    thus we fished the object of our angling was seated calmly in a boat fishing for
        <i>less</i> fish on <a href="/editions/mws/lastman/tvwater.htm">Virginia
        Water</a>. <b>[2]</b></p><p>Notes</p><p>1. Mary Shelley visited Windsor

    know not why one fancies change must necessarily ensue--&amp; one looks forward to
    it with a feeling of hope--Of themselves the breezes &amp; fresh life is
    exhilirating--every one looks more cheerful &amp; smiling--they congregate like
    swallows--it is {a} matter of wonder sometimes that our aristocrats leave their
    delightful country residences just at the time when they are most delightful to
    loose the bright May days in town pleasures--but I do not think I should like Paris
    s[o] well as London or exchange my pretty suburb for the neighbourhood of the
    Tuileries.</p><p>(feb. 7) I now her that William has got my book from <a
        href="/editions/mws/lastman/colburn.htm">Colburn</a><b>[1]</b>--&amp; I
    hope to learn today that he has sent it to you. The curiosity ex{c}ited by the title
    frightens me, because of the disappointment that must of course follow. You can form
    no idea of the difficulty of the subject--the necessity of making the scene {general
    [deleted]} universal to all mankind and of combining this with a particular interest
    which must constitute the novel--If I had at the commencement fore seen the
    excessive trouble &amp; then (much worse) the state of imperfection in which partly
    for want of time I was obliged to leave it--I should never have had the courage to
    begin. . . .</p><p>NOTE</p><p>1. Godwin, Journal, records that <i>The Last
