But this oil painting (now in the <a href="/editions/mws/lastman/walker.htm">Walker Art Gallery</a> in Liverpool) dates from 1849 (see <a href="/editions/mws/lastman/bibliog.htm#feaver">Feaver</a>). The old man stands before what appears to be a vacant seaside town, the dark sun fades in front of him, and the funereal body of a woman lies behind him.</p>
