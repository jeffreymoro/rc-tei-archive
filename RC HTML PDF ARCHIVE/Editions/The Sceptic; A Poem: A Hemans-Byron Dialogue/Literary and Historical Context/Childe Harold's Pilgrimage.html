    They won, and pass'd away&#8212;is this the whole?<br/>
    A school-boy's tale, the wonder of an hour!<br/>
    The warrior's weapon and the sophist's stole<br/>

    Of a dark eye in woman! Far along,<br/>
    From peak to peak, the rattling crags among<br/>
    Leaps the live thunder! Not from one lone cloud<br/>
    But every mountain now hath found a tongue,<br/>
    And Jura answers, through a misty shroud,<br/>

    A portion of the tempest and of thee!<br/>
    How the lit lake shines, a phosphoric sea,<br/>
    And the big rain comes dancing to the earth!<br/>
    And now again 'tis black,&#8212;and now, the glee<br/>

    Heights, which appear as lovers who have parted<br/>

    That they can meet no more, though broken hearted;<br/>
    Though in their souls, which thus each other thwarted,<br/>
    Love was the very root of the fond rage<br/>
    Which blighted their life's bloom and then departed:&#8212;<br/>
    Itself expired, but leaving them an age<br/>
    Of years all winters,&#8212;war within themselves to wage.</p>

    For here, not one, but many, make their play,<br/>
    And fling their thunder bolts from hand to hand,<br/>
    Flashing and cast around; of all the band,<br/>
    The brightest through these parted hills hath fork'd<br/>
    Its lightnings,&#8212;as if he did understand,<br/>

    To make these felt and feeling, well may be<br/>
    Things that have made me watchful; the far roll<br/>
    Of your departing voices, is the knoll<br/>
    Of what in me is sleepless,&#8212;if I rest.<br/>
    But where of ye, oh tempests! is the goal?<br/>
    Are ye like those within the human breast?<br/>
    Or do ye find, at length, like eagles, some high nest?</p>
    <p class="nolineheight">97</p>
    <p class="nolineheight">Could I embody and unbosom now<br/>
    That which is most within me,&#8212;could I wreak<br/>
    My thoughts upon expression, and thus throw<br/>
    Soul, heart, mind, passions, feelings, strong or weak,<br/>
    All that I would have sought, and all I seek,<br/>
    Bear, know, feel and yet breathe&#8212;into one word,<br/>
    And that one word were Lightning, I would speak;<br/>
    But as it is, I live and die unheard,<br/>
    With a most voiceless thought, sheathing it as a sword.</p>
    <p class="nolineheight">98</p>
    <p class="nolineheight">The morn is up again, the dewy morn,<br/>
    With breath all incense, and with cheek all bloom,<br/>
    Laughing the clouds away with playful scorn,<br/>
    And living as if earth contain'd no tomb,&#8212;<br/>
    And glowing into day; we may resume<br/>
    The march of our existence: and thus I,<br/>
    Still on thy shores, fair Leman! may find room<br/>
    And food for meditation, nor pass by<br/>
    Much, that may give us pause, if pondered fittingly.</p>

    And trees whose gums are poison; such the plants<br/>
    Which spring beneath her steps as Passion flies<br/>
    O'er the world's wilderness, and vainly pants<br/>
    For some celestial fruit forbidden to our wants.</p>
    <p class="nolineheight">121</p>
    <p class="nolineheight">Oh Love! No habitant of earth thou art&#8212;<br/>
    An unseen seraph, we believe in thee,<br/>
    A faith whose martyrs are the broken heart,<br/>
    But never yet hath seen, nor e'er shall see<br/>
    The naked eye, thy form, as it should be;<br/>
    The mind hath made thee, as it peopled heaven,<br/>
    Even with its own desiring phantasy,<br/>
    And to a thought such shape and image given,<br/>
    As haunts the unquench'd soul&#8212;parch'd&#8212;wearied&#8212;wrung&#8212;and riven.</p>
    <p class="nolineheight">122</p>
    <p class="nolineheight">Of its own beauty is the mind diseased,<br/>
    And fevers into false creation:&#8212;where,<br/>
    Where are the forms the sculptor's soul hath seized?<br/>
    In him alone. Can Nature show so fair?<br/>
    Where are the charms and virtues which we dare<br/>
    Conceive in boyhood and pursue as men,<br/>
    The unreach'd Paradise of our despair,<br/>
    Which o'er informs the pencil and the pen,<br/>
    And overpowers the page where it would bloom again?</p>
    <p class="nolineheight">123</p>
    <p class="nolineheight">Who loves, raves&#8212;'tis youth's frenzy&#8212;but the cure<br/>
    Is bitterer still: as charm by charm unwinds<br/>
    Which robed our idols, and we see too sure<br/>
    Nor worth nor beauty dwells from out the mind's<br/>
    Ideal shape of such; yet still it binds<br/>
    The fatal spell, and still it draws us on,<br/>
    Reaping the whirlwind from the oft-sown winds;<br/>
    The stubborn heart, its alchemy begun,<br/>
    Seems ever near the prize,&#8212;wealthiest when most undone.</p>

    Some phantom lures, such as we sought at first&#8212;<br/>
    But all too late,&#8212;so are we doubly curst.<br/>
    Love, fame, ambition, avarice&#8212;'tis the same,<br/>
    Each idle&#8212;and all ill&#8212;and none the worst&#8212;<br/>
    For all are meteors with a different name,<br/>
    And Death the sable smoke where vanishes the flame.</p>
    <p class="nolineheight">125</p>
    <p class="nolineheight">Few&#8212;none&#8212;find what they love or could have loved,<br/>
    Though accident, blind contact, and the strong<br/>
    Necessity of loving, have removed<br/>
    Antipathies&#8212;but to recur, ere long,<br/>
    Envonomed with irrevocable wrong;<br/>
    And Circumstance, that unspiritual god<br/>
    And miscreator, makes and helps along<br/>
    Our coming evils with a crutch-like rod,<br/>
    Whose touch turns Hope to dust,&#8212;the dust we all have trod.</p>
    <p class="nolineheight">126</p>
    <p class="nolineheight">Our life is a false nature&#8212;'tis not in<br/>
    The harmony of things,&#8212;this hard decree,<br/>
    This uneradicable taint of sin,<br/>
    The boundless upas, this all-blasting tree,<br/>
    Whose root is earth, whose leaves and branches be<br/>
    Disease, death, bondage&#8212;all the woes we see&#8212;<br/>
    And worse, the woes we see not&#8212;which throb through<br/>
    The immedicable souls, with heart-aches ever new.</p>
    <p class="nolineheight">127</p>
    <p class="nolineheight">Yet let us ponder boldly&#8212;'tis a base<br/>
    Abandonment of reason to resign<br/>
    Our right of thought&#8212;our last and only place<br/>
    Of refuge; this, at least, shall still be mine;<br/>
    Though from our birth the faculty divine<br/>
    Is chain'd and tortured&#8212;cabin'd, cribb'd confined,<br/>
    And bred in darkness, lest the truth should shine<br/>
    Too brightly on the unprepared mind,<br/>
    The beam pours in, for time and skill will couch the blind.</p>

    Through storm and darkness yawns the rending ground,<br/>
    The gulf is thick with phantoms, but the chief<br/>
    Seems royal still, though with her head discrown'd<br/>

    In the sad midnight, while they heart still bled,<br/>

    Its knell in princely ears, till the o'erstung<br/>
    Nations had arm'd in madness, the strange fate<br/>
