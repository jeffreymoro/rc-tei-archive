    My Dear Sir<br/>
    <br/>
    I have taken the liberty of sending for your perusal, a few extracts [of, deleted] from a little poem I have now by me, which would I should think, be appropriate to the present state of public feeling, if it were brought out promptly&#8212;It is entirely free from political allusions, and is merely meant as a picture of the dangers resulting to public and private virtue</td>

    and happiness from the doctrines of Infidelity&#8212;I have called it "the Sceptic", but perhaps if a more suitable title should occur to you, you would have the kindness to suggest it to me.<br/>
    <br/>
    Should it be in any way inconvenient to you to favour me with your opinion of the poetry in writing, Mr Murray will, I am sure, communicate it to me; and I would also request that the specimen may be shewn to him, as I am anxious to receive his answer on the subject.</td>

    My dear Sir,<br/>
    <br/>
    Some friends having requested me to procure for them twelve more copies of the "Tales &amp; Historic Scenes", if you think there is no chance of the first parcel being eventually recovered, (as I begin to fear it will not be,) I believe I must trouble you to send me another, containing the same number, by the mail &#8212;I hope the little poem I sent you a few days since was safely received, and that I shall very shortly have the pleasure of hearing from you on the subject&#8212; I am, dear Sir,<br/>

    I return the proof &#8212; sheets of the "Sceptic", in which I have made all the alterations I thought necessary&#8212;Have the goodness to present my thanks to Mr Gifford for the trouble he has kindly taken in correcting the proofs, and to say that I have, I believe, attended to all his suggestions &#8212; I forgot to say when I wrote last, that I wish to be Mrs Hemans in the title page of the poem, if it is not too late.&#8212; I hope I shall soon hear from you on the subject of the publication, as a letter must undoubtedly have been lost&#8212;I am, Dear Sir,<br/>

    Dear Sir,<br/>
    <br/>
    I received two days ago the parcel containing 24 copies of the "Sceptic", and also Spence's Anecdotes and Lord Grenville's and Mr Canning's speeches, for which I beg to return my best thanks &#8212;There are a few errors of the Press in the "Sceptic", and as they entirely alter the sense of the passages in which they occur, I particularly wish that a list of Errata, according to the one I now enclose, may be affixed to<br/>
