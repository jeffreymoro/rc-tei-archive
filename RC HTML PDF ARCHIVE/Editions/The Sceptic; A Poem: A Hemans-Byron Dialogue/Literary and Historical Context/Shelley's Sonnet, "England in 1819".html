    Princes, the dregs of their dull race, who flow<br/>
    Through public scorn,&#8212;mud from a muddy spring,&#8212;<br/>
    Rulers who neither see, nor feel, nor know,<br/>
    But leech-like to their fainting country cling,<br/>
    Till they drop, blind in blood, without a blow,&#8212;<br/>
    A people starved and stabbed in the untilled field.&#8212;<br/>
    An army, which liberticide and prey<br/>
    Makes as a two-edged sword to all who wield,&#8212;<br/>
    Golden and sanguine laws which tempt and slay ;<br/>
    Religion Christless, Godless&#8212;a book sealed ;<br/>
    A Senate,&#8212;Time's worst statute unrepealed,&#8212;<br/>
    Are graves, from which a glorious Phantom may<br/>
    Burst, to illumine our tempestuous day.<br/>
