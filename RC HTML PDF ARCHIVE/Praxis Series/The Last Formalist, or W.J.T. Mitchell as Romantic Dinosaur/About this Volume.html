<h2>About this hypertext</h2>
<p>This volume is designed so that the interview with W.J.T. Mitchell and the gloss by Orrin N.C. Wang may be read through and against each other, much like the structure of Coleridge's <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/stc/Coleridge/poems/Rime_Ancient_Mariner.html">Ancient Mariner</a> transposed into a postmodern context. The critical innovation here is to use the web in such a way that views it as more than a mere repository of academic content, and to transform text into true hypertext. The two pieces do also appear on separate pages, which are reachable from the table of contents. Because the links may take you to different points in the page, you may have to use the back-arrow button on your browser to return to your starting point. The full text of the volume, like all hypertexts in the Romantic Circles Praxis Series, is <a href="/search/node/">fully searchable</a>.</p>
