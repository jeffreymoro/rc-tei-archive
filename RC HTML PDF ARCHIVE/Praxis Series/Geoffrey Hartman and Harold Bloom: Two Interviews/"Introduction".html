                <p>The last half-century study of literature and
                romanticism, and of their relation, is unintelligible
                without some type of encounter with Geoffrey Hartman
                and Harold Bloom. From <em>Shelley's Mythmaking</em>
                and <em>Wordsworth's Poetry</em> to <em>The Anxiety of
                Influence</em> and <em>The Fate of Reading</em> a
                certain form of romanticism is at once summarized and
                surpassed. Whether that romanticism is the dominant
                form in romantic studies today is precisely a question
                that cannot be answered without a serious reading of
                both Hartman and Bloom. One might say the same of other
                attendant questions, such as whether there is such a
                thing as literature itself, as opposed to culture,
                history, or religion; and whether there is such a thing
                as the human, as opposed to the post-human or the
                Other, or to language or nature or Yahweh. These are
                big questions, of course; if we know them also to be
                romantic ones, that is because of Hartman and
                Bloom.</p>

              <li>
                <p>It's obviously also a mistake to list simply
                critical works of the two from the 1960s and 70s, and
                to imagine that as the high water mark of their
                engagement with romanticism, or literature, for that
                matter. (<a href="../bloom.html#Anxiety">See also
                Bloom's comment about the relation between his latest
                book, <em>Jesus and Yahweh</em> , and <em>The Anxiety
                of Influence</em></a>.) They have both written several
                careers worth of scholarship since then, and in no way
                seem to be slowing down their critical production as
                the first decade of the twenty-first century works
                toward its conclusion. Hence this present volume of
                <em>Romantic Circles Praxis</em>. Earlier interviews of
                romanticists in <em>RCP</em> have conceived of
                themselves as cameos; this volume might appropriately
                use more modernist language and present itself as a set
                of snapshots of each scholar, catching them less in
                repose and more in the active process of continuing two
                storied, foundational careers.</p>

                <p>If these are snapshots, they capture the two in
                different settings and modes of inquiry. The interview
                with Geoffrey Hartman was conducted last August in the
                lobby of the conference hotel for the 2005 North
                American Society for the Study of Romanticism that was
                held in Montreal, Canada. Romanticism is a mainstay of
                the conversation between Hartman and Marc Redfield,
                centering on Hartman's life-long shaping of Wordsworth
                as the paradoxically both radical and measured bearer
                of modernity. Their discussion also touches upon a wide
                range of topics that include the necessity of a
                multi-linguistic approach to literature, the nature of
                terror, and how Hartman and Bloom read differently. The
                interview with Harold Bloom occurred in his home in New
                Haven, Connecticut, shortly after Thanksgiving 2005,
                with family members of both Bloom and Laura Quinney
                present. In Bloom's and Quinney's conversation,
                romanticism is not so much the focus but rather a
                constant presence, signaled by references to Blake,
                Wordsworth, Emerson, and Whitman. Mixing the convivial
                and domestic with the sublime, Bloom keeps his
                attention fixed on the question of Yaweh, in a way less
                about what brings comfort than what unsettles, or even
                dismays.</p>

                the keen intelligence and sharp intrepidness that they
                brought to this project; to Kate Singer, William

                that made the interviews possible; to Jeanne Bloom for
                her gracious hospitality and Daniel and Julian Flesch
                for their patience during the interview in New Haven;
                and to Geoffrey Hartman and Harold Bloom for the
                uncommon generosity and openness, intellectual and
                otherwise, that they evinced from the beginning to the
                end of this project.</p>
