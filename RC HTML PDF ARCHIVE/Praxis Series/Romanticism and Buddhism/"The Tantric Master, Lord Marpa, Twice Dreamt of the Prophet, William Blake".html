This article explores the theoretical features, the practical functions, and the critical implications of this 'origin' through a Zen Buddhist reading of Shelley's _A Defence of Poetry_ and 'Ode to the West Wind.' This essay appears in _Romanticism and Buddhism_, a volume of _Romantic Circles Praxis Series_, prepared exclusively for Romantic Circles (http://www.rc.umd.edu/), University of Maryland.</p><p><br/>
    The great translator thought<br/>
    he had suffered the sleep of a cloudless day<br/>
    in a boat of skins<br/>
    on a cold and black inland sea.</p><p>Elohim, the eye of minor periphery,<br/>
    broke bread with him on the moonlit water.<br/>
    He washed his beard and hair<br/>
    and said your daughters are now stepping from furnaces.<br/>
    But if we wake<br/>
    by their drying looms<br/>
    with a mountain of salt between me and them,<br/>
    then the diarist wife<br/>
    has taken these margins of yellowing shoreline<br/>
    from us.</p><p>London sleeps with its cousins and sisters all winter<br/>
    while naked surgeons cross through the city<br/>

    who by physical inches of devotion are measuring a churchyard.<br/>
    The owls forming a morbidly obese quotation<br/>
    from Ovid.</p><p>The Word is always out weeping in the evening<br/>
    refusing the hot custards, stealing<br/>
    from sick and defenseless travelers.<br/>
    The last Republic is out too, burning on the horizon.</p><p>Phoenician men sitting on the purple rocks<br/>
    mending their nets, chewing<br/>
    on roots, laugh<br/>
    and then walk out across the water.</p><p>They've been doing it for centuries,<br/>
    that is&#8212; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;mending their nets with laughter.</p></div>
