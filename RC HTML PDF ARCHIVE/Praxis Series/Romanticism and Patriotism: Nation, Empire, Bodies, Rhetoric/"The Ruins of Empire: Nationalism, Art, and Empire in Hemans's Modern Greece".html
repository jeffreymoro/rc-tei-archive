                <p>At the conclusion of his magisterial history,
                <em>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,</em>
                Edward Gibbon confesses, "It was among the ruins of the
                Capitol that I first conceived the idea of a work which
                has amused and exercised near twenty years of my life"
                (II.642-3). Over a decade later and across the channel,
                C.F. Volney would write <em>The Ruins or Meditations on
                the Revolutions of Empires and the Law of Nature,</em>
                a text which gained instant popularity among select
                British reading circles. The invocation to the text
                echoes Gibbon's sentiment by hailing those sublime and
                "solitary ruins, holy sepulchers and silent walls" (1),
                which, while traveling "in the Ottoman dominions, and
                through those provinces which were anciently the
                kingdoms of Egypt and Syria" (3) inspired his plan for
                a philosophical reverie on the causes of the decline
                and fall of empires. These texts illustrate the depth
                of interest in relics, ruins, and antiquities that
                prevailed among late eighteenth- and early
                ninteenth-century British culture, fed as it were by
                the parallel developments of Ossianic nation-making and
                imperial travel narratives. They also establish a
                unique rhetoric and paradigm of the cyclical decline
                and fall of empire that will inform later nationalist
                texts.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The literature of the long eighteenth century
                reflects an uneasiness about the pursuit of empire in
                the trope of ruins. Proceeding from eighteenth century
                antiquarianism, the literature of ruins converted the
                congeries of ruins, relics, and forgeries into
                artifacts that naturalized and codified a cohesive
                British identity and continuity of community. <a href=
                "#note3">[3]</a>
                But the ruin also performed a separate and sometimes
                subversive function as a symbol for the historical
                process of the rise and decline of nations. This
                hermeneutic diverges into two distinct but related
                traditions in the eighteenth century. Whereas Gibbon's
                <em>Decline</em> expresses the classical ruin
                sentiment, which mourns the inevitable decline of
                empire, in the eighteenth-century this sentiment adopts
                a different tone&mdash;that of the prophet's scorn for
                the self-destructive pursuit of power and worldly
                splendor most poignantly expressed in Volney's
                <em>Ruins</em>. <a href=
                "#note4">[4]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Nestled between the fall of the Bastille in 1789 and
                the fall of Napoleon in 1815, the figurative landscape
                of British Romantic poetry is frequently littered with
                ruins. In Romanticism, the ruin motif is expressed and
                interpreted in various ways; here the literal ruin or
                monument, there the figurative ruin of the self, and
                elsewhere still the formalistic ruin of the Romantic
                fragment poem, with all of its unsettled meaning.
                <a href=
                "#note5">[5]</a>
                Among other readings, this study proposes that the
                literal ruin is politically overdetermined as a motif
                in Romantic poetry, possessing an acute political
                currency in a stormy period characterized by war,
                transience, and political extremes. Bruce Haley has
                argued that when Romantics write about ruins and
                monuments, they act "to restore damaged, faded, or
                unfamiliar figures to the status of living
                forms"&mdash;forms that can express meaning (5).
                Because there is an essential anxiety that the ruin or
                monument, as a record, fails to express its
                <em>idea</em> or even the characteristics of its
                central figure without the aid of an interpretive
                apparatus often consisting of adjoining visual forms
                and inscriptions, the monument poem must recover the
                muted and dead form of the central figure and make it
                live and speak again (3). However, this imagines that
                the poet can imaginatively recreate the cultural and
                ideological matrix that once determined meaning for the
                figure, a kind of Romantic archeology. My contention is
                that rather than <em>restore</em> meaning, the poet
                <em>refurbishes</em> meaning using contemporary
                ideological materiel. The monument poem breathes life
                into a dead form so that it may speak to a contemporary
                audience. Furthermore, the message is mediated in
                transmission and reception, and is thus subject to a
                host of aesthetic, cultural, historical, and
                ideological forces. For instance, if we take Shelley's
                <em>Ozymandias</em> (1818) and Keats' <em>On Seeing the
                Elgin Marbles</em> (1817) and reread these poems from
                within this hermeneutic they do not appear as
                restorations at all. Hence, when Shelley recovers the
                figure of Ozymandias, it is not his leadership and
                omnipotence that is conveyed by the poem's
                interpretative apparatus, which would have been the
                intention of the record, but rather his cruelty and the
                transience of empire (which admittedly may have been
                how it was originally received). Likewise, Keats takes
                the Elgin Marbles not as evidence of everlasting
                Grecian grandeur, but as symbols of the inevitable
                decay wrought by time. The refurbishing of meaning that
                occurs in these poems, as I stated above, is
                overdetermined by the political unconscious of a less
                sanguine age, where the drive for insatiable power and
                grandeur appear as deadly hubris. Ultimately, these
                poems are mediated by historical, cultural, and
                ideological transactions that place them within a
                broader national and international conversation over
                the direction of national politics, the arc of imperial
                desire, and the anxiety generated by these overlapping
                vectors, an anxiety frequently troped as ruin.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Proceeding from this methodological stance, this
                study will discuss the importance of the trope of ruins
                and the paradigm of decline and fall to the rhetoric of
                nationalism and imperialism in Felicia Hemans's
                <em>Modern Greece</em> (1817)<em>.</em> In the poem,
                Hemans adopts a historicist narrative position
                reminiscent of Gibbon and Volney, replete with
                "objective" detachment, episodic flashbacks,
                sentimentalism, and magniloquent conclusions. Yet,
                contrary to the republican commonplace that nation and
                empire are ultimately incompatible, Hemans draws the
                opposite conclusion: Western nation-making and
                imperialism are <em>interdependent</em> . But this
                contention is made conditional upon the active
                participation of women in patriotic discourse. Through
                the discourse of (uncritical) patriotism, a site where
                women could in fact make their presence felt during her
                time, Hemans sought to broaden the role of women in
                political and public English life, and would herself
                become widely hailed as a model of domestic patriotism.
                In <em>Modern Greece,</em> which is an adaptation of
                the conventionally masculine travelogue genre, she is
                sensitive to the hazards of this project, employing
                innovative generic modes and narratological structures
                to manage the public fallout of gender-based discursive
                transgressions. Once accessible by this stage work, the
                poem can then specifically accomplish the broadening of
                the role of contemporary women by arguing that the fall
                of ancient Greece occurred because of the failed
                education of its youth, itself a consequence of
                restricting the influence of Greece's mothers in Greek
                civil society. In making this argument, Hemans actively
                disputes the view that Greece's national decline was
                fated because of its imperialist designs, thereby
                restoring the link between nation-making and empire
                that Gibbon, Volney, and a tradition of seventeenth-
                and eighteenth-century texts had warned against.
                Instead, she issues her own equally apocalyptic warning
                to the nation: if Britain is to avoid Greece's tragic
                but avertable fate, it must find a place for patriotic
                women to speak and write in the public sphere.</p>

              <li>The centrality of empire to the constitution of
              British identity is by now fairly well established.
              Picking up from Renan's claim that forgetting is a
              crucial factor in the creation of a nation (45), and
              Anderson's claim that a nation is above all an "imagined
              community," Linda Colley has argued that Britishness was
              quite literally "forged" from conflicting and internally
              fractious Scottish, Welsh, English, and Irish
              communities&mdash;not primarily through political Acts of
              Union (1707 &amp; 1801), but through the mechanism of
              othering. Colley argues that Britain was "an invention
              forged above all by war." She continues,
    
                <blockquote>
                  <p>They [the British] defined themselves as
                  Protestants struggling for survival against the
                  world's foremost Catholic power. They defined
                  themselves against the French as they imagined them
                  to be, superstitious, militarist, decadent and
                  unfree. And, increasingly as the wars went on, they
                  defined themselves in contrast to the colonial
                  peoples they conquered, peoples who were manifestly
                  alien in terms of culture, religion and colour.

                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Conflicting class and ethnic interests could only be
                successfully negotiated and subsumed within a
                constructed British sodality by their hostile alterity
                to various others defined in national, religious, or
                racial terms.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>This raises two questions. How long can a nation
                maintain such specious and tenuous commonalities after
                the war is over and the empire is lost? And is there a
                greater danger of incessant warfare and unbridled
                expansionism consuming and corrupting the very essence
                of the nation? Many cultural historians have spent a
                good deal of time studying the trauma inflicted upon
                British national identity in its post-imperial phase,
                particularly as fears mount about the fragmentation of
                Britain in a federated European Union. <a href=
                "#note6">[6]</a>
                For now, I only wish to pause on this subject in order
                to point up the dialectic of nation and empire
                intrinsic to the modern British nation-state before I
                move from this observation to the latter question. If
                imperialism, in all its many permutations, helped forge
                a nation, could it also lead to its ruination? It seems
                to me that at the heart of Gibbon and Volney's texts is
                a fundamental assurance of this fact.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Not surprisingly, in British literature of the
                eighteenth and nineteenth centuries we often discover a
                troubling conflation of imperial discourse with
                nationalist rhetoric, particularly since Thomson's
                patriotic "Ode: Rule, Britannia" first articulated a
                pattern of providential national election and
                commercial/colonial supremacy which confirmed the
                centrality of the artist to the project of national
                invention. <a href=
                "#note7">[7]</a>
                Thomson's claim dovetails with the sanguinary
                disposition of 18<sup>th</sup> -century political
                economists towards the rise of a capitalist society.
                Bernard Mandeville's <em>Fable of the Bees</em>
                elaborates a commercialist stance which defends the
                extremes of "private vice" or self-interest as the
                vehicle for ensuring the common good, despite the
                ostensible contradiction with conventional morality.
                <a href=
                "#note8">[8]</a>
                Mandeville's argument presages Smith's more developed
                analysis of mercantile capitalism, with its serene
                faith in the benevolent and invisible hand of the free
                market to produce utopian conditions. <a href=
                "#note9">[9]</a>
                Both understood that the untrammeled freedoms of the
                market, when hitched to a compliant "fiscal-military
                state" <a href=
                "#note10">[10]</a>
                would and did lead to expansionist tendencies. Hence,
                like Thompson, both countenanced imperial expansion as
                the necessary outcome of a prosperous and free
                commercial society.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>But where Thomson, like Mandeville and Smith, is
                unequivocally in favor of commerce and empire as the
                twin springs of Britain's liberty and prosperity, other
                interlocutors in this conversation weren't so sure.
                Cowper and Goldsmith expressed anxiety about the
                compatibility of progress, commerce and empire. Hume
                warned that overrefinement, which is born of excessive
                luxury, is the most extreme danger to taste and
                national sensibility. <a href=
                "#note11">[11]</a>
                Gibbon attributed the decline of Rome to the perils of
                imperial expansion. <a href=
                "#note12">[12]</a>
                And Malthus, portending Marx, would later question the
                wisdom of placing trust in market forces to serve the
                public good.<a href=
                "#note13">[13]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The belief in the fundamental incompatibility
                between a prosperous republican state and a powerful
                imperial state has a classical provenance. David
                Armitage has traced this discourse back to the Roman
                historian Sallust, who argued that the Roman Republic's
                thirst for glory eventually led to cultural decline and
                the loss of republican freedoms under the dictatorship
                of the caesars (<em>The Ideological Origins of the
                British Empire</em> 126-27). The Sallustian tradition,
                which poses an irreconciliable relationship between
                republican liberty and empire, informs Machiavelli's
                <em>Discorsi,</em> where he too remarks on the dilemma
                of sustaining liberty or pursuing imperial greatness or
                <em>grandezza</em>. Armitage locates this tension at
                the very beginning of the English Republic, during the
                years of the commonwealth. Milton, he argues, perceived
                the crisis and failure of the commonwealth in precisely
                these terms as the Rump Parliament gave way to a
                Cromwellian Protectorate, evaporating political liberty
                in the wake of a Sulla-like military dictatorship that
                hastily pursued expansionist commercial policies
                (134-6).</p>
    
                <p><strong>II. Women and Patriotism in British Romantic
                Literature</strong></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>From Milton to the Romantics&mdash;who witnessed a
                similar period of revolution, empire, and colonial
                expansion&mdash;there is a continuous theme of
                patriotic discourse and imperial anxiety underlying
                much of British literature. Many authors, particularly
                female authors, entered the literary milieu by
                intervening in this conversation, precisely because
                patriotism was such a convenient front for eighteenth-
                and nineteenth-century women to enter the literary
                public sphere. Since the woman's purview is primarily
                concerned with domesticity and private relations, it is
                within reason to expect that women should want to be
                concerned with the preservation of the nation (often
                gendered female as in the case of "Britannia"), which
                is the guarantor of this private sphere. Hence, as
                female patriots increasingly stake out a civic role in
                support of their male compatriots, concern for the
                nation, especially one like Britain that was defined by
                intermittent warfare, supersedes the doctrine of
                separate sexual spheres (Colley 261). And who better to
                assume the domestic guardianship of the nation than
                those women entrusted with the reproduction and
                transmission of its bodies, values, and
                subjectivities?</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The popular conception of female moral authority,
                rooted in the domestic roles of child-rearing and
                education, converted the female desire for civic
                participation into a <em>duty</em> to act and often to
                write.<a href=
                "#note14">[14]</a>
                Female writers sometimes translated this duty into
                conservative reform initiatives to discipline the
                laboring class, as with Hannah More's tracts; or
                conversely into liberal or radical reform initiatives,
                such as Wollstonecraftian feminism or abolitionism.
                <a href=
                "#note15">[15]</a>
                As Anne Mellor has suggested, female writers were also
                expected to embody Christian virtue, adding piety to
                patriotism. <a href=
                "#note16">[16]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Yet, if writing were a duty, it was also a form of
                dissension against the increasingly strict mandates of
                a society of separate spheres. <a href=
                "#note17">[17]</a>
                In a growing print culture where the status of the
                "literary lady" as a feminine icon contributed to the
                marketability of female texts, the viability of a woman
                writer's career often depended upon the strategy
                selected to manage the public fallout of this
                transgression. <a href=
                "#note18">[18]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In light of this, Felicia Hemans's prodigious
                authorial career, extending through nineteen volumes of
                poetry and two dramas from the publication of
                <em>England and Spain; or, Valour and Patriotism</em>
                (1808) to the second edition of <em>Songs of the
                Affections</em> (1835), exhibits perhaps the most
                successful attempt at self-definition as a "literary
                lady," but one which also manifests a patriotic role.
                Indeed, her status as "England's most famous female
                patriotic poet" <a href=
                "#note19">[19]</a>
                garnered her a place in the British canon for over a
                century. What Victorian schoolchild could forget the
                famous verses of <em>Casabianca,</em> <em>Homes of
                England,</em> or <em>England's Dead</em>? So successful
                was she at trademarking an orthodox image of domestic
                femininity that she outsold almost all of her male and
                female competitors in the literary marketplace, and
                this during a period of reaction and war.<a href=
                "#note20">[20]</a>
                Her contemporary reviewers and Victorian biographers
                would proceed to relish the delicacy and refinement of
                her feminine traits. The <em>Edinburgh Monthly
                Review</em> raved that Mrs. Hemans "never ceases to be
                strictly <em>feminine</em> in the whole current of her
                thought and feeling."<a href=
                "#note21">[21]</a>
                Francis Jeffries, writing for the <em>Edinburgh
                Review,</em> summed up her poetry as "a fine
                exemplification of Female Poetry." <a href=
                "#note22">[22]</a>
                This sentiment is corroborated by her biographer, Henry
                F. Chorley, in his <em>Memorials,</em> who tells us
                that her letters "give so fair a picture of her mind in
                all its <em>womanliness</em> " and approvingly cites
                one critic who swears that her poems "could not have
                been written by a man" (112-13).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>However, modern critics have examined the reality fo
                teh failed marriage and disregard for domestic matters
                that characterized Hemans's life behind her traditional
                reprsentation as a paragon of womanly virtue.<a href=
                "#note23">[23]</a>
                Felicia Hemans, ne&eacute; Felicia Dorothea Browne, was
                born in Liverpool in 1793 to a middle-class family of
                six children. In 1808, after her father abandoned the
                family, they moved to Bronwylfa in Wales and Felicia
                began writing poetry for publication to defray
                household expenses. In 1812, she married Captain
                Hemans, moved to Daventry, and conceived the first of
                five children&mdash;all boys. Suddenly, in 1818, her
                husband left for Italy and never returned, leaving her
                pregnant with their last son and bereft of sufficient
                income to care for their children. It is at this point
                that Hemans moved back in with her mother, older
                brother, and sister who effectively raised her children
                while she devoted herself to full-time writing&mdash;at
                least until her mothers death in 1827. Of this period,
                Chorley writes,</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  <p>[The] peculiar circumstances of [her] position,
                  which, by placing her in a household, as a member and
                  not as its head, excused her from many of those small
                  cares of domestic life, which might have either
                  fretted away her day-dreams, and, by interruption,
                  have made of less avail the search for knowledge to
                  which she bent herself with such eagerness; or, more
                  probably still, might have imparted to her poetry
                  more of masculine health and stamen, at the expense
                  of some of its romance and music. (I.35-6)</p>
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>To allay potential criticism of Hemans, Chorley
                cleverly converts Hemans's shirking of the prescribed
                domestic role into a positive good for the production
                of a feminine poetry sans the adulteration of a
                "masculine health" that would have been imparted to it,
                ironically, by the rigors and interruptions of domestic
                labor. This apologia points up the work of literary
                fabrication that went on behind Hemans's proscenium of
                domestic femininity throughout much of her adult life.
                Ultimately, after a lifetime of disappointments by male
                providers and being early thrown into the competitive
                literary market to eke out a living for herself and her
                family, the trauma of her mother's death precipitated
                the onset of physical decline that eventually leds to
                her early death at the age of 41 in 1835.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Because her writing came as a result of financial
                necessity, considerations of pubic taste frequently
                impinged upon her selection of topoi and style to
                ensure commercial success. <a href=
                "#note24">[24]</a>
                <em>England &amp; Spain</em> (1808), her first
                published poem, was calculated to exploit contemporary
                interest in the continental war. Likewise, <em>The
                Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy</em> (1816), a
                work that sealed her literary fame, exploited popular
                contempt for Napoleon's plundering of Italian and Roman
                art. In the case of <em>Modern Greece</em> (1817) we
                know from a correspondence with her publisher, John
                Murray, that she chose the topic in order to exploit
                the nationwide scandal ensuing from the importation of
                the Elgin Marbles, and, moreover, that because of its
                academic style she thought it circumspect to publish
                the poem anonymously to increase its salability.

                <p><strong>III. Ruins and Empire in <em>Modern
                Greece</em></strong></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In <em>Modern Greece</em>, one finds a peculiar
                sentimentalism towards the quest for imperial
                <em>grandezza</em>. Perhaps deliberately, the poem
                takes off from the success of Byron's <em>Childe
                Harold</em> in content and form. Like <em>Childe
                Harold</em>, it utilizes the rich features of the
                travelogue genre and engages the simmering debate over
                the Elgin Marbles. It also shares a similar stanzaic
                structure, notational apparatus, and episodic form. But
                here the similarities end. The poem's contiguous 101
                stanzas reveal a non-chronological episodic structure
                with multiple rhetorical modes. It begins ostensibly in
                the present with a sublimely picturesque Grecian
                landscape colored by wild vegetation and moldering
                ruins. The narrator guides us through this scene by
                following the meandering path of a wandering
                <em>enthusiast</em> &mdash;ostensibly a western
                traveler captivated by ancient Greece. We move from
                this to the tragic account of a Grecian
                &eacute;migr&eacute; in the Americas, reflecting on the
                phenomenology of the refugee who has lost his homeland.
                From here, the poem shifts into a specious historicity,
                narrating the fall of classical Greece (and conflating
                this with the decline of the Byzantine Empire) on the
                very morning "When Asia poured / Her fierce fanatics to
                Byzantium 's wall" (XXXVI). From this re-enactment, the
                poem turns back to the present to magnify the contrast
                between past glory and present ruin. It then concludes
                by shifting into prophecy, reclaiming Greek heritage
                (manifested in the expropriation of the Elgin Marbles)
                for an emergent British imperium and striking a
                potentially jarring final note with a disturbing vision
                of Britain's future ruins. This vision is reminiscent
                of Volney's sentiment in <em>The Ruins</em>, where the
                narrator witnesses the ruination of past civilizations
                and ponders whether one day a traveler like himself
                might also sit silently amidst the ruins of Europe and
                "weep in solitude over the ashes of their inhabitants,
                and the memory of their former greatness" (8). <a href=
                "#note26">[26]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Central to the poem's machinery of anonymity is its
                sophisticated notational apparatus, whose erudition
                fooled one reviewer into believing that the poem could
                not have been the work of a "female pen" and must
                certainly be the production of an ostensibly male
                "academical pen." <a href=
                "#note27">[27]</a>
                Furthermore, the notes are freighted with frequent
                citations of Gibbon's <em>Decline and Fall</em>, and
                the poem's subject matter clearly betrays a line of
                influence to this text as well. <a href=
                "#note28">[28]</a>
                In fact, Peter Trinder's biography states that this was
                one of Hemans's favorite books. <a href=
                "#note29">[29]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Trinder also reveals that Hemans "spent much of her
                [childhood] time lingering and reading in the ruins of
                the castle [Conway]," indicating a fascination with
                place and romantic ruins. This corresponds with her
                description of the Grecian landscape as "the ruin Time
                and Fate have wrought" (XXX). Just as she would steal
                off to the ruins of Conway Castle to suffuse her
                imagination with sublime thoughts as she read, so too
                she constructs modern Greece as a vast and desolate
                wasteland of tombs and monuments for the wandering
                enthusiast to stray and seek inspiration. It is a
                "Realm of sad beauty . . . a shrine / That Fancy visits
                with Devotion's zeal, / To catch high thoughts and
                impulses divine . . . Amidst the tombs of heroes"
                (XXI).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>There are two observations that need to be made
                here. The first has to do with Hemans's creative
                destruction of contemporary Greek culture and society.
                Hemans orientalizes modern Greece by reducing its
                territory to a vast wilderness of "savage cliffs and
                solitudes" (XLIX) that is ready for European colonial
                intervention in the guise of a wandering enthusiast.
                <a href=
                "#note30">[30]</a>
                Through a clever temporal disjuncture that posits a
                radical and unmediated cultural dislocation between
                past and present, she is able to reconcile this
                orientalized image of modern Greece with a concomitant
                Hellenic revival that contrarily depicts Greece as the
                cradle of Western civilization. Greece <em>was</em>
                part and provenance of the constellation of western
                civilization; its ruins signify this former identity.
                But now, we are told, these ruins litter a territory
                inhabited by another culture, dubiously "Greek," but
                bearing no connection to the land's past inhabitants.
                In fact, the only thing these cultures share in common
                is a geographic coordinate. Interestingly, Greece's
                geographical location, on the metaphoric borderline
                between East (Levant) and West (Europe), sustains such
                a condition of categorical confusion. These factors
                fertilize the orientalist imaginary in which modern
                Greece is transformed into a sublime sepulcher of
                tombs, ruins, and silent plains where all is "silence
                round, and solitude, and death" (XXXII). It is easy
                thus to imagine the modern Greeks as belonging to a
                debased "second race" who "inherit but their name" and
                for whom "No patriot feeling binds them to the soil . .
                . Their glance is cold indifference, and their toil /
                but to destroy what ages have revered" (LXXXVII). The
                specter of cultural miscegenation is duly exorcized by
                insisting that this "second race" is really the progeny
                of an invading "Crescent horde" whose Moslem regions
                are "to intellect a desert space, / A wild without a
                fountain or a flower, / Where towers Oppression
                &lsquo;midst the deepening glooms." The vast chasm
                separating this "second race" from the ancient Hellenes
                is glibly denoted by the use of the modifier "modern"
                in the title <em>Modern Greece</em>. The phrase is
                presented as an oxymoron, because we are led to believe
                that there is nothing really modern about them.

                an expansionist, despotic, and conventionally oriental

                people; annexed its territories to the landscape of the
                oriental sublime; and, tragically for the "civilized"
                West, subjected the cradle of culture itself to a

                <p>This narrative tour-de-force legitimates
                intervention by Western forces, who are figured as the
                proper heirs and descendants of that "nobler race" now
                displaced by a "second race" which lacks the intellect
                and sensibility to appreciate the Grecian legacy.
                Gibbon provides the sub-text for this passage when he
                cites Petrarch's astonishment at the "supine
                indifference" of the modern Romans towards the
                stupendous monuments and ruins of ancient Rome, and who
                marvels that a "stranger of the Rhone was more
                conversant with these antiquities than the nobles and
                natives of the metropolis" (II.638). Gibbon viewed
                himself as just such a stranger, characterizing himself
                as a "devout pilgrim from the remote and once savage
                countries of the North" who has now returned to the
                cradle of western civilization to pay homage and
                resurrect its glories (II.641-2).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>This takes us to a second point, for if the "savage"
                natives cannot appreciate the relics and ruins of a
                fallen empire, then it behooves the "civilized" nations
                to send their own archeological teams to recover this
                history for the presumed benefit of humanity. True to
                the orientalist mold, Hemans's <em>Modern Greece</em>
                posits that Hellenic Greece's ruins can be
                metaphorically read, appreciated, and understood only
                by an enthusiast possessed of an equivalently western
                sensibility. <a href=
                "#note33">[33]</a>
                Like Gibbon, Hemans offers us a pilgrimmatic
                figure&mdash;a "wandering son of other
                lands"&mdash;possessed of a remarkably British
                temperament. I would argue that Hemans's enthusiast is
                a specimen of British Romantic sensibility. Our
                narrator, who functions as a guide and chronicler,
                describes our wandering enthusiast who traverses the
                vast solitudes and sublime ruins of modern Greece as
                one "whose enthusiast mind / Each muse of ancient days
                hath deep imbued / With lofty lore, and all his
                thoughts refined / In the calm school of silent
                solitude" (III). We have here the quintessential
                Wordsworthian traveler "fostered alike by beauty and by
                fear," who exhibits a penchant for introspection and a
                profound sensitivity to one's natural surroundings.
                This traveler is distinguished from the modern Greek in
                every way that matters. In fact, the only character
                similar in disposition and sensibility to our
                peripatetic protagonist is the figure of the exiled
                Greek, who is also portrayed as possessing a Romantic
                demeanor as he traverses the North American wilds.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>We must pause here and note that this
                characteristically British Romantic traveler operates
                within the narrative in a manner similar to that of
                Mary Louise Pratt's "sentimental narrator" of
                contemporary travel narratives who feigns innocence and
                vulnerability while performing the interior exploration
                of native lands slated for expropriation, exploitation,
                and colonization. <a href=
                "#note34">[34]</a>
                In this sense, our restless Romantic enthusiast is also
                an imperialist agent, culturally expropriating Grecian
                territory and artifacts based on a presumed commonality
                of sensibility and shared historical experience of
                imperial and civilizational <em>grandezza</em>. When we
                consider this in conjunction with the fact that
                Hemans's text also comes equipped with a panoply of
                ethnographic and topographical notes that subject
                Greece to a scrupulous investigation by Western
                academics, we can begin to see the various layers of
                cultural appropriation that operate within the text.
                Ultimately, Hemans's poem displaces and
                deterritorializes the modern Greeks, offering instead a
                genealogy in which the modern Briton, who is presented
                as the Romantic antithesis of the savage modern Greek,
                becomes the legitimate heir to Hellenic Greece. Nowhere
                is this more apparent than in the mirroring of the
                modern Briton in the Romantic figure of the exiled
                Greek.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The British cooptation of a Grecian national
                heritage is further impelled by the act of mourning
                over its demise. In "Hemans and Home" Tricia Lootens
                has explored the complicity of mourning with
                nation-building in Hemans's poems. Heroes' graves bind
                national folk communities, and the work of the female
                poet is to memorialize these graves and thus impress
                them into the national imaginary as sentimental
                signposts of a shared national experience of loss
                (247). In addition, as in the case of <em>England's
                Dead,</em> these graves are often found spread across
                the empire, thus working to assimilate settler
                communities into a nationalist framework and thereby
                further legitimate expansionary imperialist polices.

                In <em>Modern Greece,</em> we see the psychological
                annexation of Greece to a "Greater" Britain through the
                sentimental act of mourning for a supposedly long dead
                people whose territory remains a vast sepulcher which
                only the British romantic subject, as cultural heir to
                Grecian antiquity, is properly equipped to
                appreciate.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Hemans's choice of narratology is remarkable because
                it raises the gendered politics of the travelogue
                genre. Hemans's decision to publish the poem
                anonymously suggests a profound sensitivity to the
                gendered exclusivity of the travel narrative with its
                rigorous academic style and apotheosis of masculine
                mobility and independence. <a href=
                "#note36">[36]</a>
                To make it accessible to women authors writing within a
                discourse of patriotic inclusion, she finds it
                expedient to tamper with the conventions of the genre
                by retrofitting it with an overtly patriotic rhetoric
                and value, insinuating that she understood full well
                the consequences of unmitigated generic transgression.
                By resituating this generic form within the discursive
                horizon of patriotic texts, Hemans was quite
                deliberately fashioning a strategy whereby a "female
                pen" could experiment with a conventionally masculine
                genre without fear of reprisal.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The poem's narratological structure elaborates this
                strategy. Unlike Byron, who eventually outs himself as
                the protagonist of his travel narrative <em>Childe
                Harold</em>, Hemans cannot claim firsthand knowledge of
                Greece and must instead operate behind the invented
                persona of a Romantic enthusiast. I would argue that
                this ploy bespeaks Hemans's awareness of the severe
                limitations placed on women's geographical mobility in
                the early nineteenth-century. In light of this, Byron's
                hasty denunciation of the poem as "good for nothing;
                written by some one who has never been there" <a href=
                "#note37">[37]</a>
                comes off as a callously insensitive remark that
                carelessly overlooks the reality of immobility faced by
                middle-class women like Hemans. One way around this sad
                reality is to construct a protagonist that is
                recognizably a male Romantic while developing a
                narrator who is altogether disembodied (and thereby
                degendered), existing outside of space-time like
                Volney's Genius, and who is thus able to traverse time
                and reconstruct the minutia of historical events. Of
                course, this historical imaginary is largely enabled by
                Britain's privileged role as Queen of the seas:
                Britain's powerful navy and colonial infrastructure
                provide the unique vantage point from which Hemans can
                project her piercing and acquisitive vision of modern
                Greece.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Hemans's narrator can rather effortlessly distill
                the national essence and history of a bygone people
                largely by virtue of the statuary and architecture
                whose ruins litter the landscape. In the tradition of
                eighteenth-century ruinology, these fragments of art
                are mined for their unique expression of national
                identity. In the text, Hemans proffers the Athenian
                city-state as a synecdoche for Greece itself. And
                Athens is rendered knowable through an investigation of
                the ruins of the Parthenon, which Hemans calls "the
                purest model of Athenian taste" (LXXIV), locating in a
                nation's art its peculiar sensibility. She also
                subscribes to the eighteenth-century fascination with
                the nationalist role of the bardic artist when she
                hails Greece as the "fair land of Phidias," the
                renowned sculptor and architect who oversaw the
                building of the Parthenon and personally sculpted the
                statue of Athena (or Minerva in the Roman lexicon),
                which is stationed in its central shrine.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Yet, Hemans modifies this tradition by outfitting
                the study of ruins with a capacity for augury. At will,
                her narrator can recount the events that transpired
                during the "closing night of that imperial race"
                (XXXVII). Furthermore, by the agency of the creative
                imagination, the narrator can also conjure up vivid
                imagery of a pre-lapsarian Greece, recovering the
                splendid vistas of a once glorious Athens from the
                ruins of time:</p>
    
                <blockquote>

                  Within, around, the light of glory dwells<br />

              <li>
                <p>By meditating upon the nation's ruins, the narrator
                is able to precipitate a spell of imaginative
                reconstruction whereby imperial Athens is delivered
                from decay and presented at the height of its
                <em>grandezza</em>.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Interestingly, the Parthenon, which occupies a
                special place in the text's discursive topography, is a
                site that conflates Athenian nationalism and
                imperialism. At the time of its construction, Athens
                was pursuing an overt policy of imperial expansion. The
                processional frieze depicted along the metopes and
                pediments of the structure were meant to root the
                nation's present imperial exploits in the nation's past
                experience of warfare against human and mythological
                enemies, each time concluding with a Grecian victory
                that consolidated national identity and augmented
                Athenian <em>grandezza</em>.<a href=
                "#note38">[38]</a>
                So, in truth, the Parthenon is a special memorial which
                functions as a technology for channeling individual
                desire into the production of a national sodality
                premised on an invented tradition and its redeployment
                in support of imperialism.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>This technology and its product are symbolically
                co-opted by Britain through the expropriation of the
                Elgin Marbles, which are quite literally fragments of
                this mythology because they are fragments of the
                Parthenon's processional frieze. Thus, continues
                Hemans's narrator: "Who may grieve that, rescued from
                their hands, / Spoilers of excellence and foes to art,
                / thy relics, Athens! Borne to other lands, / Claim
                homage still to thee from every heart?" (LXXXVIII). To
                paraphrase, better that Britain, heir to the legacy of
                imperial and civilizational <em>grandezza</em>, recover
                these fragments than that they be lost to the ignorance
                and obscurity of an orientalized and debased "second
                race" whose only claim to them is that they happen to
                be squatting upon the lands once occupied by a "nobler
                race" of antique Greeks.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>"In those fragments" we are told "the soul of Athens
                lives" (XCI). Furthermore, "these [fragments] were
                destined to a noble lot . . . to light another land,
                the quenchless ray that soon shall gloriously expand"
                (XCVII). Hemans proposes that art, as the embodiment of
                national sensibility, can act as a conduit. This is, in
                effect, how British literature was utilized in India
                and elsewhere to interpellate Indian subjects with a
                uniquely British sensibility, and thus produce
                compliant colonial subjects under the ruse of spreading
                civilization. <a href=
                "#note39">[39]</a>
                In this instance, however, art becomes the vehicle for
                imperial <em>grandezza,</em> passing the torch of
                empire from one nation to the next, thus quickening the
                birth of another great civilization. Britain, we are
                told, "hast [the] power to be what Athens e'er hath
                been" (XCIX).</p>

              <li>
                <p>In a cautionary moment pregnant with patriotic
                fervor, Hemans warns that to realize this destiny
                Britain must first cultivate its own native
                art&mdash;"treasures oft unprized,
                unknown"&mdash;instead of prizing foreign "gems far
                less rich than those, thus precious, and thus lost"
                (C). <a href=
                "#note40">[40]</a>
                Imitating Volney and Gibbon, the narrator imagines a
                post-lapsarian Britain whose imperial glory has
                flickered and extinguished. Yet it too, like Greece,
                can have an everlasting life-after-death in the
                splendid ruins of its art and architecture. These can
                serve to quicken the next turning of the imperial
                gyre:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  So, should dark ages o'er thy glory sweep,<br />
                  Should thine e'er be as now are Grecian plains,<br />
                  Nations unborn shall track thine own blue deep<br />
                  To hail thy shore, to worship thy remains;<br />
                  Thy mighty monuments with reverence trace.<br />
                  And cry, "This ancient soil hath nursed a glorious
                  race!" (CI)

                <p>In turning from this passage to the conclusion of
                this study, I would like to point up the use of the
                modal verb "should," whose conditionality indicates
                that this apocalyptic vision is not an inexorable
                consequence of the pursuit of empire vis-&agrave;-vis
                the Sallustian and Machiavellian tradition. Returning
                to the narrator's Gibbonesque chronicle of Greece's
                fall, we discover that the cause of Greece's demise lay
                not in any perceived contradiction between liberty and
                empire, but in basic human frailty and error. The
                narrator concludes that the Crescent horde succeeded in
                single-handedly demolishing Greek culture not because
                of the decadence wrought by the pursuit of empire, but
                instead because of an avoidable and lamentable lack of
                patriotic vigilance on the part of the Greek
                defenders:</p>
    
                <blockquote>

                <p>Unlike the boy in <em>Casabianca</em> who needlessly
                remains upon the burning deck out of filial affection
                and patriotic zeal, the sons of Greece shrank from
                patriotic self-sacrifice, and subsequently a
                once-mighty nation fell.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>At the figurative center of this narrative is a
                re-inscription of the vital role of the domestic sphere
                in cultivating the proper degree of patriotism among
                the sons of the nation. "O, where were then thy sons"
                exclaims the narrator as the morning of Greece's fall
                unfolds. Their absence during the invasion of their
                homeland is telling because it reveals the ideological
                poverty of the Grecian women charged with their
                patriotic upbringing&mdash;who are also absent from the
                scene! If we once again compare Hemans's steadfast
                British child in <em>Casabianca</em> with these
                derelict Grecian sons and mothers we discover a subtext
                here about the vital role and presence of women in the
                service of patriotism. Put glibly, the nation is only
                as strong as its women.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>One clue to this can be found in the fore-grounded
                figure of Minerva, the patron goddess of Athens who
                represents the merger of fertility, wisdom, and martial
                prowess. In the text, Minerva functions as a metonym
                for the nation. At one point, Hemans addresses Greece
                as "Minerva's land." She also uses the polysemic figure
                of "Minerva's rent veil" as a symbol of Greece's fall.
                Through the association of an ostensibly female,
                domestic goddess with the nation and its fate, Hemans
                proffers a symbolic affront to the modern notion of
                separate spheres and insinuates a pre-ordained role for
                women in civic discourse. <a href=
                "#note41">[41]</a>
                The negligence or erasure of this role leads to
                spoliation and decline, figuratively represented by the
                tattered veil, which variously signifies the cultural
                and spiritual decline of the nation; the pillaging of
                the nation's most cherished sites&mdash;in this case
                the temple of Minerva within the Parthenon; or the
                literal and metaphorical rape of the nation, resulting
                in the extinction of a people and the procreation of an
                utterly distinct "second race." But, by signaling that
                these fates are in fact conditional and highly
                contingent upon the domestic infrastructure of
                patriotism, Hemans disputes the established position
                that liberty and empire are in contradiction by placing
                the blame for Greece's fall squarely on the deficient
                patriotic instruction of its youth, while
                simultaneously purveying an aggrandized and universal
                vision of female nationalism relevant to all
                epochs.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Ultimately, then, the ruins of modern Greece do
                issue a warning to British society, but not one
                consonant with Gibbon, Volney, or the tradition of
                pastoral and abolitionist poetry that railed against
                the corruptions of luxury wrought by unrestrained greed
                and imperial ambition. Rather, Hemans mobilizes these
                ruins to warn modern Britons not to pursue too
                vigorously the ideology of separate spheres, which,
                when too rigid, can foreclose the essential public role
                played by women in the patriotic instruction of youth
                and the maintenance of a patriotic morality in popular
                culture. Through the very act of authoring <em>Modern
                Greece,</em> Hemans underscores the participation of
                women in the patriotic defense of the nation, for only
                they, we are led to surmise from the text, can
                circumvent the decline of the imperial nation through
                the sedulous cultivation of the salutary and ultimately
                redemptive domestic affections. Her argument is
                compelling because it forces critics and historians to
                explore how the counter-hegemonic demand for greater
                female participation in public life and in the canons
                of literature can seemingly paradoxically be made from
                <em>within</em> the hegemonic and grossly masculine
                discourses of nationalism and imperialism. However,
                although this strategy ultimately did carve a public
                space for female patriotism, it left intact the
                institutions of patriarchy that continued to subjugate
                women. And, rather than challenge the prescriptive
                gender roles that propagated the figure of the lady,
                with its characteristic feminine delicacy, moral
                sympathy, and instinctive maternity, it objectively
                fortified them. But perhaps what should most perturb
                contemporary scholars about Hemans's argument is the
                manifest reality of Britain's rapid post-imperial
                decline. Strangely, it would seem that Hemans's new
                breed of civic-minded patriotic ladies may have helped
                to hasten Britain's decline precisely by fanning the
                flames of jingoism and imperial lust ever higher, and
                thus consuming in a shorter period the will and
                resources which it took Hellenic Greece several hundred
                years to exhaust.&nbsp; If imperialism has not brought
                to the British nation the utter ruin projected by the
                metanarratives of Gibbon and Volney, nonetheless it has
                effected a remarkable diminution of Britain's once
                formidable stature.</p>

            <p class="indent">5. <a name="note5" id="note5"></a>The
            conversation on Romantic ruins and fragments has had
            several notable episodes. Paul de Man's classic study of
            Shelley's <em>Triumph of Life</em>, &ldquo;Shelley
            Disfigured&rdquo; (1984), argues that we must resist the
            urge to seek semantic closure for the fragment poem through
            its &ldquo;monumentalization&rdquo; as historical or
            aesthetic object, a process that he claims arbitrarily
            settles meaning within a pre-determined historical or
            semantic order (121). In Thomas McFarland's <em>Romanticism
            and the Forms of Ruin</em>, the fragmentary is instead
            elevated to a cultural theme. In this
            expressivist-essentialist model, Romanticism is the
            emblematic expression of a phenomenological reality
            characterized by the &ldquo;diasparactive&rdquo; triad of
            incompleteness, fragmentation, and ruin (5-7). This
            reality, which is not necessarily mediated by social and
            political history, manifests in Romantic literature as the
            expression of longing and melancholy that terminate in a
            &ldquo;sentiment des ruines&rdquo; (15). Marjorie
            Levinson's <em>The Romantic Fragment Poem: A Critique of a
            Form</em> (1986) disputes this claim and argues instead for
            a historically nuanced reading of the fragment poem that
            disentangles the history of its composition, publication,
            and reception from the signification produced by the early
            nineteenth-century literary milieu and the legacy of
            Romantic ideology influencing modern critical discourse
            (8). Methodologically, this study most closely resembles
            Levinson's in its attention to historical facts and
            ideological determination. Yet it is not, per se, a study
            of the fragment as phenomenon or form.</p>

            and against an emergent bourgeois culture that emphasized
            the ameliorating effects of personal industry and commerce,
            despite being driven by self-interest and monetary reward.
            In many respects, Mandeville, a Dutch native raised in a
            commercial society where the state facilitated commercial
            and colonial expansion, is the mouthpiece for bourgeois
            cultural transvaluation against an established hegemonic
            aristocratic culture whose values and sensibility are
            rooted in the classical doctrine of &ldquo;virtu,&rdquo;

            relations. J.G.A. Pocock's &ldquo;The Mobility of Property

            argument that iconic images of femininity circulated
            alongside female texts in eighteenth-century print culture
            and lent them a unique marketing edge that also placed
            heavy constraints upon the public image of female authors.
            This is because readers consumed female texts as much for
            the commodified images of femininity associated with the
            author as for content of the texts themselves.</p>

            and &lsquo;the spear of Minerva': Felicia Hemans and the
            Dilemma of Gender&rdquo; (1994), has argued that Hemans
            deeply deplored the prescriptions of femininity that
            consigned her to a life of shattered domesticity after her
            husband's departure, and constrained her to write behind a
            domestic mask out of the economic necessity of providing
            for her family. She manages this situation by casting an
            array of female characters in her poetry that reflect the
            suffering endured by women as a result of their
            sequestration and subjection to losses inflicted by the
            masculine world of politics and war. As compensation, many
            of her characters model an almost stoical degree of heroism
            in the face of insurmountable suffering. Hence, her
            patriotic stance may well be an adaptation to the
            deplorable fate of women in a male-dominated society where
            the tranquility of domestic space is constantly imperiled
            by political intrigue and warfare.</p>

            the <em>Letter to John Murray</em> (26 February, 1817),
            cited in Wolfson 480-1. These marbles&mdash;scavenged from
            the ruins of the Parthenon and imported to London by Lord
            Elgin in 1804, and eventually sold to the British
            government in 1816&mdash;are featured in Keats's
            self-reflexive poem, <em>On Seeing the Elgin Marbles</em>
            (1817). But they were also the subject of a popular furor
            over their rightful ownership involving Byron when he, in
            Part II of <em>Childe Harold</em> (1812), explicitly
            deplores their theft. Interestingly, contemporary reviewers
            believed <em>Modern Greece</em> to have been written by
            Byron despite the fact that the poem clearly weighs-in in
            favor of this expropriation of Grecian art. See the review
            of <em>Modern Greece</em> in <em>The New British Ladies
            Magazine</em> n.s. 1 (1817): 70. See also Susan Wolfson's

            <p class="indent">26. <a name="note26" id="note26"></a>We
            know from Chorley that Volney was also quite influential on
            the young poet Hemans. He cites a correspondence from
            Bishop Heber that reveals Hemans's abandoned plan for a
            syncretistic poem along the lines of Volney's
            <em>Ruins</em>, in which her design was &ldquo;to trace out
            the symbolical meaning, by which the popular faiths of
            every land are linked together&rdquo; (I.46-7). One can
            infer from Daniel White's &ldquo;'Mysterious Sanctity':
            Sectarianism and Syncretism from Volney to Hemans&rdquo;
            that Hemans most likely did eventually complete her
            syncretistic and pietistic poem under the title of
            <em>Superstition and Revelation</em>, a twenty-eight stanza
            poem that argues for the universality of Christianity as
            the root of all other creeds, which are revealed to be
            superstitious adulterations of Christian revelation.</p>

            modern orientalism. As Said has explicated, the modern
            orientalist performs a vital function for imperialism by
            discursively mastering and dominating those peoples and
            regions under its scrutiny. According to Said, the practice
            of &ldquo;discovering&rdquo; the East operates within a
            modern paradigm of orientalism that figures the East as
            backwards and essentially knowable because it occupies a
            past stage in Western development. Said explains that this
            paradigm is contrary to classical orientalism, which
            figures the East as exotic, essentially different from the
            West, and therefore inscrutable (<em>Orientalism</em>
            120-3). Byron's treatment of Greece and the Levant in
            <em>Childe Harold</em> adheres closer to the latter
            mode.</p>
    
            <p class="indent">31. <a name="note31" id="note31"></a>In a
            letter to John Murray dated 4 September 1917, Byron,
            bristled by this wordplay, indignantly retorts,
            &ldquo;Besides, why &lsquo;<em>modern</em>?' You may say
            <em>modern Greeks</em>, but surely <em>Greece</em> itself
            is rather more ancient than ever it was&rdquo; (cited in
            Wolfson 536; his emphasis).</p>
    
            <p class="indent">32. <a name="note32" id=
            "note32"></a>Saree Makdisi makes a similar argument for
            Shelley's description of the East in <em>Alastor</em>,
            where he discursively depopulates and reduces to ruins the
            entirety of Eastern territories in order to enable a
            reframing of the East as pre-modern space situation within
            a historical continuum that leads teleologically to Western
            European civilization. See also his <em>Romantic
            Imperialism: Universal Empire and the Culture of
            Modernity</em> (1998) for a more advanced elaboration of

            <p class="indent">33. <a name="note33" id="note33"></a>This
            difference can perhaps help to explain why Byron spoke so
            fervently in behalf of Greek nationalism while Hemans

            more &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; British empire.</p>

            &ldquo;sentimental narrator.&rdquo; The &ldquo;sentimental
            narrator&rdquo; is defined as experiential, innocent,
            passive, and imperiled by natives, thereby deflecting any
            claim to imperial ambitions, when, in fact, this narrator
            is performing the necessary task of collecting data on
            unexplored territories. The narrator also inverts imperial
            reality by presenting soon-to-be conquered natives as
            dangerous aggressors while depicting the imperialist West
            as fundamentally benign, inquisitive, and innocent.</p>

            contends that sameness, not alterity, is the primary force
            that consolidated a cohesive British identity by
            psychologically binding Britain with its white settler
            communities across the globe (245). Accepting this, their
            globally scattered graves also work to engrave a British
            presence upon disparate and far-flung regions of the globe,
            symbolically annexing these territories to a British
