                <p>At first glance nothing seems more un-Shelleyean
                than patriotism. Nothing seems more opposed to
                Shelley&rsquo;s professed cosmopolitanism, to his
                philosophical skepticism, to his Godwinian
                disinterestedness, to his moral universalism, and to
                his political radicalism than the idea of patriotism,
                especially if we associate, as we are prone to do,
                patriotic sentiment with chauvinistic nationalism. But
                if we recall that there was a politically radical
                version of British patriotism,<a href=
                "#note1">[1]</a>
                and if we realize that Shelley&rsquo;s politics were
                just as practical as they were radical, we can start to
                think through just what Shelley means when he invokes
                patriotism, which he does in a surprising number of
                writings. Not only is his appeal to patriotic sentiment
                rhetorical, as in the "<em>popular songs</em> wholly
                political" (<em>Letters</em> 2: 191), it is also
                philosophical and poetic, as in writings as diverse as
                the pamphlet <em>An Address to the People on the Death
                of the Princess Charlotte</em>, the essay <em>On
                Love</em>, the unpublished <em>Philosophical View of
                Reform</em>, and the manifesto <em>A Defence of
                Poetry</em>. What emerges from these various
                deployments is an idea of patriotism that at once
                motivates the political reformer, whom Shelley calls
                the "true patriot" in <em>A Philosophical View of
                Reform</em>, and also occasions community, offering
                proof, in the language of the <em>Princess
                Charlotte</em> pamphlet, "that we love something
                besides ourselves" (<em>Prose Works</em> 232).
                Combining the motive to reform with the necessity of
                community, the references to patriotism in <em>A
                Defence of Poetry</em> suggest that patriotism in
                Shelley is what Edward Blyden called "the poetry of
                politics" (qtd. in Appiah 26).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Shelley&rsquo;s Irish pamphlets, written mostly in
                England, show an acute awareness of the problems facing
                a reformer who would like to address those outside his
                national borders. <em>An Address to the Irish
                People</em> (1812) begins,</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  FELLOW MEN, I am not an Irishman, yet I can feel for
                  you. I hope there are none among you who will read
                  this address with prejudice or levity, because it is
                  made by an Englishman; indeed, I believe there are
                  not. (<em>Prose Works</em> 9)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>From a position of tenuous authority,
                Shelley&rsquo;s gesture of transcultural sympathy is
                careful to register cultural difference and then move
                on to assert that the accident of where we are born
                ought not to disqualify the desire of the English
                reformer to enlighten the Irish: "I should like to know
                what there is in a man being an Englishman, a Spaniard,
                or a Frenchman, that makes him worse or better than he
                really is. He was born in one town, you in another, but
                that is no reason why he should not feel for you,
                desire your benefit, or be willing to give you some
                advice, which may make you more capable of knowing your
                own interest, or acting so as to secure it" (9).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>But is there tension between the apparently
                deracinated interests of the cosmopolitan reformer
                speaking political truth to the Irish people, and the
                "interests," however unspecified, of the Irish people
                themselves, interests that the cosmopolitan claims to
                be able to help the Irishman know? On a Shelleyean
                account the answer would be no: by virtue of feeling
                for and speaking to the Irish people, the cosmopolitan
                reformer performs the benevolence with which he or she
                hopes to animate his or her readership. As Shelley puts
                it in another of the Irish pamphlets, the "benevolent
                passions . . . generalize and expand private into
                public feelings, and make the hearts of individuals
                vibrate not merely for themselves, their families, and
                their friends, but for posterity, <em>for a
                people</em>; till their country becomes the world, and
                their family the sensitive creation" (<em>Prose
                Works</em> 41). The idea of feeling "<em>for a
                people</em>," italicized by Shelley in
                <em><em>Proposals for an Association of
                Philanthropists</em></em>, is probably deliberately
                unspecific as to who "the people" is, because "a
                people" in this sense can be either a nation or the
                world. So long as we move beyond the circles of
                families and friends and into the larger, often
                inconceivable circles of nation and world&mdash;and
                here is where patriotism becomes a vital concept even
                for the young Shelley &mdash; we negate the tendency
                toward self-centeredness: "In proportion as he feels
                with, or for, a nation or a world, so will man consider
                himself less as that centre, to which we are but too
                prone to believe that every line of human concern does,
                or ought to converge" (41).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Phrases such as "a nation or a world" suggest that
                Shelley thought the moral imagination capable of
                feeling for more than one "people" at once;
                additionally, they suggest that he thought patriotism
                and cosmopolitanism not incompatible. The compatibility
                of cosmopolitanism and patriotism was not an uncommon
                trope in the rhetoric of English radicalism after the
                French Revolution, a tradition which came to Shelley
                most of all through William Godwin, his intellectual
                hero and eventual father-in-law, but also through
                Paine, Tooke, Coleridge, and the Wordsworth of the
                1790s. In a sermon called <em>A Discourse on the Love
                of our Country</em> on 4 November 1789, the Dissenting
                minister Richard Price asserted that there was no
                problem in celebrating the English constitution along
                with the events in France. The love of our country,
                Price says, "does not imply any conviction of the
                superior value of it to other countries, or any
                particular preference of its laws and constitution of
                government" (25). Moreover, Price says of our country
                that "[w]e ought to seek its good, by all the means
                that our different circumstances and abilities will
                allow; but at the same time we ought to consider
                ourselves as citizens of the world, and take care to
                maintain a just regard to the rights of other
                countries" (26).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>As David Bromwich notes, the "pretension" of
                Price&rsquo;s cosmopolitan sympathies was a central
                target of Edmund Burke&rsquo;s <em>Reflections on the
                Revolution in France</em>, which argues passionately
                that such sympathy, in Bromwich&rsquo;s paraphrase, is
                "morally impossible" because "before you can be a
                citizen of the world, you must be a member of a family,
                then a neighbor of others in a small community, then
                and only then a citizen of a nation. . . . After the
                abstraction of a nation, long after, comes mankind"
                (73). Burke&rsquo;s expression of the communitarian
                thesis contains the memorable idea of our "little
                platoon":</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  To be attached to the subdivision, to love the little
                  platoon we belong to in society, is the first
                  principle (the germ as it were) of public affections.
                  It is the first link in the series by which we
                  proceed towards a love to our country and to mankind.
                  (46-7)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Shelley&rsquo;s idea of patriotism encompasses both
                Burke&rsquo;s organic localism and Price&rsquo;s
                radical world-citizenship: it would extol them both
                equally for the basic virtue of countervailing our
                tendency to self-love, and for the expansion of private
                into public feelings for either a nation or a
                world.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Unlike the patriotism of Burke or Price, however,
                Shelley&rsquo;s idea of patriotism was not based on an
                ancient English constitution or even what Price calls
                "that event in this country to which the name of THE
                REVOLUTION has been given" (28). Shelley did not, as
                Paine charged of Burke, look to antiquity for
                authority. This much is made clear in Shelley&rsquo;s
                obscure prose fragment <em>The Elysian Fields</em>
                (1815 or 1816), which E. B. Murray identifies as a
                lesson in political philosophy addressed to the
                Princess Charlotte (<em>Prose Works</em> 400):</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  The English nation does not, as has been imagined,
                  inherit freedom from its ancestors. Public opinion
                  rather than positive institution maintains it in
                  whatever portion it may now possess; which is in
                  truth the acquirement of its own incessant struggles.
                  (<em>Prose Works</em> 163)
                </blockquote>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Yet in "The Mask of Anarchy" (a poem included among
                his "popular songs"), Shelley addresses the "Men of
                England, heirs of glory, / Heroes of unwritten story"
                (147-148), bringing together the acknowledgement of a
                common past with the idea of a shared future, while
                "unwritten" asserts the agency of the "men of England,"
                the "heroes," in that future. "Unwritten" also
                indicates their heroic though yet-to-be written role in
                the past "glory" of England to which the present
                generation is "heir." The as-yet-imagined, "unwritten"
                quality of the future of England aligns Shelley with
                the radical constitutionalism of Paine&rsquo;s
                <em>Rights of Man</em>, and against the interpretation
                of the English constitution in Burke&rsquo;s
                <em>Reflections</em>. But how does Shelley get from the
                assertion in <em>The Elysian Fields</em> that "the
                English nation does not, as has been imagined, inherit
                freedom from its ancestors" to the idea in the popular
                songs of 1819 that the "men of England" are not only
                the "heroes" of their nation&rsquo;s "incessant
                struggles," but also that they are the "heirs of
                glory"?</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The transition can be explained by a look at a
                series of texts in which Shelley invokes patriotism,
                proceeding from the political pamphlets of 1817 to
                <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> in 1821. Patriotism
                appears at the intersection of Shelley&rsquo;s
                practical politics of reform, as in the appeals to it
                in the pamphlets, and his developing aesthetics of
                sociality, as in <em>On Love</em> and <em>A
                Defence</em>. The ideas that Shelley associates with
                patriotism, as well as the uses to which he puts it,
                originate as the going-out-of-ourselves, however
                contingent and varied the occasion, be it for the sake
                of aesthetic experience, material necessity, or public
                mourning. While the political pamphlets of 1817
                encourage patriotism&mdash;and in fact are composed out
                of patriotic feeling&mdash;Shelley&rsquo;s
                philosophical and poetic writings locate this
                patriotism in the affections. It is located in "our
                best affections," in fact, according to the
                <em>Princess Charlotte</em> pamphlet, and it is "at war
                with every base desire," in the language of <em>A
                Defence</em>. Variously deployed, patriotism in Shelley
                is a form of what he would come to call Love: a
                sympathetic identification with something besides our
                selves, something larger. It is both cause and effect;
                which is to say, it is both that out of which we act,
                writing pamphlets or poetry, and what it is we hope to
                achieve, the history that is yet unwritten.</p>

              <li>
                <p>Intended for an imagined readership of enlightened
                reformers, <em>A Proposal for Putting Reform to the
                Vote throughout the Kingdom</em> (1817) appeals to
                love-of-country as the solution to partisan
                gridlock:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  That the most eloquent, and the most virtuous, and
                  the most venerable among the Friends of Liberty
                  should employ their authority and their intellect to
                  persuade men to lay aside all animosity and even
                  discussion respecting the topics on which they are
                  disunited and by the love which they bear to their
                  suffering country conjure them to contribute all
                  their energies to set this great question at
                  rest&mdash;whether the nation desires a reform in
                  Parliament or no. (<em>Prose Works</em> 173)
                </blockquote>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>With the concept of patriotism unstable in the
                second decade of the nineteenth century, Shelley
                attaches it to eloquence, virtue, authority, intellect,
                and even to rhetorical persuasion&mdash;all
                characteristics of the enlightened. There is a
                distinction between the "most venerable among the
                Friends of Liberty" and the "men" whom they must
                persuade, suggesting that those who are enlightened
                already love their country and ought, for practical
                political reasons, convince others to love it too. As
                such, patriotism has a dual function in this passage:
                it is both what motivates the eloquent and virtuous
                Friends of Liberty to persuade others to set aside
                their differences <em>and</em> what the result of such
                persuasion is; which is to say, patriotism is both
                cause and effect.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In his other major pamphlet of 1817, Shelley locates
                patriotism not in the perfection of a mythical
                pre-Norman constitution or in "public opinion," but
                instead in the "bosoms of men," "revived" along with
                other "glorious emotions" such as "a noble spirit" and
                "the love of liberty" (<em>Prose Works</em> 236). The
                revival of patriotism in the "bosoms of men" occupies a
                crucial juncture in the brief historical narrative that
                Shelley presents in the pamphlet <em>On the Death of
                the Princess</em>. The narrative is an economic and
                social history of England from the war in America to
                the juxtaposed death of the Princess Charlotte and the
                execution of laborers Jeremiah Brandreth, William
                Turner, and Isaac Ludlum. A pr&eacute;cis of the
                socioeconomic analysis in the 1819 <em>Philosophical
                View of Reform</em>, the version of "things as they
                are" in the 1817 pamphlet not only shows
                Shelley&rsquo;s proto-Marxian vision of alienated
                labor, but also, in its indictment of the "double
                aristocracy" effected by the public debt, betrays
                Shelley&rsquo;s often overlooked aristocratic
                disposition.<a href=
                "#note2">[2]</a>
                Shelley posits a necessary connection between the
                prosperity of the new aristocracy of "villainous trade"
                and the "miseries" of the "day labourer":</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  The labourer, he that tills the ground and
                  manufactures cloth, is the man who has to provide,
                  out of what he would bring home to his wife and
                  children, for the luxuries and comforts of those,
                  whose claims are represented by an annuity of
                  forty-four millions a year levied upon the English
                  nation. . . . Many and various are the mischiefs
                  flowing from oppression, but this is the
                  representative of them all; namely, that one man is
                  forced to labour for another in a degree not only
                  necessary to the support of the subsisting
                  distinctions among mankind, but so as by the excess
                  of the injustice to endanger the very foundations of
                  all that is valuable in social order, and to provoke
                  that anarchy which is at once the enemy of freedom,
                  and the child and the chastiser of misrule. (236)

              <li>
                <p>According to Shelley the agent of redress is "the
                nation," which "began to be weary of the continuance of
                such dangers and degradations," and its means is "the
                public voice," which "loudly demanded a free
                representation of the people" (236). And while "the
                nation itself" was reacting to the "hard necessity"
                following from the public debt, at some point, perhaps
                without "the nation" even knowing, "[a] nobler spirit
                also went abroad, and the love of liberty, and
                patriotism, and the self-respect attendant on those
                glorious emotions, revived in the bosoms of men" (236).
                United in the sense of "self-respect" that they
                generate, the "glorious emotions" of patriotism,
                liberty, and nobility of spirit are in fact not
                presented as the cause of the nation&rsquo;s "daring to
                touch the question" of parliamentary reform; rather,
                they are presented by Shelley as being there all along,
                having "[gone] abroad" uncaused or been "revived"
                unknowingly by and in each who contributed to the
                "public voice." But in Shelley&rsquo;s historical
                narrative the "public voice" gets "overpowered by the
                timid and the selfish" (237), showing the contingency
                of progressive reform on the confluence of daring and
                selflessness. Only a "regularly constituted assembly of
                the nation" can conjure again the "public voice" that
                brings with it a nobler spirit, the love of liberty and
                patriotism&mdash;in short, the
                self-respect&mdash;necessary for wresting power away
                from the despots of England in 1817 and their "infernal
                agents." For the time being, however, Shelley advises
                the English people to mourn, not just for the Princess
                Charlotte or even just for the executed laborers, but
                for "British Liberty":</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Mourn then People of England. Clothe yourselves in
                  solemn black. Let the bells be tolled. Think of
                  mortality and change. Shroud yourselves in solitude
                  and the gloom of sacred sorrow. Spare no symbol of
                  universal grief. Weep&mdash;mourn&mdash;lament. Fill
                  the great City&mdash;fill the boundless fields, with
                  lamentation and the echoes of groans. (238-39)
                </blockquote>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The idea of public mourning is addressed at the
                start of the pamphlet <em>On the Death of the
                Princess</em>. Shelley comes out in favor of it for
                reasons that have everything to do with what he means
                when he invokes patriotism: "Men do well to mourn the
                dead," Shelley writes, "because it proves that we love
                something besides ourselves" (232). Patriotism proves
                the same thing, and it becomes clear that patriotic
                sentiment is involved in Shelley&rsquo;s vision of
                public mourning, as he writes that "[t]o lament for
                those who have benefitted the state, is a habit yet
                more favorable to the cultivation of our best
                affections" (<em>Prose Works</em> 232). While
                patriotism is not mentioned in Shelley&rsquo;s
                dissertation on public mourning, it is undoubtedly
                present as the name for what happens when we mourn,
                like the Athenians, for "those who have benefitted the
                state." Feeling for a loss beyond our little platoon is
                a characteristic of a "liberal mind":</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  We cannot truly grieve for every one who dies beyond
                  the circle of those especially dear to us; yet in the
                  extinction of the objects of public love and
                  admiration, and gratitude, there is something, if we
                  enjoy a liberal mind, which has departed from within
                  that circle. It were well done also, that men should
                  mourn for any public calamity which has befallen
                  their country or the world, though it be not death.
                  This helps maintain that connexion between one man
                  and another, and all men considered as a whole, which
                  is the bond of social life. (232)
                </blockquote>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Public mourning and patriotic sentiment are affairs
                of the heart, grounded in the "feelings of men" rather
                than in their intellects (232). They "occasion" a
                "pouring forth" of "those fertilizing streams of
                sympathy," which Shelley calls "solemnity": "This
                solemnity should be used only to express a wide and
                intelligible calamity, and one which is felt to be such
                by those who feel for their country and for mankind;
                its character ought to be universal, not particular"
                (233). Seeing no problem with feeling for both the
                country and for mankind at the same time, Shelley looks
                to public mourning as an occasion for patriotic
                sentiment&mdash;an occasion, however contingent, for
                the sociality that comprises our "best affections."</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Our "best affections" are the subject of the 1818
                essay <em>On Love</em>, which defines them as our
                search for community when we discover that merely our
                own thoughts are not enough: "[Love] is that powerful
                attraction towards all that we conceive or fear or hope
                beyond ourselves when we find within our own thoughts
                the chasm of an insufficient void and seek to awaken in
                all things that are a community with what we experience
                within ourselves" (<em>Shelley&rsquo;s Poetry and
                Prose</em> 503). Directed "beyond ourselves," this
                "powerful attraction" is what is at work in the kind of
                patriotism Shelley imagines and invokes. Indeed,
                patriotism, or more specifically "patriotic success,"
                is referenced in <em>On Love</em>, occurring remarkably
                in a group with both natural beauty and the singing of
                a loved one:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  There is eloquence in the tongueless wind and a
                  melody in the flowing of brooks and the rustling of
                  the reeds beside them which by their inconceivable
                  relation to something within the soul awaken the
                  spirits to a dance of breathless rapture, and bring
                  tears of mysterious tenderness to the eyes like the
                  enthusiasm of patriotic success or the voice of one
                  beloved singing to you alone. (504)
                </blockquote>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The specific comparison in this passage between the
                effect of natural "eloquence" and "melody" on "the
                soul" and that of "patriotic success" and a
                beloved&rsquo;s voice, both eliciting "tears of
                mysterious tenderness," suggests that while the true
                nature of patriotic sentiment is utterly inconceivable
                and thus profoundly mysterious, it can still be judged
                by its emotional impact. Like eloquence, melody, and a
                lover&rsquo;s voice, it belies our self-centeredness
                and shows us that we have a stake in what is public,
                that our "souls" bear a relationship to a nation or a
                world.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In <em>A Philosophical View of Reform</em> (1819),
                the idea of patriotism as both cause and effect, as
                both the motivation of the reformer and what reform
                would look like, informs Shelley&rsquo;s definition of
                the "true patriot": "The true patriot will endeavor to
                enlighten and to unite the nation and animate it with
                enthusiasm and confidence" (<em>Trumpet of a
                Prophecy</em> 257). The true, reformist patriot by
                definition goes out of herself and identifies with
                something larger; and the task of reform is to elicit
                this going out of self and identification&mdash;in
                short, this kind of Love&mdash;in others. Patriotism is
                both what impels the reformer and what she hopes to
                achieve. Refraining from any talk of enlightening,
                uniting, or animating all of mankind (a task left to
                the poets, those "legislators of the world"), Shelley
                assigns a central role to the "true patriot" in his
                vision of English social reform. In fact, the projects
                that Shelley sets forth for the "true patriot"
                encompass many of Shelley&rsquo;s own activities as a
                socially-committed poet: the tireless promulgation of
                political truth, the appeal to the Friends of Liberty
                to put aside their differences and come together on
                issues of common concern, the proposal of "open
                confederations" or philanthropic associations, and the
                incitement of the people to exercise their right of
                assembly in reasonable numbers. The "true patriot" is
                also the prophet of nonviolence:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Lastly, if circumstances had collected a more
                  considerable number as at Manchester on the memorable
                  16th of August, if the tyrants command their troops
                  to fire upon them or cut them down unless they
                  disperse, [the true patriot] will exhort them
                  peaceably to risk the danger, and to expect without
                  resistance the onset of the cavalry, and wait with
                  folded arms the event of the fire of the artillery
                  and receive with unshrinking bosoms the bayonets of
                  the charging battalions. (257)
                </blockquote>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The logic of Shelleyean nonviolence is manifold, but
                it includes at its heart the confrontation of the
                soldiers with their fellow men and fellow
                countrymen&mdash;or perhaps more accurately with their
                fellow men whom they only know, by virtue of the
                accident of being born in one country instead of
                another, as their fellow countrymen. Shelley notes
                twice this dual citizenship, both times pointing out
                that the soldiers are men and Englishmen: "In the first
                place, the soldiers are men and Englishmen, and it is
                not to be believed that they would massacre an
                unresisting multitude of their countrymen drawn up in
                unarmed array before them and bearing in their looks
                the calm, deliberate resolution to perish rather than
                abandon the assertion of their rights" (257). In the
                next use of the phrase&mdash;"[b]ut the soldier is a
                man and an Englishman" (257)&mdash;such dual
                citizenship is what "would probably throw [the soldier]
                back upon a recollection of the true nature of the
                measures of which he was made the instrument, and the
                enemy might be converted into the ally" (257). The
                sympathetic identification of soldier and laborer is
                not only a going-out-of-self by each party, but an
                expansion of passion, benevolence, and affection that
                is concomitant with the soldier&rsquo;s realization of
                his merely instrumental, and thus repressive,
                agency.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Although Shelley&rsquo;s "popular songs" prescribe
                just this kind of nonviolent resistance, there is no
                mention of poets and poetry in Shelley&rsquo;s
                description of the "true patriot" in <em>A
                Philosophical View of Reform</em>. Yet in <em>A Defence
                of Poetry</em> patriotism clearly depends for its
                vitality on poetry, and on the delicate sensibility and
                enlarged imagination of the true poet, which elevate
                patriotism to the realm of virtue, friendship, and
                love. Shelley mentions patriotism three times in <em>A
                Defence</em>, once in a discussion of Homer&rsquo;s
                heroes, and then twice in a list with virtue,
                friendship, and love, implying that each is equivalent
                to the others not only for their common grounding in
                poetry, but also for the fact that each is a version of
                the great secret of morals, which is "the going out of
                our own nature" (<em>Shelley&rsquo;s Poetry and
                Prose</em> 517):</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  What were Virtue, Love, Patriotism, Friendship
                  &amp;c.&mdash;what were the scenery of this beautiful
                  Universe which we inhabit&mdash;what were our
                  consolations on this side of the grave&mdash;and what
                  were our aspirations beyond it&mdash;if Poetry did
                  not ascend to bring light and fire from those eternal
                  regions where the owl-winged faculty of calculation
                  dare not ever soar? (531)
                </blockquote>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Poetry, "unlike reasoning" but more like "something
                divine," "that from which all spring, and that which
                adorns all," or "the perfect and consummate surface and
                bloom of things," not only accompanies, expresses, and
                embodies patriotism, but also participates wholly in
                it. Poetry is the origin of patriotism as well as its
                performance. The expression of patriotism, or its
                influence on thought or action, is poetry, because a
                patriot by definition proves that she loves something
                besides herself. This is "the poetry of politics," the
                Shellyean patriotism that is what happens when "self
                appears as what it is, an atom to a Universe," the part
                of a necessary whole (532). But this applies, as
                Shelley&rsquo;s repeated invocations of patriotic
                sentiment contend, whether the "whole" be a nation or a
                world, for love of either mankind or England is equally
                a going out of our own nature, equally enough to
                motivate reform and to occasion sympathy.</p>

            radical patriotism of the eighteenth century came to an end
            with the American war because of the patriots&rsquo;
            generally pro-American, pacifist stance. After 1780 the
            relationship between radicalism and patriotism became
            strained, and the next two decades saw the vocabulary of
            patriotism enfolded in the rhetoric of
            conservatism&mdash;although the Tories grew increasingly
            fond of the idea of &ldquo;loyalism&rdquo; over the idea of
