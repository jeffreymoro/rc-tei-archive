                <p>In the wake of 9/11 and the U.S. invasion of Iraq,
                public discourse has undergone a radical
                impoverishment. It would be naive to assume simply the
                sophistication of a prior civil discourse, but the
                cretinization of political argument&mdash;the reduction
                of the current political and global catastrophe we face
                to a few catch phrases of the &ldquo;war on
                terrorism,&rdquo; &ldquo;good versus evil,&rdquo; and
                &ldquo;civilization versus barbarism&rdquo;&mdash;has
                been too stunning to ignore. Given the martial
                narrative that U.S. foreign policy has embedded this
                deracinated vocabulary within, we might assume that
                such a diminishment of discourse has always been served
                by the language, or event, of patriotism. However, as
                the Iraqi war enters a new stage of diminished
                expectations and increased U.S. public restiveness, and
                the language of a loyal opposition begins to be spoken,
                it is clear that reducing patriotism to martial
                language is not simply a given. Following Claude Levi
                Strauss and Jim Chandler, we might then note how a
                prior &ldquo;hot chronology&rdquo; of history, one also
                of national panic and imperial overreach, as well as
                patriotic dissent, demonstrates even more vividly how
                patriotism actually registers the contradictions of a
                time lived and represented in apocalyptic terms
                (Chandler, 3; Levi-Strauss, 259). The writings of the
                Romantic era reveal patriotism to be neither simple nor
                transparent in either its ideological inscriptions or
                rhetorical performances, a predicament that this
                collection of <em>Romantic Circles Praxis</em> essays,
                first presented at the NASSR 2005 annual conference in
                Montreal, begins to explore.</p>

              <li>
                <p>Patriotism in its triumphalist form is arguably
                always melancholic, either implicitly so as the
                presence that jingoism defends itself against, or
                explicitly so as that which jingoism in its
                memorializing mode exploits. As Freud reminds us,
                melancholy designates a fixed attachment to a lost
                loved one; in the case of the melancholic triumphalist
                the patriotic fixation can center on either the lost
                martial body or the lost purpose of a war increasingly
                difficult to justify (124-40). As inhabitants of
                modernity we might, however, first and foremost
                associate the &ldquo;lost one&rdquo; of patriotic
                melancholy with the nation state, that which
                paradoxically can never be lost, if patriotism has any
                constative or performative value to it. Patriotism
                repudiates this loss by turning itself into the ongoing
                affirmation, or discovery, of the nation, which makes
                the obdurate, patriotic professions of nationless
                individuals an especially melancholy sight.</p>

                <p>Yet, as <a href="../crocco/crocco.html">Frank
                Crocco's</a> and <a href=
                "../borushko/borushko_essay.html">Mathew C.
                Borushko's</a> contributions to this volume attest, the
                equation of patriotism and nation is itself a
                complicated reification. Crocco's essay, &ldquo;The
                Ruins of Empire,&rdquo; reminds us that the 18th
                -century historicism of Gibbon and Volney actually
                disarticulates two terms that we might assume are
                synonymous with patriotism: nation and empire. For
                Crocco, Felicia Hemans's <em>Modern Greece</em> (1817)
                paradoxically mimics a Gibbonesque vision of ancient
                history in order to bring these ideas together, via a
                modern patriotism that is at once a polemical incursion
                of female agency into the public arena. Borushko's
                piece, &ldquo;`A Nation or A World,'&rdquo; considers
                the Romantic non-patriot par excellence, Percy Bysshe
                Shelley, and shows how much his politics are actually
                underwritten by what could be called a poetics of
                patriotism. In Borushko's estimation, Shelley's
                patriotism is actually one with his visionary
                cosmopolitanism, an ethical demand for a life lived
                centrifugally, a love always taking one out of one's
                private and national self.</p>

                <p><a href="../oquinn/oquinn_essay.html">Danny
                O'Quinn</a> resituates patriotism within the twin
                projects of nation-making and imperial adventure,
                though in a way that transforms the melancholic
                triumphalist into an even more phantasmic agent of
                conflicting desires. In O'Quinn's contribution,
                &ldquo;Projection, Patriotism, Surrogation,&rdquo; the
                1793 Calcutta celebrations of the defeat of Tipu Sultan
                at the hands of the British Army, culminating in the
                performance of excerpts from Handel's operetta
                <em>Judas Maccabaeus</em>, expose a &ldquo;masochistic
                nationalism&rdquo; that reenacts the trauma of past
                colonial disasters in order to imagine (never quite
                successfully, nor simply) the pleasures of future
                empire. <a href="../lincoln/lincoln_essay.html">Andrew
                Lincoln's</a> essay, &ldquo;Walter Scott, Politeness,
                and Patriotism,&rdquo; also measures the distance
                between metropole and empire in terms of the patriotic
                envisioning of a nation, in this case Sir Walter
                Scott's creation of Great Britain out of England and
                Scotland. Scott's patriotism also takes a surprising
                form in Lincoln's argument, a Swiftian vulgarity now
                employed at the start of the nineteenth century to
                unite disparate social groups separated by
                modernization. Playing off of Peter Stallybrass's and
                Allon White's argument about the production of refined
                politeness, Lincoln sees patriotism in Scott as a
                &ldquo;relibidnization&rdquo; of a national body whose
                gross reality cuts across class lines but whose
                unsettling powers are also limited by the mediating
                procedures of the novel.</p>

              <li>
                <p>The gross body also plays a central role in <a href=
                "../heringman/heringman_essay.html">Noah
                Heringman's</a> study of the &ldquo;satire wars&rdquo;
                of the 1790s. In his &ldquo;`Manlius to Peter
                Pindar,'&rdquo; that body becomes the very material by
                which the invectives of either a patriotic or
                unpatriotic stance are made intelligible, as they swirl
                around the figure of Georgian political satirist (and
                nemesis) John Wolcot. In their fascination with anal
                violation and unbridled corpulence, the attacks by and
                against Wolcot tie the patriotism of a nation to a
                masculinity in stark contrast to the opportunistic
                feminine patriotism that Crocco's Hemans will formulate
                two decades later.</p>

                <p>Concluding the volume, <a href=
                "../mieszkowski/mieszkowski_essay.html">Jan
                Mieszkowski's</a> contribution, &ldquo;Patriot
                Acts,&rdquo; departs not only for the continent but
                also for another perspective beside the historical,
                focusing on a materiality as ineluctable as that of the
                body's in Lincoln and Heringman, but one whose
                generation of affect is now conceived in terms of its
                linguistic, rather than simply physical, properties. In
                Heinrich von Kleist, Mieszkowski argues, patriotism is
                actually the impossible intervention in language's
                self-affection, &ldquo; in the acts by which language
                seeks to correspond with a form, structure, or law that
                is, strictly speaking, inconceivable.&rdquo;
                Mieszkowski thus both summarizes and reorients one key
                coordinate in this collection. The patriotic link
                between nation and self, the problem of political
                philosophy, becomes the dilemma of a subject subtended
                by linguistic violence&mdash;in Kleist's play, <em>Die
                Hermannsschlacht, The Battle of Hermann</em> (1808),
                cathected as the redundant sovereignty of one word,
                &ldquo;heil.&rdquo;</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Both Mieszkowski and Borushko also connect the
                question of patriotism to that of love, albeit in very
                different ways. Still, Misekowski's attention to the
                alterity of language and Borushko's sense of patriotism
                as a falling out of one's self speak to a further
                question about patriotism upon which this introduction
                can conclude. Is there a more radical form of
                patriotism than that of the loyal opposition, one that,
                after Derrida, strains past every self-reification,
                even the ones that cosmopolitanism produces? Can there
                be a patriotism of the Other? If the force of this
                question feels like an impossible task that we at this
                moment cannot afford to fail, Romanticism models for
                us, both historically and transhistorically, a practice
                shot through by that same urgency. Dialectically,
                Romanticism's expressions of social transformation,
                both libidinal and traumatic, become something more
                than the cries of a supererogatory utopianism. They
                constitute instead the very r&eacute;cits of a
                material, social antagonism that enmesh us to this
                day.</p>
