                <p>Scott often writes of patriotism in terms that evoke
                the austere virtue of classical humanist tradition. In
                the <em>Life of Napoleon</em>, for example, he argues
                that patriotism has "always been found to flourish in
                that state of society which is most favourable to the
                stern and manly virtues of self-denial, temperance,
                chastity, contempt of luxury, patient exertion, and
                elevated contemplation" (<em>Napoleon</em> 52). If
                patriotism implied active resistance to tyranny and
                oppression, and heroic self-sacrifice for the public
                good, it was easy to think of it as a virtue that
                predated the ethos of commerce, since (as many scholars
                have noted) the moral justification of commerce was
                centred on ideas of virtue associated with refinement,
                sociability, humanitarian sympathy, and on the personal
                liberty of the individual.<a href=
                "#note1">[1]</a>
                The tension between these ideas of virtue runs through
                the work of many writers in the eighteenth and early
                nineteenth centuries, including Scott&rsquo;s.
                Patriotism is a common theme in his fiction, and yet
                the hero is usually destined to be separated ultimately
                from the stern demands of patriotic duty and to be
                consigned to the enjoyment of personal liberty and
                material prosperity. In what sense, then, can Scott
                himself be described as a patriotic writer, when he
                writes novels for a commercial market?</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Scott&rsquo;s career as a novelist began in a period
                when the most serious threat to Britain&mdash;once the
                menace of Napoleon had receded&mdash;appeared to lie in
                internal conflict, the mutual alienation of the social
                orders. He responded most keenly to the evidence of
                division in rural areas, where the population was still
                rising faster than employment, and where it was still
                possible to imagine a rapprochement between the social
                orders through benevolent paternalism. I accept E.P.
                Thompson&rsquo;s view that to use the term
                "paternalism" in the context of eighteenth-century
                Britain is to evoke a "myth or ideology," rather than
                an actual social practice based on "face-to-face
                relations" between landowners and the poor. In
                Thompson&rsquo;s account the myth was sustained in an
                age when the power of the governing classes was located
                primarily in a "cultural hegemony," maintained through
                "postures and gestures" that worked to give structures
                of authority the appearance of a natural order
                (Thompson 23, 24, 46, 43). The widening gap between
                myth and "actual social practice" is a problem Scott
                has to address. Throughout eighteenth-century Britain
                the culture of paternalism was being weakened by
                economic, demographic and political changes.
                Transformations in agricultural practices led to the
                abandonment of direct economic relations between
                landowners and those who worked on their land, while
                long-established methods of supporting the poor had
                been allowed to lapse. In Scotland, the major cities
                were becoming increasingly aware of the problems posed
                by the poor displaced from the rural areas, although
                awareness did not necessarily result in a willingness
                to deal with the problems (Dwyer [1989]).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>To a twenty-first century reader, Scott&rsquo;s
                attitude to these developments must seem inconsistent.
                He was in favour of abolishing the Elizabethan Statute
                of Artificers and Apprentices, which regulated
                relations between employers and workers, and was
                critical of the poor law. He also accepted the
                "legislative interference" of the Corn Laws (introduced
                to maintain prices) as "an imperious
                necessity."<a href="#note2">[2]</a>
                Graham McMaster concludes that his position on such
                issues "makes it inconvenient to present him as a
                paternalist" (McMaster 82). But in this period it was
                hardly unusual for those who embraced the ideology of
                paternalism to hold such attitudes (see Perkin 182-192
                and Roberts 18-21). Scott was generally distrustful of
                government regulation&mdash;rather more so than
                Coleridge and Southey, who favoured state intervention
                on behalf of the poor (Lawes 29 ff). His distrust may
                be consistent with the laissez-faire emphasis of the
                new political economy. But it is rooted less in a
                commitment to what Adam Smith would term a "system of
                natural liberty," in which individual agents were free
                to pursue their own self-interest (Smith ii 208), than
                in a commitment to maintaining local dependencies by
                finding private solutions to social problems.<a href=
                "#note3">[3]</a>
                In his letters he suggests that the British post-war
                crisis was worse in England than in Scotland because
                Scottish landowners (including himself) still preserved
                paternal links with the poor, links that provided
                opportunities for shared cultural experiences, while in
                England, dependence on the "accursed poor-rates" was
                helping to promote discontents and "reforming mania"
                among the English lower classes (<em>Letters</em> V 173
                [July 1818], 509-510 [October 1819]). And he compares
                the bad effects of employing the poor on public works
                in Edinburgh with the good effects of his own methods
                of employing the poor on his Abbotsford estate
                (<em>Letters</em>, IV, 446-447 [May 1817]).<a href=
                "#note4">[4]</a>
                He shares a growing concern about the effects of
                modernization upon the higher and middling ranks of
                society, who were apparently being led (as the High
                Tory <em>Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine</em> complained)
                "to deride and despise a thousand of those means of
                communication that in the former days knit all orders
                of the people together" (1820, VII, 90-102). In his
                reactionary political work <em>The Visionary</em>,
                competed in May 1819, Scott evoked the impossibility of
                re-establishing cordial paternal relations with the
                poor once these have been broken.<a href=
                "#note5">[5]</a>
                He saw the country gentleman as "the natural protector
                and referee of the farmer and the peasant"
                (<em>Napoleon</em> 27), and a breakdown of this natural
                relation as a threat to national liberty. One of the
                aims of his writing is to defend his
                nation&mdash;Scotland-within-Britain&mdash;from this
                perceived threat of social disintegration; it is in
                relation to this aim that Scott can be thought of as a
                patriotic writer. I shall argue that some of the formal
                characteristics and thematic preoccupations of this
                fiction can be understood in terms of this patriotic
                mission.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Scott&rsquo;s paternalism conceives of an ideal
                relationship between landowners and land-workers, an
                ideal of mutual affection based on mutual kindness and
                shared interests. In his preface to <em>Memoirs of the
                Marchioness De La Rochejaquelein</em> (1827), for
                example, Scott finds his ideal realised in the
                relations between the French nobles and peasants of the
                Vend&eacute;&mdash;who at the time of the French
                revolution joined together in a vigorous campaign of
                patriotic resistance against the power of revolutionary
                Paris. This close relationship between peasant and
                landowner had survived in the remote region of the
                Vend&acute;e, because (unlike relations throughout the
                rest of France) it had been not been disrupted by the
                spread of metropolitan manners. Scott notes with
                approval that such Vend&eacute;an landowners "as went
                occasionally to Paris, had the good sense to lay aside
                the manners of the metropolis, and resume their
                provincial simplicity, so soon as they returned" (8).
                Here, then, the ideal is sustained by a movement
                between different codes of behaviour, different
                conventions and manners, polite and vulgar. It is
                sustained, that is, by role-playing, and suggests an
                attitude to identity that contrasts strikingly with
                Wordsworthian ideas of organic consciousness.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Scott&rsquo;s historical investigations are partly
                driven by his paternalism, which shapes his interest in
                forms of cultural interaction between social orders in
                earlier ages. This is an interest he shares with
                English antiquarians such as Henry Bourne
                (<em>Antiquitates Vulgares</em>, 1725), John Brand
                (<em>Observations on Popular Antiquities</em>, 1777, an
                annotated edition of <em>Bourne&rsquo;s
                Antiquitates</em>), Francis Grose (<em>A Provincial
                Glossary with a collection of local proverbs and
                popular superstitions</em>, 1782), Joseph Strutt,
                (<em>Horda Angel-cynna, or A Compleat view of the
                Manners, Customs, Arms, Habits, etc of the People of
                England</em>, 1775-76, <em>Glig-Gamena Angel Deod or
                The Sports and Pastime of the People of England</em>,
                1801) and Francis Douce (<em>Illustrations of
                Shakespeare and of Ancient Manners</em>, 1807). The
                interests of these writers were rather different from
                those of the Scottish, Irish and Welsh nationalist
                antiquarians who, in Katie Trumpener&rsquo;s account,
                were inspired by the patriotic resistance of the
                ancient bards, and "emphasised the collapse of Celtic
                clan structure under the pressures of Christianity and
                English conquest" (Trumpener 7). The English writers
                look back to localised popular customs once shared by
                high and low ranks, but which are now viewed with
                disdain by the enlightened and refined. While sharing
                that disdain, the antiquarians sometimes betray an
                anxiety about the social consequences of change.
                Francis Grose, for example, in his glossary of waning
                oral traditions, worries that mobility, newspapers, and
                the influence of metropolitan culture are spreading
                political contention and scepticism among previously
                docile land-workers (Grose vii-viii, iii). And Joseph
                Strutt, in his pioneering study of popular sports and
                pastimes, notes that the progress of refinement
                produces a general decline of "manly and spirited"
                bodily exercises, a result of the withdrawal of the
                nobility from practices that came to be seen as vulgar,
                and the disappearance of the public spaces once devoted
                to such exercises, which confined them to "common
                drinking-houses" (Strutt xlvi). Antiquarians were often
                viewed critically by historians, but in exposing the
                traces of social division and the "softening" of
                masculine manners, their researches appeared to provide
                empirical confirmation of the more general arguments of
                enlightenment historians like Adam Ferguson, who warned
                of the threat to public virtue inherent in the
                development of modern commercial societies.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Scott&rsquo;s work is clearly influenced by this new
                antiquarian interest in the history of popular culture.
                Within his fictions the emergence of politeness is
                grounded in a history of social division and exclusion.
                At various points his works allude to a process in
                which the nobility, the clergy and the bourgeoisie
                withdrew from what was once a common culture. In his
                poetic romance, <em>The Lady of the Lake</em>, for
                example, the culture of the highland clan, in which
                high and low are united by the art of the minstrel, is
                compared with that of the town of Stirling, where the
                sporting entertainments enjoyed by the burgers of the
                town, are disdained as "mean" by the nobles in the time
                of James V (Canto V). In his novel <em>The Abbott</em>,
                the popular revels once licensed and encouraged by the
                Roman Catholic church have become, in the era of the
                Reformation, an insolent threat that both Catholic and
                Protestant authorities seek to repress (105-6). <em>The
                Fortunes of Nigel</em> shows how the introduction of
                the "Ordinary" eating house in Jacobean London provides
                an exclusive social space for those with "good clothes
                and good assurance," in contrast to unrefined pleasures
                of the tavern. (Chapter 12, 168). In <em>Guy
                Mannering</em>, some "veterans of the law" are seen to
                play High Jinks in a "paltry and half-ruinous" tavern
                in Edinburgh Old Town in the early 1780s; they are
                lingering representatives of a tradition about to be
                displaced by new buildings and new manners (203-205).
                As this novel indicates, the relationship between
                refinement and social division was revealed starkly in
                eighteenth-century Edinburgh, where alongside the
                sprawling Old Town in which higher and lower orders
                traditionally lived in close proximity, the elegant New
                Town was built, an appropriate setting for the elite
                clubs and improvement societies in the vanguard of
                modern Scottish culture. By the beginning of the
                nineteenth century it appeared that, across Britain,
                the "rage for refinement and innovation" was killing
                off the last remnant of traditional popular customs and
                activities such as morris dancing, which antiquarians
                had begun to record for posterity (Douce 482).<a href=
                "#note6">[6]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Scott&rsquo;s interest in this aspect of cultural
                history anticipates that of modern historians. In some
                respects his view of this historical process resembles
                Habermas&rsquo;s account of the "retreat" of secular
                festivities from "public places" into aristocratic
                spaces "sealed off from the outside world," and the
                emergence of a "bourgeois public sphere" centred on new
                spaces such as the coffee house (Habermas 9-10, 27-35).
                It anticipates the so called "bi-polar" model of
                culture associated with Peter Burke, who claims that by
                1800 the higher orders "had abandoned popular culture
                to the lower classes, from whom they were now
                separated, as never before, by profound differences in
                world view" (Burke 270). And Scott&rsquo;s view also
                has something in common with the views of Peter
                Stallybrass and Allon White who, argue that the
                "transformation of the sites of discourse" (in the
                creation of refined spaces such as the coffee house)
                entailed a denial of "the unruly demands of the body
                for pleasure and release," in the interests of the
                "serious, productive and rational discourse"
                appropriate to polite identity. In their account,
                polite <em>rational</em> discourse is, through
                refinement, "delibidinized" (Stallybrass and White 83,
                97).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Scott shows a comparable understanding of the
                "changes in the interrelationship of place, body and
                discourse" (Stallybrass and White 83) required by the
                production of politeness; informed by the work of
                antiquarians, he shows that the withdrawal of the
                higher classes from a common culture involved changes
                in the use of space, and changes in the acceptable
                norms of bodily behaviour. What this history implies,
                is that the moderate consciousness of his
                heroes&mdash;restrained, detached, reasonable&mdash;has
                been made possible by the historical disembedding of
                identity from the social, material and cultural grounds
                that governed individuals in earlier ages.</p>

              <li>
                <p>Scott&rsquo;s view of this process is in many
                respects simpler that that of his twentieth-century
                successors, but in at least one respect, it may be more
                complicated. When Stallybrass and White consider
                responses to the process of refinement in <em>The
                Politics and Poetics of Transgression</em>, they focus
                primarily on culture within England, touching only
                briefly on relations between England and Ireland, and
                ignoring Scotland and Wales. But when the issue of
                refinement is considered in relation to the wider
                context of English hegemony, it becomes more
                complicated, as a number of distinguished scholars have
                recently reminded us.<a href=
                "#note7">[7]</a>
                While refinement produces a movement towards
                standardization, towards a usage defining, or
                identifying, polite British consciousness, the Scots
                inevitably existed in a complex relationship with that
                kind of identification. Janet Sorensen points out that
                the polite language we encounter in Samuel Johnson and
                Jane Austen was not "common" to anyone in Britain
                (<em>Grammar</em> 208). Nevertheless for Scots, as for
                Irish and Welsh, the process of linguistic
                standardization was inseparable from issues of national
                identity, national autonomy, the threat to national
                interests posed by the cultural dominance of
                England.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>We can see how this threat influenced Scott&rsquo;s
                views if we consider the monumental editions of Dryden
                and Swift that he had completed by 1814, the years in
                which he published <em>Waverley</em>. Stallybrass and
                White describe both Dryden and Swift as "great
                champions of a classical discursive body" who work to
                construct a refined English identity (Stallybrass and
                White 105). In Scott&rsquo;s assessment, however, there
                is a fundamental difference between Dryden, whose
                writing is bound by English concerns, and Swift, who
                becomes an Irish writer. Scott&rsquo;s Dryden is a
                professional poet responding to and attempting to
                reform the taste of his age; he seeks to promote a
                heroic drama in which the language, actions and
                character would be "raised above the vulgar" ("Dryden"
                24). But Swift, never a man of letters trying to please
                a select public, emerges as a great Irish patriot, who
                moves decisively beyond the exclusive and divisive
                concerns of Dryden and the fashionable English
                readership. He writes "in every varied form" (including
                ballads and prose satires supplied to hawkers), rising
                above party interests and addressing both high and low
                in order to make a whole people aware of their rights
                and interests in the face of the "narrow-souled, and
                short-sighted mercantile interest" of Britain ("Swift"
                169). Where Dryden separates literature from the
                vulgar, Swift&rsquo;s relative independence from the
                court and metropolis allows his writing to form the
                grounds for social and national unity. Swift&rsquo;s
                greatness lies in his ability to unite a diverse and
                potentially fragmented audience by moving across
                cultural boundaries. As an "Irish" writer he must
                continue to address polite English readers and include
                their concerns among others. He does not abandon the
                polite perspective, but he moves beyond it, allowing
                alternative perspectives to compete with it. He is, in
                a sense that Stallybrass and White would not
                acknowledge, both polite and popular. In this respect
                Scott anticipates the views of Swift offered in our own
                age by Michael McKeon, or by Carol Fabricant, who finds
                Swift&rsquo;s work "fundamentally inimical to the
                ordering, idealizing Augustan mind as we have come to
                understand it in terms of someone like Pope" (Fabricant
                17). For Scott the anarchic inclusiveness of Swift is
                realised most clearly in <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s
                Travels</em>:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  <p>perhaps no work ever exhibited such general
                  attractions to all classes. It offered personal and
                  political satire to the readers in high life, low and
                  coarse incident to the vulgar, marvels to the
                  romantic, wit to the young and lively, lessons of
                  morality and policy to the grave, and maxims of deep
                  and bitter misanthropy to neglected age, and
                  disappointed ambition. ("Swift" 163)</p>
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Swift offered an important precedent for
                Scott&rsquo;s own attempts to move beyond the framework
                of Anglo-British politeness in his writing. In Swift he
                found a prestigious precedent for the dynamic
                combination of historical, philosophical, political,
                sociological and literary discourses with elements
                drawn from commercial and traditional popular culture;
                the blending of realism with fantasy, literary
                game-playing and subversive irony; and for the dramatic
                unsettling of cultural hierarchies. The discontinuous
                and inconsistent qualities of Swift&rsquo;s work that
                Michael McKeon and Bob Chase read as signs of "extreme
                skepticism" are read by Scott as a means of uniting a
                diverse audience, a strategy consistent with
                Swift&rsquo;s patriotism (McKeon 338-356, Chase
                110).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Scott&rsquo;s own mission as a patriotic Scot was to
                enact conciliation, by writing as if for a unified
                national readership. Addressing an audience that was
                torn between the demythologizing heritage of the
                enlightenment on the one hand, and attempts to reassert
                traditional moral and religious principles on the
                other, Scott combines the economic amoralism of
                progressive historical discourse with the romance of
                disinterested personal virtue. He moves between
                affirmation of polite modernity and a romantic
                primitivism that validates those who stand beyond the
                norms of modern polite culture, in a condition
                "unfettered by system and affectation" (<em>Rob
                Roy</em> 410). And in attempting to reconnect the
                polite reader with what has been lost in the process of
                refinement, Scott tries to negotiate with the lost
                experience of the body. In Stallybrass and
                White&rsquo;s account of polite culture, the refined
                bourgeois consciousness that emerges in the eighteenth
                century constructed the non-refined as an "<em>other
                realm</em> inhabited by a grotesque body which it
                repudiated as part of its own identity"&mdash;a body
                characterised partly by the impure mixing of
                categories. In their account, champions of refinement
                attacked as intolerable those who "had not yet
                dissociated &lsquo;classical&rsquo; from popular
                culture" but who "actively lived both" (Stallybrass and
                White 103, 84). In Scott&rsquo;s fiction, in contrast,
                the historical dissociation of cultures is assumed to
                be an accomplished fact, while the process is viewed in
                retrospect. This means on the one hand that educated
                characters who remain in touch with popular tradition
                may call for understanding or qualified admiration. In
                <em>Waverley</em>, for example, Flora McIvor derives
                part of her romantic glamour from being placed on the
                borderline between polite culture and oral Gaelic
                culture, which she patronises. In the realm of local
                tradition, the polite gentleman may justifiably become
                the student rather than the model of culture. On the
                other hand it means that when the non-refined
                "grotesque body" first begins to surface in
                Scott&rsquo;s work, as it does spectacularly in his
                second novel, <em>Guy Mannering</em>, it is it is not
                simply the sign of anxiety about the mixing of polite
                and popular culture, but the sign of a more radical
                anxiety about the influence of polite culture itself.
                The grotesque gypsy Meg Merrilees, for example,
                antithesis of feminine refinement and enlightened
                rationality ("a full six feet high," "a man&rsquo;s
                great coat over the rest of her dress," "dark elf-locks
                [...] like the snakes of a gorgon," wild rolling eyes
                indicating "something like real or affected insanity,"
                14), preserves the remnants of a common heritage of
                Scottish folk superstition, and finds a counterpart in
                the polite hero Guy Mannering, who has a scholarly
                interest in astrological beliefs. The enlightened
                repudiation of vulgar belief is now registered as
                repression of instinct (the narrative includes a long
                quotation from Coleridge&rsquo;s translation of
                <em>Wallenstein</em>, which suggests that while folk
                beliefs "live no longer in the faith of reason," the
                heart still needs "a language," the "old instinct"
                still brings back "the old names," 18-19). The
                grotesqueness of the gypsy may register the polite
                subject&rsquo;s anxiety about what has already been
                repudiated as part of polite identity, but it also
                enables the gypsy to assume a sublime dignity
                appropriate to her role in the restoration of the lost
                heir of Ellangowan. In the same novel the grotesque
                body of the Dominie or school-master acquires a
                complementary significance. Beyond all possibility of
                refinement, it corresponds to his mental condition (he
                cannot, in spite of his parent&rsquo;s ambition, be
                educated into a priest). In the case of this figure the
                anxiety of the grotesque may be related to the
                combination of high culture and low social origin, but
                the novel passes beyond raillery to assign the Dominie
                an apartment in the restored heir&rsquo;s new house, as
                the subject of sympathetic patronage. Having failed to
                achieve independence through educational opportunity,
                he provides an image of lower class dependence that is
                reassuring rather than threatening in an age of rapidly
                spreading literacy.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>These cases illustrate the negotiation Scott
                undertakes with the legacy of refinement, in which the
                polite perspective is reproduced while the repudiation
                it implies is mitigated: the recoil from the vulgar is
                transformed into a movement to re-establish relations
                on manageable terms. Elsewhere in the novels, rather
                than simply rejecting unrefined passions, Scott uses
                the historical perspective to allow a partial&mdash;and
                of course, heavily qualified&mdash;recovery of them.
                The historical romance, that is, offers to remedy (as
                reading experience) the loss it exposes as history.
                Following the example of the gothic romance,
                Scott&rsquo;s fiction typically thrusts the modern
                consciousness of the hero and reader into a world
                beyond the delibidinized space of rational discourse to
                which it is historically adapted. This was an aspect of
                Scott&rsquo;s novels that Hazlitt, among the most
                astute of his contemporary critics and admirers, was
                keen to emphasise. He responded warmly to the
                novels&rsquo; evocation of violent passions that
                contrast with modern humanitarian sentiment:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  <p>they carry us back to the feuds, the
                  heart-burnings, the havoc, the dismay, the wrongs,
                  and the revenge of a barbarous age and
                  people&mdash;to the rooted prejudices and deadly
                  animosities of sects and parties in politics and
                  religion, and of contending chiefs and clans in war
                  and intrigue. [&hellip;] As we read, we throw aside

                  its sway in us, and as the hound starts in his sleep
                  and rushes on the chase in its fancy the heart rouses
                  itself in its native lair, and utters a wild cry of
                  joy, at being restored once more to freedom and
                  lawless unrestrained impulses ("Hating" 129).</p>
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Fiona Robertson notes how critics have traditionally
                "separated Scott from Gothic in terms of their relative
                healthiness" (Robertson 25). But for Hazlitt,
                apparently, the Gothic violence of the novels was by no
                means incompatible with a healthy influence. However,
                it was not simply the possibility of visceral
                excitement in scenes of feuding, combat, mob violence
                or torture that seemed rousing. The aesthetic principle
                that governs Scott&rsquo;s fictions involves a
                deliberate dismantling of the boundaries that usually
                preserve the contemplative poise of the refined
                subject. In his "Autobiography" Scott distinguishes
                between "the picturesque in action and in scenery" to
                define this aspect of his aesthetic: "to me the
                wandering over the field of Bannockburn was the source
                of more exquisite pleasure than gazing upon the
                celebrated landscape from the battlements of Stirling
                castle" (24). Accordingly, in his fiction he abandons
                the depoliticised picturesque convention of the framed
                and static scene that diminishes the particularity of
                human figures. Instead, the "picturesque in action"
                strives to place the observer in the position of the
                participant, moving through a landscape that may be
                peopled with historically particularised figures, up
                close to the action. Hazlitt registered a sense of
                novelty in the dynamism of Scott&rsquo;s descriptions
                ("There is a hurtling in the air, a trampling of feet
                upon the ground," "Spirit" 63), and he repeatedly
                described their effect as restorative to the enervated
                modern reader ("the mountain air is most bracing to our
                languid nerves," "Spirit" 61). In the age of the
                turnpike and the post-chaise, the novels seek to
                recreate the invigorating experience of contending with
                wild landscapes on foot, of pleasurable exposure to the
                elements, and of confronting accidents that transform
                scenery into sources of mortal danger (Mordaunt
                Mertoun, his clothes thoroughly wet, making his way
                through brooks and morasses across the bleak Shetland
                landscape, maintaining a dogged conflict with wind and
                rain in <em>The Pirate</em>, 28-29; Frank Osbaldistone,
                making his way back to Aberfoil by moonlight through a
                sharp frost-wind, his spirits suddenly elevated despite
                the danger and uncertainty of his situation, in <em>Rob
                Roy</em>, 383; the scholarly Jonathan Oldbuck "pressing
                forward with unwonted desperation to the very brink of
                the crag" in the coastal rescue in <em>The
                Antiquary</em>, 61; Arthur Phillipson "clinging to the
                decayed trunk of an old tree, from which, suspended
                between heaven and earth, he saw the fall of the crag
                which he had so nearly accompanied" in <em>Anne of
                Geierstein</em>, chapter 2). The novels also offer
                glimpses of a habitual bodily intimacy unknown to
                polite society (as in the unimproved Liddesdale of
                <em>Guy Mannering</em>, chapters 24-26), and of
                vigorous communal effort or festive enjoyment of a kind
                that contrasts with the routines of the urban workplace
                or the factory (such as the sport-as-work of the
                salmon-hunting of <em>Guy Mannering</em> and
                <em>Redgauntlet</em>, or the collective holiday
                pageantry of <em>Kenilworth</em>).</p>

                <p>Through such experiences and spectacles, the modern,
                detached, moderate rationality of the narrator, and
                often the hero, is linked to a restored sensorial
                excitement, as the novel connects the reader
                vicariously to a passional self momentarily free from
                habitual restraint (although in practice, still
                carefully insulated from any action that would
                seriously offend conventional proprieties). This
                strategy might be related to the development of the
                new, tougher ethic among the British elite during this
                period, fostered in the public schools and
                universities, through a classical curriculum
                celebrating physical heroism, through manly sports and
                fox-hunting, through the arts and the cult of military
                heroes (see Cannon 34-49, Colley 164-193, Mori
                130-133). But this elite education is usually seen as
                cultivating an ethos of patriotic state service and
                imperialism, whereas Scott&rsquo;s primary concern, I
                would argue, is the threat of social division. On the
                one hand, the novels appeared to recommend the
                detachment and moderation fostered by enlightened
                rationality (while detesting Scott&rsquo;s Tory
                politics, Hazlitt thought the novels worked to
                counteract both "ultra-radicalism" and conservative
                extremism, "Spirit" 64-65). On the other hand, they
                seemed to compensate for the repression required by
                that rationality. Moderation <em>and</em> wildness,
                detachment <em>and</em> primitive passion: the
                radically opposed tendencies Hazlitt identifies help to
                account for his sense that Scott had thrown aside the
                "trammels of authorship" ("Spirit" 61).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>While Scott presents Swift&rsquo;s patriotism as a
                matter of counteracting the policies and actions of the
                "narrow-souled, and short-sighted mercantile interest"
                of Britain ("Swift" 169), Scott&rsquo;s own patriotic
                mission can be conceived as a matter of compensating
                for, and counteracting, the divisive social
                consequences of modernisation, not only at the level of
                ideological difference (by enacting moderation) but
                also at the level of feeling. While Wordsworth recoils
                from the "degraded thirst after outrageous stimulation"
                in the modern, increasingly urban public (Wordsworth
                249), Scott works to accommodate it, while harnessing
                it to a paternalist fantasy of harmoniously restored
                dependencies in rural communities. At the same time he
                seeks to moderate the refinement that produces the
                polite recoil from what is seen as vulgar. His moderate
                paternalism required a willingness to reach across
                cultural barriers, to move beyond the norms of polite
                culture, while maintaining the hierarchies denoted by
                those norms and barriers. In contrast to Coleridge,
                whose aesthetic ideal of organic unity has been seen as
                a response to political and cultural disruption (Leask
                135-144), for Scott the imagined unity of the audience
                remained more important than the unity of the work. The
                ironies, inconsistencies and contradictions within his
                work are generated by his attempt to write as if for a
                unified national readership, by offering "attractions
                to all classes" at a time when social and political
                reconciliation seemed increasingly beyond reach.</p>
