              <li>
                <p>Near the close of the <em>Philosophy of Right</em>,
                Hegel declares, &ldquo;Patriotism is frequently
                understood to mean . . . a willingness to perform
                <em>extraordinary</em> sacrifices and actions. But in
                essence, it is that disposition which, in the normal
                conditions and circumstances of life, habitually knows
                that the community is the substantial basis and
                end&rdquo; (288-89). It is safe to say that
                contemporary discussions of patriotism in the United
                States share nothing of Hegel's phlegmatic tone. Since
                September of 2001, loyalty to country has been
                celebrated and condemned in equally vociferous tones.
                On the one hand, it is argued that a refusal to affirm
                one's devotion to the community by being prepared to
                protect it with force amounts to the abandonment of the
                most basic of social duties. On the other hand, it is
                maintained that the desire to fortify
                &ldquo;ourselves&rdquo; against &ldquo;them&rdquo;
                reveals only the pernicious triumph of xenophobia and
                the military industrial complex. In this charged
                landscape, &ldquo;I love my country&rdquo; alternately
                means, &ldquo;I am someone who is willing to fulfill
                the minimal obligations of citizenship,&rdquo; and,
                &ldquo;I am a pathetic pawn of state or corporate
                interests.&rdquo;</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>For a political theorist, the level of vitriol may
                be new, but the terms of the disputes are not. The
                belief that patriotism is essentially a form of
                nationalism and thus an obstacle to a cosmopolitan or
                internationalist ethos has routinely been debated since
                the eighteenth century. The question of whether liberal
                conceptions of personal freedom are inherently at odds
                with communitarian ideals is a similarly traditional
                topos of inquiry. From this perspective, our
                contemporary polemics&mdash;vicious though they may
                be&mdash;are merely one moment in a longstanding
                discussion about the intersecting dialectics of the
                public and private and the general and the
                particular.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>If there is nonetheless something peculiarly
                unsettling about loving the <em>terra patria</em>, it
                may lie in the suggestion that politics is partly
                grounded in affects rather than rights and principles.
                Patriotism reminds us that a subjective, even whimsical
                element plagues an arena in which we hope that due
                process and the rigor of formal systems will hold sway.
                A politics of affect is threatening because it
                highlights forces that do not readily permit of
                quantification, forces that garner their authority from
                the singularity of their expression rather than from
                the degree to which they can be communicated or
                compared with one another. More specifically, it could
                be argued that the unease inspired by patriotism is a
                factor of the specific affect it privileges, namely,
                love. As the Ciceronian model of republicanism made
                explicit, the goal in adoring one&rsquo;s civic order
                is to assume a posture vis-&agrave;-vis the state like
                that of a dutiful child to a parent.<a href=
                "#note1">[1]</a>
                This would appear to indicate that patriotism is just
                one form of celebrating the patriarchy, or more
                bluntly: Loving your country is a semi-covert way of
                indulging your infantile narcissism and its aggressive
                impulses. Cast in this light, one does not have to be
                of the opinion that the United States is governed by a
                plutocracy to want to avoid grounding the relationship
                between individuals and their rulers in a murky notion
                of <em>amor</em>.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Given the anxieties patriotism invokes on the Left
                and the Right alike, one cannot help but notice that
                there is a widespread reluctance to give up on the
                concept&mdash;even, and perhaps especially, if
                preserving it necessitates re-crafting the term so that
                we can speak of a cosmopolitan or global patriot rather
                than a national one. Like its obverse, hate, love can
                be a troubling commodity for policymakers, but it
                proves to be extremely useful when it can be harnessed
                for specific ends. The question, then, is whether
                modern political theory offers us a model with which to
                understand these affective dynamics. In proposing to
                explore these issues by looking at German writers from
                the turn of the nineteenth century, I may appear to be
                making an odd choice. Germany is not typically held up
                as an example of a country that has come to terms with
                the problem of patriotism in a salutary fashion. Even
                if one looks to the Enlightenment as a moment when the
                concept of the European nation-state was being
                forged&mdash;hence, as a point in time at which certain
                progressive possibilities may not yet have been
                foreclosed on&mdash;the study may feel more like the
                investigation of the aetiology of a disease than an
                excavation of laudable principles that have
                hithertofore been neglected.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>These concerns notwithstanding, my argument in this
                essay is that the Continental thinkers who follow
                Immanuel Kant offer some crucial alternatives to the
                familiar liberal positions on citizenship, the
                individual, and the state. To appreciate this dimension
                of their work, we will have to break with some of the
                most well established clich&eacute;s of European
                intellectual history. A dynamic of autonomous
                subjectivity is customarily presumed to have absolute
                priority in the tradition that runs from Fichte through
                Friedrich Schlegel and Novalis (Friedrich von
                Hardenberg) to Schelling and Hegel. In considering the
                individual&rsquo;s relationship to the state, however,
                these authors elaborate ethical and political dynamics
                that are not simply based on a model of a rational,
                active self&mdash;whether it is the self understood as
                the source of absolute authority, as monarchial
                sovereignty might have it, or the self viewed as the
                bearer of interests and responsibilities, as the
                liberal paradigm would maintain. For example, in their
                analysis of the polity Schlegel and Novalis are first
                and foremost concerned not with figures of
                self-positing (self-creation and self-destruction), but
                with the potentially more fundamental notion of
                self-affection. The elementary event whereby the mind
                impacts itself before there is, properly speaking,
                anything to impact is described in the <em>Critique of
                Pure Reason</em>, where Kant writes of a form of
                intuition, &ldquo;the mode in which the mind is
                affected through its own activity . . . and so is
                affected by itself (87).<a href=
                "#note2">[2]</a>
                Kant&rsquo;s reflexive &ldquo;to affect oneself&rdquo;
                (<em>sich affizieren</em>) comes from the Latin
                <em>afficere</em>: &ldquo;to affect,&rdquo; &ldquo;to
                act upon,&rdquo; &ldquo;to excite.&rdquo; Neither
                active nor passive, neither a model of self-positing
                nor self-reflection, self-affection&mdash;the
                mind&rsquo;s capacity to &ldquo;touch&rdquo;
                itself&mdash;is the posture that facilitates all other
                mental activities even as it is indifferent to
                them.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In an overtly paradoxical fashion, the state of mind
                Kant describes exists only insofar as it corresponds
                with itself before it is there; it is a subjective mode
                of being that emerges only to the extent that it
                constantly handles itself as a determined entity that
                it has not already become. Only in virtue of this
                self-misrecognition&mdash;this mistaken touching of the
                self by a self, &ldquo;itself,&rdquo; that is not yet
                there to touch or be touched&mdash;is there a self at
                all. Governed by a movement that is anything but
                self-contained or self-grounding, such a being never
                presents itself to itself as something it can know as
                its own creation, which means that self-relation is no
                longer the distinguishing characteristic of the
                subject. This radically calls into question any effort
                to base political morphology in the reflexive praxis of
                an individual agent&mdash;a point that has enormous
                implications for the Romantic reception of
                Rousseau&rsquo;s theory of the general will, the modern
                understanding of the body politic, and the very notion
                of political <em>representation</em> as such.<a href=
                "#note3">[3]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>What does it mean, then, to be a patriot in an
                intellectual climate in which the figure of the
                self-determining individual is no longer the principal
                avatar of political agency? What implications does the
                concept of self-affection have for a theory of
                citizenship and for our ideas about being a member of a
                community, that is, what are the measures of loyalty or
                responsibility if self-rule is no longer the standard
                of subjective praxis? Perhaps most importantly, how
                does the Kantian dynamic of self-affection come to be
                understood as an explicitly linguistic problem? To
                explore these questions, I want to turn to a play that
                is primarily known for its celebration of the pleasures
                of hating and killing one&rsquo;s enemies. <em>Die
                Hermannsschlacht, <em>The Battle of Hermann</em></em>,
                was written in 1808 by Heinrich von Kleist, who, like
                his contemporaries, spent his career laboring in the
                long shadow of Kant&rsquo;s first <em>Critique</em>.
                Biographically speaking, Kleist stands out among the
                intellectuals of his day for his vigorous patriotism.
                Coming from a long line of Prussian nobility and
                military officers, he served in the wars against the
                French revolutionary army in the 1790s, ultimately
                quitting when he decided that his courageous endeavors
                against the foes of the Fatherland were being cheapened
                by the King&rsquo;s decision to hire mercenaries with
                no real partisan convictions.<a href=
                "#note4">[4]</a>
                During the first decade of the nineteenth century,
                Kleist was no longer a combatant, but in his personal
                correspondence, he constantly bemoaned the evils of
                Napoleon and the French threat to Prussian autonomy,
                and he spent some time as a prisoner of war, probably
                because he had been caught spying on the enemy.

              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Where his literary productions were concerned,
                Kleist maintained that two of his plays were especially
                patriotic in intent and design: <em><em>The Battle of
                Hermann</em></em> and <em>Prince Friedrich von
                Homburg</em>. At first glance, this common thematic
                ground would seem to be the only similarity between
                these works. If <em>Prince Friedrich</em> is dreamy,
                bloodless, and overtly self-parodic, <em><em>The Battle
                of Hermann</em></em> has struck many as a crude, not to
                mention extremely violent, piece of propaganda. For
                most of the twentieth century, its jingoistic dimension
                was thought to overwhelm any moral or aesthetic content
                it might have, an assessment typified by Walter
                M&uuml;ller-Seidel&rsquo;s claim that it is only with
                great reservation that one can even grant the text a
                place (presumably &ldquo;last&rdquo; place) among
                Kleist&rsquo;s other poetic works (53). Indeed,
                <em>Hermann</em> has been dismissed as ill-conceived or
                immature with such regularity that one could be
                forgiven for supposing that Kleist had written it as a
                schoolboy, whereas in fact it was composed around the
                same time as <em>Penthesilea</em>, usually regarded as
                his dramatic masterpiece.<a href=
                "#note6">[6]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><em><em>The Battle of Hermann</em></em> is based on
                Tacitus&rsquo;s account of the victory of the Germanic
                tribes and their leader Hermann over the Roman general
                Quintilius Varus in 9 A. D., an event that at least
                temporarily halted the Roman conquest of Northern
                Europe. In the course of five acts, we are presented
                with a variety of negotiations, intrigues, and
                battlefield clashes between the invaders and the
                various German rulers, some of whom have allied
                themselves with the Romans, some against them, and some
                somewhere in-between. In the culmination of the
                military action, the forces of Hermann and his fellow
                chieftain Marbod ambush the enemy and defeat them. The
                Roman General is killed by a one-time German ally, and
                Hermann is hailed as the savior of Germania.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In the course of the drama, the patriotic fervor of
                the German people is fanned through a host of devious
                and sometimes grizzly tactics. At one point, Hermann
                has some soldiers dress as Romans and plunder their own
                land in order to enrage the inhabitants against the
                invaders; in another scene, the corpse of a German maid
                who has been raped by Romans and then murdered by her
                father is chopped into enough pieces so that a part of
                the body can be sent to each of the German tribes. Both
                of these acts exemplify the broader structure of a play
                in which efforts to confirm the boundaries between us
                and them, between friend and foe, inevitably introduce
                duplicitous signifying logics that no one controls.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Following Kleist&rsquo;s own suggestions,
                <em><em>The Battle of Hermann</em></em> is typically
                treated as a thinly-veiled allegory of the Europe of
                1809: the Romans stand in for the French aggressors,
                while Hermann and his allies represent the Prussians,
                or possibly the Austrians, who at the time were
                preparing for an invasion of France.<a href=
                "#note7">[7]</a>
                In these terms, Kleist was hardly innovative. A number
                of eighteenth-century German literary works present the
                quasi-historical figure of Hermann as a rallying point
                for contemporary partisan passions. At the same time,
                one should not underestimate the uniquely programmatic
                pretensions of Kleist&rsquo;s play. Wolf Kittler has
                heralded it as a primer on guerrilla warfare, a kind of
                counterpart before the fact to Carl von
                Clausewitz&rsquo;s famous treatise on conventional
                combat (&ldquo;Concept&rdquo; 508-510). Indeed, Kittler
                has even gone so far as to argue that the drama
                expresses Kleist&rsquo;s heart-felt desire to incite
                insurrection among the German people (<em>Geburt</em>
                342).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The ideological stakes of such an ambition are
                anything but self-evident. Accordingly, as is typical
                for almost all of Kleist&rsquo;s works, suggestions
                abound as to the real target of the attacks the play
                invites or effects. Among other things,
                <em>Hermann</em> has been described as a critique of
                Christian morality, of the incompatibility of
                aristocratic and bourgeois social theory, and, perhaps
                most conventionally, of Enlightenment subjectivity. It
                is the central role of violence in the text, however,
                that has inspired the greatest interpretive anxieties.
                In a positive vein, Se&aacute;n Allan has written that
                &ldquo;<em>Die Hermannsschlacht</em> explores the
                nature of the acts of violent retribution committed in
                the struggle to overthrow the oppressive regime of a
                colonial power&rdquo; (235). Against this affirmation
                of the value of armed resistance, Georg Luk&aacute;cs
                famously accused Kleist of emotional anarchy,
                identifying his &oelig;uvre as a forerunner to the
                aesthetics of National Socialism because Kleist&rsquo;s
                anti-humanism&mdash;unlike that of, for instance, Karl
                Marx&mdash;never goes beyond the level of mere revolt
                (7: 217ff.) Taking these same concerns in the opposite
                direction, it can be argued that <em>The Battle of
                Hermann</em> is as much a warning about the politics of
                &ldquo;strong&rdquo; leadership as it is a celebration
                of an indigenous people&rsquo;s self-assertion in the
                face of imperialist aggression. With Kleist&rsquo;s
                much-vaunted antipathy for Napoleon as a background,
                the story of Hermann can thus be read as a prime
                example of why a polity based in the cult status of an
                individual is fated to endure chaos and disaster. After
                all, at the close of the play, having just been
                denounced as a tyrant by a countryman he has casually
                sent for execution, the German leader uses his final
                speech to paint a graphic picture of a bellicose
                future, suggesting that if a <em>Pax Germanica</em> is
                to replace the <em>Pax Romana</em>, it will be no more
                faithful to the title of peace than its
                predecessor.</p>

                <p>Yet what are the real stakes of this nationalist
                war, a war that at the end of <em>The Battle of
                Hermann</em>, as at the end of <em>Prince Friedrich von
                Homburg</em>, seems more perpetual than winnable? From
                its opening scenes, <em>The Battle of Hermann</em>
                depicts a struggle over the possibility, or
                impossibility, of a figure such as Hermann functioning
                as a truly historical agent. Unsurprisingly, this
                battle over Hermann is largely fought by Hermann
                himself, but it is not waged in the terms one might
                expect. In an early discussion with the other German
                rulers who are trying to recruit him to the resistance,
                Hermann gives voice to a number of curious positions.
                With great eloquence, he insists that he strives not to
                win but to be defeated by the Roman Emperor, that he
                aims to lose everything, and that he must stand alone,
                bound with no one but God, staking everything to
                forfeit it all in death as Germany goes up in flames.
                Needless to say, Hermann&rsquo;s compatriots are
                confused, but they are soon somehow reassured of his
                support. By the close of their conversation, Hermann is
                talking about his progeny marching on Rome, and his
                fellow chieftains have switched from calling him
                incomprehensible to deciding that he stands with them
                in their struggle against the Romans. Most
                interpretations of this scene and its relationship to
                the ensuing story treat Hermann&rsquo;s various quirky
                declarations as part of a program of persuasion and
                reverse-psychological brinkmanship with which he
                intends to put himself, his associates, and the German
                populace in the best position to achieve liberation.
                Once this figure of Hermann the Machiavellian Magician
                is introduced, it can be used to explain his or any
                other character&rsquo;s behavior&mdash;however odd or
                out of place. Deferring to Hermann&rsquo;s omnipotence
                considerably simplifies the task of working through the
                plot of the later acts, since at any given moment it is
                hard to decide whether a particular combatant is being
                operationally shrewd or if he or she is simply getting
                lucky. A clever ruse may be a serendipitous blunder or
                vice versa, and it is not obvious that any of the
                characters are terribly concerned with telling the
                difference.<a href=

              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Our approach to the text changes somewhat once we
                realize that the fact that Hermann does go on to lead
                his people to victory does not in any respect
                contradict his opening statement that he aims only to
                lose. To the contrary, it is precisely because this
                strange stance is Hermann&rsquo;s position throughout
                that he is able to do something worthy of the name
                &ldquo;patriotic.&rdquo; Following Hermann&rsquo;s own
                hints when he mocks his fellow German leaders because
                their conception of freedom amounts to protecting their
                property from alien marauders rather than exercising
                autonomy, it is tempting to argue that Hermann strives
                to embody a Kantian ideal of freedom&mdash;a pure
                spontaneity of agency that corresponds with nothing,
                not even itself. When Hermann avers that in this
                struggle he must stand alone, allied with no one, he is
                merely spelling out the basic requirements of genuine
                independence. A truly free, and thus admirable,
                demonstration of one&rsquo;s commitment to one&rsquo;s
                people or nation must take the form of an act that
                eludes any calculus, standard, or guide that would
                pre-exist it as its cause or condition of possibility.
                Such an act must therefore appear as a kind of misstep,
                a mis-act; indeed, it can scarcely be recognizable as
                an act at all, or it is at risk of being treated as the
                effect of something other than itself. What this play
                calls &ldquo;history,&rdquo; then, is an activity that
                explodes any continuum between a present, a past that
                would make the present possible, and a future that the
                present proleptically (and later retrospectively)
                grounds. Hermann strives to be defeated because he
                strives to realize a praxis that is not an inevitable
                consequence of what is, has been, or might conceivably
                be the case. He strives to do something that will tear
                itself free of any smooth modulation from potentiality
                to actuality. As a result, Hermann&rsquo;s actions must
                be as impossible as they are possible, as liable to be
                worthless as vital, as likely to be missed
                opportunities as well-chosen maneuvers. If this bizarre
                historical agency cannot be realized, then there can be
                no difference between what happens and what could
                happen, and all events will be equally inevitable or
                random. In other words, without Hermann&rsquo;s embrace
                of pure loss, there is no possibility of a divide
                between what might take place and what does take place,
                no one can take credit for having said or done anything
                truly on their own, and there is certainly no way to
                envision something that could genuinely be called an
                act of resistance.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Ironically, then, a play that ostensibly offers an
                ancient insurrection as a model for modern insurrection
                begins by rejecting the authority of repetition as the
                quintessential historical force. Whatever Hermann
                represents&mdash;the will of the people, the future of
                his tribe, the last hope for Germany&mdash;he can play
                his role only insofar as he stands outside of any
                continuum of possibility and actuality that would
                seamlessly shape the future on the basis of the
                resources of the past. In fact, something very similar
                happens in <em>Prince Friedrich von Homburg</em>, the
                text Kleist designated as his other patriotic drama.
                There, the eponymous Prince Friedrich cannot be
                heralded as a true soldier until he has become so
                fearful and abject that he is said to have fallen out
                of an historical logic in which his actions could
                constitute the fame of a hero, articulating the present
                with the future. Only at the point at which it is
                impossible to view the Prince as an agent of the
                Fatherland&mdash;the point at which his behavior is
                literally an impossibility&mdash;can he become a real
                patriot. In Kleist, we might say, one fights not in
                order that Germany may rise again, but rather to show
                that Germany may rise again only insofar as we prove
                that there is no way for Germany to rise again.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The movement of such a patriotic agency is not the
                self-positing or self-negating of an absolute subject,
                but the self-affecting discourse of a language that no
                individual hero can call his own. Strife in <em>The
                Battle of Hermann</em> does not fundamentally take the
                form of a clash between peoples, cultures, or ideals.
                It is manifested rather in the exercise of a familiar
                yet unique utterance, an interjection that emerges at
                the limits of grammar and reference: the word
                <em>heil</em>, as in &ldquo;<em>Heil</em>
                Caesar,&rdquo; or perhaps in this case,
                &ldquo;<em>Heil</em> the conqueror of Caesar.&rdquo; At
                the end of the play, the Romans defeated, Hermann
                speaks to his ally: &ldquo;<em>Heil</em> Marbod, my
                magnanimous friend! / And if Germania hears my voice: /
                <em>Heil</em> its overlord and king&rdquo; (l.
                2569-2571).<a href=
                "#note9">[9]</a>
                For better or worse, Marbod responds in kind:
                &ldquo;<em>Heil</em>, I call you Hermann, the savior of
                Germania. / And when [Germania] hears my voice: /
                <em>Heil</em> its overlord and king&rdquo;
                (l.2578-2580). To some degree, the expostulation
                <em>heil</em> is obviously a hailing; but it is hardly
                an unequivocal one. More than a mere address to or
                announcement of the appearance of an individual, it is
                a performative utterance: &ldquo;You are our ruler, our
                leader, our savior, because you are the one to whom we
                say &lsquo;<em>heil</em>.&rsquo;&rdquo; <em>Heil</em>
                is also a kind of command. It orders you to be greeted,
                and to be greeted as the one worthy of, or in need of,
                greeting: &ldquo;Be <em>the</em> Hermann, be he who is
                the King of Germania, a country that should be there to
                hear us say that you are to be its ruler.&rdquo; In
                this sense, <em>heil</em> is a demand to be heard, a
                demand to be recognized as a voice that can speak a
                political language, a language that can call leaders
                and lands into existence.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Somewhere among these many orders and entreaties, we
                can begin to detect an element of uncertainty, as if
                the various stipulations of <em>heil</em> are not or
                cannot always be met to perfection. The grammar of the
                interjection <em>heil</em> hovers between the
                indicative and the subjunctive: <em>Heil dem
                K&ouml;nig</em> says, &ldquo;Long Live the King!&rdquo;
                or &ldquo;God Save the King!&rdquo; It does not say:
                &ldquo;The King <em>will</em> live a long life,&rdquo;
                or &ldquo;God <em>will</em> save the King.&rdquo;
                Moreover, <em>Heil dem K&ouml;nig</em> is not primarily
                directed to the object it ostensibly names as the
                target of its &ldquo;greeting.&rdquo; On the contrary,
                with &ldquo;Long Live (or God Save) the King!&rdquo;
                God or fate is being asked to preserve the monarch as
                he or she makes an entrance, while the
                sovereign&rsquo;s role in the situation remains
                decidedly uncertain. In other words, &ldquo;Heil
                Hermann&rdquo; may be uttered &ldquo;to&rdquo; or
                &ldquo;in the presence of&rdquo; someone named Hermann,
                but it can never be entirely to, for, or about him.
                Whatever proper noun or title we insert after
                <em>heil</em>, the word inexorably reasserts its
                relative independence vis-&agrave;-vis the declarations
                that enlist its services. In this sense, the utterance
                <em>heil</em> is as much an attempt at a salutation,
                acclamation, or blessing of itself as of anything else.
                <em>Heil</em> <em>heil</em>, we might say,
                <em>heil</em> the power of <em>heil</em> to signify,
                posit, or demand. Underscoring the repetition that
                <em>heil</em> seems to require, the Grimm Brothers note
                that in the eighteenth century the word appears in a
                number of overtly redundant expressions, including
                <em>Heil und Segen</em> (&ldquo;Bless you, bless
                you&rdquo;) and <em>Heil und Gl&uuml;ck</em>
                (&ldquo;Good luck, good luck&rdquo;). The curious
                relation of <em>heil</em> to its own iterability is
                very much in evidence at the end of Kleist&rsquo;s
                other patriotic play, when the impossibly abject Prince
                Friedrich is welcomed back into Prussian respectability
                in a bizarre ceremony that culminates with the
                Colonel&rsquo;s declaration: &ldquo;<em>Heil</em>,
                <em>Heil</em> the Prince of Homburg&rdquo; (l.
                1854).<a href=
                "#note10">[10]</a>
                The accolade is ordinary, and certainly respectful, but
                it remains incomplete until the accompanying officers
                add: &ldquo;<em>Heil</em>, <em>heil</em>,
                <em>heil</em>!&rdquo; (1855). Order is restored and
                everyone goes off to fight (in this case, the Swedes
                rather than the Romans), but all of this can happen
                only because it has supposedly been shown that it is
                possible to say <em>heil</em> to <em>heil</em>.
                Patriotism takes place, then, not when the characters
                salute the King or the Fatherland, but when they salute
                the language of salute, or rather, when they yield to
                language&rsquo;s own salute to itself. What
                <em>heil</em> first and foremost attempts to acclaim is
                the power of language to acclaim. <em>Heil</em> is the
                affirmation language seeks to offer language; it is
                language&rsquo;s greeting to itself as that which
                should be able to greet, confirm, or at least give
                voice to the hope that something will be the
                case&mdash;for instance, that Hermann, or Marbod, will
                be the King of Germania.<a href=

              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The problem is that the very need to say
                <em>heil</em> seems to contravene its stated intent.
                Like the English <em>hail</em> (as in &ldquo;Hail to
                the Chief&rdquo;), the German interjection comes from
                the Old Norse word for <em>whole</em>
                (&ldquo;complete&rdquo;), a meaning that is obvious in
                modern German in which the adjective <em>heil</em>
                means &ldquo;undamaged&rdquo; and the verb
                <em>heilen</em> is &ldquo;to heal.&rdquo;<a href=
                "#note12">[12]</a>
                Yet precisely because it is neither simply prescriptive
                nor descriptive, neither purely constative nor
                performative, <em>heil</em> risks rendering the
                &ldquo;whole&rdquo; incomplete by revealing that, as
                with the exchange between Hermann and Marbod, the ruler
                is not the ruler unless he is hailed, confirmed or
                better, <em>called out</em>&mdash;challenged to show
                that he can dare to rule with reference and deference
                to the authority of <em>heil</em>. For aspiring
                politicians, the lesson could not be clearer: The only
                safe answer to <em>heil</em> is <em>heil</em>. No other
                utterance can &ldquo;perform&rdquo; the operation
                expressed with <em>heil</em>; no other utterance can
                refer to what <em>heil</em> does; and most importantly,
                no other utterance can pretend to get along without
                it.</p>

                <p>To return to the Kantian terms with which we began,
                <em>heil</em> is linguistic self-affection. It heralds
                not a discourse of positing and reflection, but a
                movement of obedience to a language whose very
                condition of possibility does not yet exist. All
                language is affected by <em>heil</em>, which is also to
                say that all language must seek to assert its radical
                independence from <em>heil</em>, i.e., all language
                must aim to fulfill the impossible task of being
                &ldquo;whole&rdquo; without it. For Kleist, the name
                for the effort to effect a discourse that could be
                based on something other than a dynamic of
                self-affection is &ldquo;patriotism.&rdquo; In this
                way, <em>The Battle of Hermann</em> shows us that real
                devotion to the community rests not on our capacity to
                serve our government or to acknowledge the primacy of
                the public over the private, but on our ability to
                intervene in the acts by which language seeks to
                correspond with a form, structure, or law that is,
                strictly speaking, inconceivable. It is from this
                perspective that we can begin to reread the liberal
                tradition and its understanding of citizenship,
                focusing less on clashes between individual and state
                interests and more on the forms of linguistic violence
                that give shape to subjective praxis.</p>

    <p class="indent">1.<a name="note1" id="note1"></a> On
            Roman notions of the <em>patria</em>, see Kantorowicz
            (243-247).</p>
    
            <p class="indent">2<a name="note2" id="note2"></a>. Kant
            writes about "[d]ie Form der Anschauung, welche, da sie
            nichts vorstellt, au&szlig;er so fern etwas im Gem&uuml;te
            gesetzt wird, nichts anders sein kann, als die Art, wie das
            Gem&uuml;te durch eigene T&auml;tigkeit, n&auml;mlich
            dieses Setzen ihrer Vorstellung, mithin durch sich selbst
            affiziert wird" (<em>Kritik</em> 92).</p>
    
            <p class="indent">3<a name="note3" id="note3"></a>. In
            Schlegel, the consequences of this transformation are
            perhaps most evident in the notion of political
            representation as a melancholic fiction of surrogacy that
            he develops in his "Essay on the Concept of Republicanism."
            The extent to which Kantian self-affection invites an
            explicit consideration of political affect is even clearer
            in Novalis's "Faith and Love," where <em>Liebe</em> names
            the condition of possibility and impossibility of a
            relationship between a monarch and his or her subjects.</p>
    
            <p class="indent">4<a name="note4" id="note4"></a>. See in
            particular Kleist's note to his friend Adolfine von Werdeck
            in November of 1801 (2: 700).</p>
    
            <p class="indent">5<a name="note5" id="note5"></a>. In one
            typical letter, Kleist marvels that nobody has put a bullet
            in the head of the "evil world spirit," Napoleon (1: 761).
            Unsurprisingly, discussions of Kleist's personal history
            and his remarks in his private correspondence have led to a
            wide range of contradictory conclusions about his positions
            on militarism, nationalism, and patriotism. These issues
            become more complicated if we ask whether his literary
            texts and his life are in some sense "consistent" on these
            points. For one of the most far-reaching considerations of
            these issues, see Wolf Kittler, <em>Die Geburt des
            Partisanen aus dem Geist der Poesie.</em></p>
    
            <p class="indent">6<a name="note6" id="note6"></a>. In his
            <em>In Pursuit of Power: Heinrich von Kleist's
            Machiavellian Protagonists,</em> William C. Reeve offers a
            detailed overview of the critical reception of the play.
            Working against the tendency among commentators to
            highlight the differences between <em>Hermann</em> and the
            later <em>Prince Friedrich</em>, Reeve has also argued that
            the former text is a crucial forerunner to the latter. (see
            "<em>Die Hermannsschlacht:</em> A Prelude to <em>Prinze
            Friedrich von Homburg.</em>")</p>
    
            <p class="indent">7<a name="note7" id="note7"></a>. "We are
            the people subjugated by the Romans. The plundering of
            Europe in order to enrich France is anticipated," wrote
            Kleist to his sister Ulrike on October 24, 1806, ten days
            after the Prussian army was crushed in the battle of Jena
            and Auerst&auml;dt (2:771).</p>
    
            <p class="indent">8<a name="note8" id="note8"></a>. For an
            excellent analysis of the rhetorical structure of the play
            and the difficulties that arise in trying to take any given
            character "at his or her word," see Jan Plug, "The Borders
            of a Lip: Kleist, language, and politics."</p>
    
            <p class="indent">9<a name="note9" id="note9"></a>.

            <p class="indent">11<a name="note11" id="note11"></a>. More
            than half a century after the fall of Nazi Germany, it is
            still impossible to discuss the German word <em>heil</em>
            without immediately conjuring up thoughts of the infamous
            <em>Hitergru&szlig;</em>. It could be argued that the
            structure of this salute, whereby "Heil Hitler" is
            supplemented with a movement of the arm and hand, aims to
            mime the iterability internal to any utterance of
            <em>heil</em>. This may be an effort to stabilize the
            dynamics we have been describing, an attempt to reconfirm
            the authority of the verbal utterance by complimenting it
            with a physical manifestation of "tribute." From the
            perspective of Walter Benjamin's reading of Bertolt
            Brecht's Epic Theater as a Theater of <em>Gestus</em>, one
            could take this notorious Nazi greeting as an opportunity
            to explore the political significance of the body as an
            explicitly linguistic problematic. On the asesthetics and
            poetics of gesture, see N&auml;gele, esp. 151-158.</p>
    
            <p class="indent">12<a name="note12" id="note12"></a>. In
            German, <em>heilen</em> means to heal or to cure, not "to
            hail," as in English. ("To hail" is <em>zujubeln, bejubeln,
            or zurufen.</em>) The German adjective <em>heil</em> means
            "unhurt," "uninjured," "undamaged"; <em>wieder heil
            werden</em> is "to get better"; <em>heil nach Hause</em> is
            "to get home safe and sound"; and <em>heil machen</em> is
            "to make better" (<em>reparieren</em>). The noun
            <em>Heil</em> means "well-being," "good," or
            "salvation."</p>
