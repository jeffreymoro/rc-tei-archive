        <p style="text-align: left">OVERSEER. Now, my black beauties, quiet your ebony pipes, and listen to the words of your Grand Overseer. Be it known to all that this is the birth-day of the Lady Rosa, the fair daughter of our own benevolent master, Mr. Ormond.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left">QUASHEE. Captain Orford! Oh! he good kind man, too; me never forget when he here before, long, long, long time eber since ago: he save poor black much floggee, floggee; me wish him happy long time, marry good old wife, and many good pickaninies.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left">OVERSEER. And in requital of such good wishes, our good master gives you a holyday. (NEGROES <i>shout.</i>) Adieu to labour! Let the sugar canes take care of themselves, and hey for mirth and merriment! (NEGROES <i>shout.</i>) And a fig for Obi, and Three-Fingered Jack!</p>

        <p style="text-align: left">SAM. Oh, massa, take care, he hear us and make Obi woman kill us.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left">OVERSEER. Nonsense, nonsense! ye black ninny hammers. Do you think an old woman, as great a noodle as yourselves, can stop your wind-pipes by cramming parrots feathers, dogs' teeth, broken bottles, rum, and egg-shells into a cow's horn, and then mumbling a few words over it, as incomprehensible as your own fears?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left">QUASHEE. Oh, massa, you say what you please, but Obi woman know ebery ting from top of head to bottom of toe; and if once she put Obi o poor negro man, he no eat, he no drink, he no nothing, but pine, pine, pine, pine, pine and die away.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left">OVERSEER. Why, ladies and gentlemen, to judge from your aversion to work, Obi seems rather a fashionable disorder, but as to not eating, drinking, or sleeping, I really discover no symptoms of the complaint, so set your minds at rest, and enjoy the sports.

        <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: left">ORMOND. No, I allude to scenes long past; to scenes of joy and happiness for ever blasted by the ruffian you have named. Alas! this very day, the birth-day of my Rosa, was the one on which I saw her mother fall beneath the hands of that accursed wretch.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: left">OVERSEER. Good Heavens! was your wife the victim of his cruelty?</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: left">ORMOND. Long had he been on the estate, and long had every art been tried to soothe his savage nature, for Heaven knows I pitied the unfortunates, and strove by kindness and humanity to mitigate their cruel lot. With Karfa, (for so was he then named,) alone, my efforts failed; each day but added to his ferocity; crime followed crime, until the villain dared to attempt the honour of my wife. The signal punishment which awaited him drove him to madness, and under shade of night he burst his bonds, broke into my chamber, and before my sight murdered my unhappy wife. Vainly I endeavoured to grapple with the monster&#8212;his giant strength dashed me to the earth, and in the confusion the wretch escaped.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: left">OVERSEER. And has no attempt been made to secure the murderer?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left"><b>ORMOND. Often.

        <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: left">JACK. Impatience&#8212;impatience, hag! The gods of my fathers frown my delay. Years have elapsed since I sacrificed the wife of the white man, a victim to the memory of my beloved Olinda, whom they tore lifeless from these arms as they dragged me from my native land; can I forget? can I forgive? Never. And long ere this should vengeance have been satisfied, had not a mistaken faith in thy mummery restrained my arm.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: left">JACK. Power? thy power is in the fear of thy votaries&#8212;and fear I know not. As Africa receded from my gaze I swore that the first white man who purchased Karfa's services should also feel his hate. Ormond was that man. The wife of his bosom was my first victim, and long ere this should his bones have been mouldering in the grave, but that you promised a sweeter, though a slower vengeance.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: left">OBI WOMAN. And I will perform my promise; Ormond shall die. He but hovers round me for a time, as the fluttering bird struggles to avoid the fascinations of the serpent. But here have I his image made in wax, and as it is molten by a blue fire kindled with dead men's eyes, so shall he waste, waste, waste. (<i>throws in coloured fire.</i>)</p>

'Tis the anniversary of his daughter's birth&#8212;'tis the anniversary of that, when blasting their revelry, I struck my first strong blow against his peace. Now, 'tis the day on which he purposes to give his daughter's hand in marriage to her lover; and 'tis the day when, bursting like a whirlwind on him, I will sacrifice his every remaining joy to the memory of my broken-hearted wife, my helpless infants, and the wrongs of my poor country.
