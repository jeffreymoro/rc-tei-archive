    <h3>About the Romantic Circles Praxis Series<a name="series"> </a></h3>
    <p align="left">The <i>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</i> is devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, <i>RCPS</i> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions of today. <i>RCPS</i> is committed to mapping out this terrain with the best and most exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist scholarship. <i>The Romantic Circles Praxis Series</i> was formerly known as <i>Romantic Praxis: Theory and Criticism</i>. The name was changed in November 1999.</p>
