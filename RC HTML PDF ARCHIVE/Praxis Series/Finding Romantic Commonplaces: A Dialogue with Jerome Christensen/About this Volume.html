    <p align="left">This volume of the Romantic Circles Praxis Series (RCPS) is a dialogue designed as a multi-linked site and organized around a constellation of <i>topoi,</i> each with its own icon. It is part of the "Cameo Series" within RCPS, which features interviews with prominent Romanticists. Previous "Cameo" volumes include an <a href="/praxis/mitchell/index.html">interview with W. J. T. Mitchell</a> by Orrin N. C. Wang. Please see the editor's <a href="/praxis/christensen/prefatory.html">prefatory note</a> for more information about the interview format.</p>

    <h3>About the Romantic Circles Praxis Series<a name="series"> </a></h3>
    <p align="left">The Romantic Circles Praxis Series is devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, RCPS recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions of today. RCPS is committed to mapping out this terrain with the best and mo st exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist scholarship. The Romantic Circles Praxis Series was formerly known as Romantic Praxis: Theory and Criticism. The name was changed in November 1999.</p>
