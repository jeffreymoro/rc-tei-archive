    <p>Well, that was the title, ably coined by Stuart Curran for the Keats-Shelley Association of America, that we sent to the MLA, in glad cooperation with President Marjorie Perloff's invitation for a Convention mega-colloquium on "The Sound of Poetry."&nbsp;The editors of the Convention Program sighed, and shortened it to "<i>Romanticism: Poetry and Poetics of Sound</i>," at once killing off the resonant Sidney sound-bite,<a href="#1">[1]</a> and foreshortening our sprightly leap from instance to theory, and our lovely apt anagrams.&nbsp;Not poetic, that Convention bureau.&nbsp;But what they lacked in wit in the program-prose they made up for in the resourcefulness of material doing: they did manage to schedule this session on verse in a perversely narrow wind-tunnel of a room in Philadelphia, 2006, where, too poignantly, hearing was hard, we were told.</p>

    <p>So we, and our frustrated auditors, are especially grateful for Orrin Wang's invitation to revise our essays for a new hearing in <i>Romantic Praxis,</i> promoted not only from narrow wind-tunnel to worldwide web, but also released from the torture to twenty minutes on the MLA's new LimiTimer: a branded coinage, catchily two-sided, with a single shared T facing in opposite directions at once, that reads like a lampoon of those blended phonetic effects in Romantic verse that each of the speakers tries in various ways to keep in earshot&mdash;not to mention a parody of romantic end-rhyme itself, with its metrically clocked bounds of sound.</p>

    <p>Our participants, now unbound, are, in addition to me, Adam Potkay, James Chandler, and Garrett Stewart, and in our auditorium, all those whom we quote. I wonder about the sound of <em>sound</em> in Romantic poetry. Adam has his ear to the sound of Wordsworth's stanzas; Jim relays Wordsworth's <i>Power of Sound</i> into the Sound of Power and what "sound overpowers" in the Intimations Ode and Shelleyan coordinates; and the Master-Ear of the Phonotext, Garrett Stewart, catches the Romantic phone-omenon in Romantic poetry, its reverberations in Victorian imagination, and its resonance in cognition theory today.</p>

    <p class="indent"><sup><a name="1"></a>1</sup> Stuart Curran supplied this, from Sidney's <i>Apology for Poetry</i>: "And even Historiographers, although their lippes sound of things done, and veritie be written in their foreheads, have bene glad to borrow both fashion and perchance weight of the Poets."</p>
