    <h3><a name="hypertext"> </a>About this Volume</h3>

    <p align="left">This collection offers five outstanding Romanticists focusing on the nightmarish sleep into which Victor Frankenstein falls after seeing his creature take its first breaths in Mary Shelley's original novel of 1818. That dream, the dark side of Frankenstein's glorious daydreams about the future of humanity after his experiment, has been explored by several critics already, mostly on psychoanalytic and feminist grounds. Despite these rich interpretations, though, several dimensions&#8212;and some later adaptations&#8212;of that dream remain unexplained. These essays address those unresolved issues by dealing with several rarely explored aspects or echoes of Frankenstein's dream: its "abjection" of unresolved and interwoven ideological conflicts; the cultural links it reveals between sentimentality and sadism; the inescapable connection between "creation" and parody; the relationship between patriarchal societies and the fecal ejection of its actual foundations; and the ways in which <i>Frankenstein</i> on film echoes the movements and dissolves between images that overwhelm Victor at his most pre-conscious moment in the novel. Each of these new explorations also relates these parts of the dream to much wider contexts, not only in the novel itself, but in the history of modern Western culture.</p>

    <h3><a name="series"> </a>About the Romantic Circles Praxis Series</h3>
    <p align="left">The <b>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</b> is devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, <b>RCPS</b> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions of today. <b>RCPS</b> is committed to mapping out this terrain with the best and mo st exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist scholarship. The <b>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</b> was formerly known as <b>Romantic Praxis: Theory and Criticism</b>. The name was changed in November 1999.</p>
