                <p>Much has been made over the last two decades of the
                power relationships that inhere in the opposition
                between selfhood and otherness, particularly within the
                context of British colonial expansion. Often
                overlooked, however, is the complex rhetoric of
                <em>sameness</em> that attended British imperialism in
                India, and more importantly, in Spanish America, during
                the early decades of the nineteenth century. The
                rhetoric of otherness was useful in justifying
                colonialism by the emphasis it placed on the necessity
                of improving allegedly benighted and savage peoples.
                The rhetoric of sameness, on the other hand, functioned
                to allay the anxieties of an era beset by the horrors
                of colonial mismanagement by stressing the naturalness
                and moral uprightness of imperialism. The most famous
                instance of such colonial mismanagement was that of
                Warren Hastings, Governor General of India, whom Edmund
                Burke condemned in no uncertain terms:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  He is never <em>corrupt</em> without he is
                  <em>cruel</em>. He never <em>dines without creating a
                  famine</em>. He feeds on the <em>indigent</em>, the
                  <em>decaying</em>, the <em>ruined</em>. . . not like
                  the generous eagle, who feeds upon a <em>living,
                  reluctant, equal prey</em>: No, he is like the
                  <em>ravenous vulture</em>, who feeds upon the
                  <em>dead</em>. . . Mr. Hastings feasts in the dark
                  alone; <em>like a wild beast he groans in a corner
                  over the dead and dying</em>.(<em>Trial of Warren
                  Hastings</em> 64)<a href=

              <li>
                <p>In the most widely attended public trial of the
                period, Burke brought to light a staggering exegesis of
                Britain's colonial guilt. With deliberate awareness,
                Burke attempted to do for late eighteenth-century
                Britain what Bartolom&eacute; de Las Casas had done for
                Spain over two hundred years earlier: to exonerate his
                nation by exposing its violence and greed before the
                very leaders responsible for its colonial policy.
                Pleading his case before the court of Ferdinand and
                Isabella, Las Casas declaimed:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Those who have gone over there . . . have had two
                  principal methods for extirpating and razing from the
                  face of the earth those miserable nations. The first
                  was by way of unjust, cruel, bloody and tyrannical
                  wars. The other . . . oppressing them with the
                  hardest, harshest, and most horrible servitude under
                  which men or beasts have ever been placed . . . The
                  reason why so many have been destroyed and killed . .
                  . is simply their ultimate end of obtaining gold and
                  to glut themselves with riches in the fewest possible
                  days, and to rise to very high states out of all
                  proportion to their persons.(Las Casas 78-9)<a href=

              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In the impeachment proceedings against Hastings,
                Burke drew upon Las Casas's vocabulary in order to
                stress the dangerous parity he perceived between
                British India and Spanish America:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Were we to be driven out of India this day, nothing
                  would remain, to tell that it had been possessed,
                  during the inglorious period of our dominion, by
                  anything better than the ouran-outang or the tiger .
                  . . My lords, the business of this day . . . is . . .
                  whether millions of mankind shall be made miserable,
                  or happy . . . We are to decide by this judgment . .
                  . whether this Nation will convert the very offenses,
                  which have thrown a transient shade upon its
                  Government, into something that will reflect a
                  permanent luster upon the honour, justice, and
                  humanity of this Kingdom. (Burke 310, 383)
                </blockquote>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Yet as was the case with the pious missionary, Las
                Casas, Burke, the conservative M.P. did not set himself
                against colonialism <em>per se</em>, but rather,
                against its corruption by unscrupulous fortune seekers.
                Burke defends colonialism&mdash;as he defends all of
                his beliefs&mdash;by reference to tradition. Because
                colonialism boasts an exalted pedigree tracing back to
                the empires of the classical world, it is therefore
                good.<a href=
                "#3">[3]</a>
                But Burke's reference to the Spanish empire is
                complicated: Though he converts Warren Hastings into a
                unique aberration in the long line of good
                colonialists, a solitary straw man, the pervasiveness
                of Spanish colonial corruption suggests an intrinsic
                flaw in the moral structure of expansionism. The very
                language he uses to banish Hastings from the line of
                good colonialists, in short, exposes the atrocities of
                the traditional colonialism Burke would defend as the
                proper expression of the English constitution.<a href=

              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The shocking idea that enlightened Britain might
                present the mirror image of the Spain of the
                Inquisition flew in the face of two centuries of the
                Black Legend, that nearly ubiquitous notion that
                defined British expansionism as the antithesis of
                everything its Spanish precursor had been:
                gold-thirsty, inhuman, and hypocritical. Since the
                publication of Adam Smith's <em>Wealth of Nations</em>,
                British liberals had come to regard traditional
                colonialism, of the sort practiced by Spain, as
                counterproductive and unprofitable. Was not Spain's
                mercantile reliance on the extraction of bullion from
                its colonies directly responsible for its languishing
                industry, agriculture, trade, and wealth?&nbsp; By
                contrast, Britain's policy of indirect rule in South
                America cost nothing to maintain or defend, and amply
                compensated the kingdom for the loss of trade
                privileges with North America. Indeed, as early as
                1707, that forerunner of modern capitalism, Daniel
                Defoe, had plainly stated:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  We want not the domination of more countries than we
                  have; we sufficiently possess a nation when we have
                  an open and free trade to it . . . our trading to Old
                  Spain has been a full trade to New Spain, a trade by
                  which England has always drawn as much money from
                  America as Old Spain itself. (Quoted in Liss 4-5)
                </blockquote>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>By the end of the eighteenth century, Britain had
                come to believe that "large-scale overseas settlement .
                . . could ultimately be only destructive to the
                metropolis." By contrast, British India "was to be a
                place not of settlement, but of exploitation." Because
                the Indian people were alleged to live "under the
                'tutelage', rather than the rule" of Great Britain,
                they were&nbsp; "likely to prove more cooperative and
                more productive" (Pagden 6-7).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>When Warren Hastings went on trial, the legitimacy
                of indirect rule as a benevolent commercial contract
                went on trial as well. Under the aegis of establishing
                a program of "harmonious exchange" with India and
                Bengal, Hastings had created a despotic and corrupt
                reign that undercut and destabilized native power
                structures and required the erection of a militaristic
                British colony to safeguard his rule (Pagden 10).
                Better would it have been, argued Burke, to have
                established a traditional colony in India, one pledged
                to improve the country in which it was founded, rather
                than to tacitly maintain a military-commercial colony
                with no civic responsibility beyond the aggrandizement
                of its rulers. Whereas it had been possible before the
                Hastings trial to imagine liberal commerce as the
                salvation from Spanish-style colonialism, now the old,
                protectionist imperialism emerged as a haven from the
                ravages of irresponsible British-style
                exploitation.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>While Spain still nominally held the reins of power
                in Spanish America, however, it was all too easy to
                frame incursions into the area by British capitalists
                as missions of political liberation. Black Legend
                rhetoric condemning the tyrannical Spanish incumbency
                counterbalanced the fact that Britain's economic
                rapacity was beginning to effect uncomfortable
                parallels with Spain. But so powerful was British
                commercial domination of Spanish America, both legal
                and illegal, that when Spain declared war against
                Britain in 1796, the British navy was able to sever
                communications between Spain and the New World
                (Williams 45). As with India, Britain's proudly vaunted
                "harmonious exchange," or free trade, with America
                ended neither with trade nor with freedom. British
                merchants financed, and British soldiers and seamen
                facilitated, the establishment of new Spanish American
                governments sympathetic to British interests. Intrigues
                involving the outright seizure of Spanish America were
                the order of the day. In the year before his death,
                Prime Minister Pitt schemed to take Spanish America,
                while Sir Popham, followed by General Auchmuty,
                Brigadier-General Craufurd, and General Whitelocke
                attempted to commandeer Buenos Aires and administer it
                as a British colony.<a href=
                "#5">[5]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>For Burke, the quintessential error of both Spanish
                colonialism in America and British colonialism in India
                was in observing too great a difference between the
                Euroimperial subject and the colonized native. This
                position was at once radically universalist and
                radically chauvinistic. In his writings on America and
                India, Burke's logic was that subjection to the British
                constitution&mdash;that repository of all human freedom
                and justice&mdash;was the highest form of independence
                a struggling nation could expect. Good British
                colonialism, then, offered the only meaningful freedom
                to a colony, a freedom guaranteed by the essential
                similitude of conqueror of and conquered. Thus, for
                Burke, the dominant feature of the North American
                colonists was their "fierce spirit of liberty," which,
                it happened, was their natural inheritance from the
                English character and constitution: "the people of the
                colonies are descendents of Englishmen. They are
                therefore not only devoted to liberty, but to liberty
                according to English ideas, and on English principles"
                (Burke 81). America was in revolt because the Americans
                were being denied their fundamental bond with the
                British, their rights as subjects under the British
                constitution. Burke rhetorically transformed the
                Americans into Britons in order to argue, not for their
                independence, but instead that their liberation was
                synonymous with their continued peaceful colonization.
                To wit, "the more ardently they love liberty, the more
                perfect will be their obedience" (Burke 129). Burke's
                arguments for humane government in India admitted of
                greater differences between colonizer and colonizer,
                yet the same principle of intimate mutual interest
                inhered.<a href=
                "#6">[6]</a>
                In his defense of Fox's East India Bill, Burke asserted
                that good management in India was tantamount to the
                protection of British rights: "I am certain than every
                means effectual to preserve India from oppression is a
                guard to preserve the British constitution from its
                worst corruption" (Burke 289). For America and India
                alike, the principle maintained that the generous
                exercise of British empire guaranteed the rights and
                interests of both Britain and its colonies.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In 1795, despite Burke's eloquence, Warren Hastings
                was acquitted. Burke's failure to expiate Britain's
                colonial guilt left an indelible mark on Romantic-era
                ideology. Poets such as Coleridge, Southey, Anna
                Letitia Barbauld, P. B. Shelley, and others would
                continue to challenge and develop Burke's fear of the
                new imperialism and his assertion that the recognition
                of the sameness of colonized and colonizer could bring
                about a form of good colonialism. Indeed, the
                ideological excess of Burke's colonial rhetoric laid
                the foundation for the curious blending of utopianism
                and guilty paralysis that has become synonymous with
                the Romantic character. It was under the influence of
                this Burkean amalgam of good colonial rhetoric and
                uncontainable colonial guilt that Robert Southey first
                imagined his American epic, <em>Madoc</em>, in
                1789.<a href=
                "#7">[7]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><em>Madoc</em> was born with Southey's drive to
                abandon what he perceived as a corrupted Europe. In
                1793, Southey wrote, "the visions of futurity are dark
                and gloomy&mdash;and the only ray enlivening the scene
                beams on America" (Carnall 23). In a letter of 1794 to
                Horace Walpole Bedford, Southey elaborated his plan of
                escape:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Calmly and firmly&mdash;after long deliberation I
                  pronounce&mdash;I am going to America . . . Should
                  the resolution of others fail, Coleridge and I will
                  go together, and either find repose in an Indian
                  wig-wam&mdash;or from an Indian tomohawk, but this is
                  the last resource of disappointment and despair . . .
                  .Horace would the state of society be happy where
                  [labor] two hours a day at some useful employment,
                  where all were equally [ . . . .] where the common
                  ground was cultivated by common toil, and its produce
                  laid in common granaries, where none were rich
                  because none should be poor, where every motive for
                  vice should be annihilated and every motive for
                  virtue strengthened? . . . far removed from treachery
                  corruption and slaughter [of the present European
                  wars], I go with my brethren and friends to establish

                <p>The Pantisocratic movement envisioned by Southey,
                Coleridge, and their circle held that the present
                unequal distribution of property was the principle
                cause of immorality in the world. By removing the cause
                of this evil in a society, based variously on the
                abolition of private property and on the equal division
                of shared property, immorality could be

                <p>Southey never reached America. In his original plan
                for <em>Madoc</em>, however, Southey transposed his
                utopian vision of Pantisocracy onto the Inca society of
                Peru.<a href=
                "#9">[9]</a>
                Southey conflated Prince Madoc of twelfth-century Wales
                with Manco Capac, the reigning Inca King during the
                invasion of Pizarro, thereby suggesting, somewhat
                anachronistically, that the Incas were originally
                Welsh. Southey explains:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  <p>it is my intention &lsaquo;on&rsaquo; the basis of

                  when Peru was discovered by Pizarro the whole country
                  was divided into three parts. the King &amp; the
                  Priests had one each. the remaining part was the
                  property of the nation&mdash;they cultivated it by
                  their common toil&mdash;the produce was laid up in
                  common storehouses&mdash;&amp; enjoyed by all

                  property thus annihilated&mdash;all motives for vice

                <p>Despite this plan, the final published version of
                <em>Madoc</em> was set, not in Peru, but in Florida,
                and in a Florida identified as Mexican Aztlan, mythical
                homeland of the Aztecs, explicitly described in
                language borrowed from the Spanish chronicles of the
                discovery of Mexico.<a href=

                <p>In the 1805 version of <em>Madoc</em>, Southey drew
                upon the legend, then experiencing renewed popularity,
                that Prince Madoc discovered America in the year 1170,
                there to found a harmoniously integrated colony of
                Welsh Indians. Madoc and his followers were believed to
                have assimilated into Mexican life while preserving the
                Welsh language and religion. Hosts of European
                travelers from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century,
                as well as the wave of Welsh settlers that arrived in
                America around 1666, bore this story out, attesting to
                encounters with Welsh-speaking Indians in the southern
                parts of North America and areas of the West Indies.
                These accounts were in turn used to argue that
                Britain's peacefully established claim to America
                predated Spain's by over 300 years. By contrast with
                the Black Legend, in Southey's retelling, Madoc and his
                people are not motivated by the desire for gain. Madoc
                and his followers, rather, are political exiles,
                fleeing the tyrannical reign of Madoc's brother, King
                David, who has been duped into marriage with an English
                princess as part of the Plantagenet strategy of Celtic
                conquest. Madoc arrives in America as anything but a
                conquering hero. On touching land, he is beseeched by
                the oppressed native Hoamen to free them from the Aztec
                warlords who demand human sacrifice from them. Madoc is
                drawn into war, but only, Southey insists, to protect
                the innocent Hoamen. After the expulsion of the Aztecs,
                the Hoamen found a new society with their Welsh
                protectors.</p>

                <p>The necessity of rewriting the Spanish conquest of

                Even while the lessons of the Hastings trial weighed
                heavily on the British conscience, Britain was
                accelerating its aggressive policy of indirect rule in
                Spanish America. Despite the power of the Burkean
                rhetoric of good colonialism, a sense of guilty
                implication lurked behind Britain's keen interest in
                the death throes of the Spanish empire.<a href=

                against the dangers of Britain's Spanish American
                speculation, one early nineteenth-century commentator
                had this to say about Spain:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  <p>No sooner did they obtain wealth without labor,
                  than unbridled passions began to predominate, and a
                  love of immoderate enjoyments stamped the Nation with
                  the horrible character of treachery and
                  licentiousness. Woe to the people who obtain wealth
                  without labor! (Quoted in Carnall 109-10) <a href=
                  "#14">[14]</a></p>
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Spain was the dominant European colonial power of
                the immediate past, Britain of the present and future.
                As such, Spain presented an object lesson about the
                pitfalls of imperialism. Other commentators recalled
                Volney's accounts of the ruins of Palmyra, and
                prophesied that Britain was&nbsp; "doomed, a second
                Rome, to fall under the attack of the modern Franks"
                (<em>Monthly Magazine</em> 3-4). During this same
                period, Anna Barbauld's poem, <em>Eighteen Hundred and
                Eleven</em>, appeared, foretelling the decline of
                London into a primitive state as a result of
                imperialism and the insatiable expansion of
                trade.<a href=
                "#15">[15]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>By asserting that the natives of Aztlan had been
                British from 1170 onwards, Southey could legitimate
                modern British intervention in the area as having a
                reference point historically anterior to (and morally
                superior to) Spain's. To support this claim, Southey
                noted in the preface to <em>Madoc</em>: "Strong
                evidence has been adduced that [Madoc] reached America,
                and that his posterity exist there to this day, on the
                southern branches of the Missouri, retaining their
                complexion, their language, and, in some degree, their
                arts" (Southey, <em>Madoc</em> 8-9).<a href=
                "#16">[16]</a>
                But Southey's portrayal of good colonialism exceeds its
                own rhetoric even more terrifically than Burke's. In
                the first place, the very existence of the Madoc legend
                depends upon violent colonial encounter. England's
                brutal and unjust invasion of Wales is the exact
                condition of possibility for Madoc's guiltless
                colonization of America. If Burke's "myth of imperial
                venerability" relied on the scapegoating of Warren
                Hastings as the repository of all colonial evils, then
                Southey outdid his predecessor in casting England
                itself as the villain whose abjection would ensure the
                goodness of Madoc's colonial mission (Suleri 45). And
                if Hastings's acquittal was preordained by a nation
                seduced by the nascent ideology of free trade, one
                could hardly expect the indictment of ancient England
                in the era that witnessed the birth of English
                nationalism. The contemporary reader of <em>Madoc</em>
                was thus caught between his or her allegiance to
                England as a colonial power and the growing awareness
                of the Celtic victims of English colonialism, thus
                forwarding the Romantic-era identification of the
                British subject with both colonizer and colonized.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>This contradictory double allegiance was at the
                center of Southey's depiction of the exploits of the
                Welsh Prince Madoc. The growth of Welsh nationalism, in
                which Madoc and other Welsh heroes were called upon to
                support the growth of a Welsh identity as separate
                from, and even opposed to a British identity, was
                concomitant with that of English nationalism in the
                late eighteenth century.<a href=
                "#17">[17]</a>
                According to Gwyn Williams, "Madoc fever was part of a
                crisis of modernization of much of Welsh society in
                this period, and the dream of rediscovering the lost
                Welsh Indians had much in common with the desire to
                recreate Druidism or the patriarchal language" (G.
                Williams 569).<a href=
                "#18">[18]</a>
                Welsh nationalism reached men such as Southey and Dr.
                Johnson via a strong cadre of Welsh intellectuals
                living in London, one of their most prominent members,
                the mythologist and cultural activist, Iolo Morganwyg,
                being the man who persuaded Southey to tackle the theme
                of Madoc. Welsh patriot-scholars now held
                themselves&mdash;and not the English&mdash;to be the
                continuators of the originary Britons; it was the Welsh
                Druids and Celts who had staved off Saxon, Norman, and
                Roman invasions until their defeat by the English.
                While, on the one hand, shared imperial endeavor abroad
                aided the formation of an authentically British
                governing elite, on the other, Britain was being riven
                apart by budding Celtic patriotism.<a href=
                "#19">[19]</a>
                As such, the internecine warfare racking the house of
                Owen evoked for <em>Madoc</em>'s British readers the
                conflicts erupting as the Celtic periphery struggled
                for greater independence from its English overlords.
                Southey's treatment of Madoc, thus, did not convey a
                neutral presumption of Welsh history <em>as</em>
                British history but rather, thanks to the success of
                the Romantic Celtic revival, the celebration of a
                radical Britishness that might indeed exclude
                England.<a href=

              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Even as Southey necessarily foregrounded the
                violence of conquest, he awkwardly strove to banish it
                from his poem by rejecting the trappings of epic in
                favor of those of sentimental literature (Southey,
                <em>Madoc</em> 9).<a href=

                The 1794 version of <em>Madoc</em> openly rejects
                Aeneas as a heroic role model:</p>

                  <p>After attributing such "justice" to their cause,
                  Southey proceeded to cleanse his conquerors of their
                  obligatory violence by portraying them as the victims
                  of a cruelty that outstripped that which they would
                  exert. By repeatedly identifying the Welsh-English
                  conflict with the Hoaman-Aztec conflict, and then by
                  melding the Welsh and the Hoamen into one race,
                  Southey could ultimately present the conquest of the
                  Aztecs as direct and natural retribution for the
                  incursions of England upon Wales.</p>

                <p>This transposition from the Welsh stage to Aztlan
                depended first on the <em>a priori</em> sameness of the
                Hoamen and the Welsh. Upon encountering the Hoamen,
                Madoc aptly notes:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  <p>. . . Fearless sure they were,<br />
                  And while they eyed us, grasped their spears, as

                  Like Britain's injured but unconquered sons,<br />
                  They, too, had known how perilous it was<br />
                  To let a stranger, if he came in arms,<br />
                  Set foot upon their land. (Southey, <em>Madoc</em>
                  45-6)</p>
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Then, as the Hoamen, discerning the good intentions
                of Madoc's men, proceed to kill a deer with which to
                feast their guests, they bring more honor upon
                themselves, even outdoing the Welsh with whom they are
                compared, and, like Burke's Indians, inverting the
                standard trope by which natives are to civilized
                Europeans what children are to adults:</p>

                the Welsh&mdash;and indeed, their superiority in
                certain arts, he also emplots an extensive set of
                parallels between his Hoaman and Welsh protagonists.
                The most significant of these parallels is that between
                Madoc and the Aztec leader, Malinal, who renounces his
                morally corrupt people to live among the Hoamen. Both
                Malinal and Madoc are conscientious exiles from their

                <p>In war as in love, Malinal functions as Madoc's
                double. While Madoc fights the Aztecs, Malinal drives
                the invaders from the Welsh-Hoaman village. As one
                assailant pursues Goervyl, Malinal valiantly "thrust[s]
                into his groin / The mortal sword of Madoc" (Southey,
                <em>Madoc</em> 314). And following their final defeat
                by Malinal, Southey notes significantly that the
                repulsed Aztecs retreat "as midnight thieves / Who find
                the master waking" (Southey, <em>Madoc</em> 308).</p>

                <p>The relationship between Malinal and Madoc not only
                argues for the sameness of colonizer and colonized, it
                helps articulate the necessary hybridity of both.
                Though hybridity theory is rarely brought to bear on
                Americanist texts by British authors of the Romantic
                era, the relationship between Malinal and Madoc, like
                that between the English colonist and Indian native in
                Rudyard Kipling's "Naboth," exemplifies "the hybridity
                of imagined communities" through the "emergence of the
                interstices&mdash;the overlap and displacement of
                difference" where cultures are restructured (Bhabha,
                <em>Location</em> 5, 2).<a href=
                "#23">[23]</a>
                Indeed, Southey's choice of the name, Malinal, was no
                accident. In her treatment of the figure of La
                Malinche, Cort&eacute;s's Aztec mistress and the
                translator who made possible the Spanish defeat of
                Aztlan, Sandra Cypess explains that the name, La
                Malinche, was formed by combining the Nahuatl birth
                name, Malinal, and its variant Malintzin, with Marina,
                the name given to La Malinche at her Christian baptism.
                As such, according to Cypess, the name La Malinche must
                be understood as a quintessential "syncretic, mestizo
                form" (Cypess 2). Being widely read in the Spanish
                chronicles of discovery, Southey was undoubtedly aware
                of both the debt the Spaniards owed to La
                Malinche/Malinal for their victory over the Aztecs, and
                of the fact that La Malinche's/Malinal's child by
                Cort&eacute;s, Don Mart&iacute;n, "was considered the
                first mestizo, origin of the Mexican nation, the union
                of Amerindian and European" (Cypess 9).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Southey's rewriting of La Malinche as the Aztec
                warrior and future husband of the Welsh Princess
                Goervyl restores honor to the much maligned,
                "traitorous" Malinche, just as the substitution of
                Prince Madoc for the barbarous Cort&eacute;s
                resuscitates a righteous vision of colonialism.
                Together, these rewritings serve to replace the scene
                of desperate native betrayal by the Spanish with one of
                enlightened native collaboration with the British. By
                his identification with Malinal, Madoc too becomes a
                figure of hybridity, redeeming the ideal of cultural
                blending from the degraded regimes of Aztec and English
                oppression. Though in 1805, America may not yet have
                been completely deprived of its alterity, the process
                of creolization was well under way, and the white
                creole populations of Spanish America, with the help of
                British patronage, were on the eve of declaring
                independence. In <em>Madoc</em>, the rhetoric of which
                "shows an 'Indianisation' of Europe as the inevitable
                corollary of the 'Europeanisation' of America," one
                feels the adumbration of Spanish American independence,
                and of Southey's hope that Britain's continuing
                involvement be beneficent rather than mercenary (Mason
                8).<a href=

              <li>
                <p>Hartley and Godwin had provided Southey with the
                rationale for connecting self-interested affection with
                more capacious benevolence. According to Godwin, family
                affection represented personal love that, in a just and
                rational social order, blossomed into the love of one's
                nation, and from there, into the love of all peoples.
                Southey's envisioned bicultural merging between Welsh
                and Hoamen substitutes the consolidating turning-inward
                of familial affinity for the acquisitive
                turning-outward of imperial expansion. But when Madoc
                is drawn into tribal warfare on behalf of his new
                Hoamen relations, Southey's elaborate machinery for
                replacing conquest with reciprocal love reveals its
                fatal flaw. It is paradoxically by yielding himself too
                fully to his sympathy and identification with the
                Hoamen that Madoc ends by recapitulating the deeds of
                Cort&eacute;s and annihilating the Aztec race. When a
                Hoaman boy "place[s] / The falchion in [Madoc's] hand,
                and g[ives] the shield, / And point[s] south and west,
                that [he] should go / To conquer and protect," Madoc
                works himself into a frenzy of sympathy that results in
                unreflecting violent retribution: "I shuddered, and my
                hand / Instinctively unsheathed the avenging sword"
                (Southey, <em>Madoc</em> 50, 54). Rather than providing
                a retreat from colonial violence, family love is
                marshaled to inspire and justify imperial punishment.
                Here, as elsewhere, Southey refused to differentiate
                between colonizer and colonized, designing instead "to
                elicit a sense of moral kinship with peoples of
                different customs and faiths" according to the belief
                that "self-transcendence, was the starting point for .
                . . human reformation" (Meachen 592). But while a
                belief in self-transcendence for the good of the group
                was seminal in Southey's disposition against violent
                conquest, it was precisely that impulse which
                involuntarily recapitulated the actions of the
                conqueror. Because "the justification of violence is
                developed in reaction to the dangers which threaten
                it," <em>Madoc</em> inadvertently foregrounds the
                violence it meant to suppress by its exaltation of the
                family (Meachen 605).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The convenient identification with nature itself
                prevents this supplemental violence from destabilizing
                the precarious balance between aggressor and victim.
                Through a series of metonyms, Queen Erillyab is
                represented as the direct extension of Aztlan.<a href=
                "#25">[25]</a>
                Madoc, as Erillyab's husband/brother, commands this
                relationship as well. As such, the final confrontation
                that determines the Aztecs' expulsion is resolved, not
                in a contest of arms, but in the combined natural
                disasters of a spontaneous volcanic eruption and flood
                which cause the retreating Aztecs to cry in dismay:
                "The Gods are leagued with them! . . . the Elements /
                Banded against us! For our overthrow / Were yonder
                mountain-springs of fire ordained; / For our
                destruction the earth-thunders loosed" (Southey,
                <em>Madoc</em> 383).<a href=

                <p>The naturalized Welsh-Hoaman defeat of the Aztecs
                redeems the Welsh defeat by their Catholic English
                conquerors and represents the symbolic triumph of good
                British colonialism over Catholic Spanish conquest.
                Medieval England's identification with Spain by way of
                their shared faith eases the strain of Southey's
                anti-English rhetoric. Madoc's verbal assault on the
                English troops occupying his homeland is indeed
                conspicuous more for its anti-Catholic stance than for
                any anti-English sentiment:</p>

                  I shall not strike so much as a topsail for the
                  breath<br />
                  Of all his maledictions! (Southey, <em>Madoc</em>
                  126-7)</p>
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>The parallel between Catholicism and the Aztec
                religion that facilitates Madoc's defeat of the Aztecs
                is unmistakable in the following juxtaposition of
                scenes. In the first scene, Madoc discovers an English
                plot to exhume his father's bones and discard them "In
                some unhallowed pit, with foul disgrace / And
                contumelious wrong" (Southey, <em>Madoc</em> 128).
                Madoc succeeds in interrupting the "irreverent work" of
                their "polluted hands" and, turning the situation to
                advantage, forces the Catholic ministers to repackage
                King Owen's bones for transport to America (Southey,
                <em>Madoc</em> 130, 131). On American soil, Madoc
                performs a strikingly similar restitution of the
                defiled Hoaman patriarch. Coanocotzin, the Aztec King,
                has desecrated the Hoaman King Tepollomi's mummified
                corpse: "the dead Tepollomi / Stood up against the
                wall, by devilish art / Preserved; and from his black
                and shrivelled hand / The steady lamp hung down." Madoc
                exclaims, in an echo of his injunction to the Catholic
                gravediggers: " . . . till that body in the grave be
                laid, / Till thy polluted altars be made pure, / There
                is no peace between us," and proceeds to destroy the
                Aztec temple (Southey, <em>Madoc</em> 61).<a href=

              <li>
                <p>According to the Black Legend, the dissipation of
                Catholic Spain derived from its acquisitiveness, greed,
                and taste for ostentation. It was the dread lest
                Britain exhibit such traits in its actions abroad that
                had lent such force to Burke's attack on Hastings. As
                Britain began to emerge as "a state in the disguise of
                a merchant," Southey, like Burke, vilified all that was
                economically speculative in order to purge the colonial
                project of its perceived inhumanity (Burke, quoted in
                Browne 95). Southey warmly agreed with Charles Hall's
                polemic, <em>The Effects of Civilization</em>, which
                appeared in the same year as <em>Madoc</em>, when it
                claimed that "Trade knows no friends or kindred . . .
                &mdash;avarice no compassion&mdash;gain no bounds"
                (Hall, quoted in Carnall 4). From its opening stanzas,
                <em>Madoc</em> takes a firm stand against the
                celebration of commercial values:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Blow fairly winds of Heaven! ye ocean waves<br />
                  Swell not in anger to that fated fleet,<br />
                  For not of conquest greedy, not the sons<br />
                  Of Commerce, merchandizing blood, they seek<br />
                  The distant land. &mdash;blow fairly winds of
                  Heaven!<br />
                  Ye ocean waves bear safe your blameless load!
                  (Southey, quoted in Pratt, 'Revising" 155)</p>
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>From the debates on free trade to those on the
                dangers of nurturing too fine a sensibility engaged by
                sentimental novelists from Radcliffe to Austen, the
                fear that Britain might be hastening toward its
                decadence weighed on the public mind at the turn of the
                century. The conservative opposition to free trade that
                Southey shared with Burke is manifest in the former's
                attempt to free his Welsh protagonists from the stain
                of showiness by emphasizing instead the superstitious
                vanity of the Aztecs. According to Southey's sources,
                the Aztecs kept "the gods of the conquered nations . .
                . fastened and caged in the Mexican temples" (Southey,
                <em>Madoc</em> 419). Like the burgeoning British market
                for oriental commodities, the Aztecs' collection of
                specimens from their conquered subjects pretended to
                the classical glory of empire while nurturing
                avarice.<a href=
                "#28">[28]</a>
                But even as Madoc's destruction of the Aztec temples
                marks an end to acquisitive empire, Southey's aim of
                rationality and sobriety is compromised by the poem's
                own explicitly exoticist allure.<a href=
                "#29">[29]</a>
                Although Southey ostensibly privileges Welsh simplicity
                over Aztec gaudiness, this program is compromised by
                the dazzling visual effects of such lines as:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Little did then his pomp of plumes bestead<br />
                  The Azteca, or glittering pride of gold,<br />
                  Against the tempered sword; little his casque,<br />
                  Gay with its feathery coronal, or dressed<br />
                  In graven terrors, when the Briton's hand<br />
                  Drove in through the helm and head the short-piked
                  mace. (Southey, <em>Madoc</em> 301)</p>
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Such is the contradiction of an exoticist poem
                conceived as the embodiment of the rational humanist
                ideals of Hartley and Godwin.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Again, the reader of <em>Madoc</em> is confronted
                with a seemingly unassimilable composite identification
                with both the colonial aggressor and his victim. Yet
                whereas before, this double identification was
                sanctioned by nature itself, now the narration of
                Madoc's triumph implicates the hero and his
                partisans/audience in an enjoyment of the "pomp of
                plumes" that has come to define the Catholic/Aztec
                adversary. <em>Madoc</em>'s uncomfortable flirtation
                with the luxuriousness of the enemy was left to stand
                until 1815, when Southey prepared a new edition of the
                poem. The revised preface reversed the passage
                indicating the survival of Madoc's legacy in America.
                The new version read: "That country has now been fully
                explored; and, wherever Madoc may have settled, it is
                now certain that no Welsh Indians are to be found upon
                any branches of the Missouri" (Southey, <em>Madoc</em>
                1815). This erasure of the Welsh Indians effectively
                neutralized Madoc's violent conquest, insofar as
                Madoc's progeny became the victims of a greater, but
                unnamed, expansionist violence that had wiped away
                Britain's claim to America, leaving nothing but a
                legend of legitimacy to counter the looming specter of
                culpability. Madoc's success as a colonist who achieves
                complete sameness with those he colonizes, and who
                therefore expiates the violence of his conquest, is
                thus ultimately contingent on his destruction by a
                later and less scrupulous European expansionism.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Burke's failure to change the course of the British
                empire in India and America, and Madoc's failure to
                sustain a viable British title to New Spain are
                essential to the Romantic ideology of good colonialism.
                Burke himself was keenly aware of the emotional force
                of such grandiose failures:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  <p>I am convinced we have a degree of delight, and
                  that no small one, in the real misfortunes and pains
                  of others . . . The prosperity of no empire, nor the
                  grandeur of no king, can so agreeably affect in the
                  reading, as the ruin of the state of Macedon, and the
                  distress of its unhappy prince. (Burke,
                  <em>Philosophical Enquiry</em> v. I 80)</p>
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>In his <em>Theory of Moral Sentiments</em>, Adam
                Smith had maintained that the harmonious natural order
                of the universe favored economic freedom&mdash;what
                would become free trade in <em>The Wealth of
                Nations</em>&mdash;as beneficial to the greatest number
                of people. According to Smith, a natural link inhered
                between moral virtue and free trade, insofar as "the
                road to virtue and that to fortune . . . are, happily
                in most cases, very nearly the same" (Smith 63). If a
                conservative vision of good colonialism were to compete
                with such powerful liberal rhetoric, it would need to
                insist on the cruel and unnatural efficiency of free
                trade imperialism.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The contrasting naturalness and inefficiency, and
                the resulting failure, of good colonialism, by its
                identification with the colonial victim, guaranteed its
                innocence and obscured its operations of power behind a
                veil of pathos. Burke and Southey saw good colonialism
                as the only principled reaction against self-interested
                commerce. But the rhetoric of colonial unassailability
                that they developed was short lived. By 1858, the
                British crown had assumed direct control over India,
                and Victoria had been crowned Empress of India. In
                place of indirect rule, "there had emerged a
                belligerent militarism which borrowed is rhetorical
                style, and its political culture if not its colonial
                policies, from the same Roman imperial imagery which
                had driven earlier European empires" (Pagden 8). It is
                a bitter irony that, in attempting to stem the tide of
                capitalist exploitation overseas, Burke and Southey
                unwittingly helped create the rhetorical resources upon
                which the distinctly <em>illiberal</em> imperialist
                resurgence of the Victorian Era would draw.</p>

            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="3"></a>3</sup> In his
            <i>Speech on Conciliation with America</i>, Burke
            exemplifies this nostalgia for the colonial era before the
            Peace of Paris when he urges that Britain "return to that
            mode which a uniform experience has marked out to you as
            best, and in which you walked with security, advantage, and
            honor, until the year 1763" (Burke 108). Before the rise to
            power of Lord North and the application of George III's
            coercive bills, Burke continues, "everything was sweetly
            and harmoniously disposed" and the empire was "more united
            than it is now" (Burke 122). Burke's proposed conciliation
            with America, as opposed to economically "sophistical"
            imperialism, "is what becomes the dignity of a ruling
            people&mdash;gratuitous, unconditional, and not held out as
            a matter of bargain and sale" (Burke 76, 126).</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="4"></a>4</sup> Sara Suleri
            insightfully notes: "Burke supplies imperial England with
            an idiom in which to articulate its emergent suspicion that
            the health of the colonizing project was dependent on a
            recognition of the potentially crippling structure of
            imperial culpability" (Suleri 26).</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="5"></a>5</sup> Popham et.
            al. were far from the only British officers to make an
            attempt on Argentina. Among the more well-known British
            colonialists, John Constanse Davie, who wrote <i>Letters
            from Paraguay</i> (1805), one of the earliest British
            travel accounts about Spanish America, also conspired to
            wrest the Plata region of Argentina from Spain.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="6"></a>6</sup> In his
            <i>Speech on Mr. Fox's East-India Bill</i>, Burke explains
            that although the people of India are not descended of the
            English, they match&mdash;and even precede&mdash;the
            English in civilization and dignity: "This multitude of men
            does not consist of an abject and barbarous populace . . .
            but a people for ages civilized and cultivated; cultivated
            by all the arts of polished life, whilst we were yet in the
            woods. There, have been . . . princes once of great
            dignity, authority, and opulence . . . . There, is to be
            found an ancient and venerable priesthood, the depository
            of their laws, learning, and history . . . a nobility of
            great antiquity and renown; a multitude of cities, not
            exceeded in population and trade by those of the first
            class in Europe; merchants and bankers, individual houses
            of whom have once vied in capital with the bank of England
            . . . millions of ingenious manufacturers and mechanicks"
            (Burke 295-96).</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="7"></a>7</sup> Originally
            envisioned in 1789, the first version of <i>Madoc</i>
            appeared in print in 1794. It was followed by a revised
            version in 1797 and a final, expanded version in 1805.
            <i>Madoc</i> was reprinted with minor alterations several
            times throughout the nineteenth century, and was
            particularly appreciated by the young Shelley and
            Byron.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="8"></a>8</sup> George
            Burnett, who planned to emigrate to America with Southey
            and Coleridge, described the "grand object" of the
            Pantisocratic movement as "the Abolition of Property; at
            least of individual property. Conceiving the present
            unequal distribution of property, to be the source of by
            far the greater part of the moral evil that prevails in the
            world; by removal of the <i>cause</i>, we thought, and as
            it appears to me justly thought, that the <i>effect</i>
            must also cease" (Quoted in Roe 157).</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="9"></a>9</sup> It should be
            remembered that Southey's foisting of Pantisocracy onto
            Inca law is a two-way street, as many of his Pantisocratic
            ideals came initially from the study of Inca and other
            Native American civilizations.</p>

            Charlevoix, Roger Williams, Heriot, Timberlake, Mackenzie,

            Robertson's <i>History of America</i> (1777) presents
            another excellent instance of Britain's rescripting of the
            Spanish conquest of America. In North America, Joel
            Barlow's epics, <i>The Vision of Columbus</i> and the
            <i>Columbiad</i>, represent a project similar both in

            Interestingly, Thomas de Quincey identifies the Iberia from
            which the good colonist of Egypt, Prince Gebir, hails in
            Walter Savage Landor's eponymous poem as "spiritual
            England" (Quoted in Leask, 26).</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="14"></a>14</sup> <i>An
            Expos&eacute;</i>, 1810, 11. This warning came as a
            response to the increasingly prevalent&nbsp; wish that
            Britain, and not Spain, possessed the wealth of Spanish
            America. One English columnist expressed this desire as
            follows: "The more I contemplate on the filth and laziness
            of these people, the more I regret the miserly Henry, when
            applied to by Columbus, was not inspired by the demon of
            avarice, if no more laudable motive could have actuated
            him, to have fitted out that noble adventurer, and by that
            means to have secured this country, this rich delightful
            country, to the Crown of Britain. The Spaniards possess
            blessings they never did, nor ever will know how to
            appreciate; for, slaves to gold, they neglect every other
            advantage. Had the English possessed this southern world,
            thousands and tens of thousands, nay millions, would have
            blest the hour when they became their conquerors" (Quoted
            in Jones 65-6).</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="15"></a>15</sup>
            Significantly, Barbauld's poem was met by an anxious
            rebuttal from Southey the reviewer, and the aging Barbauld
            suffered vicious attacks, both on her poem and her person,
            by a host of intellectuals who had previously supported her
            work.</p>

            particularly characteristic. After being considered
            throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as a
            "usurper or misguided rebel . . . . Glendwr seems to burst
            forth in splendor in the 1770s as a national hero" (Morgan
            81). During the same period, a new and widely-read version
            of Madoc's history appeared in 1790, by Dr. John

            Scotland, England, and to a lesser extent Ireland became
            welded later in the 1770s into a single ruling class that
            intermarried, shared the same outlook, and took to itself
            the business of governing, fighting for, and profiting from
            greater Britain" (Colley, 325-6).</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="20"></a>20</sup>
            Significantly, when John Evans was sent in 1790 to
            investigate the Welsh Indians, he was financed, not by the
            British government, but by the Welsh. Kindled by the
            American Revolution, Welsh interest in America focused on
            the movement to immigrate to America in order to found a
            Welsh-speaking colony in the new republic.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="21"></a>21</sup> Southey
            believed that the "general fault of Epic Poems is, that we
            feel little interest for the Heroes they celebrate [ . . .
            ] to engage the unprejudiced, there must be more of human
            feelings than is generally to be found in the character of
            Warriors." (Southey, <i>Joan of Arc</i>, quoted in Pratt,
            "Revising" 153). However, as Pratt says, "This did not mean
            that Southey was to follow the example of some of his
            contemporaries and attempt to produce a pacifist epic"
            (Pratt, "Revising" 153). The example of a pacifist epic
            cited by Pratt is Joseph Cottle's rather limp <i>Alfred, An
            Epic Poem, in Twenty-Four Books</i> (1800). Southey's
            generic revisionism did not sit well with reviewers, one of
            whom sardonically quipped: "We behold the author mounted on
            a strange animal, something between a rough Welsh pony and
            a Peruvian sheep, whose utmost capriole only tends to land
            him in the mud," and more sarcastically: "there is nothing
            in Homer, Virgil, or Milton, in any degree resembling the
            beauties of <i>Madoc</i>" (Ferriar 104).</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="22"></a>22</sup> The link
            between Madoc and Malinal is naturalized via ritual
            engagement with American soil. Malinal approaches Madoc
            just as the latter has finished interring his father's
            bones. As Malinal speaks, "In sorrow come I here, a
            banished man . . . Cut off from all my kin, from all old
            ties / Divorced," one recalls Madoc's flight from his
            brother's corrupt reign. Poignantly, Malinal's brother, the
            Aztec leader, Yuhudthiton, is there to hear this speech,
            and like the Welsh King David, haunted by his brother's
            righteous words, "hearkened he as one whose heart perforce
            / Suppressed its instinct" (Southey, <i>Madoc</i>
            227-8).</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="23"></a>23</sup> Work by
            Sara Suleri, Homi Bhabha, and Gayatri Spivak has opened the
            subject of colonial complicity in the representation of
            British India, revealing "the dynamic of powerlessness
            underlying the telling of colonial stories" (Suleri, 1).
            See Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, <i>In Other Worlds: Essays
            in Cultural Politics</i> and Homi K. Bhabha, "The Other
            Question: The Stereotype and Colonial Discourse."</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="24"></a>24</sup> In this
            context, it is worth exploring the extent to which
            Southey's <i>Madoc</i> was influenced by Alfonso de Ercilla
            y Zu&ntilde;iga's sixteenth-century creole epic <i>La
            Araucana</i>, which he knew of through William Hayley's
            <i>An Essay on Epic Poetry</i> (1782).</p>
    
            <p class="indent">In 1807, Southey wrote, without much
            hope, "We are going upon a wrong plan with respect to South
            America, and a ruinous one . . . . What should be done is
            to throw the Spanish colonies open, and leave them alone"
            (Quoted in Humphreys 8).</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="25"></a>25</sup> Madoc's
            encomium on Aztlan reveals an inability to separate the
            land from the woman he conquers: "Queen of the Valley! thou
            art beautiful!" (Southey, <i>Madoc</i> 356). This aspect of
            Southey's strategy for naturalizing conquest is very much
            in line with the tradition of Spanish conquest narratives
            against and over which he wrote. Annette Kolodny points out
            that standard colonial discourse encodes a gendered

            implicit reference to the natural devastation of imperial
            Rome is clearly no accident, and participates in a larger
            discourse that defined Spanish American volcanic activity,
            like its Italian correlative, as a warning against the
            arrogance of empire.</p>

            Conflations of Catholics and Aztecs abound in <i>Madoc</i>.
            In another scene, the Aztecs "piled a heap of sedge before
            our host, / And warned us: 'Sons of Ocean! from the land /
            Of Aztlan, while ye may, depart in peace!&nbsp; / Before
            the fire hence shall be extinguished, hence!&nbsp; / Or,
            even as yon dry sedge amid the flame, / So shall ye be
            consumed.' The arid heap&nbsp; / They kindled, and the
            rapid flame ran up, / And blazed, and died away (Southey,
            <i>Madoc</i> 65). Southey furnishes this action with a
            footnote that leaves no room for misunderstanding his
            design of dissolving Aztec crimes into Catholic ones: "As
            the sacring of the new-elected pope passeth (as the manner
            is) before St. Gregory's Chapel, the master of the
            ceremonies goeth before him, bearing two dry reeds, at the
            end of the one a burning candle tied, and at the other a
            handfull of flax, the which he setteth on fire, saying,
            with a loud voice, 'Pater Sancte, sic trasit gloria mundi"
            (Southey, <i>Madoc</i> 171n).</p>

            Leask explains that British demand for Chinoiserie in the
            Romantic Era is "rationalized in terms of an (always risky)
            analogy with the imperial triumphs of the classical world.
            For the orientalist poet Tom Medwin, English Romantic
            literature found a precedent and alibi in the Athenian
            practice of incorporating the imagery of its subjugated
            enemies into its own culture, caryatids from the
            Peloponnese, flowery eastern capitals from Persia" (Leask
            8).</p>

            shrewd analysis of how eighteenth-century British painting
            also worked to soften the violent seizure of American lands

            conquerors, as seduced by commodities, see B. Fowkes Tobin,
