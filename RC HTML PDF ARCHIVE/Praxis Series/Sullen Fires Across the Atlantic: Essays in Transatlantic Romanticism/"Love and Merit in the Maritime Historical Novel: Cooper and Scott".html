              <li>
                <p>Because two of the earliest Anglophone maritime
                historical novels feature seafaring characters whose
                manliness proves their suitability to command, they
                provide a useful field of inquiry for historians of
                gender and genre-making. In the 1820s, James Fenimore
                Cooper and Walter Scott invented manly heroes who
                exercise authority through a personal charisma that
                operates ineffably upon other men. Both Scott&rsquo;s
                <em>The Pirate</em> (1821) and Cooper&rsquo;s <em>The
                Pilot</em> (1823) cast socially isolated men in lead
                roles, but the various affectionate pairings of sailors
                in <em>The Pilot</em> contrast sharply with an emphasis
                on manly disinterestedness in <em>The
                Pirate</em>.<a href=

                The American mariners in <em>The Pilot</em> are not
                anti-social like they are in <em>The Pirate</em>,
                because Cooper&rsquo;s concern with the republican
                possibilities of historical romance led him to
                represent the pleasurable camaraderie among American
                gentlemen as a social symptom of the representative
                government being constructed by hardy colonials.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Cooper portrays legitimate political authority by
                highlighting the manly characteristics of the
                Revolutionary-era naval officers, and contrasting their
                plucky heroics to the fruitless efforts of loyalists to
                preserve traditional notions of fealty. His tale
                promotes the view that a republican government creates
                social conditions that naturally engineer meritocracy,
                ensuring the cultivation of subjects who will form an
                elite governing class. For Cooper, meritocracy bridges
                the historical and social rupture between traditional
                and republican governments&mdash;a gap in which
                conservative thinkers from Hobbes to Cobbett envisioned
                destructive social leveling, violent anarchy, and the
                eventual dissolution of the protective authority of the
                state. In contrast, Scott&rsquo;s 1821 novel <em>The
                Pirate</em> celebrates paternal government, and
                conflates democracy with piracy. Cooper&rsquo;s
                strategic fictional response to the association of
                virtue with traditional monarchical authority
                attributes improved values to the exemplary democratic
                citizens that serve in the Revolutionary-era Navy. To
                dramatize the way these improved values develop, Cooper
                treats friendships between men as productive sites for
                collective social activity. The emotions produced in
                these relationships bring out the best in men, and
                ensure that the group selects the most able for
                positions of leadership.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>By focusing on how men among men faithfully
                recognize the merit of one another because&mdash;as
                good citizens&mdash;they feel love, Cooper challenges
                disparaging views of early US culture and institutions.
                His depiction of meritocracy, manliness, and intimate
                friendship in <em>The Pilot</em> affirms a republic
                that did not become less civilized by breaking with the
                British Empire. The romantic story of naval adventure
                Cooper tells in his inaugural sea-novel stages the
                innate capability of exceptional individuals, who are
                recognized and rewarded by a well-organized republican
                society. According to this theory, meritocracy
                guarantees stable strata within the social hierarchy by
                ensuring the continued primacy of cultivated white
                males. Therefore love and merit take the place of
                traditionally exercised authority in Cooper&rsquo;s
                idealized democratic republic.<a href=

                <p>This essay compares the patriots in <em>The
                Pilot</em> to the adventurers of <em>The Pirate</em>,
                examining in particular the ways that experiences of
                emotion do or do not enable the social construction of
                legitimate authority. For both writers, political
                authority inheres in the body of the genteel white
                male; however, in the process of transforming the
                American Revolution into the subject of romance, Cooper
                revises Scott&rsquo;s attitude toward the emotionally
                autonomous hero. In Cooper&rsquo;s response, caring
                friendships provide charismatic military heroes with
                emotionally charged, institutionally interpolated sites
                to socialize subordinates, to make good collective
                decisions, and to romance women.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Scott sets <em>The Pirate</em> at "the end of the
                17<sup>th</sup> century" in the environs of a remote,
                dilapidated "earl&rsquo;s mansion" situated on a "neck
                of land" in the archipelagos stretching northeast of
                Scotland (Scott 6). High-minded buccaneer captain
                Clement Cleveland wrecks near this mansion, the adopted
                residence of his estranged father. Of course, Cleveland
                does not find out that the wealthy recluse and reformed
                pirate is his father until the climactic final
                chapters. After he is rescued by his half-brother, the
                dashing but amoral seafarer takes up residence with
                local aristocrat Magnus Troil and his two beautiful
                daughters. Munificent Troil holds his land according to
                the pre-colonial traditions of the island&rsquo;s
                Scandinavian population. Though Troil and other ethnic
                Scandinavians resist outside influence, Scott makes it
                clear that by the end of the seventeenth century more
                than two centuries of occupation has nearly succeeded
                in securing the cultural ascendancy of nearby
                Scotland.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In the 1849 "Preface" to <em>The Pilot</em>, Cooper
                narrates how his dissatisfaction with the
                representation of technical knowledge, nautical
                language, and seafaring life in <em>The Pirate</em> by
                Walter Scott prompted a literary response that
                dramatizes the patriotic exploits of mariners led by
                John Paul Jones in a raid off the coast of Britain
                during the Revolutionary War. But in addition to
                nautical verisimilitude, the nature of legitimate
                political authority is at stake in both works, and so
                in <em>The Pilot</em> Cooper adapts a scene from
                <em>The Pirate</em> that enacts a central problem of
                democracy&mdash;in popular governments factions form,
                and sap a state&rsquo;s ability to function as a
                collective unit. Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
                critics of democratic ideas often argued that without
                clear standards set by an exemplary aristocratic class,
                civil society must inevitably fracture into cliques
                motivated by regional prejudice and special interests.
                Factions, according to this line of reasoning, obviate
                the communal good that was the desideratum of much
                eighteenth- and nineteenth-century republican
                thought.<a href=
                "#3">[3]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>To reckon with this critique of representative
                government, in <em>The Pilot</em> Cooper imagines that
                republican meritocracy can keep participative politics
                from degenerating into a chaotic, drunken brouhaha.
                Concentrating on representations of manhood, affect,
                and status, I show how the council scenes in these
                maritime romances comprise a transatlantic dialogue on
                issues of individual autonomy and political
                authority.<a href=
                "#4">[4]</a>
                Different representations of manliness in these works
                demonstrate that the history of British and American
                republicanism is a history of efforts to manage ideas
                about manhood as well as race, class, nation, and
                commerce. In critiquing the reverence for a centralized
                political authority that Scott encourages, Cooper uses
                the manly sailor to legitimize his romantic version of
                republican meritocracy.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The Pirate council scene in <em>The Pirate</em>
                equates democracy with disorder. After the enigmatic
                buccaneer captain Clement Cleveland returns to his
                cronies after a long stay with Troil and his daughters,
                the leadership of this group of brigands is hashed out
                by two competing captains. The men&rsquo;s bodies
                narrate the difference between their characters and
                styles of command, and between the different sources of
                authority to which each can lay claim:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Black-haired, bull-necked, and beetle-browed, his
                  [Goffe&rsquo;s] clumsy strength and ferocious
                  countenance contrasted strongly with the manly figure
                  and open countenance of Cleveland, in which even the
                  practice of his atrocious profession had not been
                  able to eradicate a natural grace of motion and
                  generosity of expression. (403)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>As the contending commanders face off, the crew
                naturally divides into two factions according to
                partisan lines. In this drama of democratic feeling,
                the young men are attracted to the manly vigor
                exhibited by genteel Cleveland, while their more
                experienced peers favor the older Goffe&rsquo;s
                seniority. Operating outside the prescriptive
                procedures of an established civic order, the buccaneer
                crew cannot establish a clear order of merit; the
                captains therefore advance their respective claims of
                precedence before the entire crew in a democratic
                fashion.<a href=
                "#5">[5]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The hallmark of socio-political chaos in <em>The
                Pirate</em> is this unsavory, unregulated contact among
                members of discrete social classes. Unlike commanders
                in the Royal Navy, buccaneers in <em>The Pirate</em>
                must exercise their authority without the protective
                veneer of esteem that legitimate state power affords to
                those with elevated status:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  When Cleveland . . . found himself once more on board
                  the pirate vessel, his arrival was hailed with hearty
                  cheers by a considerable part of the crew, who rushed
                  to shake hands with him and offer their
                  congratulations on his return; for the situation of a
                  buccanier captain raised him very little above the
                  level of the lowest of his crew, who, in all social
                  intercourse, claimed the privilege of being his
                  equal. (402)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Here Scott stages the vulgarizing effects of social
                leveling, for the disintegration of hierarchy wreaks
                havoc upon the orderly functioning of the collective.
                Instead of giving authority to the truly meritorious,
                an egalitarian society distributes a little ineffectual
                bit of power to every man, and as Cleveland takes the
                hand of each of "the lowest" men in his grasp
                republican social relations transgress the genteel
                boundaries that protect privileged bodies from the
                invidious touch of a "clumsy and ferocious" class of
                men&mdash;in other words, those without manly merit
                (402).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Eventually the boatswain motions for "a general
                council in the great cabin" to decide the contest of
                authority; meanwhile the drunken revels of the greater
                part of the crew demonstrate that the formal structures
                of majority rule elicit base behavior (405). During the
                proceedings that will determine the fate of the pirate
                vessel, most of the ordinary outlaws take advantage of
                the "unlimited quantity of liquor" ostensibly provided
                in order to facilitate free expression. Lacking both
                the education and character necessary for
                self-government, they soon grow too intoxicated to
                participate and the consultation of the interested
                players takes place without any real public discussion.
                The narrator describes how the election process
                degenerates into mayhem and oligarchy:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  But a few amongst the adventurers, who united some
                  degree of judgement [sic] with the daring and
                  profligate character of their profession, were wont,
                  at such periods, to limit themselves within the
                  bounds of comparative sobriety, and by these, under
                  the apparent form of a vote of general council, all
                  things of moment relating to the voyage and
                  undertakings of the pirates were in fact determined.
                  (405)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Despite the customary provisions for a general vote,
                on Scott&rsquo;s pirate vessel the actual
                decision-making is confined to the work of a select
                "senate" formed of the most interested or privileged
                individuals (405).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Meanwhile "inebriation in all its most brutal and
                disgraceful shapes" takes its moral toll upon the
                masses in the form of vile oaths, imprecations, naughty
                songs, and pervasive "ribaldry"; thus procedures that
                are intended to facilitate public participation
                actually create an "earthly hell" on the deck of the
                outlaw vessel (405). Since some few of the crew realize
                that only the appealing Cleveland can persuade local
                merchants into provisioning their ship, they make him
                acting captain. Later, gentlemanly generosity leads
                Cleveland to insist that the crew reinstate boorish
                Goffe as commander.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In <em>The Pirate</em>, the democratic form is
                merely nominal, because the individuals who comprise
                the public are unsuited to&mdash;and uninterested
                in&mdash;political participation. Because these men are
                not fit to govern themselves, on the buccaneer vessel
                power becomes concentrated in the hands of a few
                uncouth men who achieve positions of authority through
                brute force rather than true manly merit. The group
                subordinates the claims of cultivated individuals to
                partisan feeling and self-interest, while the
                historical absence of statutory hierarchy leads
                inexorably to frighteningly chaotic political
                conditions. Scott&rsquo;s depiction of a rough pirate
                council confirms the social degeneration effected by
                majority rule, and empties political authority of
                meaning outside the structural mandates of the
                traditional monarchical state.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In contrast, in <em>The Pilot</em> the doctrine of
                charismatic manliness allows Cooper to locate political
                authority in deserving individuals, instead of
                attributing legitimacy solely to inherited
                institutions. The novel chronicles how youthful naval
                officers Ned Griffith and Dick Barnstable sail to the
                coasts of England during the Revolutionary War and
                discover their patriotic paramours housed in a
                crumbling Abbey with an aging uncle, a Carolina Tory,
                who represents an earlier age&rsquo;s devotion to
                England and to the defense of British imperial power.
                The adventure plot of <em>The Pilot</em> hinges upon
                the relationships these young naval
                officers&mdash;thoughtful Griffith and hotheaded
                Barnstable&mdash;form with the mysterious Pilot, John
                Paul Jones in disguise, who conducts a daring
                prisoner-taking expedition in order to bring the
                conflict in the North American colonies home to
                Britain&rsquo;s shores.</p>

              <li>
                <p>Cooper enacts the administrative logic of republican
                meritocracy most vividly in the council of war that
                follows the entrance of an enigmatic pilot into the
                shipboard community. Captain Munson gathers together
                the officers and warrant-officers of the frigate for a
                conference in the republican style; as suggested by the
                frontispiece to the chapter (drawn from Addison&rsquo;s
                Roman drama <em>Cato</em> "Sempronius, speak"), the
                council scene accentuates the policy-making procedures
                unique to republican hierarchy. Positing a hierarchy
                based upon individual merit at work on the frigate,
                Cooper intends to demonstrate how republican government
                cultivates personal worth, creating qualified leaders
                and a just social hierarchy to effectively manage the
                free exchange of ideas.<a href=
                "#6">[6]</a>
                On the American frigate, the officers gather around the
                conference table in descending order of rank. Some
                legible personal quality accounts for the position each
                man holds in the scheme. Commencing with the
                pen-chewing, plebian sailing-master&mdash;aptly named
                Boltrope&mdash;the captain gives each officer an
                opportunity to speak in an institutionally prescribed
                order that indicates the seamless correspondence of
                manner and skill with rank in each participant.
                Beautiful young Ned Griffith is, by reason of his many
                virtues, near the top of the chain of command aboard
                the frigate, and eventually the officers acknowledge
                the tactical superiority of the plan he proposes.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Therefore the war-conference on board the American
                frigate models how republican political procedure
                engenders meritocracy, not anarchy; with careful
                attention to prominence the mariners and soldiers act
                out civic exchange of ideas, culminating in the
                selection of the best plan of action by those officers
                with the most expertise. Because of the irresistible
                draw of meritorious individuals with institutionally
                validated authority, republicanism regulates the social
                and occupational worlds on the ship so well that the
                palpably genteel character and measurable professional
                skills of each man are directly proportional to his
                social and economic status. Democratically, Captain
                Munson proposes that "by comparing opinions, we may
                decide on the most prudent course"; and, in fact, the
                thoughtful first lieutenant suggests a course of action
                somewhere between the two tactical extremes recommended
                by Barnstable and Manual (Cooper, 77).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>After the lower-ranked warrant-officers offer their
                views, "The opinions of the others grew gradually more
                explicit and clear, as they ascended in the scale of
                rank" (75). Meritocracy and mutual respect make the
                correspondence of rank with ability entirely seamless.
                This council scene reveals the ways that republican
                ideals engineer the novel&rsquo;s fantasy of just
                statehood, of community formation, and of privileged
                male power by demonstrating how, in a republic, the
                system allows every man a voice. Moreover, in the
                institutional processes wherein constituents freely
                express their ideas, the group can readily single out
                for recognition those men with the best ideas. In
                <em>The Pilot</em>, Cooper imagines a system in which
                authority and merit coincide smoothly, so that society
                automatically recognizes and rewards manly
                merit.<a href=
                "#7">[7]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Manly affect holds the corporate group together
                securely, because each man perceives the worthiness of
                a leader like Griffith. As a result, charismatic
                leadership energizes the hierarchy engendered by the
                unique features of republicanism.<a href=
                "#8">[8]</a>
                After the meeting, Griffith feels compelled to question
                Captain Munson&rsquo;s unwavering trust in the
                pilot&mdash;a stranger they have plucked from an
                isolated stretch of coast. The aging commander responds
                by recurring to his professional seniority, saying "I
                have not your pretensions, sir, by birth or education,
                and yet Congress have not seen proper to overlook my
                years and services" (82). At this point the pilot
                intervenes, acknowledging Griffith&rsquo;s doubts and
                then dramatically relieving them by producing "a
                parchment, decorated with ribbands and bearing a
                massive seal, which he opened, and laid on the table
                before the youth" (82). Once Griffith realizes that the
                seemingly innocuous stranger is in fact the infamous
                tactical genius John Paul Jones," a glow of fiery
                courage flitted across his countenance" and he
                instantly swears allegiance to the legendary warrior,
                pledging "Lead on! I&rsquo;ll follow you to death!"
                (82). The pilot and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; exit arm
                in arm, leaving "Old Moderate" to his private musings,
                the very picture of disinterested liberal
                authority.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The scenario whereby the pilot wins the allegiance
                of the young lieutenant is reproduced along the chain
                of hierarchy, linking superiors, peers, and
                subordinates in a series of institutionally proscribed
                partnerships validated by experiences of intensely
                personal emotion. The pilot&rsquo;s virtuoso technical
                knowledge signals one form of merit, but due to the
                programmatic niceties of institutional conduct Griffith
                may require additional credentials as proof of the
                worth and status of the mysterious interloper. The
                token the pilot produces&mdash;it seems to be the
                endorsement of the French crown&mdash;alleviates the
                anxieties about power, position, and hierarchy that
                prompt challenges from Griffith. Manly merit,
                therefore, is irreducible to professional talent.
                Meritocracy depends upon charismatic qualities and the
                resultant legitimacy afforded to those who exercise
                power. Charisma engenders sympathy; since affection
                makes authority more palatable, the most approved
                leaders are those whose charismatic leadership cements
                the community of individuals into one feeling
                whole.<a href=

              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In <em>The Pilot</em> professional ability provides
                one obvious signifier of manly merit, but in addition
                to his technical skills, a bosun or coxswain in
                Cooper&rsquo;s revolutionary navy must possess those
                manly qualities that catalyze group affect within the
                unique conditions provided by maritime life, and
                according to genteel thinking the hard-working, moral,
                rustic characteristics of the regional type make such
                individuals well-suited to providing a unifying focus
                for social relations. The physical imagery Cooper
                employs in vivid descriptions of Long-Tom and David
                Boltrope, the sailing master, indicate that this
                charismatic capacity is another prerequisite for
                authority. Nevertheless, they lack an inherent quality
                of charismatic commanders&mdash;an ability to bodily
                convey an authority that other men will recognize and
                experience as legitimate.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In <em>The Pilot</em>, men learn to sympathize by
                emulating those they admire. When Long-Tom Coffin goes
                down with his ship, the entire crew mourns the loss of
                their beloved cockswain, but none with more feeling
                than his commander. As tears overcome poor Barnstable,
                Merry "sat respectfully watching the display of feeling
                that his officer, in vain, endeavored to suppress"
                (293). The lieutenant&rsquo;s tears elicit
                sympathy:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Merry felt his own form quiver with sympathy at the
                  shuddering which passed through Barnstable&rsquo;s
                  frame; and the relief experienced by the lieutenant
                  himself, was not greater than that which the
                  midshipman felt, as the latter beheld large tears
                  forcing their way through the other&rsquo;s fingers,
                  and falling on the sands at his feet. (293)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Republican manliness is not at odds with such
                unguarded displays of affect, for the "loftiness" and
                "pride" of genteel manhood are linked to virtuous
                performance of emotion.<a href=
                "#11">[11]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Most importantly, the didactic exchange enacted
                through expressions of shared feeling cements the
                already strong relationship the midshipman shares with
                his commander:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Merry had often beheld the commanding severity of the
                  lieutenant&rsquo;s manner, in moments of danger, with
                  deep respect; he had been drawn towards him by
                  kindness and affection, in time of gayety and
                  recklessness; but he now sate [sic], for many
                  minutes, profoundly silent, regarding his officer
                  with sensations that were nearly allied to awe. The
                  struggle with himself was long and severe in the
                  bosom of Barnstable; but, at length, the calm of
                  relieved passions succeeded to his emotion. (293)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>The attraction Merry already feels toward
                Barnstable&mdash;who not coincidentally is engaged to
                Merry&rsquo;s cousin Katherine&mdash;increases to
                something near "awe" through the throbbing pulse of
                sympathy. Silently the midshipman gives himself up to
                the "sensations" provoked by a combination of his
                admiration for and desire to emulate his superior
                officer. In this fashion, <em>The Pilot</em> depicts
                how love among men shores up hierarchy. This scene
                enacts the principle whereby men learn to negotiate
                rank and status by managing their emotions in
                accordance with institutionally prescribed standards;
                needless to say, if an institution enforces standard
                practices for the experience and expression of
                feelings, it likewise manifests a code of manliness
                that uses emotional behaviors to index the social and
                institutional values of behavior associated with sex
                and gender.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In <em>The Pilot</em>, bodies stimulate recognition
                of merit, whereas intimate friendship verifies its
                presence. Griffith and Barnstable are fast friends from
                early childhood, and the twists and turns in their
                affectionate but occasionally competitive relationship
                provides the work with several of its
                characteristically melodramatic plot movements. Both
                men carry a mercantile culture&rsquo;s version of
                pedigree. Additionally, Griffith is "gifted with an
                experience beyond his years" (18) and endowed with a
                natural authority that operates "like a charm" (338);
                he also appears "haughty" and exults in a fervent
                "native pride" (72). Barnstable, likewise, radiates
                that "calm authority, that seamen find it most
                necessary to exert, in the moments of extremest danger"
                and readily exhibits "that collectedness of manner, and
                intonation of voice, that were best adapted to enforce
                a ready and animated obedience" on the part of a
                trusting crew (273). <em>The Pilot</em>, however, is
                the penultimate manly authority in the novel; combining
                consummate professional skill and a "muscular form"
                with commanding mien to which others respond
                "involuntarily" (338), Mr. Gray successfully asserts
                himself as "One who has a right to order, and who will
                be obeyed!" (345).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>No single or central source of authority confers
                power and status in <em>The Pilot</em>. Instead, social
                relationships each produce unique conditions in which
                authority plays all kinds of constitutive roles. Like
                Mr. Gray or Griffith in <em>The Pilot</em>, Magnus
                Troil and Clement Cleveland in <em>The Pirate</em> are
                charismatic centers of authority; however, the brusque
                yet "honest Udaller" eschews most displays of emotion,
                while circumstances force the pirate captain to
                suppress his finer feelings and cultivate an appearance
                of ferocity. Despite very different political
                perspectives, manliness is the common ground for power
                and authority in both maritime romances. Cooper and
                Scott treat the charismatic male as the catalyst
                through which both collective identity and social
                hierarchy take form. And in both novels, affection may
                sustain hierarchy; intimate attachments to worthy
                representatives of power solidify allegiance to the
                abstract principles embodied in leaders. Yet for Scott,
                only avaricious self-interest provides incentive for
                <em>The Pirate</em> crew to follow their dashing,
                fearless commander. Troil holds the fealty of his
                tenants through tradition as well as force of
                personality; although his ample country feasts and
                paternalistic administration do secure the devoted
                adherence of his constituents, the power he exercises
                arises from the legal and cultural conventions that
                underpin his position in the local hierarchy.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>But in <em>The Pilot</em>, representations of the
                complex network of relationships on board the frigate
                and the Ariel contradict the Hobbesian doctrine of
                natural competition among males in Scott&rsquo;s
                narrative. Because this view of manly charisma
                discounts intimate affiliations among men as binding
                social forces, a character such as Cleveland cannot
                stand being indebted to Mordaunt Mertoun, the youth who
                has saved his life; "there is a natural dislike"
                between them, he avers, "a something like a principle
                of repugnance in our mutual nature, which makes us
                odious to each other" (Scott, 209). Of course, it turns
                out that the two men share a father, but they never
                achieve any kind of friendly relation or brotherly
                intimacy. For Cleveland, display of refined manly
                emotion proves troublesome and exerts no improving
                influence. While the picturesque work of the deep-sea
                fishermen occupies the residents of Burgh Westra, the
                elegant Cleveland reveals his history to his
                impressionable paramour, Minna Troil. Though drawn
                inexorably into the adventurous world of the
                unregulated West Indies, young Cleveland assures Minna
                that "my natural disposition has been controlled, but
                not altered, by the untoward circumstances in which I
                am placed" (217). While barely pubescent, undaunted
                Cleveland becomes commander of a privateering crew of
                "desperate fellows" bent on wreaking havoc on Spanish
                vessels. But his refined moral sense inconveniences his
                crew, so they maroon the principled buccaneer on an
                uncharted Caribbean islet.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In isolation Cleveland learns to adopt an "iron
                mask" of manly imperturbability as a "chief security
                against treason, or mutiny of my followers" (216). In
                order to safeguard the innocent and restrain his
                ignoble companions, he endeavors to appear even more
                terrible and inhumane than his subordinates by showing
                no emotion. Seclusion gives him time to acquire

                  more gently nurtured, and more civilized than they,
                  had made them envy and hate me as a being of another
                  species. I agreed with myself, then, that since I
                  could not lay aside my superiority of intellect and
                  education, I would do my best to disguise, and to
                  sink in the rude seaman, all appearance of better
                  feeling and better accomplishment. (216)

                  such a habitual command over my followers, that I
                  might use it for the ensurance of discipline, and for
                  relieving the distresses of the wretches who fell
                  under our power. (216)

                <p>Cleveland disguises his superior "mind, morals, and
                manners" because only the threat of savage reprisal can
                contain the depredations of his savage crew. In <em>The
                Pirate</em>, displaying "better feeling" will anger the
                mass of men rather than producing any refining
                influence.</p>

              <li>
                <p>In contrast, Barnstable and Griffith are sensitive
                to their crews. Exemplifying manly fortitude, they
                enforce discipline by winning the devoted admiration of
                their subordinates. No self-respecting seaman, hints
                <em>The Pilot</em>, could be anything but brave faced
                with the example of these worthy commanders; by this
                means republican institutions improve upon Hobbesian
                models of charismatic authority. In his writings on
                civil government, Thomas Hobbes claims that a society
                requires a single figurehead to organize individuals
                into a community. But in <em>The Pilot</em>, manly
                merit engenders intimate friendship, and affiliation
                among citizens becomes the cornerstone of authority in
                a republic. Therefore, Cooper treats the experience of
                being commanded as pleasurable; the powers of the US
                Navy to control and coerce are made legitimate by
                representing authority as the product of intimacy.
                Because it relies on love among good citizens,
                republican meritocracy readily provides ethical
                justification for democratic revolution. In the world
                of <em>The Pirate</em>, on the other hand, demonstrated
                worth might just get you stranded on a deserted island
                by jealous plebeians.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><em>The Pirate</em> portrays the provincial
                political structure of the seventeenth-century Orkney
                and Shetland islands nostalgically. It depicts the slow
                mainstreaming of the Norwegian ethnic majority, while
                <em>The Pilot</em> evokes the revolutionary
                transformation of a British colony into an independent
                state. In <em>The Pilot</em>, expressions of affect
                indicate the revisions to political subjectivity that
                accompany republican revolution because conditioned
                emotional response on the part of the citizen is a
                requirement for political participation. Sympathy and
                sentiment have political uses, not least because they
                allow men to explain the ties binding citizens to one
                another without exclusively locating those ties in the
                realm of economic expedience. For Cooper, the very
                reasons for communal identification and collective
                action reside in the affective drives and physical
                needs of politically empowered subjects.</p>

              <li>
                <p>The staging of sympathy in <em>The Pilot</em> may
                seem familiar to readers of Adam Smith.<a href=
                "#12">[12]</a>
                Unlike earlier thinkers, such as Shaftesbury, Smith
                does not treat sympathy and sociality as innate human
                faculties; for him, "fellow-feeling" arises through
                "excited" "fancy" and is therefore a product of the
                imaginative mind of the civilized subject (Smith, 48).
                It is also social, because "sympathy" is shared
                experience not of feelings, but "of the situation which
                excites" feelings (51). Potentially, "mutual sympathy"
                confers both pleasure and the power to perform
                concerted action since a man who seeks the aid of
                others "rejoices when he observes that they adopt his
                own passions, because he is then assured of that
                assistance" (54). The virtuous man with "proper
                motives" for his actions automatically</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Is in friendship and harmony with all mankind, and
                  looks upon his fellow-creatures with confidence, and
                  benevolent satisfaction, secure that he has rendered
                  himself worthy of their most favorable regards. In
                  the combination of all these sentiments, consists the
                  consciousness of merit, or of deserved reward. (165)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Merit, therefore, is present in the individual who
                inspires the regard of others. This is why Cooper ties
                merit to the love engendered by manly sympathy.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Smith sees recognition of individual worth arising
                in the social configurations that sympathetic
                situations create: "our sense of . . . merit arises
                from . . . an indirect sympathy with the gratitude of
                the person who is . . . acted upon" (148). Meritocracy,
                then, is about the emotions charismatic individuals
                elicit in other subjects. For this reason the "Grateful
                affection" of others is the best evidence of manly
                merit (148). Because mutual regard is the hallmark of
                fellow feeling, friendship both indexes personal merit
                and images the bonds that organize men into societies.
                In fact, according to Smith sympathy makes meritocracy
                possible: "Our whole sense, in short of the merit and
                good desert of such actions [those of Scipio, Camillus,
                Timoleon, and Aristides], of the propriety and fitness
                of recompensing them . . . arises from the sympathetic
                emotions of gratitude and love, with which, when we
                bring home to our own breast the situation of those
                principles concerned, we feel ourselves. . ." (149).
                Conversely, according to Smith patriotism originates
                from self-interest: "The state or sovereignty in which
                have been born and educated" naturally includes the
                self and also "comprehends" family, friends, and other
                attachments to loved ones (372).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Applying many of the same ideas, in <em>The
                Pilot</em> Cooper shows how republican meritocracy
                cultivates patriotism. The proof, the novel suggests,
                is in the heroes. Unlike the typical man Smith
                describes, the mariners of <em>The Pilot</em> revere
                "wisdom and virtue" and not "wealth and greatness";
                therefore Cooper&rsquo;s Americans bestow their
                "respectful attentions" according to merit and not
                display of affluence or status (Cooper, 126). Like
                friendship and other virtues, love of country proves
                merit by exemplifying the virtuous exercise of human
                capacities for emotional attachment. When authority
                figures exhibit affect in <em>The Pilot</em>, their
                subordinates learn virtuous practice of emotion. In a
                culture wherein "male" and "female" designate different
                regimes of feeling, these displays teach proper
                practices of gender because they also teach proper
                practices of emotion. As scholars of US literature have
                argued in the context of the American family, love
                turns out to be an especially effective mechanism for
                socialization and for the reproduction of hierarchical
                power relations. Manly friendship in <em>The Pilot</em>
                illustrates how the disciplinary powers of love and
                affection can fashion subjects in institutional
                confines as well as in the domestic sphere.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Thus admiration becomes the means for reproducing
                the system of rule among Cooper&rsquo;s republican
                mariners, and the loyalty individuals feel for their
                leaders guarantees good discipline.<a href=
                "#13">[13]</a>
                Through an admixture of love and submission that
                locates discipline and patriotism within personal
                experiences of emotion as well as in the institutional
                and cultural state apparatus, American men in <em>The
                Pilot</em> come to passionately follow authority
                figures. Genteel republican love for meritorious
                soldiers and seamen ensures the just administration of
                discipline on the part of the powerful, and secures for
                the elite the gratefully devoted service of their
                subordinates.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Throughout <em>The Pilot</em> Cooper is especially
                skillful at scripting the affective basis for
                authority. Intimate friendships demonstrate how a
                combination of attachments both to individuals and to
                principles solidifies and legitimates power in its
                patriarchal, institutional forms. Central to his view
                of the affect of authority is the charismatic male
                figure&mdash;physically arresting, knowledgeable in his
                field, and thereby in a position to secure the devoted
                admiration of others, Cooper&rsquo;s powerfully
                attractive hero can use his body as a focus for the
                emotions of a lot of people, whose attachments to one
                another are solidified by shared devotion to the hero
                and his principles. The mutual emotional attachments
                the charismatic man produces can thereby signal
                membership in a community of shared values and
                reciprocal affinities. From the isolated Pilot to the
                garrulous Barnstable, each hero exercises his authority
                largely because of the devoted love he engenders in the
                tenderly receptive bosoms of both comrades and
                subordinates.<a href=
                "#14">[14]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Because of the way that manliness grounds power for
                both Cooper and Scott, manly friendship provides a
                metaphor for US/British relations in <em>The
                Pilot</em>. The best example of Cooper&rsquo;s view of
                the relation of the US to Britain is the domestic
                pairing of an American and a British soldier who lead
                opposing armies during the period of border disputes
                with British-held Canada in the late eighteenth
                century. <em>The Pilot</em> ends with an epilogue
                describing the camaraderie of two characters, the
                marine captain Manual and British infantry commander
                Borroughcliffe, who eventually shack up together in a
                makeshift hut on an island in the St. Lawrence River.
                In England, the two men wound each other in a pointless
                duel that ends not with rancor, but with friendly
                feelings and vows of shared regard instead.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Years later, as their respective nations duke it
                out, the two men meet again and revive a military
                friendship based upon institutional values,
                affectionate respect, and a shared taste for Madeira
                wine. The comic parody of heterosexual domesticity
                represented by these two codgers implies the
                simultaneously contiguous and divergent nature of
                American and British institutions. The romance of
                maritime power in <em>The Pilot</em> works though the
                implicit suggestion that development of improved manly
                virtues among Americans signals the eventual doom of
                gendered principles of allegiance articulated according
                to inherited British models. However, while it stages
                the superiority of American manhood, <em>The Pilot</em>
                also points to the debt the young republic owed to
                metropolitan culture for acquired models of manliness.
                The politics of manliness in these maritime historical
                novels indicates that attitudes toward gender and
                sexuality permitted early architects of transatlantic
                white culture to represent the relations of the US with
                Britain dialectically. Ideas about gender and emotion
                that were widely shared allowed Anglophone writers
                paths into debates about more factious issues, like
                individual rights or the nature of political
                authority.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Recent studies of the interdependent concepts of
                race and nation in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
                fiction illustrate how narratives of racial difference
                helped writers to invent a symbolic cultural and
                political heritage for the new nation. For instance,
                Jared Gardner has described how, in the
                <em>Leatherstocking</em> novels, Cooper reconciles the
                republic with the culture and institutions of Britain
                by staging the disappearance of natives and
                African-Americans into an imagined past. However, in
                his maritime novels of the 1820s, Cooper uses manhood
                to depict the traditions and truisms of Old World
                politics succumbing to the irresistible force of
                republican pluck. Cooper&rsquo;s representation of the
                relationship between Old and New worlds hinges upon
                notions of masculinity as well as of race because
                enterprise and vigor are portrayed as key features of
                republican manliness. Cooper self-consciously presents
                a revised version of manhood and gender relations in
                order to justify the claims of his Revolutionary heroes
                not only to integrity, but to some degree of superior
                manliness over their British foes, who may be valiant
                but whose dedication to tradition prevents the public
                recognition of merit in enterprising individuals like
                John Paul Jones. In <em>The Pilot</em>, when men
                recognize worthiness in other men, the loving
                friendships that arise supposedly create a stronger,
                more stable state.</p>

            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="2"></a>2</sup> The variety
            of republican attitudes at work in the 1820s suggest that
            republicanism was a highly adaptable approach to theorizing
            the relationship of persons and communities to the
            state&mdash;one signaled by certain recurring themes rather
            than a system or set of beliefs. I use "republican" to
            refer to political ideas that both value representative
            government, elite or democratic, and emphasize a need for
            communal identity. In early nineteenth-century American
            culture, republican ideologues tended to understand
            political power as embodied in representative males who are
            endowed with authority by a constituency comprised of elite
            white property-owners, who in turn represent the aggregate
            body of society. For example, in no. 39 of <em>The
            Federalist</em> Madison sums up the "republican complexion"
            of government (242) as that endowed with authority "from
            the great body of the society" it governs (Rossiter,
            241).</p>

            for many served or sought profit in both Pacific and
            Atlantic spheres, and many more employed their skills in
            smaller local communities. The narratives of eighteenth-
            and nineteenth-century seafarers suggest that Atlantic rim
            culture is as constructed as local and national
            geo-political terms for cultural contiguity. Since maritime
            workers were a historical locus of transatlantic cultural
            exchange, then narratives about sailors provide an
            especially useful archive for excavating embedded concerns
            with the shifting configurations of citizenship and
            international relations. For foundational research on
            seamen of African descent and the spread of political
            ideas, see Julius Scott, "The Common Wind: Currents of
            Afro-American Communication in the Era of the Haitian
            Revolution," diss., Duke U, 1986.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="5"></a>5</sup> By the
            nineteenth century, the British popular imagination had
            long associated piracy with democracy; both could be seen
            as unruly systems without any established moral foundation.
            Christopher Hill notes that in the seventeenth century
            pirate "Captains were often elected, and were answerable to
            their crews; decisions on policy and disciplinary
            punishments were democratically taken. This contrasted very
            sharply with the despotism of naval captains, the rule of
            the lash, the ultimate possibility of a death sentence for
            mutiny" (Hill, 117).</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="6"></a>6</sup> Notably,
            Cooper&rsquo;s fantasy of revolutionary adventure imagines
            a maritime power the republic did not possess in the
            Revolutionary era or in the 1820s, although the US would
            achieve considerable sea power by the end of the
            century.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="7"></a>7</sup> Anthony
            Rotundo&rsquo;s <em>American Manhood: Transformations in
            Masculinity from the Revolution to the Modern Era</em> is a
            useful overview of changing ideas about manhood in the
            United States. Rotundo shows that in the later eighteenth
            century, intimate friendship between men was the norm in
            genteel circles. Recent studies of manhood and US print
            culture have applied the insights of Rotundo&rsquo;s work
            to more specific textual sites for the construction of
            masculinity. Most notably, in <em>American Sympathy</em>,
            Caleb Crain examines the relationship of sympathy to
            manhood in the early republic, and in the process shows how
            critics might productively view friendship among men as a
            site of possibility and complex negotiations of affect,
            rather than a reflection of the competitive relations of
            the market. My purpose here is to show how, for writers
            like Cooper, the dialectical emotional exchanges between
            friends also suggested one way to re-imagine the
            relationship of Britain to the US.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="8"></a>8</sup> Regarding
            the early republican fascination with charismatic males,
            Mark Kann writes that "Ultimately, the founders&rsquo;
            faith in the Heroic Man completed their grammar of manhood
            by promoting a patriarchal discourse that lifted up a few
            great men over the democratic masses and played down
            women&rsquo;s political potential as citizens and leaders"
            (Kann, 130-1). In <em>A Republic of Men</em> political
            scientist Kann analyzes the ways in which cultural concepts
            of gender, and especially white manhood, were deployed in
            federalist print of the early national era. Positing a
            cultural "grammar of manhood"&mdash;comprised of "the
            hegemonic norms, language, and rules they employed to
            promote public quiescence and justify leadership"
            (3)&mdash;Kann assesses the effect of cultural notions of
            threatening (non-heterosexual) manly disorder, family
            stability, civic virtue and heroic individuality on the
            development of citizenship and doctrines of political
            authority.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="9"></a>9</sup> In this
            manner, my argument differs from Margaret Cohen&rsquo;s
            examination of "know-how" in <em>The Pilot</em>.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="10"></a>10</sup> My
            analysis of the feelings of the hero draws from the theory
            of charisma and institutional bureaucracy articulated by
            Max Weber. According to his sociology of the individual as
            political fetish, the modern state routinizes gender
            inequalities through a "workaday" bureaucracy located in
            the mundane structural demands of economic activity; in the
            civic arena created by official bureaucracy, patriarchal
            social patterns formalize commercial relations and enforce
            the domination of a perceived "natural leader" in the home,
            the marketplace, and the sphere of civic activity.
            Weber&rsquo;s description of patriarchal authority
            emphasizes the historical connections of patriarchal
            authority to economic forces and statutory bureaucracy. In
            the Western political scenarios that Weber describes, a
            social group recognizes the quality of "charisma" in a man;
            this act of ascription legitimizes the privileged positions
            of charismatic individuals within the prescribed hierarchy
            of the "social strata" (Weber, 39). Weber claims that under
            the conditions of modern capitalism, most social
            institutions in the West authorize these forms of
            individual&mdash;almost always a male
            individual&mdash;empowerment by managing the system of
            social status and access to capital.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="11"></a>11</sup> Showing
            how later eighteenth-century poets used the "imaginative
            domain" of the "Atlantic theater" to represent "the
            connection between emotion and history," Julie Ellison
            argues that "the Age of Sensibility can by defined by its
            focus on the moments when consciousness dilates to
            historical horizons and when history is compressed into
            consciousness" (Ellison; 124, 141, 142). In a similar
            manner, maritime historical novels such as <em>The
            Pirate</em> and <em>The Pilot</em> relate individual
            consciousness to grand historical narratives through shared
            experience. In the romantic worlds imagined by Cooper and
            Scott, each man&rsquo;s affective capacities engineer his
            position within social and political hierarchies, and his
            intimate attachments to peers, subalterns, and authority
            figures become the basic components of manly historical
            enterprise.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="12"></a>12</sup> It may
            also be recognizable to scholars of nineteenth century US
            sentimental fiction. For literary scholars like Elizabeth
            Barnes, Julia Stern, and Lori Merish, in the eighteenth
            century philosophies of sympathy set the precedent for
            sentimental forms and rhetoric&mdash;a nineteenth century
            middle class phenomena with a unique incarnation in the US.
            In her examination of the ways that familial love
            intersects with seduction plots, Elizabeth Barnes
            illustrates how doctrines of sympathy could collapse a
            variety of emotional relations into the same forms in
            nineteenth-century novels. Stern uses her readings to
            describe the psychological underpinnings of connections
            between emotion, gender, and national violence in US
            writing, while Merish emphasizes attitudes toward the
            political and national subject status of middle-class women
            that make commodity consumption into a gendered practice.
            Following Nancy Armstrong, most feminists examining
            literary form in the early US emphasize the acculturation
            of British forms associated with the white middle class;
            for many of these scholars the literary relations of the US
            with Britain illustrate the relevance of British culture
            and especially print culture to gendered, political, and
            material practices in later nineteenth-century
            America.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="13"></a>13</sup> According
            to Enlightenment thinkers, this process of empowerment
            requires properly socialized national subjects, because the
            public must willingly recognize charisma in the men who
            exercise power.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="14"></a>14</sup>
            Interrogating the literary-critical tendency to idealize
            narratives of interracial male pairing, Robyn Wiegman has
            shown how these popular bonding narratives operate by
            "transmuting the narrative of racial difference into a
            scenario of the mutuality of gender" (Wiegman, 172).
            Despite the prevalence of this narrative convention in
            popular fiction and film, "critical discussions of the
            American [canonical] tradition have nonetheless debated,
            for almost half a century, the meaning, centrality, and
            utopian possibilities inherent in the image of closely
            bonded men" (172). Wiegman&rsquo;s thesis on the obsession
            of twentieth-century narrative with "symbolic marriage
            among men" is relevant to my study because her close
            readings highlight the ongoing relevance of theses about
            manliness, affinity, and sympathy in Enlightenment-era
            political thought. My point is that the cultural work
            assigned to same-sex friendship in eighteenth- and early
            nineteenth-century historical fictions eventually produced
            the discourse of sexual correspondence that allowed
            twentieth-century critics like Leslie Fiedler to theorize
            "democracy" in US fiction by pointing to scenarios that
            displace women and heterosexuality, and that use same-sex
            bonds to dissolve the historical and political problem of
            racial difference (149).</p>
