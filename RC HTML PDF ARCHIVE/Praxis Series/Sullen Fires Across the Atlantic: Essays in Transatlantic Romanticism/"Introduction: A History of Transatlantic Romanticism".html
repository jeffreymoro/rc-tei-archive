                <p>Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote in 1840 that "the fame of
                Wordsworth is a leading fact in modern literature,"
                calling the poet a "divine savage" and acknowledging
                that "Wordsworth now act[s] out of England on us...."
                Just as true was that Americans acted reciprocally on
                Wordsworth. As the poet noted in a letter to his U.S.
                editor, Henry Reed, the "acknowledgements which I
                receive from the vast continent of America are among
                the most grateful that reach me." He went on to
                exclaim: "What a vast field is there open to the
                English mind, acting through our noble language!"
                Wordsworth does strike a pose of condescension here,
                acting the part of the generous master. Nevertheless,
                it is clear that his sense of his own importance, of
                his significance as a public figure, is framed in
                relation to an international readership. He speaks to a
                community of readers defined not by a common
                nationality, but by a common culture.</p>

                <p>William Keach, in his contribution to a recent
                exchange on how to periodize Romanticism, argues that
                "all forms of merely habitual national one-sidedness
                (are) a serious barrier to critical advance" and that
                "the grounds on which we claim the continuing relevance
                and coherence of a &lsquo;romantic century&rsquo; need
                to be transatlantic" (31). This news is both old and
                new. For like Wordsworth and Emerson, the British and
                American Romantics took their movement&rsquo;s
                transatlanticism for granted. But despite the
                self-conscious internationalism of the Romantics
                themselves, most twentieth-century critics and cultural
                historians have attempted, in ways that are quite
                destructive of full understanding, to isolate discrete
                national literatures and cultures: English literature
                and American literature.</p>

              <li>
                <p>Critical nationalism has not been a matter of simple
                regression. After all, "English literature" was a
                Romantic innovation, part of the British Empire&rsquo;s
                invention of a deep past to authorize its newly
                acquired power. In <em>Walden</em>, Henry Thoreau
                describes his reverent absorption of that tradition:
                during his senior year at Harvard, he ignored his
                official studies and labored to consume Alexander
                Chalmers&rsquo;s twenty-one-volume collection of the
                British poets, claiming that he read it through
                "without skipping" (259). The power to command such
                attention, the cultural authority of British
                literature, was such that American literature, both as
                an object of study and as a scholarly discipline in the
                U.S., was invented both in opposition to it
                <em>and</em> by analogy with it.<a href=
                "#1">[1]</a>
                When the U.S. did eventually replace Britain as the
                world&rsquo;s dominant imperial power, American
                literature came to perform the same cultural work,
                providing a warrant for domination. Thus, during
                mid-century, the business of American cultural
                historians was to anatomize the triumphant "American
                Mind," with a special focus on its "renaissance" during
                the Romantic century. From time to time, influence
                studies appeared that recalled the responsiveness to
                British antecedents that afflicted even the most
                respectably original American Romantic authors. Not
                surprisingly, defenders of the national canon, like
                Perry Miller in his "Thoreau in the Context of
                International Romanticism" (1961), compensated for the
                resulting discomfort by asserting confidently that the
                canonical texts of the American Renaissance were the
                culminating achievements of Romanticism as a
                whole.<a href=

              <li>
                <p>The first sustained account of Romanticism in a
                transatlantic context came in Stephen Spender&rsquo;s
                <em>Love-Hate Relations</em> (1974), a book that was
                based on a series of lectures delivered at Cambridge
                University in 1965 and that set out to examine an</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  awareness felt particularly by writers (because it
                  has a lot to do with living within the language of
                  their birth) of the connection between their separate
                  existence and their country, in its history,
                  landscape and people. This awareness is of a life
                  which is that of an ideal United States or England
                  which the writer, if he is in a correct relation to
                  it, releases in his work. Unless he does have such a
                  relation, his work will be peripheral to that center
                  or turned inward upon itself. (xxi)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Spender argues that American writers formed their
                sense of the significance of their "patria" by
                "comparing their idea of European civilization with
                their own county&rsquo;s force and vitality. They
                either reacted against Europe or they gravitated
                towards it, but the shadow image of England and Europe
                qualified their attitudes to their own country and
                state of culture" (xxvi). Spender looks to the Romantic
                period for the origin these "love-hate relations,"
                arguing that while British readers were scarcely aware
                of American culture, the American literary community
                faced a "dilemma: the combination of political
                independence and cultural colonization" (8). As a
                result, that community was deeply divided between those
                who "regarded England and its traditions as undermining
                their freedom of development" (xx) and those who "saw
                America as deadened by its &lsquo;materialism,&rsquo;
                and Europe as the center of spiritual values." These
                attitudes could coexist in the same person. For
                instance, Spender describes Emerson&rsquo;s ambivalence
                toward his hosts during a visit to Europe: "he felt, as
                an American, &lsquo;almost an invalid&rsquo; when he
                compared himself with the English, although he managed,
                at much the same time, to feel that the English were
                aging parents of the strong independent American
                children who had left them behind, on their exhausted
                island" (4). Spender, with his focus on national
                identity as the definitive analytical category, and his
                almost mystical way of describing authors as uniquely
                constitutive and representative of that identity,
                articulates what had been common sense through decades
                of old historicism. <a href=

              <li>
                <p>Almost simultaneous with the appearance of
                <em>Love-Hate Relations</em>, Harold Bloom published
                <em>The Anxiety of Influence</em> (1973). Bloom&rsquo;s
                study does not specifically consider transatlantic
                literary relations, since he conceives of literary
                traditions and history as a matter of supranational
                interactions between individual authors. Nevertheless,
                his notion of "poetic misprision" elevated to the level
                of theory Spender&rsquo;s donnish comments on British
                oblivion and American anxiety. According to Bloom,
                strong poets construct fruitful misreadings of their
                forebears from whose influence they need to escape in
                order to discover their own individuality. Thus, the
                American Romantics were engaged in "a hidden civil war"
                with their British predecessors (12). This
                psychologistic narrative of maturation allowed for a
                schematic, even mechanical representation of
                transatlantic cultural relations. The process of
                American differentiation from the British tradition was
                isolated as the centrally important drama of the
                period, and came to be read as a family romance with a
                foregone conclusion. The study of transatlantic
                Romanticism was dominated for more than a decade by
                versions of this simple plot: influence, imitation,
                anxiety, rejection, and independence. The position
                received its most resolute, even absolute, statement in
                <em>Atlantic Double-Cross: American Literature and
                British Influence in the Age of Emerson</em> (1986), in
                which Robert Weisbuch describes what he calls the
                "American secret": "I believe that the American writer
                begins from a defensive position and that the
                achievements of British literature and British national
                life are the chief intimidations against which he, as
                American representative, defends himself" (ix, xii).
                Together, Bloom and Weisbuch, gave the weight of
                finality to the idea that American literature only
                becomes truly American, only achieves "independence"
                from the "burden of Britain," when its authors invent
                native forms capable of rendering the true character of
                a unique American experience.<a href=

              <li>
                <p>A closely related but significantly divergent
                position was mapped out by Leon Chai&rsquo;s <em>The
                Romantic Foundations of the American Renaissance</em>
                (1987), which articulates perhaps the most
                sophisticated version of the dependency and maturation
                hypothesis. Chai argues that "the American Renaissance
                [was] the final phase of a movement that begins with
                European Romanticism," a phase characterized by formal
                self-consciousness and even mannerism:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  After certain aesthetic or conceptual norms attain
                  the level of conscious expression...they become
                  fraught with extraordinary tensions that prevent the
                  possibility of their perpetuation. What so often
                  results might be described as a subjectivization of
                  those norms, that is, their externalization into the
                  medium of expression itself, and a simultaneous inner
                  transformation of their content and significance.
                  (xii)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>While Chai implies a reversed valuation of the
                process of transatlantic influence, like Weisbuch, he
                accepts the logic of national competition. And both,
                together with Spender and Bloom, reduce what is a
                complex process of mutual, but unequal, influence, into
                tautological narratives of individuation, either of
                whole cultures, or of their individual
                representatives.</p>

                <p>Three books, published almost simultaneously in the
                early 1990s, subjected what had gone before to rigorous
                reappraisal and set the study of transatlantic
                Romanticism on a definitive new tack. Perhaps the most
                absolute reaction against the nationalist consensus
                came in Richard Brantley&rsquo;s <em>Coordinates of
                Anglo-American Romanticism</em> (1993). In the course
                of an account of the influence of "the twin pioneers of
                transatlantic revivalism," John Wesley and Jonathon
                Edwards, on the "empirical evangelical methodology" of
                Emerson and Carlyle, Brantley argues that "the two
                national literatures are one." (8, 4, 6). Moreover, he
                turns a Bloomian narrative of maturation on the
                critical tradition itself, arguing that "American
                literature, now having come of age, having shed the
                &lsquo;adolescent&rsquo; insecurity that demanded
                independence from tradition, no longer needs to insist
                on complete separation from the literature of England.
                &lsquo;Anglo-American&rsquo; literature emerges as a
                valid concept" (1).<a href=
                "#5">[5]</a>
                Similarly, Stephen Fender&rsquo;s <em>Sea Changes:
                British Emigration and American Literature</em> (1992)
                applies a post-national perspective to "the rite of
                passage in which the experience of emigration was
                inscribed," arguing that it "contributed to the
                formation of [American] national consciousness and the
                literature which reflected and conditioned it" (13).
                Fender describes what he calls "the discourse of
                anglophone emigration," showing how it "underpins the
                very self-definition of the United States of America"
                (5). At the same time, the <em>discourse</em> of
                emigration played a central role in the self-definition
                of Britain, for "after American independence, during
                the unrest that followed the Napoleonic Wars, British
                progressives and conservatives began to inscribe the
                domestic debate for and against reform within an
                argument about the viability of the new republic across
                the Atlantic, and particularly about the wisdom of
                emigrating there" (10).<a href=
                "#6">[6]</a>
                Third, Paul Gilroy&rsquo;s <em>Black Atlantic:
                Modernity and Double Consciousness</em> (1993)
                fruitfully complicates Brantley and Fender&rsquo;s
                internationalism by emphasizing the central importance
                of the Triangle Trade as a force for cultural mixing.
                But in doing so Gilroy, like Brantley and Fender,
                overcorrects. Attempting to produce an antidote to "the
                tragic popularity of ideas about the integrity and
                purity of cultures" (7), Gilroy overemphasizes figures
                of hybridity, producing a utopian retrospective of the
                period that threatens to erase the substantial
                differentials of cultural power around the Atlantic
                Rim.<a href=

                <p>Two recent volumes have struck the fine balance so
                long needed, setting a new standard for empirical
                cultural analysis that is freed of nationalist
                distortions but closely attentive to the power of
                nationalism as one of the most fundamental structures
                of identity during the Romantic century. In
                <em>Transatlantic Insurrections: British Culture and
                the Formation of American Literature, 1730-1860</em>
                (2001), Paul Giles produces a cultural history of the
                period that, on one hand, speaks to the diversity of
                literary expression in English along the Atlantic Rim
                and, on the other, recognizes just how rigidly
                concentric that world was, just how solidly London sat
                at the center of the literary universe as it was then
                mapped both by the English, their subjects, and their
                former possessions. On one hand, Giles shows how "the
                emergence of autonomous and separate political
                identities during this era can be seen as intertwined
                with a play of opposites, a series of reciprocal
                attractions and repulsions between opposing national
                situations" (1). Giles dwells on "figures of mirroring
                and twinning," showing how "British and American
                cultural narratives tended to develop...as heretical
                alternatives to each other" (2). At the same time, he
                is careful not to erase the period&rsquo;s hierarchies
                of national power:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  To restore an American dimension to British
                  literature of this period is to denaturalize it, to
                  suggest the historical contingencies that helped
                  formulate the dynamics of Augustan order and imperial
                  control. Conversely, to restore a British dimension
                  to American literature is to politicize it: to reveal
                  its intertwinement with the discourses of heresy,
                  blasphemy, and insurrection, rather than
                  understanding that writing as an expression of local

                <p>This is the kind of sensitively historicist approach
                we need to understand the period&rsquo;s complex and
                fluid co-evolution of British and American literary
                cultures and national identities. <em>Transatlantic
                Insurrections</em> demonstrates the transnational
                interdependence of national cultures, showing that it
                is "easier to see what American literature embraces and
                omits by comparing it to British literature, just as
                American literature from a reverse perspective
                manifests itself as British literature&rsquo;s
                shadow-self, the kind of culture it might have been,
                but wasn&rsquo;t" (195).</p>

                <p>Richard Gravil&rsquo;s <em>Romantic Dialogues:
                Anglo-American Continuities, 1776-1862</em> (2000)
                describes the multivalent circulation of ideas around
                the Atlantic rim as driven by both broad historical
                trends and specific local events. The American
                Revolution provided an important catalyst for the
                crystallization of early British Romanticism and
                remained a touchstone for its later phases: "The terms
                of [British] political debate in the 1790s over France,
                and in the 1830s over reform, were set in large measure
                by the lines drawn in 1776: lines that were themselves
                predicated on that ancient fault line in British
                politics between Republicans and &lsquo;True
                Whigs&rsquo; on the one side, and Tories and Royalists
                on the other" (3). Radical optimism was quickly
                replaced by explanations for the apparent shortcomings
                of the experimental republic: "Romanticism, frequently
                viewed as an internal compensation for the failure of
                the French Revolution, is quite as much a response to
                the different failures of the American
                Revolution&mdash;its partial failure, in some respects
                to <em>be</em> a revolution, and its more lamentable
                failure, from an English standpoint, to bridge the
                Atlantic" (21). American Romanticism, then, is "a
                delayed variation upon the literary awakening
                occasioned in England by the loss of America" (21).
                Significantly, Gravil&rsquo;s book is one of the first
                to focus not just on demonstrating that there is
                substantial transatlantic continuity in the culture of
                Romanticism, but also on explaining why:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  What made the impact of the Romantic poets especially
                  powerful...was that in numerous respects the
                  situation of idealistic Americans in
                  1823-1862...involved preoccupations and expectations
                  strangely parallel to those of England in the period
                  1789-1819.... In America, Blake&rsquo;s
                  &lsquo;mind-forged manacles&rsquo; and his
                  slave-trading manacles fused together for a
                  generation appalled by the deadlock imposed upon
                  social progress by a Constitution that they had been
                  brought up to regard as the epitome of political
                  wisdom if not the work of demi-gods. The dark Satanic
                  mills, too, were now in evidence (xiii).
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>For Gravil, the flow of ideas and cultural
                formations around the Atlantic Rim follows the flow of
                modernization, and this insight grounds the
                spectacularly detailed historicity of his readings of
                the complex web of reciprocal literary influence:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Just as Hawthorne and Dickens engage in a symbiotic
                  exchange, with Hawthorne amply repaying his debts to
                  Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Keats by helping to form
                  the composite of fictional styles we know as
                  Dickensian; and just as Emerson assists Carlyle in
                  transforming Romantic insights into
                  Victorian&mdash;and then Nietzschian&mdash;forms of
                  Transcendence; so Whitman and Dickinson reshape and
                  re-equip the lyric tradition as it essentializes
                  itself in Tennyson, preparing the modernity of
                  Hopkins, Eliot, and Lawrence. (xix)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>In this mode, Gravil narrates a fully developed
                cultural history composed of multiple episodes and
                vectors of ideological exchange. And while his
                selection of texts may remain somewhat narrowly
                canonical, he nevertheless synthesizes the insights of
                the preceding two decades of revisionist scholarship
                into what will long be recognized as a benchmark for
                the field.<a href=

              <li>
                <p>Gravil observes rightly that a complete mapping of
                what he calls the "lost continent of literary exchange
                that our artificially divided academic community has
                yet to recognize and explore...is work for a
                generation, not for a book" (xix, xviii). This
                collection of nine essays, <em>Sullen Fires Across the
                Atlantic: Essays in Transatlantic Romanticism</em>, is
                a contribution to that project. However, <em>Sullen
                Fires</em> is bigger than the sum of its parts. These
                essays were produced by a cohort of scholars for whom
                the internationalism of literary culture is no longer a
                hypothesis, but an axiom. That is to say, these
                scholars have moved beyond demonstrating that
                Romanticism <em>was</em> transatlantic, to documenting
                and exploring the startling range of its
                transmigrations. They have moved beyond the simple
                notation of literary influence or ideological
                parallelism, and are now performing a new functional
                taxonomy of Romanticism from the fresh perspective of
                transatlantic cultural studies.<a href=

              <li>
                <p>As a result, these essays collectively shed light on
                one of the most fundamental, and largely undiscussed,
                problems in the field of transatlantic studies, namely,
                why there is such pronounced parallelism between
                nations, but uneven chronology, in the development of
                Romantic habits of thought. It has been usual to
                describe a delay of about thirty years in the flow of
                ideas from England to America. But the picture is more
                complicated than that. After all, republicanism
                achieved its first full flowering during the American
                Revolution, then crossed the Atlantic to reinvigorate
                English radicalism and inspire the French Revolution.
                But heroism and idealism crop up first in Germany, then
                find their way to England, and much later to New
                England. Similarly, the romantic novel took shape in
                Scott&rsquo;s hands as a literary technology for the
                authorization of English colonial dominion over
                Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. Then it was imported to
                the New World, where first it was used by Cooper,
                Sedgwick, Child and others to justify the displacement
                of natives east of the Mississippi, but then was
                adapted by Hawthorne, Stowe, and others to the
                rhetorical needs of feminists and abolitionists. It was
                finally redeployed by Dickens, Thackeray, and others,
                who used it to represent the brutality of class
                oppression in industrial capitalist England. In other
                words, romantic genres and structures of feeling moved
                fluidly back and forth across the Atlantic. And there
                was no typical vector of national cultural development
                that simply began at different times in different
                places.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The very expectation that there should be national
                and chronological uniformity of cultural development
                follows from narrowly idealist and formalist modes of
                analysis, from the habit of thinking about Romanticism
                as an episode in the history of ideas whose coherence
                inheres in a diagnostic set of discourses (idealism,
                exoticism, individualism) or aesthetic patterns
                (sublimity, exoticism, organicism). While it is true
                some thoughts and tropes were more central than others
                during the period, I would argue that they were central
                because of their substantial value to a particular
                class at a particular time in its development. That is,
                the core of Romanticism was the ideology and rhetoric
                of the British and American bourgeoisies as they first
                conquered and then began to exercise political and
                cultural power commensurate with their long burgeoning
                economic and social power. Romanticism began with a
                structure of feeling and a set of rhetorical strategies
                deployed by the emergent bourgeoisie to authorize and
                direct its political and economic ambitions, and it
                then evolved into the ongoing post-revolutionary
                project of underwriting that class&rsquo;s wholesale
                restructuring of culture and society in its interests.
                This was the central and most powerful current. But
                substantial eddies and cross-currents complicate the
                picture. Forces loyal to the residual feudal order
                engaged in cultural debate, subverting, inverting, and
                diverting Romanticism at the margins of the new order.
                Likewise, new revolutionary forces and radical
                movements&mdash;abolition, feminism, working class
                organizations&mdash;immediately began to appropriate
                and redeploy the bourgeoisie&rsquo;s ideas and
                arguments, directing their force against their creators
                in their position as a new ruling class.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Moreover, the economic and political transformation
                that Romanticism both responded to and shaped occurred
                in fits and starts, and this is what accounts for
                uneven cultural development. In North America, where
                the power of the crown was attenuated by distance, the
                bourgeoisie and its allies were able to take power
                directly and completely. In the British Isles, on the
                other hand, a long and hard fought process of transfer
                and transformation produced a system in which the
                monarchy now functioned more in the interests of the
                urban mercantile, commercial, and manufacturing elite
                rather than the landed aristocracy. Throughout the
                period, Romantic ideology was adaptively and creatively
                deployed by cultural producers from all classes, but
                always in ways shaped by this irregular and
                unpredictable process. Romanticism, in other words, is
                not a cluster of ideas or forms, but a period in the
                history of cultural politics during which the most
                fundamental structuring trend, the dynamic center of
                gravity around which ideas and rhetorics organized
                themselves, was the revolutionary emergence and
                subsequent consolidation of capitalism in the British
                empire.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>This materialist account is meant to establish a
                principle of coherence for the subject of this volume
                of essays, transatlantic Romanticism, but it does not
                delimit the critical approaches to that subject taken
                by our nine authors, who present a variety of close
                readings, generic accounts, literary historical
                approaches, and cultural materialist analyses. In other
                words, rather than impose an artificial unity or
                foreclose particular critical options, this argument
                about periodization is designed to ground an expanded
                range of interpretive possibility, enabling discovery
                of the full richness of this exciting field. That range
                is reflected in how the essays in <em>Sullen Fires
                Across the Atlantic</em> can be organized around three
                central questions: what is the nature of transatlantic
                cultural influence, how does gender operate outside the
                national marriage, and what is the future of
                transatlantic Romantic Studies?</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The first three essays demonstrate the substantial
                variability in the transatlantic circulation of
                literary nationalism. Sarah Ferguson-Wagstaffe sets out
                to unpack what has long been no more than a "critical
                intuition" by examining several "points of contact"
                between William Blake and Walt Whitman, two poets who
                bracket the long Romantic century. Rather than attempt
                to demonstrate direct influence, she focuses on formal
                parallels that mark them as definitively Romantic. Both
                adopt the stance of the national prophetic poet and
                both maintain a commitment to a "revisionary poetics"
                that demanded a "lifelong practice of revising their
                previously printed works." Each poet, as a printer, was
                intimately familiar with the "material conditions of
                producing and revising a long poem" through alternating
                episodes of "contraction and expansion," and each
                produced texts in which poetic troping of this mode of
                production served as a metaphor for the revolutionary
                transformation of the nation.</p>

              <li>
                <p>Sohui Lee reconstructs the literary nationalism of
                John Louis O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s <em>Democratic
                Review</em>, publisher of many of Nathaniel
                Hawthorne&rsquo;s short stories. At a time when
                American readers seemed to be in the grip of a
                dangerous "Anglomania," O&rsquo;Sullivan argued that an
                authentic national literature could counteract the
                anti-democratic propaganda of the nation&rsquo;s
                rapidly developing elite and strengthen the broader
                reading public&rsquo;s dedication to Jacksonian
                democratic principles. Crucially, it was in sentimental
                terms that he called for such a literature. Domestic
                fiction and sentimental poetry were the best means to
                cultivate the moral sentiments of "human sympathy,
                optimism, and brotherhood" that could "connect
                America&rsquo;s disparate classes and ethnic groups in
                a democratic community of feelings" that was
                specifically opposed to the "specter of England."</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>This powerful combination of democratic radicalism
                and literary nationalism shaped the output of many
                Romantic writers to be sure, but others were quite
                skeptical. Scott Harshbarger describes how Nathaniel
                Hawthorne and Robert Burns reacted similarly to
                Scottish and American nationalists who called for the
                appropriation of oral-tradition folklore to create a
                national literature. Both authors created subversive
                counter-narratives which draw on "the content and
                technique of folk legend...illuminating with a devilish
                light the complex relationship between demons,
                demonizers, and nation-making." Burns&rsquo;s "Tam
                O&rsquo;Shanter" and Hawthorne&rsquo;s "Young Goodman
                Brown" demonstrate how tales of the witch&rsquo;s
                sabbat kept alive belief in a sinister Other, which
                could be used to forge a unifying fear and hatred. Most
                importantly, both texts focus satiric attention on
                elite manipulation of folkloric materials to create
                social cohesion through hatred and scapegoating.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The second set of three essays in <em>Sullen
                Fires</em> explores the surprisingly complex
                intersections of gender and nationalism in
                transatlantic Romantic culture. If cultural producers
                interrogated and in some cases rejected nationalist
                appeals, consumers too demonstrated a good deal of
                autonomy. Cree LeFavour uses Thackeray&rsquo;s
                <em>Vanity Fair</em> to open a window on the chaotic
                and decidedly transnational U.S. literary marketplace.
                <em>Vanity Fair</em> is a parody of the sentimental
                novel and it enjoyed massive popularity during the
                decade following its 1848 U.S. publication. LeFavour
                argues against the position, common to those who study
                "women&rsquo;s nationally identified literary
                production," that the "antebellum literary world" was
                dominated by American women&rsquo;s sentimental novels.
                Instead, she argues that "the borders between
                &lsquo;genteel&rsquo; American-authored sentimental
                fiction, British reprints that fit into this category,
                those that didn&rsquo;t, and American originals not fit
                for &lsquo;ladies&rsquo; were constantly shifting." The
                way that reviewers praised the "realism" of <em>Vanity
                Fair</em> and expressed wry appreciation of
                transgressive characters like Becky Sharp shows that
                working and middle-class readers of the period were
                capable of real "sophistication and self-consciousness"
                in their consumption of "an extremely diverse range of
                fiction." In all, while literary nationalists attempted
                to forge a unified national culture in the antebellum
                U.S., both writers and their readers often tenaciously
                maintained their independence and internationalism.</p>

                <p>Jen Camden explores the cultural politics of what
                she calls the forgotten heroine, a little-noticed
                element of marriage plots that narrativize questions of
                national identity. Ann Radcliffe&rsquo;s <em>A Sicilian
                Romance</em>, Jane Austen&rsquo;s <em>Sense and
                Sensibility</em>, and James Fenimore Cooper&rsquo;s
                <em>The Pioneers</em> all feature paired female
                protagonists. In each case, the literal or figurative
                sister who demonstrates sense or reason is left out of
                a novelistic conclusion that rewards the reeducation of
                the sister characterized by sensibility or sentiment.
                But these forgotten heroines are not merely foils or
                "narrative loose ends"; they are "transgressive figures
                that...allow room for alternate subjectivities."
                Radcliffe&rsquo;s Emilia, for instance, operates as
                part of "a pattern of narrative violation [that]
                teaches us to be disappointed in the tidy ending."
                Through Emilia, who in the end chooses the role of
                tutor to the children of Hippolitus and Julia,
                "Radcliffe authors and authorizes an alternative to
                marriage." Similarly, Cooper&rsquo;s generous and pious
                Louisa "exiles herself from the marriage plot"
                embodying the cost of forging a unitary and
                aristocratic early national identity out of the
                disparate elements of frontier culture. Thus, while
                these novels concern themselves mainly with policing
                women&rsquo;s marriage choices and containing chaotic
                sentiment within the orderly structure of the national
                family, they also stage the forgotten suffering
                required to consolidate a unified nation.</p>

              <li>
                <p>If the figure of the forgotten heroine allowed women
                readers visionary escape from the domestic sphere,
                manly naval officers could demonstrate the power of
                sympathy to bind together a well-ordered republic.
                James Crane explores representations of male authority
                in maritime romances by Walter Scott and James Fenimore
                Cooper, showing how these two novelists engaged in a
                debate over the problem of political authority.
                Scott&rsquo;s <em>The Pirate</em> (1821) and
                Cooper&rsquo;s <em>The Pilot</em> (1823) feature "manly
                heroes who exercise authority through a personal
                charisma that operates ineffably on other men." But
                these figures are deployed to very different ends by
                the two authors. Scott celebrates paternal government,
                and conflates democracy with piracy, echoing the
                period&rsquo;s conservative critique of republicanism
                as a step on the way to "destructive social leveling,
                violent anarchy, and the eventual dissolution of the
                protective authority of the state." Cooper on the other
                hand treats affective exchanges between men as sites
                for the production of a stable meritocratic social
                order based on sympathy: here "men among men faithfully
                recognize the merit of one another because&mdash;as
                good citizens&mdash;they love each other so much."</p>

              <li>
                <p>The last three essays in <em>Sullen Fires</em>
                explore the rich cultural history of literary exchange
                between England and Latin America. In so doing, they
                expand the field of transatlantic Romanticism to
                include, as it should, the entire Atlantic Rim around
                which capital, people, and ideas circulated. Joselyn
                Almeida argues that "the Spanish American nexus that
                connected London, Kingston, and even Dublin with Spain,
                the Caribbean, South America, and Africa has been
                largely overlooked." And she sets out to demonstrate
                the workings of this nexus by reconstructing
                Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var&rsquo;s tremendously
                complex and canny self-fashioning for British and South
                American participants in London&rsquo;s multilingual
                magazine culture. Alternative versions of a
                biographical sketch of Bol&iacute;var appeared in the
                January 1823 numbers of the <em>New Monthly
                Magazine</em> and <em>Variedades</em>. Both articles
                were vetted by Jos&eacute; Blanco White, but the second
                acknowledges Bol&iacute;var&rsquo;s 1810 visit to
                London, while the first suppresses this image of the
                great liberator&rsquo;s political ties to imperial
                Britain. Similarly, Bol&iacute;var&rsquo;s "Jamaica
                Letter," written in Kingston in 1815 and published in
                <em>The Jamaica Quarterly and Literary Gazette</em> in
                1818, "aims to create a textual alliance between
                Britain and Latin America" and "uses the language of
                abolition as a critique of empire to gain sympathy for
                the Latin American cause." In short, Almeida
                demonstrates that transatlantic Romanticism will not
                have been fully constituted as a field until we
                recognize that because "intercultural exchanges cross
                linguistic borders" as easily as geographic ones, we
                cannot "invoke the Americas, the Caribbean, and the
                Atlantic, and ignore the crucial presence of
                Hispano-Americans, whom Romantic authors themselves
                acknowledged."</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>If the case of Bol&iacute;var shows a canny
                manipulation of audiences at the imperial center, Andre
                Cardoso demonstrates how the first Brazilian novels
                negotiated the demands of potential readers who "avidly
                consumed European novels." Joaquim Manuel de
                Macedo&rsquo;s <em>A Moreninha</em> shows that instead
                of being "an automatic attempt to copy the latest
                trends of European literature, the appropriation of
                foreign models by the early Brazilian novel was highly
                selective." <em>A Moreninha</em> narrativizes the
                circulation of cultural forms in its love plot, but
                "poking fun at the sentimental model is less a
                criticism of this model than a refusal to take
                <em>any</em> literary model too seriously.... The
                process of appropriation borrows from Europe a history
                for the genre of the novel, still virtually inexistent
                in Brazil by the time A Moreninha was published, at the
                same time that it neutralizes this history in
                presenting the Brazilian novel as a child who has not
                yet fully absorbed its education and is still largely
                free from the dictates of any tradition." Macedo
                represents the Brazilian novel, and Brazil itself, as
                spaces of simultaneous awareness and freedom "on the
                margins of the sea of international commerce, retaining
                its childlike innocence and originality, but at the
                same time engaging in an intensive interaction with
                European civilization."</p>

              <li>
                <p>Finally, Rebecca Cole Heinowitz describes how Robert
                Southey&rsquo;s long poem <em>Madoc</em> narrativizes
                the discourse of "good colonialism." This liberal
                defense of empire was most influentially voiced by
                Edmund Burke during the trial of Warren Hastings, the
                notoriously corrupt Governor General of India. Burke
                argued in terms "at once radically universalist and
                radically chauvinistic" that the violence of the
                British dominion in India, like that of the Spanish
                rule of America, resulted from the failure of greedy
                and short-sighted colonizers to see their fundamental
                "sameness" with the colonized. Southey&rsquo;s
                <em>Madoc</em>, makes a similar liberal critique of
                imperialism by telling the tale of the exiled Welsh
                Prince Madoc and his people, refugees from the invading
                English, who forge an alliance with the Hoamen against
                oppressive Aztec warlords. After overthrowing the
                Aztecs, Hoamen natives and Welsh settlers amalgamate to
                form a utopian new society. "By asserting that the
                natives of Aztlan had been British from 1170 onwards,
                Southey could legitimate modern British intervention in
                the area as having a reference point historically
                anterior to (and morally superior to) Spain&rsquo;s."
                By banishing the violence of conquest from the poem and
                staging cultural hybridization through the
                self-transcending union of Malinal and Madoc, Southey
                imaginatively replaces "the scene of desperate native
                betrayal by the Spanish with one of enlightened native
                collaboration with the British." In other words,
                sameness calls for benevolent rather than mercenary
                conquest. Once that conquest has been completed,
                sameness helps to explain the seemingly inevitable fate
                of the conquered.</p>

              <li>
                <p>In <em>America: A Prophecy</em>, William Blake
                narrates the opening moments of the transatlantic
                Romantic century: "The Guardian Prince of Albion"
                stares at the blood red light of "Sullen fires across
                the Atlantic" where the American revolutionary army has
                gathered. There, Washington reminds his compatriots
                that "a heavy iron chain / Descends link by link from
                Albions cliffs across the sea to bind / Brothers &amp;
                sons of America..." (5). A cataclysm of revolutionary
                violence follows, as it must, and Orc, the "lover of
                wild rebellion" (9), emerges from the dark clouds of
                war. Blake engraves him as a naked Adamic figure
                sprawled atop a moldering skeleton, looking confidently
                into clearing sky and singing a hymn to human
                liberation:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Let the slave grinding at the mill, run out into the
                  field:<br />
                  Let him look up into the heavens &amp; laugh in the
                  bright air;<br />
                  Let the inchained soul shut up in darkness and in
                  sighing,<br />
                  Whose face has never seen a smile in thirty weary
                  years;<br />
                  Rise and look out, his chains are loose, his dungeon
                  doors are open.<br />
                  And let his wife and children return from the
                  opressors scourge;<br />
                  They look behind at every step &amp; believe it is a
                  dream.<br />
                  Singing. The Sun has left his blackness, &amp; has
                  found a fresher morning<br />
                  And the fair Moon rejoices in the clear &amp;
                  cloudless night;<br />
                  For Empire is no more, and now the Lion &amp; Wolf
                  shall cease. (8)<br />
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Orc&rsquo;s revolutionary impulse is the driving
                force of transatlantic Romanticism. It shaped the
                political aspirations of the revolutionary bourgeoisie,
                aspirations voiced most influentially by figures like
                Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, William Godwin, and
                Mary Wollstonecraft. It also inspired the explosive
                insurgency of post-revolutionary movements for
                reform&mdash;abolition, women&rsquo;s rights, native
                American anti-imperialism, organized labor, utopian
                socialism, and more&mdash;that sought to broaden the
                horizons of freedom once the bourgeoisie had
                established itself firmly in power in the transatlantic
                capitalist world it had created. Thus, Orc&rsquo;s
                vision of liberation also structures the vibrant
                literary culture of a period marked by staggeringly
                inventive experimentation, with its declamatory calls
                for action on behalf of the oppressed, its sensitive
                delineations of human desire and subjectivity, its
                sweeping surveys of complex social orders and
                histories, and even its reactionary satires of
                revolutionary and reformist hubris. The essays in
                <em>Sullen Fires Across the Atlantic: Essays in
                Transatlantic Romanticism</em> draw nine transects
                through this exciting cultural field, nine lines of
                inquiry that intersect at a central point: the nation,
                the protagonist of both Romantic narratives of
                revolution and of critical narratives of Romanticism.
                Taken together, these essays demonstrate that
                transatlantic literary relations during the long
                Romantic century were far more intricate, far more
                nuanced, than a mere agon of national cultures.</p>

            British Association for American Studies. Tanner is mainly
            concerned to differentiate American practice from the known
            quantity of the European tradition. He observes that the
            Americans have an abiding sense of solitude in nature, a
            low regard for history, and, more surprisingly, that they
            do not have a "revolutionary social dimension," that is, an
            "energizing conviction that the poet&rsquo;s imaginative
            visions...could vitally influence and enhance the

            Another way of complicating the easy tale of American
            Romanticism&rsquo;s rebellion against Wordsworth,
            Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, and Keats has been to
            demonstrate that Emerson, Thoreau, Fuller, and the rest

            See also Giles&rsquo;s exploration of the term
            "transnational" along with his rereading of Emerson and
            Thoreau in the context of early national Anglophobia in
            "Transnationalism and Classic American Literature." An
            important complementary study of the way in which British
            nationalism developed as part of the rise of imperialism is
            Saree Makdisi&rsquo;s Romantic Imperialism (1998), which
            rereads the central Romantic poets in the context of
            developments in India, Africa, and the Arab world.</p>

            Several recent collections of essays have begun to explore
            the field mapped most thoroughly by Gravil. Comparative
            Romanticisms: Power, Gender, Subjectivity (1998), edited by
            Larry H. Peer and Diane Long Hoeveler provides twelve case
            studies of the true internationalism of the three
            analytical categories listed in the title. These essays
            make connections around the entire Atlantic Rim and beyond,
            with readings of American, British, German, French,
            Italian, and Russian texts. A second collection of essays
            from the discipline of comparative literature, this one
            focusing more narrowly on connections between the British,
            French, and German Romantics, is Gregory Maertz&rsquo;s
            collection, Cultural Interactions in the Romantic Age
            (1998). Also important for its accounts of the
            internationalism of both natural history and republicanism
            and their literary consequences is Revolutions and
            Watersheds: Transatlantic Dialogues 1775-1815 (1999),
            edited by W. M. Verhoeven and Beth Kautz. More recently,
            Verhoeven has edited Revolutionary Histories: Transatlantic
            Cultural Nationalism, 1775-1815 (2002), an impressive
            volume centered on the Romantic keywords, "history" and
            "nation." Finally, the first half of Special Relationships:
            Anglo-American Affinities and Antagonisms, 1854-1936,
            edited by Janet Beer and Bridget Bennett offers a valuable
            selection of case studies in late Romanticism.</p>
