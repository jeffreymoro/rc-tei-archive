              <li>
                <p>As Carol McGuirk has demonstrated, Robert
                Burns&rsquo; influence on nineteenth-century American
                culture (literary and otherwise) was pervasive. She
                goes so far as to compare Burns to Elvis, in that "mere
                celebrity has been transcended and cult status
                achieved" (137). This essay compares one of
                Burns&rsquo; most popular poems, "Tam O&rsquo;Shanter,"
                with one of Hawthorne&rsquo;s most famous stories:
                "Young Goodman Brown." Hawthorne&rsquo;s interest in
                Burns, the possible date of composition of "Young
                Goodman Brown," and the striking similarities between
                story and poem suggest direct influence. A comparison
                of the two works also sheds light on the strategies the
                authors developed in adapting folk materials in a
                critical milieu which regarded such appropriation as
                intrinsically bound up with literary nationalism. If
                literary nationalism is often intended to celebrate the
                native glory of an exceptional people, these works,
                drawing on the content and technique of folk legend,
                reveal the flipside of that project, illuminating with
                a devilish light the complex relationship between
                demons, demonizers, and cultural nation-making.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Although no critic to my knowledge has considered
                "Tam O&rsquo;Shanter" a precursor of "Young Goodman
                Brown,"<a href=
                "#1">[1]</a>
                there are several indications of direct influence. To
                start, all four volumes of Burns&rsquo; poetry and
                songs were checked out to the Hawthorne household in
                November of 1828 (<em>Hawthorne&rsquo;s Reading</em>
                46), the earliest conjectured year for the composition
                of "Young Goodman Brown" (Newman 333). Several
                similarities between the two works also suggest direct
                influence. Both Goodman Brown and "Honest" Tam
                O&rsquo;Shanter ignore their wives&rsquo; warnings and,
                heading into the night, witness a demonic rite
                performed by witches and presided over by the devil
                himself. While setting and action are similar, so are
                other thematic and narrative elements: journey,
                isolation, initiation, and a kind of strategic
                ambiguity, manifested on one level as a blurring of
                dream and reality. Wavering between skepticism and
                belief, the narrators of both tales leave it up to the
                reader to decide what really happened to Tam or
                Brown.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>There is no doubt that both authors were regularly
                attracted to folk material in fashioning their
                respective works. Born into a mid-eighteenth-century
                rural peasant class, Burns achieved a mastery of folk
                legend and song that positioned him to take advantage
                of a thriving Scottish nationalism.<a href=
                "#2">[2]</a>
                Set in motion by the Act of Union in 1707,
                Scotland&rsquo;s national yearnings, writes Marilyn
                Butler, help explain "why an apparently local writer
                using a provincial idiolect at once found a receptive
                audience, and why the conditions were right for him to
                become a <em>national</em>, that is a Scottish poet"
                (103). In many ways, Burns seems an embodiment of the
                developing eighteenth-century conception of The Bard,
                "a figure who," writes Katie Trumpener, "represents the
                resistance of vernacular oral traditions to the
                historical pressures of English imperialism and whose
                performances brings the voices of the past into the
                sites of the present" (33).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Presented to the literate elite in December of 1786
                by Henry Mackenzie with what Manning calls "an air of
                patriotic duty" (162), Burns would become the rustic
                darling of Scottish nationalists: "Burns&rsquo;
                subsequent exertions as a song collector in his own
                right sprang from a similarly motivated antiquarian and
                editorial desire to preserve and restore native Scot
                culture" (<em>Fragments</em> 162). Referring
                specifically to the Act of Union, Burns published one
                of his most angry songs in 1791, a year after composing
                "Tam":</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  O would or I had seen the day<br />
                  That treason thus could sell us,<br />
                  My auld grey head had lien in clay,<br />

                  We&rsquo;re bought and sold for English gold,<br />
                  Such a parcel of rouges in a nation! (17 - 24)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Burns&rsquo; resentment of English rule would only
                be exacerbated by the repressive measure taken by the
                central government to stifle dissent, including the
                banning of native dress as well as the deportation of
                resistance leaders.<a href=

              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Nevertheless, Burns was skeptical of the decades-old
                movement which, suffering military disaster in 1745,
                continued to call for armed struggle against the
                English:</p>

                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Though clearly opposed to English rule, Burns
                directs his wrath at his own countrymen: those who were
                bribed into allowing Scotland to become a province of
                Great Britain, as well as those who persisted in a
                movement that, receiving new inspiration from the
                French Revolution, encouraged violent resistance.
                Although Burns would always retain his faith in the
                Scottish "folk," he found himself increasingly at odds
                with both the political elite and its militant
                opposition. As Leth Davis and others have argued,
                Burns' ambivalent nationalism found expression in much
                of his poetry and songs, including "Tam
                O&rsquo;Shanter."<a href=

              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Much has been written on the longstanding connection
                between Scottish and American intellectual and
                political culture.<a href=
                "#5">[5]</a>
                Though writing decades later, Hawthorne, like Burns,
                came of age in a country dominated by nationalist
                ideology. Whereas Burns&rsquo; national sensibility was
                conditioned by Scotland&rsquo;s political domination by
                an imperial power, Hawthorne&rsquo;s was influenced by
                an America that, emerging victorious from the War of
                1812, set about expanding the franchise and enlarging
                the country. However, democratic empowerment would be
                limited to white males, and annexation of territory was
                accomplished through a brutal "Indian Removal" policy.
                "The metaphor of a peaceful nation which now turned its
                face toward the West is historically sound," writes
                George Dangerfield in <em>The Awakening of American
                Nationalism: 1815-1828</em>, adding a qualifier
                evocative of "Young Goodman Brown": "but only if one
                concedes that this nation was constantly looking over
                its shoulder" (12).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Born on the Fourth of July, Hawthorne would have
                many occasions to reflect on the uncritical celebration
                of the nation. Moreover, he would never forget that he
                was the descendent of two imposing figures of American
                history who brought the spirit of persecution to public
                service, one famous for violently driving a Quaker
                woman out of Salem, the other for helping to preside
                over the Salem witchcraft trials. Hawthorne&rsquo;s
                attitude toward the national government would perhaps
                find its most direct expression in his description,
                appearing at the beginning of <em>The Scarlet
                Letter</em>, of the "truculent" and "unhappy" national
                symbol presiding over the entrance to Salem&lsquo;s
                Custom-House. Though occasioned by his political
                removal as Inspector in 1848, the statement has a
                vividness that suggests the boiling over of feelings
                that had been simmering for quite some time: "She has
                no great tenderness, even in her best of moods, and,
                sooner or later,&mdash;oftener sooner than
                later,&mdash;is apt to fling off her nestlings with a
                scratch of her claw, a dab of her beak, or a rangling
                wound from her barbed arrows" (2-3).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Hawthorne&rsquo;s suspicion of public authority was
                complemented by an awareness that "the people" were
                susceptible to a variety of moods and manipulations, a
                fact evident in the many disturbing crowd scenes that
                appear in his fiction, from "My Kinsman Major Molineux"
                to <em>The Marble Faun</em>. Using Hawthorne&lsquo;s
                work as prime example, Nicolaus Mills notes that "In
                the midst of an era of nationalism and expansion [the
                classic American novel] reflects an abiding fear that
                in America democratic men are the enemy of democratic
                man" (12).<a href=
                "#6">[6]</a>
                Given his family history and the current national
                proclivities, it is perhaps not surprising that, while
                his closest friends became prominent politicians,
                Hawthorne himself cultivated an almost pathological
                privacy.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Like eighteenth-century Scotland, early
                nineteenth-century America sought to define its
                national culture by turning to apparently indigenous
                American folk sources. Influenced by Herder,<a href=
                "#7">[7]</a>
                such prominent writers as James Kirke Paulding, William
                Cullen Bryant, John Neal, Rufus Choate, and Henry
                Wadsworth Longfellow were among the those calling for
                an original American literature (Bland 78; Doubleday
                450). Delivering the oration at Hawthorne&rsquo;s
                graduation from Bowdoin in 1825 , Longfellow
                remarked,</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  We are thus thrown upon ourselves: and thus shall our
                  native hills become renowned in song, like those of
                  Greece and Italy. Every rock shall become a chronicle
                  of storied allusions: and the tomb of the Indian
                  prophet be as hallowed as the sepulchers of ancient
                  kings, or the damp vault and perpetual lamp of the
                  Saracen monarch. (qtd. in Bland 78).
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Indeed, around the time Hawthorne may have composed
                "Young Goodman Brown," Paulding, Bryant, and Neal
                attempt to create an authentic American literature by
                drawing on witch lore and legend.<a href=
                "#8">[8]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Although not embedded in the world of oral tradition
                in the same way Burns was, Hawthorne did have a deep
                and abiding interest in folklore and storytelling.
                Coleman Tharpe has argued that the oral narrators who
                appear in Hawthorne&rsquo;s novels, "represent a unique
                refinement of Hawthorne&rsquo;s earlier artistic
                experiments with the oral folk tradition, particularly
                his experiments with the oral folk narrator" (205).
                From his projected story collection, "The
                Story-Teller," to the evocatively titled "Twice-Told
                Tales," to the oral aspects of <em>The Scarlet
                Letter</em>, Hawthorne consistently evinced a
                fascination with folk tradition, and the power of the
                spoken word in its many forms.<a href=
                "#9">[9]</a>
                As Lauren Berlant writes in her discussion of
                Hawthorne&lsquo;s construction of a "national
                symbolic," "[the] early tales can illuminate the later
                national tales and novels: first, because they all
                center on a scene of oral transmission that
                demonstrates the tangled relations between discursive
                power and &lsquo;native&rsquo;-historical knowledge"
                (35).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Like "Tam O Shanter," "Young Goodman Brown" portrays
                the tangled relations between the author, the folk
                material he has chosen to adapt, and the literary
                nationalism very much in the air. However, as Frank
                Doubleday saw years ago, Hawthorne made a "significant
                departure" from the program of literary nationalism
                laid out by such writers as Rufus Choate:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  [Hawthorne] will not use the past only to glorify and
                  idealize it. Choate&rsquo;s motives are worthy
                  enough; he believes that historical fiction would
                  foster a corporate imaginative life and reassemble
                  "the people of America in one fast congregation":
                  &lsquo;Reminded of our fathers, we should remember
                  that we are brethren.&rsquo; He urges a selection
                  from the varied materials of history to achieve
                  artistic unity; but he urges, too, a selection in
                  which all that is regrettable in Puritan society be
                  suppressed. (451)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Doubleday sees in Hawthorne&rsquo;s story "P&rsquo;s
                Correspondence" the author&rsquo;s ultimate rejection
                of Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s celebratory form of
                literary nationalism: "Were he still a writer," avers
                the narrator of Hawthorne&rsquo;s story, "and as
                brilliant a one as ever, he could no longer maintain
                anything like the same position in literature. The
                world, nowadays, requires a more earnest purpose, a
                deeper moral, and a closer and homelier truth than he
                was qualified to supply it with" (qtd. in Doubleday
                453). Hearing the calls for a nationalist literature,
                Hawthorne would turn from Scott and, following a course
                closer to Burns&rsquo;, compose tales which reflect and
                comment on the problematic and ambiguous nature of
                nationalism itself.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>While some interpreters of nationalism regard it as
                a product of the Enlightenment and French and American
                Revolutions,<a href=
                "#10">[10]</a>
                and others find its roots in the Renaissance or
                earlier,<a href=

                most acknowledge the various contradictory and
                problematic strands of what would come to be one of the
                most potent and vexing forces of the modern world.
                While Herder and other eighteenth-century writers had
                advocated the progressive aspects of a folk-based
                organic nationalism, the subsequent histories of many
                nationalist movements have proven to be much more
                troubling. Regardless of their political motivations or
                consequences, nationalist movements require narrative,
                a story that endows the "nation" with some kind of
                authentic native authority. Several interpreters of
                nationalism have stressed the fictive aspects of such
                narratives. Writes Ernest Gelner: "The cultural shreds
                and patches used by nationalism are often arbitrary
                historical inventions. Any old shred and patch would
                have served as well" (66). However, as Anthony Smith
                points out, such "shreds and patches" only serve the
                nationalist story if they have emotional resonance.
                Their appeal, writes Smith, "has nothing to do with
                their &lsquo;innovative qualities,' let alone their
                truth-content, and everything to do with the traditions
                of popular ethnic myths, symbols and memories which
                nationalisms habitually evoke, and invoke" (83). By
                focusing on "the analogy between political Union and
                personal integration" Manning also relates political to
                personal identity: "In both cases, &lsquo;union&rsquo;
                is about narrative&mdash;telling a single story of
                nation or self&mdash;and about how the mind stabilizes
                conditions of flux sufficiently to realise the
                continuities on which such a story would depend"
                (<em>Fragments</em> 11). Burns and Hawthorne, I would
                argue, are less concerned with the literal truth of
                such legends than they are with their "emotional
                resonance," and the role such resonance plays in
                entwining the political with personal, for good or
                ill.</p>

              <li>
                <p>In "Tam" and "Brown," Burns&rsquo; and
                Hawthorne&rsquo;s explorations of the dark side of folk
                nationalism begin with their protagonists&rsquo;
                ignoring their wives&rsquo; prophetic warnings.
                Tam&rsquo;s wife Kate "prophesied that late or soon /
                Thou would be found deep drown&rsquo;d in Doon; / Or
                catch&rsquo;d wi&rsquo; warlocks in the mirk, / By
                Alloway&rsquo;s auld haunted kirk." (558).
                "&rsquo;Dearest heart,' whispered [Faith], softly and
                rather sadly, when her lips were close to his ear,
                &lsquo;pr&rsquo;y thee, put off your journey until
                sunrise, and sleep in your own bed tonight. A lone
                woman is troubled with such dreams and such thoughts,
                that she&rsquo;s afeard of herself, sometimes'" (74).
                Just as women play a key role in both tales so have
                they been crucial to the development of the nation
                state. Foya Anthias and Nira Yuval-Davis identify
                several ways in which "women have tended to participate
                in ethnic and national processes and in relation to
                state practices," in particular, as "transmitters of
                culture," "biological reproducers of members of ethnic
                collectivities," and "reproducers of the boundaries of
                ethnic/national groups" (7). The women in both tales
                represent an aspect of the social story associated with
                wives&rsquo; tales, young or old, their warnings
                pregnant with the events to come. Representing the
                homely, the familiar, the domestic on the one hand, and
                the wild and disturbing on the other, wives and witches
                symbolize the boundaries both men will cross on their
                wayward journeys. Writes Manning: "Goodman
                Brown&rsquo;s unstable allegorizing mind is polarized;
                to him his wife Faith <em>is</em> purity. He cannot
                allow her (in his mind) to have any connection with
                evil" (<em>Puritan-Provincial</em> 99). Faith&rsquo;s
                admission "that she&rsquo;s afeard of herself,
                sometimes" hints at her role in collapsing the
                boundaries of Brown&rsquo;s dichotomized world at the
                heart of Hawthorne&rsquo;s story.</p>

                <p>Impelled originally by the antiquarian Francis
                Grose&rsquo;s request that Burns contribute to a volume
                that would record for national posterity the various
                stories associated with Aloway Kirk,<a href=
                "#12">[12]</a>
                Burns dramatizes the profound effect of such stories by
                having Tam ride by various reminders of local
                legend:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  By this time he was cross the ford. . . past the
                  birks and meikle stane, Whare drunken Charlie
                  brak&rsquo;s neck-bane; And thro&rsquo; the whines,
                  and by the cairn, Whare hunteres fand the
                  murder&rsquo;d bairn [child]; And near the thorn,
                  aboon the well, Whare Mungo&rsquo;s mither
                  hang&rsquo;d hersel.&mdash;(89-96)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>The evocative specificity of these rural legends
                helps ground the story in local and personal
                associations: having come from an extended stay in the
                Tavern, Tam should be especially affected by the
                mention of drunken Charlie&rsquo;s legendary demise.
                The fact that such legends keep alive the victims of
                these rural tragedies suggests the kind of cultural
                haunting that Manning equates with tradition itself:
                "Tradition, like a ghost, is a mnemonic and an
                admonition to the present. A kind of platonic
                anamnesis, or reminiscence of former existence, it
                attempts to create and sustain a communal cultural
                memory in potentially hostile circumstances"
                (<em>Fragments</em> 167). Local, particular, and
                tragic, the incidents that Burns memorializes through
                Tam&rsquo;s ride foreshadow the even darker legend to
                come.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>While Burns seeks to reclaim a national tradition
                posed against "the potentially hostile circumstances"
                of English hegemony, Hawthorne uses the stuff of
                history and legend to formulate what Lauren Berlant,
                following Foucault, calls "counter memory": "the
                residual material that is not identical with the
                official meanings of the political public
                sphere&mdash;for instance, the material of popular
                memory in which public or national figures, bodies,
                monuments, and texts accrue a profusion of meanings"
                (6). What Mary Ellen Brown remarks of Burns and "Tam
                O&rsquo;Shanter" can be applied to Hawthorne as well:
                "Burns not only used legend content, he also recreated
                in the poem aspects of the legend context, the
                situation of legend exchange" (65). The power of such
                exchange hinges on intimacy and the potential for
                identification between speaker and audience. Such
                intimacy and identification is underscored by the
                narrator&rsquo;s observation that the figure Brown had
                arranged to rendezvous with in the forest, bore "a
                considerable resemblance to him, though perhaps more in
                expression than features. Still, they might have been
                taken for father and son" (76).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The invoking of kinship ties suggests a parodic
                inversion of the ancestral genealogy underlying many
                "proto-" or "primordial" nations.<a href=
                "#13">[13]</a>
                This figure, though "simply clad as the younger, and as
                simple in manner too" but having "an indescribable air
                of one who knew the world" serves as intermediary
                between the common man represented by Brown and the
                world of nations represented by "King William&rsquo;s
                court" (76). Manning finds such "familial analogies"
                essential to account for the personal and political
                dynamic involved in Scottish and American nationalism:
                "In both Scottish and American contexts,
                England-as-parent was the prior given which made it
                inevitable that separate identity would be articulated
                in resistance and reaction" (<em>Fragments</em> 22). In
                a post-colonial American context, such a father figure
                may represent the ghostly memory of the British
                monarch, or it could suggest the birth of an analogous
                authoritarian system. That he is not only a father but
                also a devil, intent on passing his snake-like staff
                down to Brown, suggests that Hawthorne is suspicious of
                any process that attempts to bind the common and the
                elite in intimate community through ties of blood, real
                or imaginary.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Ironically, and subversively, the intimacy the devil
                wishes to establish with Brown is based on stories and
                events that, while evoking Hawthorne&rsquo;s ancestral
                story, suggests nationalism&rsquo;s persecuting spirit.
                Some historians have attempted to understand this
                dimension by contrasting a liberal "civic" nationalism
                with its illiberal "ethnic" counterpart,<a href=
                "#11">[11]</a>
                the former characterized by "inclusive tolerance," the
                latter by "conflict" and "exclusion" (Marx viii).
                However, as Anthony Marx has argued, even apparently
                inclusive "civic" nationalism typified by England and
                America has its roots in state manipulation of
                religious conflict, involving the exclusion of a
                demonized other. To help explain this phenomenon, Marx
                turns to the political scientist Arthur Stincombe:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  [nationalism] is a wish to suppress internal
                  divisions within nation and to define people outside
                  the group as untrustworthy as allies and implacably
                  evil as enemies . . . It is on the one hand a
                  generous spirit of identification . . . a love of
                  compatriots . . . But it is on the other hand a
                  spirit of distrust of the potential treason of any
                  opposition within the group and a hatred of strangers
                  (qtd. in Marx 23).
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>In short, "To legitimate state rule requires
                cohesion of those included as a nation, against some
                other" (23). A "conceptual structure of polarities,"
                characteristic of Calvinism and "the psychological
                state it induces in the believer," (Manning,
                <em>Puritan-Provincial</em> 7) would also encourage a
                nationalism predicated on the conceptual necessity of a
                damned other. In "Tam" and "Brown" Burns and Hawthorne
                explore and critique this powerful narrative means of
                forging group identity through demonization.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Responding to Brown&rsquo;s claim that he was first
                in his family to rendezvous with the devil, this figure
                observes: "I helped your grandfather, the constable,
                when he lashed the Quaker woman so smartly through the
                streets of Salem. And it was I that brought your father
                a pitch-pine knot, kindled at my own hearth, to set
                fire to an Indian village, in King Philip&rsquo;s war"
                (77). Hawthorne uses legend-telling&mdash;a process
                which Choate and others wished would be used to
                buttress national glory&mdash;to enshrine the process
                by which societies cohere around the persecution of
                various others, here, Quakers and Indians. By having
                the Devil avow the role he has played in the Puritan
                settlement since its founding, Hawthorne is able to
                foreshadow the climax of the story by hinting at the
                kernel of social truth revealed through legend
                telling.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Again, moving beyond the mere borrowing of folk
                material, Hawthorne explores the rhetoric of legend at
                the heart of nation-making, a rhetoric which is most
                effective when insinuating, rather than imposing,
                belief. What would become a hallmark of
                Hawthorne&rsquo;s mature style&mdash;what Mathiessen
                referred to as his "device of multiple choice"
                (276)&mdash;can be viewed as deriving from the story
                teller&rsquo;s anticipation, and manipulation, of
                responses from a diverse oral audience. Brown cycles
                through a number of interpretations and responses, from
                naive skepticism to cynical certainty, while the
                narrator invites the reader to judge the ultimate
                reality of the story in any number of ways: "Had
                Goodman Brown fallen asleep in the forest, and only
                dreamed a wild dream of a witch-meeting?" (89) This
                medley of interpretation highlights the social
                construction and negotiation of "truth" within the
                various interpretive communities in which
                legends&mdash;and nations&mdash;develop.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>His faith in the wholesomeness of the community
                narrative seriously threatened by his encounters in the
                forest&mdash;not only with the devil, but with Deacon
                Gookin, the minister, and Brown&rsquo;s Sunday School
                teacher&mdash;Brown perceives a dark mass floating
                overhead. Full of "confused and doubtful voices," this
                cloud becomes a symbol of legend itself, along with the
                forms of belief it engenders:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Once, the listener fancied that he could distinguish
                  accents of town&rsquo;s-people of his own, men and
                  women, both pious and ungodly, many of whom he had
                  met at the communion-table, and had seen others
                  rioting at the tavern. The next moment, so indistinct
                  were the sounds, he doubted whether he had heard
                  aught but the murmur of the old forest, whispering
                  without a wind. Then came stronger swell of those
                  familiar tones, heard daily in the sunshine, at Salem
                  village, but never, until now, from a cloud of night.
                  (82)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Brown&rsquo;s perception of and participation in
                this dark cloud of voices reflects the content of folk
                tradition&mdash;familiar and strange, homely and
                sinister&mdash;as well as the unreliable but effective
                process by which it survives.</p>

              <li>
                <p>A number of folklorists have argued that folktales
                are largely the product of communal
                projections.<a href="#14">[14]</a>
                The same process by which an audience responds
                personally to folktale helps explain Brown&rsquo;s
                response to the murmuring cloud. Into this murky mass
                of imagined voices Brown projects his greatest fear of
                all: "There was one voice, of a young woman, uttering
                lamentations, yet with an uncertain sorrow, and
                entreating for some favor, which, perhaps, it would
                grieve her to obtain" (82). Brown&rsquo;s fate is
                sealed when his call for Faith brings "a scream,
                drowned immediately in a louder murmur of voices,
                fading into far-off laugher, as the dark cloud swept
                away . . . . something fluttered lightly down through
                the air, and caught on the branch of a tree. The young
                man seized it, and beheld the pink ribbon" (82). The

                the dark cloud of murmuring voices is used by Hawthorne
                to dramatize how conviction of utmost certainty can
                arise from the nebulous murmurs of the social
                imagination. More specifically, this incident
                foreshadows the loss, in Brown, of his faith in
                official community, and the narratives that support
                it.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Hawthorne underscores the intensity of Brown&rsquo;s
                growing alienation from the communal story by making
                him audience to a gathering symphony of perverse
                utterance&mdash;real or imagined&mdash;quite different
                from the whisperings of Faith that begin the tale: From
                the devil&rsquo;s laughter to the strange mumblings of
                the Sunday School teacher; to the "solemn old tones" of
                the minister and Deacon Gookin "talking so strangely in
                the empty air"; to the voice of a young woman "uttering
                lamentations, yet with an uncertain sorrow"; to
                Brown&rsquo;s response, mocked by the echoing forest,
                "crying&mdash;&lsquo;Faith! Faith!' as if bewildered
                wretches were seeking her, all through the
                wilderness"&mdash;all contribute to Brown&rsquo;s
                mental and social bewilderment (81-82). Brown&rsquo;s
                despairing exclamation that "there is no good on earth;
                and sin is but a name" (83) is followed by his own
                nihilistic laughter, which, echoing the devil&rsquo;s,
                prompts nature to respond in kind: "The whole forest
                was peopled with frightful sounds; the creaking of the
                trees, the howling of wild beasts, and, the yell of
                Indians; while, sometimes, the wind tolled like a
                distant church-bell, and sometimes gave a broad roar
                around the traveler, as if all Nature were laughing him
                to scorn . . . ." In a perverse form of call and
                response, Brown rises to nature&rsquo;s profane
                challenge: "&rsquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; roared Goodman
                Brown, when the wind laughed at him. &lsquo;Let us hear
                which will laugh loudest!&rsquo;" (83). The forest
                having become an echo chamber of his social despair,
                Brown is ready for his encounter with the remaining
                folk in the forest.</p>

                <p>Perhaps the most spectacular example of powerful
                legendary belief having no basis in actual fact is the
                conviction, held in Scotland, England, the Continent,
                and Colonial America that those dedicated to Evil meet
                on a regular basis to plot and celebrate the overthrow
                of all things good and holy. Writes Robin Briggs: "The
                stories of the [witch&rsquo;s] sabbat represented a
                fusion between the persecuting stereotypes elaborated
                by clerics and judges and the various older folkloric
                traditions of the peasantry" (32). She continues:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  The idea of secret meetings where orgies take place
                  and evil is planned must be one of the oldest and
                  most basic human fantasies. Charges of nocturnal
                  conspiracy, black magic, child murder, orgiastic
                  sexuality and perverted ritual were nothing new in
                  Europe when they were applied to witches. . . . The
                  stereotype is obvious; it consisted of inverting all
                  the positive values of society, adding a lot of lurid
                  detail (often borrowed from earlier allegations),
                  then throwing the resulting bucket of filth over the
                  selected victims. (32)

                <p>If nationalism derives much of its power by tapping
                into the same ideas and emotions associated with other

                the Witch&rsquo;s sabbath can be viewed as a demonic

                It is, at once, the opposite of the ruling national

                <p>Indeed, the witchcraft persecutions have been
                correlated with the rise of the nation state. Supported
                by the nationalist combination of elite claims and
                popular sentiment, the crime of witchcraft, as
                Christina Larner has pointed out, "went on the statute
                books, or became otherwise the responsibility of
                secular powers, at a time when jurisdictions were
                becoming more centralized and more rationalized . . .
                ." (205). The link between the rise of nationalism and
                the witchcraft of hysteria of the sixteenth and
                seventeenth century supports Anthony Marx&lsquo;s
                contention that early forms of nationalism require the
                identification and persecution of a reviled other.
                Although British nationalism was formed primarily by
                demonizing Catholics, "Sometimes, such attacks were
                directed instead against &lsquo;witches,&rsquo; with
                any form of heresy, non-conformity, or effect of blood
                seen as inviting of intolerance and treatment as
                scapegoats" (96). Through the witch persecutions, the
                role of women in the nation state as definers of
                national boundaries would be used to define the
                categorically unacceptable.<a href=

              <li>
                <p>In Scotland there would be even greater opportunity
                for using "witches" as scapegoats. Writes Manning: ". .
                . after the departure of James VI to the English throne
                in 1603 had deprived the people of a divinely ordained
                focus for their loyalties, the periodic witch hunts
                became a way of reaffirming defensively the precarious
                theocratic solidarity of the Scottish nation" (<em>The
                Puritan-provincial Vision</em>, 21). While
                Calvinism&rsquo;s polarizing tendencies referred to
                earlier would encourage a nationalism predicated on the
                damned and the elect, its foundational focus on
                original sin would also create lingering misgivings
                about any form of social organization rooted in "the
                people."</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>As Katherine Briggs observes, "In Scotland we find
                tales of the witches&rsquo; Sabat and more instances
                than in England of the diabolic compact" (326).
                Accordingly, Burns is able to provide a fully
                fleshed-out account of the sabbat Tam encounters:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  And, vow, Tam saw an unco sight!<br />
                  Warlocks and witches in a dance;<br />
                  Nae cotillion brent new frae France,<br />
                  But hornpipes, jigs, strathspeys, and reels,<br />
                  Put life and mettle in their heels . . .<br />
                  There sat auld Nick, in shape o&rsquo;beast;<br />
                  A toozie tyke, black, grim, and large,<br />
                  To gie them music was his charge:<br />
                  He screw&rsquo;d the pipes and gart them skirl,<br />
                  Till roof and rafter a&rsquo; did dirl&mdash;
                  (114-118; 120-24)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Employing the vernacular, Burns presents an
                emphatically Scottish scene, the Devil himself
                providing the appropriate folk music. In this
                depiction, the Scottish instruments, music, and the
                dance they inspire are put into service of a devilish
                celebration, wherein the national mind projects a
                parallel tradition of evil&mdash;the feared yet
                necessary other&mdash;through which the imagined
                community of Scotland may cohere.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>If, as Tom Nairn writes, "through nationalism the
                dead are awakened" (4), the process of such awakening
                often involves memorializing the hideous manner in
                which such deaths were effected. The role that folk
                tradition can play in such awakening is suggested by
                Burns&rsquo; catalogue of gruesome details:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Coffins stood round, like open presses,<br />
                  That shaw&rsquo;d the dead in their last
                  dresses;<br />
                  And by some devilish cantraip slight<br />
                  Each in its cauld hand held a light.&mdash;<br />
                  By which heroic Tam was able<br />
                  To note upon the haly table,<br />
                  A murderer&rsquo;s banes in gibbet airns;<br />
                  Twa span-lang, wee, unchristen&rsquo;d bairns
                  [children];<br />
                  A thief, new-cutted frae a rape [rope],<br />
                  Wi&rsquo; his last gasp his gab did gape,<br />
                  Five tomahawks, wi&rsquo; blude red-restued;<br />
                  Five scymitars, wi&rsquo; murder crusted;<br />
                  A garter, which a babe had strangled;<br />
                  A knife, a father&rsquo;s throat had nabled,<br />
                  Whom his ain son o&rsquo; life bereft,<br />
                  The grey hairs yet stack to the heft&rsquo;<br />
                  Wi&rsquo; mair o&rsquo; horrible and
                  awefu&rsquo;,<br />
                  Which even to name wad be unlawfu&rsquo;. (125-142)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Illumined by the coffined dead, the scene reveals
                the grisly content of many a folk tale or
                song&mdash;murder, execution, infanticide,
                parricide&mdash;along with the bloody implements by
                which these violent acts were accomplished. Examples of
                the kind of "cultural haunting" that, for Manning,
                suggests the disciplinary function of tradition
                (<em>Fragments</em> 167), such stories arouse and make
                available a variety of shades of fear and loathing,
                ready to inspire nationalist purposes not imagined by
                Herder.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>It is at this point that the heroes of both tales
                focus their attention on the female celebrants, or in
                Brown&rsquo;s case, inductee. Here the gendered aspect
                of the witchcraft hysteria comes to the fore,
                supporting the theory that the rise of the nation
                involves the reestablishment of patriarchy.<a href=
                "#19">[19]</a>
                The patriarchal demand for submissive women is
                reinforced by imagining its opposite: sex with the
                devil, one of the most striking legendary sabbat
                practices. As Anthia and Yval-Davis point out, "Women
                are controlled [by the state] not only by being
                encouraged or discouraged from having children who will
                become members of the various ethnic groups within the
                state. They are also controlled in terms of the
                &lsquo;proper&rsquo; way in which they should have
                them" (314). In projecting one version of the ultimate
                other, the nationalist mind imagines a form of
                diabolical sexual behavior&mdash;the ultimate in female
                insubordination&mdash;most threatening to the
                patriarchal order.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Although sex with the devil would have to qualify as
                something "Which even to name wad be unlawful"
                (Grose&rsquo;s volume was intended for a respectable
                middle-class audience), Burns does eroticize
                Tam&rsquo;s encounter with the Sabbath witches. In
                doing so he creates an ironic version of this aspect of
                the witch&rsquo;s sabbath, thereby revealing his
                ambivalent attitudes toward the nationalist project to
                create an unredeemable other. Drawing closer, Tam
                observes a particular young witch, whose short skirt
                turns him from shocked witness, to voyeur, to
                prospective participant:</p>
    
                <blockquote>

                  That night enlisted in the core . . .<br />

                  183-189)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>In a Burnsian twist on the sabbath legend, a mere
                witness to the sexually charged satanic ritual becomes
                a potential participant, the teasing techniques of
                legend-telling becoming a kind of foreplay leading to
                Tam&rsquo;s ejaculatory "Weel done!" Burns reveals his
                ambivalence to the nationalist project&mdash;or its
                mirror opposite&mdash;by having his hero be by turns
                repelled and seduced.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Suggesting his own ambivalence toward the
                nationalistic uses of a folk-inspired other, Hawthorne
                also has his hero witness or imagine his own Satanic
                gathering. Like Tam&rsquo;s encounter, Brown&rsquo;s is
                bathed in a diabolic light: "the mass of foliage, that
                had overgrown the summit of the rock, was all on fire,
                blazing high into the night, and fitfully illuminating
                the whole field" (86). The burning bush makes visible a
                "numerous congregation," which alternately shines forth
                and disappears into the shadows&mdash;the visual
                equivalent of the ambiguity of legend-telling.
                Hawthorne&rsquo;s sabbath is also filled with music,
                although here, instead of Scottish jigs, we hear
                Puritan hymns, but with a twist: "Another verse of the
                hymn arose, a slow and mournful strain, such as the
                pious love, but joined to words which expressed all
                that our nature can conceive of sin, and darkly hinted
                at far more. Unfathomable to mere mortals is the lore
                of fiends" (85). Like the strains of Burns&rsquo;s
                sabbath, this music provides a familiar means to a
                diabolical end. Although they may not seem as spirited
                as Scottish jigs, the Puritan hymns, when combined with
                "words which expressed all that our nature can conceive
                of sin," become a powerful "anthem" (86) composed of
                the sacred and the profane. Brown&rsquo;s encounter
                with the folk in the forest is analogous to
                Hawthorne&rsquo;s encounters with the light and dark of
                the folk imagination, a microcosm of proto-nationalist
                forces created and revealed through the "lore of
                fiends."</p>

                  Irreverently consorting with [the] grave, reputable,
                  and pious people, these elders of the church, these
                  chaste dames and dewy virgins, there were men of
                  dissolute lives and women of spotted fame, wretches
                  given over to all mean and filthy vice, and suspected
                  even of horrid crimes. It was strange to see, that
                  the good shrank not from the wicked, nor were the
                  sinners abashed by the saints (85).
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>To suggest the nature of such sins, Hawthorne
                details his own catalogue of crime, reminiscent of
                Burns&rsquo;: "how many a woman, eager for
                widow&rsquo;s weeds, had given her husband a drink at
                bed-time, and let him sleep his last sleep in her
                bosom; how beardless youths have made haste to inherit
                their fathers&rsquo; wealth; and how fair
                damsels&mdash;blush not, sweet ones!&mdash;have dug
                little graves in the garden, and bidden me, the sole
                guest, to an infant&rsquo;s funeral" (287). Again, we
                find a kind of "counter-nation," the symbiotic partner
                of the nationalist project, fueled by "lore," to which
                all are invited: "Welcome, my children . . . to the
                communion of your race" (86).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Whereas Both Burns and Hawthorne used the stories of
                the folk in their writing, and did not shrink from
                including the grisly and the grotesque, their attitudes
                toward such dark tales, revealed by the tone of their
                narrators, seem significantly different. Burns&rsquo;
                tale emerges toward the end of a career characterized
                by multiple uses of folk tales legends, and song. That
                Burns in many respects felt at home in this tradition
                is reflected in the rollicking denouement of the
                poem:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  The carlin [old woman] caught her [Tam&rsquo;s horse]
                  by the rump,<br />
                  And left poor Maggie scarce a stump.<br />
                  Now, wha this tale o&rsquo; truth shall read,<br />
                  Ilk man and mother&rsquo;s son take heed:<br />
                  Whene&rsquo;er to drink you are inclin&rsquo;d,<br />
                  Or cutty-sarks run in your mind,<br />
                  Think, ye may buy the joys o&rsquo;er dear,<br />
                  Remember Tam o&rsquo; Shanter&rsquo;s mare. (117-224)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Tam&rsquo;s tussle with the witches can be seen as
                parallel to Burns' encounters with the nationalistic
                implications of folktale: anxious, exciting, and
                frightening, the tradition had left its mark: and
                thereby hangs, or does not hang, a tail/tale.
                Nevertheless, that Burns could forswear his encounters
                with the folk is as likely as that Tam could swear off
                drink or cutty-sarks.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>While both authors were to contribute to
                nation-making by drawing on folklore, the nature of
                such folklore, and the hysteria it could inspire,
                inspired Hawthorne to create his own subversive tale,
                but with a difference: though Brown, like Tam, snaps
                the spell with an impulsive shout&mdash;"&rsquo;Faith!
                Faith!&rsquo; . . . &lsquo;Look up to Heaven, and
                resist the Wicked One!&rsquo;"&mdash;his is less an
                ejaculation and more a form of <em>national
                interuptus</em>. With his shout, the imagined community
                predicated on the exclusions of a distinct other ceases
                to exist. Since this is the only community Brown seems
                capable of conceiving, he becomes a "stern, a sad, a
                darkly meditative, a distrustful, if not a desperate
                man," so that, at the end of his life, "they carved no
                hopeful verse upon his tomb-stone; for his dying hour
                was gloom" (90).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Whereas Burns seems content to play with the
                dichotomies upon which the Scottish nation might be
                constructed&mdash;his hero comically impervious to any
                attempt to define a detestable other&mdash;Hawthorne
                seems much more worried by any project which might rest
                on such a strategy. As mentioned, such wariness was no
                doubt informed by the role played by his ancestor in
                the trial and execution of dozens of people during the
                Salem witchcraft hysteria as well as the dark forces of
                a truculent American eagle unleashed by a gathering
                Jacksonian nationalism. Hawthorne does respond to the
                call to use folk culture to propel a national literary
                project, but in a way that demonstrates an
                understanding of that culture far beyond that possessed
                by those calling for its simple exploitation. If, as
                Nairn writes, "the substance of nationalism as such is
                always morally, politically, humanly ambiguous" so are
                the folk whose stories can be manipulated to propel
                nationalist literary projects. Any writer&rsquo;s
                attempt to forge national worship through folk legend
                and belief is considerably complicated, and, perhaps,
                subversively inspired, by the strange and mournful
                tales of "folk" themselves&mdash;whether we find them
                in the jolly tavern, the Scottish Kirk, or a New
                England forest.</p>

            most of the sources Newman summarizes are literary, he also
            points to oral tradition: "The witch folklore transmitted
            through oral tradition is difficult to document, yet during
            the course of growing up in the environs of Salem,

            works, and his articulated views on the function of
            composition&mdash;all suggest Burns&rsquo; strong and
