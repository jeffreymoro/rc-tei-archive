                <p>James Fenimore Cooper&rsquo;s <em>The Pioneers</em>
                (1823) almost ends with the marriage of the hero and
                heroine, Edward Oliver Effingham<a href=
                "#1">[1]</a>
                and Bess Temple--almost ends, but doesn&rsquo;t.
                Instead, the last chapter begins with Bess and Oliver
                walking towards the graveyard, discussing their future.
                When Oliver fails to guess Bess&rsquo;s plans, she
                replies: "Do you forget Louisa, and her father?" (448).
                In the exchange that follows, their badinage over
                Louisa&rsquo;s future frequently repeats that phrase:
                "you forget Louisa." As Oliver and Bess debate, readers
                are reminded that they have forgotten Louisa. Indeed,
                Cooper appears to have forgotten Louisa &mdash; she has
                not appeared since she refused to return to the
                mountain with Bess. Although Louisa attracts
                readers&rsquo; attention early in the novel, by the end
                she has faded from view, her heroic status replaced by
                Bess, the consummate "American girl." In this respect,
                Louisa functions as what I term a secondary
                heroine.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In this essay, I locate the erasure and then the
                return of Louisa as part of a larger narrative pattern
                of forgetting in the nineteenth-century novel.
                Specifically, I examine Ann Radcliffe&rsquo;s <em>A
                Sicilian Romance</em> (1790), Jane Austen&rsquo;s
                <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> (1811), and <em>The
                Pioneers</em> to argue that each novel "forgets" a
                heroine, only to have her return at the end in a
                puzzling and uncanny "return of the repressed." Rather
                than understanding this return in psychoanalytic terms,
                however, I examine these heroines in terms of competing
                ideals of national identity and femininity.
                Specifically, I show that the primary heroines in these
                novels represent a socially-visible "sensibility" that
                represses the more invisible "sense" represented by the
                secondary heroines. In turn, these novels evoke
                readers&rsquo; sensibilities, either to enforce or, in
                the case of Austen, to question the role of sensibility
                in shaping the national identities of England and
                America through literary heroines. In this way, I
                demonstrate that the transatlantic transmission of the
                figure of the forgotten heroine <a href=
                "#2">[2]</a>
                is illustrative of the cultural work performed by the
                novel as a genre in both England and America.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Several literary and historical narratives link the
                novels that I examine, most importantly, the cult of
                sensibility, the Gothic, and the marriage plot. The
                secondary heroine provides a way to locate these
                organizing narratives intertextually. While the primary
                heroines of Radcliffe, Austen and Cooper&rsquo;s novels
                each possess sensibility, brave a form of the Gothic,
                and end happily married, the secondary heroine in each
                of these novels illuminates the work of sensibility,
                the Gothic and the marriage plot in stabilizing
                constructions of femininity and national identity and
                suggests, quite literally, the cost of sensibility.
                These secondary heroines suffer because of their lack
                of independent financial resources; they make visible
                the structure of wealth girding the nation, but masked
                by the sensibility of primary heroines. These secondary
                heroines respond to the overwhelming ideological power
                of sensibility by insisting that we remember the
                ordinary.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>It has been common in recent years to study both
                British and American early novels in terms of the
                impact of the cult of sensibility on the history of the
                novel. Robert Jones opens his review of five recent
                books on this subject by remarking: "Earlier
                conceptions of sensibility as a particular literary,
                artistic or social mode--most often described as the
                &lsquo;cult&rsquo; of sensibility &mdash; have given
                way to a history of the late eighteenth century that
                regards sensibility as the animating force for the
                whole period" (395). Recent considerations of
                sympathy,<a href=
                "#3">[3]</a>
                such as Audrey Jaffe&rsquo;s <em>Scenes of Sympathy:
                Identity and Representation in Victorian Fiction</em>
                (2000) or Kristin Boudreau&rsquo;s <em>Sympathy in
                American Literature: American Sentiments from Jefferson
                to the Jameses</em> (2002), extend the influence of
                sensibility well into the nineteenth-century. These
                scholars and others have uncovered the ways authors
                narrate the spectacle of suffering to provoke sympathy
                in characters and readers alike, and then use that
                sympathetic response to cement national identity or
                reshape social policies.<a href=
                "#4">[4]</a>
                However, attention to this spectacle, this scene of
                sympathy, has obscured the role of the secondary
                heroine. In both British and American Romantic novels,
                the heroine of sensibility embodies national ideals
                that the ideal reader internalizes via sympathy. This
                narrative strategy connects the British and American
                literary traditions through the cult of sensibility. In
                contrast, the secondary heroine&rsquo;s lack of
                sensibility limits readers&rsquo; sympathy for her
                character and thus, at least initially, for the
                alternative possibilities of nationhood and womanhood
                she represents.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Before turning to the secondary heroine, I want
                briefly to follow the trajectory of the primary heroine
                in the three novels (and three genres) I consider in
                this essay. In the Gothic novel, the reader watches the
                heroine of sensibility appreciate the beauty of a piece
                of music or a picturesque scene and, through sympathy
                with her, learns to value that aesthetic. The Gothic
                plot disrupts these scenes of sensibility, but we
                return to them once the Gothic mystery has been
                resolved. The Gothic plot, therefore, serves as both
                interruption and test for the heroine of sensibility,
                and she is rewarded by the restoration of order,
                implicit in the return to the pastoral, and by the
                resolution of the marriage plot in favor of the hero of
                sensibility who shares her aesthetic tastes.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In the nineteenth-century novel, we see British and
                American authors incorporating heroines of sensibility
                to very different nationalist ends. In England, as we
                see in <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>, the
                narrator&rsquo;s ironic distance from the marriage
                plots illuminates the excessive sensibility of the
                protagonists and calls into question the possibility of
                true sympathy. By setting her novel in a very familiar
                English landscape, Austen offers a sort of test case
                that asks how the sensibility endorsed by the
                eighteenth-century novel fares in quotidian England. In
                <em>The Pioneers</em>, Cooper&rsquo;s heroine, Bess, is
                the heroine of sensibility who rightly appreciates the
                beauty of the American landscape and is able to respond
                appropriately to scenes of distress. However, Bess also
                establishes American domesticity through her management
                of Judge Temple&rsquo;s house and his wayward
                subordinates and in her marriage to Oliver Edwards. In
                this way, Cooper establishes a new American sensibility
                able to face both the wilderness and the management of
                the hearth.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>By writing a historical romance, Cooper is also
                clearly indebted to Sir Walter Scott, whose Waverly
                novels first appeared in 1814, three years after the
                publication of <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> and nine
                years prior to <em>The Pioneers</em>. In this essay, I
                focus on Cooper&rsquo;s less-studied debt to Austen to
                understand the significance of the cult of sensibility
                to the development of the novel and the nation. In
                Radcliffe and Austen, the heroines are sisters,
                ensuring a common biological background; the difference
                between each heroine is one of sensibility.<a href=
                "#5">[5]</a>
                While Cooper insists that Louisa and Bess are different
                &mdash; both emotionally and biologically &mdash;
                Louisa&rsquo;s social status is the key marker of
                difference. Cooper&rsquo;s focus on the class identity
                of his heroines connects his version of the historical
                romance to Austen.<a href=
                "#6">[6]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The secondary heroines I examine in this article
                &mdash; Emilia, Elinor and Louisa &mdash; receive
                little sympathy from their sister heroines of
                sensibility. Radcliffe and Cooper intentionally limit
                readers&rsquo; sympathy for these figures in order to
                consolidate national identity under the auspices of the
                heroine of sensibility, but in doing so reveal the ways
                that sensibility masks the link between money and
                matrimony.<a href=
                "#7">[7]</a>
                While Radcliffe and Cooper deploy very similar
                strategies of "forgetting" in the undomesticated
                landscapes of the Gothic and the American frontier,
                Austen reveals the limits of sensibility by giving
                narrative weight to pragmatic Elinor as well as to the
                more effusive Marianne. In Austen&rsquo;s novel, the
                reader is encouraged to have sympathy for Elinor at
                least in part because Marianne and the other figures of
                sensibility do not. In reimagining the British domestic
                within the borders of home, Austen refigures the
                marriage plot to value the quotidian. Austen occupies a
                pivotal point in my argument: a point where British and
                American traditions divide. Austen&rsquo;s valorization
                of the domestic is often located as a point of origin
                for the British realist novel.<a href=
                "#8">[8]</a>
                In the American tradition, Cooper responds to Austen by
                deliberately forgetting the secondary heroine in order
                to shore up the nationalist project of the historical
                romance. By forgetting the secondary heroine, Cooper
                attempts to create a new point of origin for the
                American novel.</p>
    
                <h4>Domestic Sense and Italian Sensibility in A
                Sicilian Romance</h4>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Whether with respect or derision, the nineteenth
                century looked back to "Mrs. Radcliffe," or "Mother
                Radcliffe," as Keats called her, as the exemplary
                author of the Gothic novel. It has become a critical
                commonplace to name Radcliffe the founder of a form of
                "female Gothic," though the scope of definitions of
                this term is as dizzying as the landscapes of her
                novels. E. J. Clery traces the origin of the phrase
                back to Ellen Moers in <em>Literary Women</em>,
                suggesting that Moers coined the term "in order to
                reveal a tradition of women&rsquo;s writing, an
                alternative canon; by it, she meant simply &lsquo;the
                work that women have done in the literary mode that,
                since the eighteenth century, we have called the
                Gothic&rsquo;" (qtd. in Clery, "Ann Radcliffe," 203).
                Clery rightly continues to question the accumulated
                connotations now surrounding Moer&rsquo;s coinage in
                order to raise the central question of her argument:
                "Why a heroine?" (203). The question raised by <em>A
                Sicilian Romance</em>, however, is why
                <em>two</em>?</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Traditionally these sisters, Emilia and Julia, have
                been read as representations of sense and
                sensibility,<a href=
                "#9">[9]</a>
                with Emilia&rsquo;s "sense" quickly dismissed to focus
                on the education of Julia&rsquo;s sensibility. Though
                Julia certainly takes on the status of primary heroine,
                Emilia is not neatly killed off, imprisoned or exiled.
                Instead, her story surfaces at several points to
                punctuate Julia&rsquo;s Gothic adventures with an
                alternative narrative of domestic confinement and
                bereavement. In the conventional Gothic novel, the
                heroine survives her adventure to be married to the
                hero; Emilia has no adventure and survives the novel
                unmarried and with apparently no inclination to be
                married.<a href=
                "#10">[10]</a>
                Radcliffe&rsquo;s insistence on Emilia&rsquo;s return
                suggests that the restoration of order is not complete
                once the Gothic is explained and the hero and heroine
                reunited. While the Gothic now has an explanation,
                Emilia&rsquo;s confinement in the Castle Mazzini does
                not. By encouraging readers to draw comparisons between
                their own domestic confinement and Emilia&rsquo;s while
                suggesting the Gothic nature of that confinement,
                Radcliffe raises the possibility that the Gothic is not
                only in Sicily, but also at home.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>By constantly providing a rational explanation for
                her supernatural events, it has been argued, Radcliffe
                educates her heroine and her readers&rsquo;
                sensibilities, teaching them to rely on their reason
                instead.<a href=
                "#11">[11]</a>
                However, Radcliffe not only "disappoints" us by
                revealing the rational behind the supernatural, she
                disappoints almost all of our readerly expectations, in
                effect refuting the rational reader&rsquo;s attempt to
                relegate the plot of the novel to expected conventions.
                If the novel teaches Julia, and through Julia, us, that
                the mysterious light has a perfectly rational
                explanation,<a href=
                "#12">[12]</a>
                what the novel teaches us, but not Julia, is that we
                should not expect this novel to fall into conventional
                patterns so easily. By returning periodically to
                Emilia&rsquo;s confinement, Radcliffe violates her own
                narrative pattern and raises the possibility that, for
                readers, Emilia, and not her mother, is the Gothic
                mystery that must be discovered at the heart of the
                Castle Mazzini.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The novel concludes by falling into the greatest of
                all possible literary conventions, the marriage plot,
                but I would argue that by establishing a pattern of
                narrative violation throughout the course of her novel,
                Radcliffe teaches readers to be disappointed in the
                tidy ending by revealing its constructedness. In turn,
                our dissatisfaction with the conclusion of the novel,
                our awareness that something is not quite right here,
                encourages readers to look for the rational
                explanation, the making-right, that Radcliffe has
                always offered. As Claire Kahane has convincingly
                argued:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  This disjunction between the Gothic experience and
                  the novel&rsquo;s conclusion illustrates a pervasive
                  ambivalence for the female reader in the Gothic
                  paradigm. . . . Thus as in <em>Udolpho</em> and
                  <em>Jane Eyre</em>, while the heroine ultimately
                  moves into a space that she seemingly controls, that
                  control is illusory, based as it is on social
                  withdrawal and psychological repression, on an
                  ultimate submission to patriarchal constructs of the
                  feminine.[...] Both conclusions excise the Gothic
                  terrors, idealizing the mother and the heroines as
                  well. Yet beneath the pedestal lies an abyss; at the
                  Gothic center of the novels, a fearsome figure in the
                  mirror still remains, waiting to be acknowledged.

                <p>Kahane sees the heroine&rsquo;s confrontation with
                the mother as the dark center of the Gothic novel from
                which the heroine (and the reader) is "saved" by
                repression and a return to the pastoral/patriarchy at
                the conclusion of the novel. In the case of Julia in
                particular, her many attempts at escape lead her back
                to her true point of origin &mdash; her mother. Julia
                appears to be doomed to a fate similar to her
                mother&rsquo;s, thus perpetuating the repetitious cycle
                of doubles and traps characteristic of this novel. In
                keeping with Kahane&rsquo;s argument, it is possible to
                read Julia&rsquo;s inability to escape from Sicily as a
                narrative device forcing her further inward towards the
                confrontation with her mother. However, despite
                appearances, <em>A Sicilian Romance</em> does
                <em>not</em> end by repressing the Gothic danger Julia
                had faced and ushering the hero and heroine into a
                comfortable pastoral landscape. Instead, the novel
                insists on the return of the repressed through both
                landscape and the secondary heroine.</p>

                <p>We leave Julia at the close of chapter fourteen,
                hiding from the Marquis with no sign of escape. Her
                eventual escape with her mother, aided by Hippolitus,
                is destined to fail in precisely the same manner as her
                first attempt with Ferdinand. Julia&rsquo;s encounter
                with her mother has not made it possible for her to
                escape Sicily. However, the discovery of Julia&rsquo;s
                mother does change the narrative practices of the
                novel: the story of their escape and attempt to flee to
                Italy is told in the past tense, as all of the
                characters are seated around a happy villa fireside.
                Secure in the outcome for Julia&mdash;a happy
                reunion&mdash;the Gothic events of the story are made
                harmless and almost inconsequential. Indeed, our
                narrator does not indulge in the descriptions that have
                heretofore characterized the novel. In contrast to the
                lengthy description of Julia&rsquo;s discovery of her
                mother, their reunion with Hippolitus is described as
                follows: "No color of language can paint the scene
                which followed; it is sufficient to say that the whole
                party agreed to quit the cell at the return of night"
                (195). Readers have followed Julia through all of the
                picturesque scenery of Sicily; now their journey to
                Palermo is condensed: "Having escaped from thence they
                proceeded to a neighboring village, where horses were
                procured to carry them towards Palermo. Here, after a
                tedious journey, they arrived, in the design of
                embarking for Italy" (197). The storm which
                (inevitably!) strikes their small vessel is contained
                in one sentence: "They soon had reason to repent their
                temerity; for the vessel had not been long at sea when
                the storm arose, which threw them back upon the shores
                of Sicily, and brought them to the lighthouse, where
                they were discovered by Ferdinand" (198). Compared to
                the tempest described earlier in the novel, the
                transformation in Radcliffe&rsquo;s narrative tone is
                amazing. And although the narrator&rsquo;s tone and
                manner of description appears to indicate that the
                narrative is headed towards resolution, the tempest,
                operating as a sort of deus ex machina, returns the
                characters to the shores of Sicily to fetch Emilia from
                the Castle Mazzini and reminds readers that they have
                forgotten Emilia for the majority of this tale.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Once the family has "settled their future plans,"
                Ferdinand "hastened to the castle of Mazzini to fetch
                Emilia, and to give orders for the removal of his
                household to his palace at Naples, where he designed to
                fix his future residence. The distress of Emilia, whom
                he found recovered from her indisposition, yielded to
                joy and wonder, when she heard of the existence of her
                mother, and the safety of her sister" (198). The
                "distress of Emilia" is interrupted by the clause "whom
                he found recovered from her indisposition." Some might
                claim this is simply Radcliffe tying up loose ends;
                indeed, it might appear that Radcliffe has suddenly
                remembered that Emilia was left "confined to her bed by
                a dangerous illness" (193) after the deaths of the
                Marquis and Maria, but this is consistent with
                Radcliffe&rsquo;s treatment of Emilia throughout the
                novel.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Emilia is gradually left out of the plot from the
                moment Julia sees Hippolitus. The morning after the
                ball, the narrator tells us "Julia found it impossible
                to support a conversation with Emilia, whose
                observations interrupting the course of her thoughts,
                became uninteresting and tiresome" (21). The
                introduction of "the Gothic" to the novel, in the form
                of the mysterious lights and sounds from the
                uninhabited portion of the castle, serves as much to
                throw Julia and Emilia back together, at least
                initially, as it does to ultimately unite Julia and
                Hippolitus. It is not the mysterious chambers of the
                castle, but rather the marquis&rsquo;s decision that
                Julia should marry the Duke de Luovo that once again
                separates Julia and Emilia. Whether the suitor is the
                appealing Hippolitus or the vile Duke de Luovo, the
                effect of the marriage plot on Emilia and Julia is the
                same: separation.<a href=
                "#13">[13]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Emilia does not return to the narrative until the
                end of the first volume, when Madame de Menon&rsquo;s
                accidental discovery of the marchioness&rsquo;s
                intrigue forces her to leave the castle. Unlike Julia,
                who abandons friend and family without a word,
                Emilia&rsquo;s distress at Madame de Menon&rsquo;s
                departure is markedly vocal: "In madame she lost her
                only friend; and she too well understood the value of
                that friend, to see her depart without feeling and
                expressing the deepest distress" (102). This vocal
                distress is valorized by our narrator, who commends
                madame&rsquo;s and Emilia&rsquo;s grief at parting:
                "They left each other with a mutual sorrow, which did
                honor to their hearts" (103). By valorizing "mutual
                sorrow" and the expression of feeling, Radcliffe
                quietly rebukes Julia&rsquo;s selfish sentimentality
                that prioritizes her own marital happiness over female
                friendships. Emilia&rsquo;s narrative, when it
                surfaces, prevents readers from fully identifying with
                Julia&rsquo;s narrative by making visible what Julia
                represses: the toll sensibility takes on other
                characters.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>At the close of the novel, our narrator recounts the
                fate of each of the characters, beginning with the
                marchioness, followed by Hippolitus and Julia,
                Ferdinand, Madame de Menon, and lastly Emilia, whose
                future is elided with that of the marchioness: "Emilia,
                wholly attached to her family, continued to reside with
                the marchioness, who saw her race renewed in the
                children of Hippolitus and Julia. Thus surrounded by
                her children and friends, and engaged in forming the
                minds of the infant generation, she seemed to forget
                that she had ever been otherwise than happy" (199). The
                text only definitively states that Emilia is "wholly
                attached to her family," but the pairing of Emilia and
                the marchioness is suggestive. Although this pairing
                might appear to conflate Emilia&rsquo;s imprisonment
                with that of the marchioness, there is a crucial
                difference: the marchioness married the marquis; Emilia
                has never been married. By having Emilia choose to
                remain with her family, unmarried, Radcliffe authors
                and authorizes an alternative to marriage, but perhaps
                more importantly, reveals the perilous position of
                women. Choosing a bad husband, such as the Marquis, or
                choosing no husband, as Emilia does, has the same
                effect: imprisonment.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Though Emilia, like her mother, may have "seemed to
                forget that she had ever been otherwise than happy"
                (199), by concluding the manuscript annals with this
                line Radcliffe reminds us that Emilia had indeed been
                "otherwise than happy" and points us back into the
                text. But where is the record of Emilia&rsquo;s
                unhappiness? Where has she been for the last hundred
                pages? Emilia thus becomes a Gothic mystery and in the
                untold tale of her imprisonment within the Castle
                Mazzini the reader might infer instead a domestic
                double of Madame de Menon and Julia&rsquo;s adventures.
                All we are told is that "the castle Mazzini, which had
                been the theatre of a dreadful catastrophe; and whose
                scenes would have revived in the minds of the chief
                personages connected with it, painful and shocking
                reflections&mdash;was abandoned"(198). Emilia is the
                chief personage connected with the castle Mazzini,
                having spent the bulk of the novel within its ramparts.
                If Julia is perpetually cast back "upon the shores of
                Sicily," Emilia is kept within the confines of the
                castle, without the hope of rescue from a suitor, and
                subject to Ferdinand&rsquo;s "fetching" her to rejoin
                their friends.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The barely-narrated story of Emilia&rsquo;s
                imprisonment is compelling if we remember that Emilia
                had never been impatient to leave the confines of the
                Castle Mazzini, as is made evident by her and
                Julia&rsquo;s strikingly different reactions to the
                approaching festival:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Julia, who, in the distance, had considered the
                  splendid gaieties of life with tranquility, now
                  lingered with impatient hope through the moments
                  which withheld her from their enjoyments. Emilia,
                  whose feelings were less lively, and whose
                  imagination was less powerful, beheld the approaching
                  festival with calm consideration, and almost
                  regretted the interruption of those tranquil
                  pleasures, which she knew to be more congenial with
                  her powers and disposition. (15)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Emilia&rsquo;s contentment with her tranquil
                retirement is only troubled by the disappearance of
                those female friends and relatives whose company she
                enjoys. Julia&rsquo;s entry into the world through her
                attachment to Hippolitus exiles her from Emilia, and,
                at least for the first volume of the novel, from Madame
                de Menon. This exile begins long before Julia&rsquo;s
                escape, when her preoccupation with Hippolitus renders
                Emilia&rsquo;s conversation "uninteresting and
                tiresome" (21).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>By entering the world through heterosexual desire,
                Julia subjects herself to competing authorities:
                Hippolitus and her brother, Padre Abate, as well as the
                Marquis and Duke. In contrast, Emilia remains subject
                to her father&rsquo;s authority, but suffers because of
                the preoccupation of the household with the impending
                threat of Julia&rsquo;s marriage, whether to Hippolitus
                or to the Duke. In the novel, Radcliffe describes two
                scenes as "known only to those who have experienced a
                similar situation": the first is Emilia&rsquo;s
                "anguish" (103), at the departure of Julia and then
                Madame de Menon; the second is "the strangely mingled
                emotions of joy and terror that agitated Hippolitus"
                (164) upon the rediscovery of Julia in the caverns of
                the banditti. Clearly the gothic excess of the latter
                makes it unlikely that any reader would identify with
                Hippolitus; moreover, that Radcliffe&rsquo;s readers
                were predominately middle-class women makes their
                identification with a young Neapolitan aristocrat even
                more suspect. Emilia&rsquo;s domestic confinement, on
                the other hand, would echo their own, and they would
                certainly be sensible to her pain at the loss of her
                female friends.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Thus Julia&rsquo;s Gothic adventures illustrate the
                perils and the inescapability of not only the Sicilian
                landscape but the tandem impossibility of escape from
                the competing patriarchal authorities of the father,
                whether embodied in the aristocratic Duke, the Catholic
                Church (certainly already suspicious to a Protestant
                like Ann Radcliffe), or the literal paternal
                figure.<a href=
                "#14">[14]</a>
                However, Emilia&rsquo;s untold story, her confinement
                in the Castle Mazzini, which despite its Gothic secrets
                must also be described as her home, allowed the readers
                of Radcliffe&rsquo;s novels a space in which to realize
                their own English identity within the novel, both in
                their complicity with the Gothic structures that nearly
                killed the Marchioness, whom Emilia is said to be so
                much like, but also in the difficulty of completely
                abandoning those structures. For readers of <em>A
                Sicilian Romance</em>, the forgotten heroine&rsquo;s
                return, like the return to Naples, is a return of the
                repressed. While readers may wish to forget Emilia, as
                Julia does, to do so requires that they repress the
                narrative of her confinement. Emilia&rsquo;s return
                reminds readers that the dangers apparently surmounted
                in Sicily are not so safely distant from their own
                shores.</p>

                <p>In <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>, the frequent

                of course, the silences and secrets that estrange our
                characters from each other are all reminiscent of the
                Gothic. Most readings of Austen limit her response to

                The Gothic elements of <em>Northanger</em> are

                suggests to Catherine the Gothic possibilities of the
                Abbey, and Henry who undoes the Gothic spell by asking:
                "Remember that we are English, that we are Christians.

                By using Henry to contain the Gothic possibilities
                Catherine imagines, Austen ensures that their marriage
                provides the kind of rational explanation Radcliffe
                offered to her readers.</p>

              <li>
                <p><em>Sense and Sensibility</em> opens with the exile
                of the women from their home, Norland, by the
                conditions of their father&rsquo;s will. In effect a
                social-realist parody of the conventional Gothic cruel
                father who drives his daughter beyond the pale, the
                unintentional cruelty of Mr. Dashwood sends his
                daughters and wife outside of the domestic. The world
                they encounter is not filled with banditti or
                inescapable caverns, but it is equally challenging, as
                they attempt to negotiate the British economic system.
                Austen juxtaposes the heroine of sense, Elinor, with
                the heroine of sensibility, Marianne, to discipline
                readers into emotional and fiscal management. Critics
                have long argued over the respective status of these
                two heroines;<a href=
                "#17">[17]</a>
                I argue that Marianne is the primary heroine, and
                Elinor is the secondary heroine. In doing so, however,
                I do not mean to suggest that Elinor is less
                significant than Marianne. Instead, I argue that Elinor
                lines up with the category of the "forgotten heroine,"
                but that Austen&rsquo;s project is to insist that we
                remember her.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In the eighteenth century, the manifestation of
                proper sensibility was a marker of class status.
                However, the later appropriation of the discourse of
                sensibility by the middle class devalued the
                performance of sensibility. Although Marianne&rsquo;s
                spectacle of sensibility gets readers&rsquo; attention
                and often our sympathy,<a href=
                "#18">[18]</a>
                it is Elinor&rsquo;s more difficult and often less
                interesting attempt to negotiate the English class
                system in search of financial security that Austen
                trains her readers to appreciate. In this respect,
                Austen builds on Emilia&rsquo;s domestic confinement in
                <em>A Sicilian Romance</em>. Emilia values female
                friendship, but is financially dependent on her father.
                By choosing not to marry, she necessarily chooses
                domestic isolation until the family is reconfigured in
                Naples. The death of the father at the start of
                <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> leaves the Dashwood
                women without any financial resources: they cannot
                remain at home. By devaluing Marianne&rsquo;s encomiums
                on the English landscape in favor of Elinor&rsquo;s
                pragmatic approach to economics, Austen establishes a
                new British domestic. This new domestic recognizes that
                the sensibility of the Dashwood girls does not ensure
                happiness, as it might in one of Marianne&rsquo;s
                novels; instead, the Dashwoods are dependent on the
                sympathy of their relations, their own ability to
                economize and, lastly, on the possibility of marrying
                well. In short, the Dashwood women need money, and the
                juxtaposition of Elinor and Marianne is in some ways a
                competition to determine the best way to get it. This
                competition reveals the correlation between economic
                and emotional management.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The Dashwood women are in financial need, but
                support from their relations is highly unlikely.
                John&rsquo;s discussion with Fanny concerning the
                interpretation of his father&rsquo;s last wish that he
                would "assist his widow and daughters" (6) reveals
                their want of true sympathy.<a href=
                "#19">[19]</a>
                Their overmanagement of financial resources &mdash; in
                short, their greed &mdash; makes them unsympathetic to
                the Dashwoods. John and Fanny are more attentive to
                their own comfort, and imagine how they would feel if
                they were in place of the Dashwoods quite literally, by
                moving into Norland and lamenting the loss of the
                original linen and china. In their limited
                understanding of the economic plight of Mrs. Dashwood
                and her daughters, they imagine them either
                well-married, or able to shift on the inheritance they
                already have. In contrast, Austen places the
                Middletons, whose excessive hospitality also discomfits
                the Dashwoods. It is notable that their hospitality not
                only consists of financial support through the low rent
                at Barton cottage, the frequent invitations to dinner,
                and the journey to town, but also extends to the
                preoccupation of Sir John and Mrs. Jennings with the
                intimate details of the social lives of the Dashwood
                sisters. Thus even financial generosity is not
                necessarily equivalent with true sympathy, a requisite
                for proper sensibility. Their overexuberance to see the
                girls married results in a great many awkward
                misunderstandings concerning the three primary suitors:
                Willoughby, Colonel Brandon, and Edward Ferrars.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The three suitors, in turn, offer different
                representations of wealth and economy as they operate
                in England; the financial practices of Austen&rsquo;s
                men are an echo of their true sensibilities.
                Willoughby&rsquo;s excessive spending and want of
                management not only results in debt but also in his
                dishonorable relationship with Eliza. Willoughby is, we
                discover, not what he seems, and thus true sympathy
                with Marianne is impossible. Colonel Brandon&rsquo;s
                history is determined by both wealth and sensibility:
                his love for Eliza was obstructed by his parents&rsquo;
                determination to wed her to his older brother for the
                sake of uniting their family fortunes. Brandon&rsquo;s
                careful management of his own wealth and his generosity
                to Edward are reflections of his appropriate sympathy
                for others and management of his own emotions. Although
                Brandon styles himself a "poor narrator," he knows when
                it is appropriate to divulge information, and when it
                is best to conceal what one feels. In contrast,
                Edward&rsquo;s financial security as a gentleman,
                unallied to any sort of profession, leaves him adrift
                and susceptible to the superficial charms of Lucy
                Steele.<a href=
                "#20">[20]</a>
                Only after Edward is tethered to Lucy by their
                engagement does he begin to understand his failure of
                sensibility. His subsequent disinheritance requires
                that Edward find a profession; his new responsibilities
                as pastor render him fit for the anti-Gothic new world
                of sense that Austen constructs as the English ideal.
                Austen does not imagine a world of independent women
                possessing rooms of their own, but instead suggests
                that economic and emotional management on the part of
                men <em>and</em> women will secure domestic
                England.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The Dashwood women will achieve financial security
                through marriage, but they must first learn to
                economize for themselves. It is only after they have
                successfully negotiated domestic economy and
                sensibility that these heroines can identify and thus
                sympathize with the management of sensibility and
                wealth by their suitors. While the Gothic novel opposed
                the greed of the father to the sensibility of the
                daughter, Austen&rsquo;s domestic novel requires that
                her heroines manage their money and their marriages
                (and understand the relationship between the two).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Even before Elinor learns of Edward&rsquo;s
                engagement to Lucy Steele, she does not openly display
                her feelings: "Without shutting herself up from her
                family, or leaving the house in determined solitude to
                avoid them, or lying awake the whole night to indulge
                meditation, Elinor found every day afforded her leisure
                enough to think of Edward" (90). The negative
                construction of this sentence invites comparison with
                Marianne, who would, of course, shut herself up, leave
                the house, or lie awake the whole night to think of
                Willoughby. By illustrating the negative consequences
                of Marianne&rsquo;s excessive sensibility, Austen
                trains her reader away from the narrative of
                sensibility epitomized in the story of the two Elizas,
                and into an understanding of the British domestic, in
                which the real tragedy occurs, as George Eliot would
                later remark, in "the roar on the other side of
                silence." Marianne&rsquo;s disdain for the Colonel and
                preference for Willoughby and his sonnets mark her as a
                descendant of the Gothic heroine of sensibility.
                However, as we have seen in the embedded narrative of
                the Elizas, such heroines no longer end happily.
                Elinor&rsquo;s silence (although probably initially as
                disappointing to Austen&rsquo;s readers as it is to
                Marianne) grants her desire, whereas Marianne&rsquo;s
                multiple letters to Willoughby produce little effect.
                Marianne&rsquo;s letters are manifestations of her
                sensibility, but Austen reveals that if an excess of
                wealth does not support that excess of emotion, it has
                no effect. In Austen&rsquo;s new domestic England,
                happiness is preserved, at least fictionally, for those
                capable of emotional management.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>By reforming her expectations from Gothic to
                domestic, Marianne is able to find some sort of
                contentment. Brandon&rsquo;s connection to Willoughby
                through the two Elizas makes Marianne sympathetic to
                <em>him</em>, and out of that sympathy their attachment
                is formed. This sympathy is in contrast to
                Marianne&rsquo;s pride in her "sensibility." Whereas
                Marianne&rsquo;s sensibility values her individual
                response to Norland or to Cowper, and finds sympathy
                with those who share her exact response, as Willoughby
                appears to, Marianne&rsquo;s discovery of sympathy is
                not linked to appearance (Brandon is, after all, twice
                her age and fond of flannel waistcoats), but rather to
                Adam Smith&rsquo;s understanding of sympathy: "As we
                have no immediate experience of what other men feel, we
                can form no idea of the manner in which they are
                affected, but by conceiving what we ourselves should
                feel in the like situation" (10-11). Marianne imagines
                herself in the place of each Eliza and realizes that
                her sensibility is not individual and individuating,
                but dangerously common. Through the first Eliza,
                Marianne becomes aware of the possibility of parental
                prejudice to her lack of wealth; through the second,
                Marianne furthers the correlation between wealth and
                sympathy: if one&rsquo;s wealth is contingent on
                another, one&rsquo;s sympathy must follow. However, by
                imagining herself in the place of Eliza, Marianne is
                able to imagine herself in Brandon&rsquo;s care.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Marianne&rsquo;s first moment of sympathetic
                identification is not with either Eliza, but with
                Elinor. Marianne has sympathy for Elinor because Elinor
                is experiencing something that Marianne has also
                experienced: the marriage of a former suitor. When
                their man-servant informs the Dashwoods that Mr.
                Ferrars is married, Marianne&rsquo;s reaction
                illustrates that she has literally imagined herself in
                Elinor&rsquo;s place, but in doing so prevents others
                from sympathizing with Elinor:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Marianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes upon
                  Elinor, saw her turning pale, and fell back in her
                  chair in hysterics. Mrs. Dashwood, whose eyes, as she
                  answered the servants inquiry, had intuitively taken
                  the same direction, was shocked to perceive by
                  Elinor&rsquo;s countenance how much she really
                  suffered, and in a moment afterwards, alike
                  distressed by Marianne&rsquo;s situation, knew not on
                  which child to bestow her principal attention. (310)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Although Marianne&rsquo;s "violent start" is solely
                occasioned by her concern for Elinor&rsquo;s feelings,
                it produces much the same effect as her previous
                effusions of sensibility &mdash; it gets
                everyone&rsquo;s attention. By the time Marianne has
                been attended to by her mother and the maid, Elinor
                "had so far recovered the use of her reason and voice
                as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas, as to the
                source of his intelligence" (310). Elinor&rsquo;s
                suffering is barely noticed by the characters within
                the narrative, as is made evident by Mrs.
                Dashwood&rsquo;s shock at Elinor&rsquo;s countenance.
                In maintaining this distance from her own suffering,
                and seeking always the benefit of others, Elinor
                resembles Austen&rsquo;s narrator, whose ironic
                distance from narrative events disallows sympathy, or
                at the very least, reveals the ways in which sympathy
                functions within its own economy, whereby one must
                construct a narrative which will engage the sympathy of
                the listener.<a href=
                "#21">[21]</a>
                Marianne is never fully aware of the way a story is
                told, she instead responds to stories that appeal to
                her. Elinor initially uses silence to manage her
                emotional response to narratives (such as Lucy
                Steele&rsquo;s account of her engagement to Edward),
                but eventually learns to tell her own story in order to
                manage Marianne&rsquo;s emotions.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Elinor tells Marianne about Edward&rsquo;s
                engagement twice. The first time, the narrator
                suppresses her account and tells us instead: "Her
                narration was clear and simple; and though it could not
                be given without emotion it was not accompanied by
                violent agitation, nor impetuous
                grief.&mdash;<em>That</em> belonged rather to the
                hearer, for Marianne listened with horror, and cried
                excessively. Elinor was to be the comforter of others
                in her own distresses, no less than in theirs" (227).
                Elinor&rsquo;s narrative, intended to "suggest a hint
                of what was practicable to Marianne" (227) in the
                management of one&rsquo;s sensibilities, only provokes
                Marianne&rsquo;s sensibilities. Elinor must reconstruct
                her narrative to appeal to Marianne&rsquo;s
                sensibilities.<a href=
                "#22">[22]</a>
                Her second narration, full of dashes and emotional
                confessions, finally moves Marianne to realize how
                selfish she has been in her own distresses. But perhaps
                Marianne goes too far in embracing "sense"&mdash;as the
                narrator tells us, she embarks on a rather excessive
                course of study, and in the end, marries Colonel
                Brandon out of pure sense: "With such a confederacy
                against her&mdash;with a knowledge so intimate of his
                goodness&mdash;with a conviction of his fond attachment
                to herself, which at last, though long after it was
                observable to everybody else&mdash;burst on
                her&mdash;what could she do?" (333). Marianne&rsquo;s
                new responsibilities, however, are still those of
                pre-industrial England. She and the Colonel have no
                profession except for the management of their estate
                and the village.<a href=
                "#23">[23]</a>
                It is significant that the narrator focuses not on
                Marianne&rsquo;s happiness, but rather on the
                Colonel&rsquo;s &mdash; describing Marianne as his
                "reward" that "consoled for every past affliction"
                (334) and thus coding their life together as
                outdated.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>It is instead Elinor, who tempers sensibility with
                sense and who persists in her first very reasonable
                attachment to Edward, whom the narrative quietly
                endorses. Elinor and Edward&rsquo;s residence in the
                parsonage at Delaford marks them as resolutely
                middle-class. Their very real concerns with household
                economy result from their similar economic situations.
                Each is unexpectedly disinherited: Elinor, by her
                father&rsquo;s early death and the entailment of
                Norland; Edward, by his misstep with Lucy and the
                resultant forfeiture of his "right of eldest son."
                However, the novel discourages reliance on these
                antiquated legal mechanisms of acquiring property and
                wealth, and instead rewards Edward&rsquo;s and
                Elinor&rsquo;s characters, which earn them the living
                at Delaford and the grant of ten thousand pounds from
                Mrs. Ferrars. In doing so, Austen not only revises
                literary tastes from Gothic to domestic, but also
                envisions a new British domestic that is not bound by
                the artificial economies of sympathy and primogeniture.
                Marianne&rsquo;s marriage to the man in the flannel
                waistcoat is dissatisfying because it undoes the
                reader&rsquo;s nostalgia for uncomplicated sentimental
                resolution. In this new domestic, for Marianne to find
                her sentimental equal she will have to look to an older
                man, an older generation. Elinor&rsquo;s rather
                uninteresting marriage to Edward is in fact
                progressive. The seamy economic underbelly of the
                national romance is thus made explicit and renounced in
                favor of a sort of national realism. Austen directly
                confronts the vestiges of British aristocracy that the
                Gothic had located in the past and on the Continent and
                devalues the means by which they sustain power.</p>
    
                <h4>Remembering the Rival: Louisa Grant</h4>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Austen&rsquo;s gentry and middle class represent a
                very narrow swath of the British class structure. In
                James Fenimore Cooper&rsquo;s <em>The Pioneers</em>,
                the construction of American identity in the wake of
                revolution assembles a more socially diverse group of
                characters, but Cooper ultimately reimposes aristocracy
                as the best means of ordering the previously "composite
                order" of Templeton. The marriage of Elizabeth and
                Oliver at the close of <em>The Pioneers</em> does, as
                many critics have argued,<a href=
                "#24">[24]</a>
                establish the ideological stakes of the new nation,
                while attempting to reconcile or erase alternative
                possibilities: Indian John dies, Natty heads west, and
                Edwards/Effingham&rsquo;s complex ancestry seems to
                satisfy all of the quibbles over land ownership and law
                that have plagued Templeton.<a href=
                "#25">[25]</a>
                However, one alternative remains: Louisa Grant.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Critics have long dismissed Louisa Grant as a bland
                foil who renders Elizabeth, or Bess, more
                brilliant,<a href=
                "#26">[26]</a>
                but to dismiss Louisa requires that we ignore
                Cooper&rsquo;s insistence on her presence in the text.
                Louisa&rsquo;s exile at the close of the novel removes
                the last impediment to Oliver and Bess&rsquo;s
                marriage&mdash;Bess&rsquo;s rival <a href=
                "#27">[27]</a>&mdash;and
                reveals that Bess does, as she claims, "manage more
                deeply than you imagine, sir" (449). By resigning the
                future of Templeton, and by extension, America, to
                Bess&rsquo;s management, Cooper writes Louisa out of
                the novel and with her the alternative subjectivity she
                represents. In doing so, Cooper chooses the stable
                narratives of aristocratic primogeniture to consolidate
                the new nation even as he raises, if only to dismiss,
                the possibility of a meritocracy.<a href=
                "#28">[28]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The first appearance of each heroine is significant
                in determining the relationship between the heroine and
                the possible direction of the nation: Louisa and Bess
                are each initially obscured from the reader&rsquo;s
                gaze, but both become visible and audible when they
                resolve an awkward situation. When Bess and Judge
                Temple approach Templeton, Bess is buried beneath
                layers of garments. However, she casts aside her cloak
                and her silence to tend to the young hunter, Oliver. As
                Janet Dean has already noted, something of Bess&rsquo;s
                character is revealed in this action: her sensibility
                to the young hunter&rsquo;s dangerous wound overcomes
                her prudence in sheltering herself from the cold air.
                Throughout the novel, Bess braves the elements of the
                American frontier&mdash;scaling the Vision, paddling in
                the canoe, walking unattended in the woods&mdash;as she
                says, "My father&rsquo;s daughter fears nothing, sir"
                (188). Her temerity&mdash;attached to her status as
                heiress&mdash;is requisite for the frontier, where she
                must be willing and able to meet the challenges of the
                wilderness. Her self-identification&mdash;"my
                father&rsquo;s daughter"&mdash;underscores the literal
                genealogy of this temerity. By deploying her status as
                heiress, Bess establishes her authority over the
                American landscape.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In contrast, the reader is introduced to Louisa at
                the first formal service held at the new church. Louisa
                is the only member of the congregation familiar with
                the correct responses and willing to speak them out
                loud. Bess and Oliver, we later discover, have been
                raised in the city and are familiar with the service,
                but Bess does not speak until she hears Oliver join
                Louisa. Certainly her motivations are not as pure as
                Louisa&rsquo;s piety: it is only once Oliver tacitly
                rebukes her silence that she joins the prayer to
                maintain his good opinion. Richard Jones&rsquo;s
                attempt to impose one permanent church in Templeton is
                unsuccessful because the only attendees familiar with
                the proper responses are those who have spent time in
                the city, as opposed to the frontier.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The parishioners, accustomed to a rotating minister,
                do not know what the appropriate responses are in the
                Episcopalian service; they may, in fact, be somewhat
                suspicious of the service because of its ties to
                England. The narrator informs us that after the
                American Revolution, the Episcopalian church
                "languished" until American ministers could be ordained
                in England: "Pious and suitable divines were at length
                selected, and sent to the mother country, to receive
                that authority, which, it is understood, can only be
                transmitted directly from one to the other, and thus
                obtain, in order to preserve, that unity in their
                churches, which properly belonged to a people of the
                same nation" (102). The Episcopalian church, therefore,
                appears to function as a transatlantic bridge between
                England and America and suggests an alternative to
                nationalism, one that incorporates the English, the
                Americans, and the Native Americans under the umbrella
                of Christianity. Cooper makes clear that the authority
                of the Episcopal divines is more tenuous than the
                authority of law, embodied in Judge Temple. While Judge
                Temple&rsquo;s questionable legal practices are always
                effective, Cooper&rsquo;s history of the Episcopal
                Church in America, his depiction of the first Episcopal
                service in Templeton, and Reverend Grant&rsquo;s
                unsuccessful attempt to perform the last rites for
                Indian John all depict the church as ineffective.
                Although the church appears as an ordering structure in
                the new colonies, alongside government and the law, it
                does not carry the authority of these other structures
                of order:<a href=
                "#29">[29]</a>
                while Reverend Grant attempts to convert Native
                Americans, and Louisa lives in fear of them,
                Bess&rsquo;s marriage to Oliver at the conclusion
                erases the threat of the many claims to Templeton
                through primogeniture, and exiles Louisa and her father
                to Boston. The ideological impact of the conclusion of
                the novel is so forceful that it is easy, perhaps, to
                forget that Louisa&rsquo;s attachment to Oliver is not
                entirely unfounded; in the early chapters of the novel,
                Oliver&rsquo;s attentions seem devoted to her: "Drawing
                her arm through his own, he lifted his cap from his
                head, allowing the dark locks to flow in rich curls
                over his open brow, and walked by her side, with an air
                of conscious pride, as if inviting an examination of
                his inmost thoughts" (140). Solicitous of her comfort,
                Oliver saves Louisa from a falling branch: "the figure
                of Louisa, slowly yielding in her saddle; and but for
                his arm, she would have sunken to the earth" (240). By
                constantly placing Louisa in situations where she is
                dependent on Oliver, Cooper seems to forward a romance
                plot between them.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In contrast, Bess repeatedly refuses Oliver&rsquo;s
                aid. Until she can ascertain his real identity, she
                will not be dependent on him in any way. Bess&rsquo;s
                status as heiress makes it particularly important for
                her to keep her distance from this unknown quantity.
                Louisa, on the other hand, finds the various potential
                identities for Oliver &mdash; Native American, for
                example &mdash; troubling, but not troubling enough to
                prevent her attachment to him. Louisa&rsquo;s
                insistence on seeing the good in Oliver overwhelms
                these other considerations, and highlight&rsquo;s
                Bess&rsquo;s distancing strategies. Bess sees the
                transformation of the American landscape; Louisa
                notices the transformation in Oliver. Bess sees a
                subject to sketch; Louisa sees how superior Oliver is
                to his companions. Bess may see the American landscape
                in its totality, but she does so because her class
                status requires her to see herself apart from the
                landscape and its inhabitants.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>As the novel progresses, sympathy develops between
                Oliver and Bess, but Oliver is consistent in his
                attentions to both young women. Bess and Oliver&rsquo;s
                shared sensibilities are evident despite their attempts
                at secrecy: for example, Oliver&rsquo;s hand rests
                naturally on the piano, despite his hunting garb. Bess
                reads Oliver&rsquo;s sensibilities as evidence of his
                true identity, and only waits for more tangible
                confirmation of his worthiness. Cooper foregrounds
                these scenes of sensibility to prepare readers for the
                revelation of Oliver&rsquo;s identity, but distances us
                from Louisa by limiting our perception of her to the
                perspectives of the other characters. This narrative
                distance echoes Austen&rsquo;s use of Mrs. Jennings to
                relate Elinor&rsquo;s marriage, and to similar effect.
                Louisa is made auxiliary to the other characters, and
                particularly to Bess.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>However, Cooper complicates the novel&rsquo;s
                endorsement of Bess through depictions of Bess&rsquo;s
                jealousy. Bess&rsquo;s jealousy reveals the merit of
                Louisa, and the extent of her own management. When
                Oliver expresses surprise at her desire to send Louisa
                away, Bess questions his motivations: "fixing her eyes
                with a searching look on his countenance, where they
                met only the unsuspecting expression of manly regret"
                (449). Oliver passes her test, but Bess&rsquo;s
                jealousy forces readers to question her motivations for
                exiling Louisa at the end of the novel. Bess is right
                to be jealous, for Louisa is the only other woman in
                the Patent who is her equal; indeed Remarkable
                Pettibone, admittedly for selfish reasons, prefers
                Louisa to Bess: "Now, to my reckoning, Lowizy Grant is
                much more pritty behaved than Betsy Temple" (176). Bess
                herself acknowledges Louisa&rsquo;s superiority,
                although her sincerity is questionable: "&lsquo;Nay,
                Louisa, humility carries you too far. The daughter of a
                minister of the church can have no superiors. Neither I
                nor Mr. Edwards is quite your equal, unless, &lsquo;she
                added, again smiling, &lsquo;he is in secret a
                king&rsquo;" (279). Rather than locating superiority in
                social status, Remarkable and Bess each assign an
                alternative form of value. Remarkable suggests that
                Louisa&rsquo;s "pritty" behavior surpasses Bess&rsquo;s
                temerity; Bess suggests that Louisa&rsquo;s place in
                the Christian hierarchy, as the daughter of a minister,
                gives her a higher station than herself or Oliver,
                unless Oliver is "in secret a king." Bess quickly
                changes the compliment to Louisa into a prying barb at
                Oliver&rsquo;s secrecy, one that reveals her own
                anxieties about Oliver&rsquo;s social status and
                national identity. Louisa&rsquo;s social status can be
                located, but Oliver&rsquo;s is a contradiction: his
                sensibilities suggest that he is from the same social
                class as Bess, but his attire and association with
                Natty and Indian John complicate Bess&rsquo;s reading
                of his sensibilities. Oliver is also Young Eagle: both
                his Native American and English names prevent Bess from
                reading his social status because neither name provides
                a genealogy. Oliver is an assumed name, and Young Eagle
                is a name given to him by Indian John to mark his
                adoption.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In contrast, Louisa&rsquo;s legible social status
                obscures her merit, especially in conversations between
                Oliver and Bess. It is easy to lose perspective of the
                "real" Louisa in the complex motivations behind all of
                these speeches, until Louisa speaks for herself: "It is
                sometimes dangerous to be rich, Miss Temple; but you
                cannot know how hard it is to be very, very poor. . . .
                Ah! Miss Temple, you little understand the troubles of
                this life, I believe. My father has spent many years as
                a missionary, in the new countries, where his people
                were poor, and frequently we have been without bread;
                unable to buy, and ashamed to beg, because we would not
                disgrace his sacred calling" (305). This almost untold
                story of Louisa&rsquo;s past opens a gap in the history
                of Louisa narrated in the text. While the Louisa
                visible to Bess and Oliver lacks the polish of
                Bess&rsquo;s education, wears garments inappropriate to
                the season, and is in general "timid" and "maidenly,"
                Louisa has known "the sick and the hungry" (305), the
                death of her siblings and the horrors of poverty.
                Louisa&rsquo;s class position as minister&rsquo;s
                daughter has not granted her the respect and
                superiority that Bess and Oliver imagine, but instead
                has insured nothing but suffering and hunger, as the
                Grants conscientiously attempt to maintain the same
                level of subsistence as their parishioners.
                Bess&rsquo;s status as "the heiress" may make her the
                more obvious choice for Oliver, but it has also
                preserved her from the suffering Louisa has endured.
                Bess deploys her status to justify a sort of
                exceptionalism: as "my father&rsquo;s daughter" she may
                board a canoe or witness a turkey shoot without
                impinging on her maidenly delicacy. She assumes her
                position as mistress over Remarkable Pettibone by
                adopting the title Miss Temple and exiles Oliver from
                her walk with Louisa because she does not want to
                entertain "particular attentions" from someone whose
                family history is unknown. Bess&rsquo;s apparent
                fearless independence is tempered by a rather Old World
                sense of social propriety and class distinctions.
                Louisa&rsquo;s experiences of poverty and suffering
                complicate the novel&rsquo;s attempt to dismiss her as
                unfit for the frontier: instead, it becomes clear that
                Louisa&rsquo;s merit is overshadowed by her class
                identity. Cooper introduces the possibility of an
                alternative system of value, but forecloses it in favor
                of a conclusion that establishes the legal right of
                white Americans to the land through the very same
                strictures of primogeniture that Austen had called into
                question.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>After her indirect rescue of Bess and Oliver, Louisa
                never reappears in the novel. However, she is discussed
                by Oliver and Bess, and narrated once by Cooper, during
                the strange comedy of Monsieur LeQuoi&rsquo;s proposal.
                Janet Dean has read these proposals as "the connection
                between marriage and nationhood," arguing that
                Elizabeth, should she accept Monsieur LeQuoi, would
                become French, and relinquish her property in Templeton
                and, by implication, "the promise of the American
                future" (1-2). Dean ignores Monsieur LeQuoi&rsquo;s
                subsequent proposal to Louisa, which is also rejected.
                Monsieur LeQuoi&rsquo;s proposals are offered "as a
                duty which a well-bred man owed to a lady in such a
                retired place" (444), and remind us that Louisa is as
                qualified as Bess to receive them. Louisa&rsquo;s
                refusal, however, is significant in that through it,
                Louisa exiles herself from the marriage plot. There are
                no other young men in Templeton, as Oliver observes, "I
                really don&rsquo;t know any one hereabouts good enough
                for her" (448); and by refusing Monsieur LeQuoi,
                Louisa, in effect, refuses marriage.<a href=
                "#30">[30]</a>
                Aside from Cooper&rsquo;s account of her refusal,
                Louisa is removed from the novel. Bess&rsquo;s plans
                for Louisa&rsquo;s future are, as Oliver notes,
                evidence of how deeply she manages, but seem unlikely
                to agree with Louisa&rsquo;s own desires or tastes. It
                is almost impossible to imagine Louisa in a situation
                where she "may meet with such society, and form such a
                connexion, as may be proper for one of her years and
                character" (449): society has never been Louisa&rsquo;s
                forte. Thus Cooper requires the reader to imagine
                Louisa&rsquo;s future as one outside the marriage plot
                Bess and Oliver imagine, and allows for another
                possibility. In this respect, Louisa&rsquo;s exile
                might be compared to Natty&rsquo;s &mdash; although it
                is difficult to think of the timid Louisa as "the
                foremost in that band of Pioneers" (456). The
                conclusion of <em>The Pioneers</em> opens the
                possibility of an ever-receding frontier, but the
                subsequent Leatherstocking tales look back instead to
                narrate Natty&rsquo;s past. While Cooper asks the
                reader to imagine Natty&rsquo;s journey west, he sends
                Louisa back east to settled Boston.<a href=
                "#31">[31]</a></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Louisa, therefore, has a double function within
                <em>The Pioneers</em>: she represents, on one hand, a
                possible alternative to the marriage plot by choosing
                independence rather than a marriage of convenience with
                Monsieur LeQuoi.<a href=
                "#32">[32]</a>
                On the other hand, Louisa also stands in as
                representation of what is lost through the
                solidification of American identity emblematized in the
                marriage between Bess and Oliver. For while their
                marriage can be read as reconciling competing
                nationalisms &mdash; British, American and Native
                American &mdash; in favor of a new, legitimate order,
                the exile of Indian John, Natty, and Louisa from that
                new order points to what is lost in the consolidation
                of American identity. Natty and Indian John live on in
                the rest of the Leatherstocking tales, but
                Louisa&rsquo;s prehistory and subsequent fate are left
                unnarrated, pointing to the erasure of women by history
                unless they are allied to the dominant hierarchies of
                power. But the forgetting of Louisa also suggests the
                significance of women in consolidating national
                identity: the possibility of Oliver and Louisa&rsquo;s
                marriage must be eliminated, and is, in fact, so
                frequently raised and discarded that it persists even
                after the marriage of Bess and Oliver. The
                narrative&rsquo;s inability to forget Louisa
                underscores Bess&rsquo;s methodical elimination of any
                other claim to the American landscape she and Oliver
                inhabit. Louisa&rsquo;s suffering, allied to her status
                as a minister&rsquo;s daughter, poses an alternative
                hierarchy of value that reveals the economic
                underpinnings of the legal unification of Templeton,
                and thus America. Bess&rsquo;s sensibilities surmount
                the American wilderness, just as Marianne&rsquo;s
                effusions over dead leaves and Julia&rsquo;s ever-ready
                lute surmounted the British and Sicilian islands,
                respectively, but each of these heroines indulged their
                sensibilities at the expense of a secondary heroine who
                remained at home. Emilia, Elinor and Louisa each
                suffer, and attention to their suffering reveals the
                cost of sensibility.</p>
    
                <h4>Conclusion: Who Can Afford Sensibility?</h4>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>For Radcliffe, the forgotten heroine serves as a
                site of readerly identification, in which the
                barely-told narrative of Emilia&rsquo;s loss of her
                friends to the Gothic plot, set in play by
                Julia&rsquo;s desire for Hippolitus, is similar to the
                less Gothic experience of so many young women as they
                reached marriageable age. Julia&rsquo;s adventures in
                Sicily point to the dangers of wealth and aristocracy:
                the Marquis&rsquo;s desire to profit by marrying Julia
                to the Duke de Luovo, the banditti rampant in the
                Sicilian caverns, the greedy Padre Abate&rsquo;s
                attempt to coerce Julia into becoming a nun. The
                restoration of the Marchioness, the marriage of Julia
                and Hippolitus, and the return to Naples under the
                direction of Ferdinand resolve these issues by
                instituting a stable domestic family. However,
                Emilia&rsquo;s narrative clearly does not belong in the
                crags and caverns of the Sicilian landscape in the
                manner that Julia&rsquo;s does. Rather, through Emilia,
                Radcliffe offers readers a way back from Italy to
                England, and suggests that the stability of the
                domestic is always available there, but also always
                compromised.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Austen&rsquo;s novel is set in the domestic England
                Emilia emblematizes. In Austen, both heroines marry at
                the end, and so we must instead understand why Elinor
                seems "forgotten" throughout much of the text while we
                are preoccupied with Marianne. Elinor&rsquo;s silences,
                her ability to manage her emotions rather than indulge
                in them, mark her as already having successfully
                exchanged the discourse of sensibility for that of
                sense. Marianne&rsquo;s reeducation teaches her the
                dangers of a hero like Willoughby, and her marriage to
                Brandon, who shares a similarly Gothic past, is coded
                as traditional and even antiquated. Elinor and
                Edward&rsquo;s residence in the parsonage at Delaford
                makes them dependent on the Brandons, but they are also
                depicted as progressive: the parsonage has been
                remodeled, and their prosaic wish for "rather better
                pasturage for their cows" is indicative of their mutual
                proficiency in financial, as well as sentimental
                management.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In writing a novel clearly preoccupied with a
                romantic reconciliation of history, Cooper selects an
                outspoken and wealthy heroine to create a new and
                uniquely American aristocracy that resolves, however
                superficially, America&rsquo;s tenuous position as
                former colonial subject and nascent colonial power.
                However, Louisa&rsquo;s experiences of poverty and
                hardship, when contrasted with the luxuriant excess of
                Judge Temple&rsquo;s house, suggests a correlation
                between financial security and sensibility.
                Bess&rsquo;s bravery is, quite literally, a luxury she
                can afford. In contrast, as the sole surviving child of
                Reverend Grant, Louisa has witnessed the price of
                temerity, and her father cannot afford to lose her
                assistance. Bess&rsquo;s plans for Louisa, in tandem
                with the exile of Natty and the death of Indian John,
                attempt to remove the threat that suffering poses to
                the national romance.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The relationship between these novels and the cult
                of sensibility is complex, and is explicitly tied to
                concerns of national identity. At the height of the
                cult of sensibility Radcliffe&rsquo;s novel introduces
                two sisters, not for the purposes of a contrast novel
                that exalts one sister and deprecates the other, but
                rather to provide an alternative narrative to the
                Gothic plot that anticipates Austen. While
                Radcliffe&rsquo;s Emilia still inhabits Sicily, she
                rarely ventures outside the confines of home. In turn,
                Austen&rsquo;s critique of sensibility is also a
                critique of the fantastic displacement common to the
                Gothic novel. Readers who identified with a victimized
                Italian noblewoman, according to Austen, have more
                important, and perhaps more terrifying challenges to
                face in domestic England. Austen&rsquo;s heroines ask
                readers to choose between two versions of English
                identity: the familiar heroine of sensibility, who is
                comically out of place in quotidian England, or a
                pragmatic heroine of sense, who is capable of
                navigating the changing class structure of early
                nineteenth-century England. In turn, Cooper&rsquo;s
                romance adopts Gothic strategies to displace and
                resolve competing national origins. Although the
                landscape of <em>The Pioneers</em> is explicitly
                American, it is clearly not the America familiar to
                Cooper&rsquo;s readers. By reintroducing the heroine of
                sensibility as the emblematic American girl, Cooper
                exploits her ideological power to exile competing
                national identities, including that of the secondary
                heroine.</p>

            Oliver&rsquo;s name and heritage is a source of confusion
            in the novel, and the revelation of his heritage is key to
            Cooper&rsquo;s reconciliation of the competing Native
            American, British and American claims to Templeton. In this
            essay, I refer to Edward Oliver Effingham as Oliver, and to
            Elizabeth Temple as Bess.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="2"></a>2</sup> In this
            essay, I use "secondary" and "forgotten" heroine
            interchangeably.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="3"></a>3</sup> I do not
            wish to conflate sympathy and sensibility; for the purposes
            of this essay, I consider sympathy to be one of the
            qualities necessary to possess sensibility. To possess
            sensibility, as Margaret Anne Doody has defined it, is "to
            possess the capacity of human sympathy, as well as the
            capacity for aesthetic responsiveness" ("Introduction,"
            xiv). The power of sympathy, according to Adam
            Smith&rsquo;s <em>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</em>
            (1759), is to bridge this divide between individual minds:
            "As we have no immediate experience of what other men feel,
            we can form no idea of the manner in which they are
            affected, but by conceiving what we ourselves should feel
            in the like situation" (10-11). Smith suggested that
            observing a fictional sentimental hero or heroine&rsquo;s
            response to an occasion for sympathy, such as suffering or
            beauty, and the narrative reward of that appropriate
            behavior, or punishment of inappropriate behavior, enabled
            the reader to internalize sentimental ideals. In turn, the
            reader&rsquo;s appropriate response to the representation
            of a scene of sympathy allows the reader to claim to
            possess sensibility. Thus, despite the decline of the "cult
            of sensibility," theories of sympathy continued to impact
            the novel.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="4"></a>4</sup> Thus,
            sympathy is inherently tied to questions of class identity
            and nationalism, issues also central to the resolution of
            the marriage plot in the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
            novel.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="5"></a>5</sup> Elizabeth
            Barnes&rsquo;s <em>States of Sympathy</em> is particularly
            useful here. In <em>States of Sympathy</em>, Barnes
            suggests that early sentimental seduction novels and the
            domestic fiction of the 1850s are connected by a common
            preoccupation with sympathetic identification: "Whereas
            seduction fiction depicts the middle-class family as a
            closed system&mdash;a nuclear and potentially incestuous
            unit based on the affiliation of blood ties&mdash;the
            domestic story represents the family as a collection of
            shared values and emotional experiences" (15). Cooper
            rewrites Radcliffe and Austen&rsquo;s sisters into friends
            to ensure that Louisa is, in effect, always already
            forgotten&mdash;exterior to the family unit of
            Templeton.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="6"></a>6</sup> Race is, of
            course, also a central issue in <em>The Pioneers</em>.
            Cooper locates the threat of miscegenation in his male
            characters, especially Oliver. Oliver&rsquo;s
            manifestations of an appropriate sensibility &mdash; his
            hand resting naturally on the piano, for example &mdash;
            assure Bess and the reader that the apparent markers of
            racial identity (his name and knowledge of their language,
            his time with Natty and Indian John) must be misleading.
            Cooper&rsquo;s conclusion not only erases the threat of
            miscegenation, but it reveals that Oliver is the rightful
            heir of Templeton, reinstating the importance of
            primogeniture in legitimating the new nation&rsquo;s claim
            to the American landscape.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="7"></a>7</sup> This is, as
            I will illustrate in the next section, complicated by the

            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="8"></a>8</sup> See, for

            English novel (after Defoe, Richardson, and Fielding) in
            the work of Jane Austen" (35).</p>

            Clemens and Brigitta Berglund also claim that Emilia
            contrasts Julia&rsquo;s sensibility.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="10"></a>10</sup> Even Kate

            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="11"></a>11</sup> This has
            become such a critical commonplace it seems almost
            unnecessary to offer sources, but, for the sake of
            illustration: see, for example: Kate Ellis, "Ann Radcliffe
            and the Perils of Catholicism" where she distinguishes
            between Catholic superstition opposed to pious sensibility:
            E.J. Clery reads this pedagogy in Marxist terms as enabling
            the reader to indulge in a consuming "passion that is
            economically desirable but morally problematic;
            happily...sublimated by the same means, in sympathetic
            identification with the virtuous and most immaterial
            heroine" ("Ann Radcliffe," 212). More straightforwardly,
            see Fred Botting, "<em>Dracula</em>, Romance and
            Radcliffean Gothic"; Scott Mackenzie, "Ann
            Radcliffe&rsquo;s Gothic Narrative and the Readers at
            Home," John Stoler "Having her Cake and Eating it Too,"

            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="17"></a>17</sup> There are
            two major critical camps: pro-Elinor and pro-Marianne.
            (However, within these critical camps is a strong tendency
            to insist that Austen troubles a simple division between
            sense and sensibility, or between Elinor and Marianne.) For
            pro-Elinor readings, see: James Thompson, Marilyn Butler,
            Stuart Tave, and Barbara Seeber. See also Alistair
            Duckworth and Mary Poovey. For pro-Marianne readings, see:
            Angela Leighton, Julie Shaffer, and Karl Kroeber. Laura
            Goodlad explicitly connects Austen to both the French
            Revolution and English nationalism: "Austen&rsquo;s early
            novel contrasts Elinor&rsquo;s ideal Englishness, a
            synthesis of "sense" and "sensibility" with
            Marianne&rsquo;s immoderate <em>Frenchness</em>" (60).
            Other readings of the novel, including Poovey, Kroeber,
            Butler, and Leighton, have argued that Elinor&rsquo;s
            reserve is Augustan, Classical, or in other ways outdated
            and is contrasted with Marianne&rsquo;s more modern
            Romantic sensibility. I argue, instead, that
            Marianne&rsquo;s sensibility is depicted as outdated,
            whereas Elinor&rsquo;s "sense" is progressive and tied to
            economics, rather than aesthetics.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="18"></a>18</sup> Scholars
            of this novel have addressed, rather extensively, the
            strange paradox that readers are sympathetic to Marianne,
            even though Austen appears to punish her excessive
            sensibility in the novel&rsquo;s conclusion. As Tony Tanner
            has noted: "As in behavior, so in language, Marianne gives
            an added dimension of warmth and vitality to the world of
            the book and Jane Austen was well aware of it" (96). Where
            Tanner and others struggle is in reconciling
            Marianne&rsquo;s sympathetic character with Austen&rsquo;s
            treatment of Marianne in the conclusion. I argue that this
            struggle comes from a critical forgetting of Elinor, who is
            alternately dismissed as an "overpowerful ideology that has
            limited value and that therefore deserves deauthorization"
            (Shaffer, 143), or as "the bearer of a more or less fully
            developed historical and national consciousness" (Goodlad,
            65).</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="19"></a>19</sup> See Tara
            Ghoshal Wallace&rsquo;s article, "<em>Sense and
            Sensibility</em> and the Problem of Feminine Authority,"
            for an interesting reading of Fanny, and other monstrous
            women in Austen. Wallace suggests that Elinor is actually
            aligned with authoritative figures like Fanny and Mrs.
            Ferrars and is emblematic of Austen&rsquo;s own authorial
            anxieties.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="20"></a>20</sup> Lauren
            Goodlad argues: "Nevertheless, the greatest irony, as we
            shall see, is that Austen&rsquo;s resort to the logic of
            Spivak&rsquo;s &lsquo;soul making&rsquo; project is less a
            defense against Marianne&rsquo;s emancipatory politics,
            than against the increasing sway of Lucy&rsquo;s bourgeois
            epistemology" (76). Although Lucy&rsquo;s desire to know
            how much everything costs is clearly a dark echo of
            Elinor&rsquo;s attempts to economize, it is Lucy&rsquo;s
            corresponding over-management of her own sentimental
            economy that the novel condemns.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="21"></a>21</sup> Marilyn
            Butler has argued that Austen&rsquo;s use of "free indirect
            speech" gives readers access to Elinor&rsquo;s point of
            view, rather than Marianne&rsquo;s (190). Similarly, Stuart
            Tave has claimed: "<em>Sense and Sensibility</em> is the
            story of Elinor Dashwood. The action of the novel is hers;
            it is not Marianne&rsquo;s and it is not equally divided
            between the sister&rsquo;s; it is Elinor&rsquo;s. The whole
            of Marianne&rsquo;s story is included within
            Elinor&rsquo;s: Marianne&rsquo;s begins later and it ends
            earlier"(96). However, both of these readings overlook the
            ways in which Elinor&rsquo;s narrative is packaged (so to
            speak) for Marianne&rsquo;s consumption.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="22"></a>22</sup> Strangely,
            despite consistent critical attention to and praise of
            Austen&rsquo;s use of language, critics have ignored this
            exchange between Elinor and Marianne. For discussions of
            Austen&rsquo;s use of language, see Thompson, Tanner and
            Kroeber.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="23"></a>23</sup> Laura
            Goodlad has interpreted Marianne&rsquo;s status as
            "mistress" as revealing "the potential complicities between
            domestic and imperial dominions"(76). But in 1811, the year
            of <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>&rsquo;s publication, the
            British Empire had just lost a colony (America), had
            mistakenly supported the French Revolution, and was about
            to enter the War of 1812. Rather than reading Marianne as
            emblematic of an ascendent imperialism, therefore, I argue
            that she is allied with an outdated feudal agrarian
            culture.</p>

            Additionally, Natty has trained Oliver to be both a good
            shot and a conservationist. Elizabeth&rsquo;s affection for
            and debt to Natty ensures that they both will abandon the
            "wasty ways" that had threatened the natural resources of
            Templeton.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="26"></a>26</sup> See, for
            example, Joy Kasson: "Elizabeth Temple&rsquo;s education
            shines more brightly when she is contrasted with simple
            Louisa Grant" (57); John Sheckter: "In <em>The
            Pioneers</em>, references to &lsquo;the delicacy of her
            sex&rsquo; and &lsquo;natural feminine timidity&rsquo;
            almost always occur in connection with the thoroughly
            conventional Louisa Grant, to contrast her lack of
            imagination and her cowardice with the energy and courage
            of Elizabeth" (41); or Abby Werlock, for a similar
            reading.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="27"></a>27</sup> Critics
            have been too quick to dismiss Louisa&rsquo;s potential as
            Bess&rsquo;s rival, as I will argue later.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="28"></a>28</sup> I use this
            term advisedly. I do not mean to suggest that Louisa is
            "better" than Bess &mdash; Louisa&rsquo;s racism and
            timidity are very unappealing qualities. Rather, I argue
            that Bess&rsquo;s class status is what enables her lack of
            fear (for Louisa&rsquo;s racism is really a sort of fear,
            rather than a belief in the inferiority of the other). By
            writing Louisa out of the novel, Cooper affirms class
            hierarchies at the expense of any alternative system of
            order, including both the religious hierarchy suggested at
            times by Bess herself, Richard Jones, and Reverend Grant,
            but also a similar secular hierarchy that would privilege
            Louisa&rsquo;s suffering as a mark of merit, rather than
            Bess&rsquo;s wealth.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="29"></a>29</sup> That
            Richard Jones is the chief advocate for the Episcopalian
            faith illustrates that the church itself has little power
            on its own.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="30"></a>30</sup> Although
            popular with the ladies, Monsieur Le Quoi is, admittedly,
            no prize. However, Louisa is here presented with the choice
            to be married; with Oliver she had no choice or
            opportunity.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="31"></a>31</sup>
            Natty&rsquo;s journey westward may be thought of as
            "progress," in opposition to Louisa&rsquo;s return east,
            which suggests a sort of regress towards England. However,
            Natty&rsquo;s age, his departure from the gravesite of
            Mohegan John and Effingham, and the narrator&rsquo;s claim
            that "He had gone far towards the setting sun" all point to
            a strange contradiction in Natty&rsquo;s journey westward:
            is he really "opening the way for the march of the nation
            across the continent" (456)? Or do all of these images of
            age and death gesture instead to a conclusion? Cooper seems
            to suggest both simultaneously; as Natty himself remarks,
            "Tis like the dead there, who thought, when the breath was
            in them, that one went east and one went west, to find
            their heavens; but they&rsquo;ll meet at last; and so shall
            we, children. --- Yes, end as you&rsquo;ve begun, and we
            shall meet in the land of the just, at last" (454). But it
            is impossible for Bess and Oliver to "end" as they have
            "begun," just as it is impossible for Natty to remain ahead
            of the "march of the nation" in his journey west. Instead,
            Natty and Louisa are each subsumed by the culture from
            which they attempt to differentiate themselves.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="32"></a>32</sup> We see
            this same pattern rehearsed in Catharine Maria
            Sedgwick&rsquo;s <em>Hope Leslie</em>, in which Esther
            declines any future offers of marriage once her engagement
            to Everell is broken off.</p>
