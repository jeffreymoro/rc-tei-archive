    <p>This volume of <i>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</i> includes an editor's introduction by <a href="#mitchell">Robert Mitchell and Ron Broglio</a>, essays by <a href="#mitchell">Robert Mitchell</a>, <a href="#broglio">Ron Broglio</a>, <a href="#baulch">David Baulch</a>, and <a href="#collings">David Collings</a>.</p>
    <p>This volume summarizes and utilizes the arc of Gilles Deleuze's work while turning it toward Blake, Kant, Shelley, and Wordsworth. It serves both as a primer for those not familiar with the idiosyncratic vocabulary and concepts of Deleuze as well as a thoughtful intervention in Romantic criticism in order to open up new terrain on travel, the sublime, and the revolutionary. Contributors include David Baulch on representation and revolution in Blake's <i>America</i>, Ron Broglio on Wordsworth and the picturesque narrative of encounter, and Robert Mitchell on P. B. Shelley's sublime, with a responding essay by David Collings. In an ongoing effort to make use of the multiple platforms of new media, Romantic Circles has provided audio of these essays. It is, we hope, one in a series of efforts at finding the proper utility of audiocasts.</p>

    <h3 align="center">About the Romantic Circles Praxis Series</h3>
    <p>The <b>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</b> is devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, <b>RCPS</b> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions of today. <b>RCPS</b> is committed to mapping out this terrain with the best and mo st exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist scholarship.</p>
