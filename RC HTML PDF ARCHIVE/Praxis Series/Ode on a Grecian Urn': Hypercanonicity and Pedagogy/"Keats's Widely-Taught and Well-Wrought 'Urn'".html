            <li><p>How one approaches Keats's ode in the classroom will depend, of course, 
              on the kind of classroom and the nature of the class. The hypercanonicity 
              of "Ode on a Grecian Urn" stems in part from its usefulness in various 
              pedagogical settings, from the British Romanticism survey to the Introduction 
              to Poetry class to the course on literary criticism. Like Wordsworth's 
              "Lucy" poems, "Grecian Urn" is a target text for exemplifying major 
              issues and ideas in British Romanticism, for studying the genre of the 
              lyric, and for illustrating various critical and theoretical approaches. 
              As James O'Rourke's recent <em>Keats's Odes and Contemporary Criticism</em> 
              has ably demonstrated, the poem is especially well suited to foregrounding 
              the debate between formalist, deconstructionist, historicist, and feminist 
              ways of reading and teaching.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>My own pedagogy, while eclectic, is biased toward formalism for several 
              reasons, including, inescapably, my early training in the New Criticism 
              and my reservations concerning the extra-literary direction of literary 
              studies over the last several decades. More importantly, however, one 
              tries to identify students' needs, and in my experience, students&#8212;and 
              I am not referring to ESL students&#151;have never been more in need 
              of learning how to read. I mean by "read" not just the ability to respond 
              with comprehension and sensitivity to what used to be called "poetic" 
              as opposed to "scientific" or "discursive" writing. I mean also the 
              ability to decode even mildly complex uses of grammar, syntax, and vocabulary 
              and thus to analyze and understand a written text on a paraphrastic, 
              much less a fully "literary," level. </p></li>
            
            <li><p>It will come as no surprise, then, that I spend a lot of class time 
              on "close reading," although I do not delimit that methodology in the 
              ways that Cleanth Brooks, Robert Penn Warren, and other New Critics 
              tended to do. I like to teach Keats's "Urn" in conjunction with "Ode 
              to a Nightingale," often assigning a preliminary writing assignment 
              (formal or informal) in which I ask students to discuss the two poems 
              with special attention to the endings of each. I focus on the endings 
              for some obvious reasons. For one thing, the notorious "who says what 
              to whom" problem in the "Urn"'s last lines still catches students&#8212;even 
              advanced students&#8212;by surprise. Many simply do not see the various 
              grammatical and syntactical possibilities for meaning at a first (or 
              even third) reading, nor have most ever thought about the material nature 
              of a text, the determinant role of editing, or the importance of publication 
              history. (The major Romantic anthologies all include commentary on the 
              "Beauty is truth, truth beauty" crux, although many undergraduates seem 
              opposed on principle to reading footnotes.) The "Urn" is an excellent 
              vehicle for introducing such things and for forcing students to pause, 
              in their headlong gallop toward subjective response or ideological pronouncement, 
              to ponder the grammatical and semantic relations between pronouns and 
              antecedents in the English language. </p></li>
            
            <li><p>Attention to the concept of closure implicates the concept of form 
              or structure, which opens up discussion of theme, tone, persona, diction, 
              and other formalist preoccupations. The anthology I use most often for 
              Introduction to Literary Study I, a foundation course for English majors, 
              includes the "Urn" in the chapter on "Word Choice, Word Order, and Tone." 
              My teaching points are not particularly original and are indebted to, 
              among others, M. H. Abrams's classic statement on "the greater Romantic 
              lyric." I tend to present the structure of the ode as processive, that 
              is, as revealing the persona's dynamic processes of thought and feeling 
              as they develop, line by line, from stanza one through stanza five. 
              I ask students to identify what they take to be definitive shifts in 
              the speaker's responses and thus in the argument and structure of the 
              poem. We usually agree, as do most critics, that stanza four marks a 
              fundamental formal and thematic turning point. The persistent questioning 
              of stanza one reappears, but directed now to a very different scene 
              with very different implications. Instead of a timeless and erotic Hellenic 
              pastoral in which the disparity between "deities" and "mortals" is inconsequential, 
              the speaker interrogates a religious sacrifice with its intrinsic reminders 
              of human mortality and limitation. The scene provokes him to imagine 
              a "desolat[ion]" beyond the capacity of the urn to picture or explain 
              and thus initiates the highly-wrought ambiguities of the closing stanza.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Comparing/contrasting poetic texts is a good way to teach reading 
              skills, and juxtaposing the "Nightingale" and the "Urn" encourages students 
              to make precise discriminations involving tone and theme. That one poem 
              ends in a question, the other in a declarative statement is a starting 
              point, and students usually identify the "Nightingale" as the more obviously 
              skeptical and "emotional" of the two poems. They come to a better appreciation 
              of the ambiguity and feeling in the "Urn," however, as we examine the 
              various tonal ironies of "brede," "overwrought," and "Cold Pastoral" 
              and the deceptive assurance of the "Beauty is truth, truth beauty" pronouncement 
              in stanza five. We then move back to the paradoxical portrayal of artistic 
              transcendence in stanzas two and three. Students rarely seem to notice 
              without prodding the problematic effects of the double negatives and 
              repeated "happy"'s in those stanzas but are eager to interpret them 
              when they are pointed out.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>An attempt to define as specifically as possible the tone of Keats's 
              "Urn" affords an opportunity to introduce the December, 1817 "Negative 
              Capability" letter. The letter as a whole, with its references to the 
              visual arts, its celebration of artistic "intensity," and its use of 
              the phrase "Beauty &amp; Truth," makes a useful commentary on the poem 
              and moves students beyond a reductively formalistic preoccupation with 
              the "words on the page." I ask students to apply Keats's ideas on Negative 
              Capability to the "Urn." Compared to the "Nightingale" (or "To Autumn"), 
              for example, does the poem "remain (sic) content with half knowledge"? 
              Does it achieve an aesthetic form, a "sense of Beauty," capable of "overcoming" 
              or "obliterating" its implicit "uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts"? I 
              also often introduce Coleridge's organicist view of "the balance or 
              reconciliation of opposite or discordant qualities" in chapter fourteen 
              of <em>Biographia Literaria</em> as another relevant theoretical statement. 
              We generally agree that the "Urn" achieves a degree of "negative capability" 
              or "balance" or what Brooks called "dramatic wholeness" greater than 
              that achieved in the "Nightingale" but less than that achieved in "To 
              Autumn." The point, of course, is not to construct an evaluative hierarchy 
              or come to absolute conclusions but to get students thinking carefully 
              about tone, context, and diction, and about their own critical and aesthetic 
              responses.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>In upper-division and graduate classes on Romanticism, I teach Keats 
              as a second-generation Romantic and foreground the skeptical idealism 
              that characterizes that belated generation. In such classes, I tend 
              to adopt a quasi-deconstructive critical stance, approaching the "Urn" 
              as a meta-text that comments self-reflexively on Romantic idealist aesthetics 
              and metaphysics. Using familiar deconstructive moves, I push students 
              beyond the more or less "balanced" ambiguity of a formalist reading 
              towards a more radically ambivalent interpretation that foregrounds 
              the unresolved (and presumably irresolvable) relationship between transcendent 
              meaning and material form. As a way of reading, deconstruction is particularly 
              well-suited, I think, to illuminate the textual complexities, if not 
              to evaluate the metaphysical, aesthetic, and emotional commitments, 
              of a Romantic idealist poetics.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Although I do not completely buy Paul de Man's distinction between 
              symbol and allegory, his equation of the symbolic and the aesthetic 
              works nicely as a way into Keats's ode. The poem strives to construct 
              the well-wrought urn as a symbolic form, as an eternal work of art capable 
              of representing the ideal perfections Romanticism attributed both to 
              nature and to Hellenism. The poem seeks to idealize the urn, that is, 
              as an embodiment (and thus an expression), as an incarnation (and thus 
              a revelation) of transcendent and intelligible meaning in a sensible 
              form. At the same time, however, the poem includes subtextual elements 
              (de Man would call them "allegorical") that put into question the very 
              possibility of an aesthetic symbolism uncontaminated by and transcending 
              temporal, material reality.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>In stanza one, for example, the urn is represented as both "historian" 
              and poet, but the speaker cannot decode the "flowery tale" it tells, 
              a readerly and writerly failure intensified, as already mentioned, in 
              stanza four. The tonal and thematic inconsistencies in stanzas two and 
              three also point to an underlying metaphysical and poetic dilemma. An 
              ideal order "far above" the exigencies of material human existence&#8212;including 
              attempts to "Pipe . . . spirit ditties" to a non-"sensual ear"&#8212;can 
              only be expressed in terms of the same naturalistic and sensual order 
              that the speaker desires to transcend. Vehicle obscures tenor, signifier 
              compromises signified, language deconstructs meaning.</p></li>
            
            <li><p> A similar problem unfolds in stanza five as the speaker seeks to 
              elicit from the urn a transcendental message both aesthetic and ontological 
              that will bring the poem to thematic and formal closure and that will 
              confirm the urn's (and the poem's) status as a revelatory Romantic symbol. 
              Not only is the revelation itself largely undecidable, however, but 
              the speaker's conflicting attempts at personification and apostrophe 
              betray, as figurative language so often does, his (and our) epistemological 
              uncertainties. Is the urn a "silent form" that leads us beyond intelligibility 
              (and speech) altogether, or is it a loquacious, even sententious "friend" 
              speaking a higher, but still explicable, wisdom? The speaker, like the 
              text, and like second-generation British Romanticism, can (indeed must) 
              desire an answer, but cannot know.</p></li>
