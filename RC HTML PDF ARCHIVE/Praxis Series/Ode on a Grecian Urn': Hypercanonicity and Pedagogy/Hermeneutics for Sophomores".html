          <ol>
            <li><p>I have taught the "Urn" in a variety of graduate courses, in upper-division 
              undergraduate Romantics surveys, in critical theory courses, and in 
              sophomore &quot;Great Books&quot; courses and British Literature surveys. 
              Because of what Jim O'Rourke calls its &quot;hypercanonicity,&quot; 
              students (and perhaps we their teachers) find it difficult to read the 
              poem itself, rather than simply rehearsing preconceptions. This difficulty 
              exacerbates a more general problem: students at all levels have difficulty 
              reading it as anything other than a narrative, having had little training 
              in either the historical development of the ode form or even the differing 
              interpretive demands of poetry and prose.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>In the fall of 2000 I had the luxury of addressing some of the relevant 
              formal and generic issues at length, in a graduate seminar at Auburn 
              University entitled &quot;Form and History in Romantic Poetry,&quot; 
              in part inspired by Susan Wolfson&#8217;s <em>Formal Charges</em>, which 
              had appeared the previous year. In that course we spent two classes 
              on the Romantic ode, using Paul Fry's <em>The Poet's Calling and the 
              English Ode</em>, Cyrus Hamlin's chapter on the ode in <em>Hermeneutics 
              of Form</em>, Stuart Curran's very useful chapter on the ode in <em>Poetic 
              Form and British Romanticism</em>, and some contemporary discussions 
              of the ode, including scattered comments from the poets themselves and 
              parts of Robert Lowth's <em>Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews</em>. 
              Having already done extensive work on the sonnet, we were able to explore 
              the theory that Keats's ode form developed out of his experimentations 
              with the sonnet, address the relation between the ode and the hymn, 
              discuss the form&#8217;s public vs. private status, test Curran's hypothesis 
              about the combination of Horatian and Pindaric elements (while reading 
              some Horace and Pindar in translation), and read it alongside some of 
              the other Romantic and pre-Romantic odes that Keats would have known. 
              With that background, the "Urn" pretty much taught itself.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Normally, however, the time for that kind of contextualization is 
              not available, and the challenges of teaching the poem in lower-division 
              courses are actually more interesting to discuss, if not always to face. 
              Getting students to read the poem in a sophomore British literature 
              survey with some degree of generic sensitivity takes up so much time 
              that I normally don't do a great deal of a great deal of detailed historical 
              contextualization. Am I therefore a closet New Critic in the classroom? 
              One of the questions Jim O'Rourke asked us to consider in this assignment 
              is whether we are new historicists in our research who &quot;fall back 
              into formalist New Criticism in the classroom.&quot; I will duck the 
              admission of bad faith that this question implies by asserting that 
              I am not, nor have I ever been, a new historicist. But New Criticism 
              (or rather the caricatured ahistorical straw man that is called to mind 
              by that appellation today) is not the only alternative to new-historical 
              discussions of material conditions and ideological displacements, and 
              I do see my own scholarly agenda, informed by a different use of history, 
              as relevant to my teaching of the "Urn."</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I am interested in hermeneutic theory, particularly as developed by 
              philosophers such as Hans Gadamer and Paul Ricoeur, with an emphasis 
              in my recent work on how questions of interepretation intersect with 
              questions of ethics. Therefore I like to look at the way past texts 
              and present readers speak to each other from different but intersecting 
              and historically conditioned horizons. I am not interested in what I 
              see as the impossible and incoherent task of reconstructing a work as 
              it was read at the time, a task that is incoherent on theoretical grounds 
              because it depends on a myth of historical objectivity that is in fact 
              a legacy of Romantic historiography, but also impossible on practical 
              grounds within the constraints of all but an advanced graduate course. 
              At the same time, I want to emphasize, rather than elide, the historical 
              distance between us and the poem, so I try to squelch any simple discussion 
              of how the poem is &quot;relevant&quot; to our time, with the goal of 
              enabling a less simple discussion of how interpreting such a poem from 
              the past might involve a kind of ethical practice that is in fact relevant 
              now.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>My interest in these hermeneutic issues may make my approach to the 
              "Urn" a kind of minority report, and it may mark me as old-fashioned. 
              I may also appear to be merely complicating the obvious, since much 
              of what hermeneutics does is bring to the surface the unstated assumptions 
              that guide interpretive practice, assumptions that often operate on 
              a more fundamental level than the specific interpretive methods of a 
              particular literary or cultural theory. However, I think the question 
              of how our interpretive horizons intersect with those established by 
              a past instance of particularly intense interpretive practice is exactly 
              what needs to be emphasized when teaching the poem, particularly in 
              a lower-level course such as a sophomore British Literature survey, 
              in which we are often engaged in the very basic work of teaching students 
              how to read. For many students this will be the only literature class 
              taken in college, and so it can be the one chance to demonstrate the 
              value of literary interpretation and to help them become somewhat more 
              self conscious about their own interpretive practices. I would argue 
              that the &quot;Urn&quot;'s &quot;hypercanonicity&quot; is at least partly 
              a result of the fact that it is so useful for this purpose.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>The "Urn" is a particularly good text for these issues because, like 
              all of Keats's odes, but especially the "Ode to Psyche" and the "Ode 
              to a Nightingale," it is so self-conscious about its own interpretive 
              practice. The speaker worries about how to read a &quot;flowery tale&quot; 
              that is directly apprehended (&quot;ditties of no tone&quot; bypassing 
              the &quot;sensual ear&quot; and piped directly to the &quot;spirit&quot;), 
              but which produces more questions than answers, leading to an explicit 
              message about beauty and truth, which is presented as a general statement 
              for future generations, but which is also clearly an end-product of 
              the speaker's interpretive moves throughout the poem. The poem is very 
              specifically concerned with the temporality of interpretation, in its 
              effort to interpret an object that &quot;speaks,&quot; albeit silently, 
              from the past, as the &quot;foster-child of silence and slow time,&quot; 
              with a message for the future.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>In spring 2002 I taught the poem in a sophomore British literature 
              survey (Romantics to the present) at Appalachian State University, in 
              which my guiding theme was how the authors we read interpreted the past. 
              For part of the semester we read A.S. Byatt's <em>Possession</em>, a 
              story of how two late-twentieth scholars unearth and relive a romance 
              between two Victorian poets, alongside a good deal of Romantic and Victorian 
              poetry, partly to help us maintain a double focus that is explicit in 
              Byatt's novel: we observed modern relations to past texts as we studied 
              how those texts engaged their own relation to various pasts. With very 
              little encouragement on my part, the &quot;Urn&quot; kept popping up 
              throughout the course well after we had &quot;done&quot; the poem, as 
              a touchstone for other works that treated and in some way idealized 
              a past. Some of the more obvious connections to the "Urn"'s treatment 
              of the past included Matthew Arnold's much more confident idealization 
              of a different brand of Hellenism, Swinburne&#8217;s juxtaposition of 
              the Greeks' quotidian sense of mortality with the illusions of Christianity, 
              and Yeats's aesthetic Byzantium.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>I open the discussion of the poem itself (once we have gone through 
              the text and untangled some syntax and vocabulary) by asking students 
              to explore how the poem is about interpretive strategies and the difficulties 
              they entail. We discuss heard vs. unheard melodies, the inadequacy of 
              &quot;our rhyme&quot; to reproduce the work of the &quot;Silvan historian,&quot; 
              and the disjunction between the spatiality of the urn's figures and 
              the temporality of the narrative implied by the speaker's questions. 
              Students are so used to reading according to a linear narrative model&#151;&quot;reading 
              for the plot&quot;&#151;that noticing this poem's failure to construct 
              a plot can usefully steer them away from seeing it simply as a story 
              with a moral at the end. Particularly if they have read more obviously 
              dialectical Romantic odes in which one section is opposed or even contradicted 
              by the next (the turns in Wordsworth's &quot;Tintern Abbey,&quot; or, 
              better yet, the successive contradictions of Keats's own &quot;Nightingale&quot;), 
              they can begin to see the poem as something other than a straightforward 
              narrative, in explicit opposition to the speaker's effort to perceive 
              the urn as the teller of a narrative. </p></li>
            
            <li><p>Some of this ode's interpretive self-consciousness comes with the 
              genre. Without going into a great deal of detail about the history of 
              the ode in English poetry, I ask the students to think about hymns, 
              a genre these North Carolina students, many with strong religious backgrounds, 
              do know something about (Fry's book has an excellent discussion of the 
              Romantic ode as displaced hymn). They can see that the speaker's effort 
              to connect with an idealization &quot;all breathing human passion far 
              above&quot; resembles a hymnist's effort to connect with a deity through 
              praise, thanksgiving, or supplication, but in this case the effort occurs 
              without the security of a religious community confident in the omnipotence 
              and benevolence of the idealization in question. It is easy for students 
              to see that this situation poses some particular interpretive difficulties, 
              and that the object of a hymn is to make a connection, not simply to 
              narrate a story, even as the speaker attempts to extract a narrative 
              from the urn and as the poem ends up narrating the poem's failure to 
              make the desired connection.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>My agenda is to view the poem as an attempt, or a series of attempts, 
              at a difficult and ultimately incomplete act of interpretation, rather 
              than as a statement or a narrative, and then to see how our interpretive 
              acts intersect with the poem's. Interpretation is always incomplete, 
              because of the finitude of any interpretive horizon, and Keats was more 
              aware than most of how his horizon is limited by his health, education, 
              and social status. The operative conceit of most Romantic odes (perhaps 
              with the notable exception of Keats's &quot;To Autumn&quot;) is that 
              the speaker is trying to connect with something that is by definition 
              beyond the speaker&#8217;s horizon, with the attendant Kantian problems 
              of accessing a noumenal realm inaccessible from the phenomenal: Wordsworth&#8217;s 
              past in &quot;Tintern Abbey,&quot; Shelley's Mont Blanc, Keats&#8217;s 
              nightingale.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>For the speaker of the "Urn," this generic interpretive difficulty 
              is exacerbated by the fact that his particular object of interpretation 
              is frustratingly both within and beyond his horizon. The sudden ability, 
              thanks to the imperial insensitivity of Lord Elgin, for someone like 
              Keats to view Greek artifacts directly in the British Museum, puts him 
              into the state of confusion expressed in &quot;On Seeing the Elgin Marbles 
              for the First Time,&quot; a poem I usually have students read with the 
              &quot;Urn.&quot; Keats is well aware that his knowledge of Greek language 
              and culture is second-hand, which adds to the already inconceivable 
              temporal and spatial distance imposed by what &quot;Elgin Marbles&quot; 
              calls &quot;the rude / Wasting of old time&quot; and the &quot;billowy 
              main.&quot; But at the same time, he is able to see these new examples 
              of &quot;Grecian grandeur,&quot; previously visible only in two-dimensional 
              pre-photographic reproductions, up close. The shock of this simultaneity 
              of temporal and spatial distance and proximity (a foreign but important 
              perspective for students brought up in the eternal present and presence 
              of video and shopping malls) is at the root of many of the speaker's 
              interpretive difficulties, as is evident in the oscillation between 
              the direct apostrophe in stanzas three and five and the distance implied 
              by the questioning in stanza four. A related phenomenon informs our 
              interpretive perspective. On a simple level, the poem is right there 
              in front of us but interpretively inaccessible in its historical distance. 
              The poem is also familiar and other in another sense: the poem's interpretive 
              horizon is different from our own but also partly constitutive of our 
              own, in the direct sense that our reading is conditioned by the poem 
              in front of us and in the indirect sense that our interpretive practices 
              are historically conditioned by phenomena that include Romanticism. 
              </p></li>
            
            <li><p>I try to get at these issues concretely by asking students to list 
              the difficulties and ambiguities that the speaker of the &quot;Urn&quot; 
              faces, and the difficulties that we face, and then look for points of 
              comparison and contrast. A sample list of interpretive difficulties 
              for the speaker might look something like this<br>
              <blockquote><strong>1.</strong> His inability to read the &quot;leaf-fringed 
                legend&quot;<br>
                <strong>2. </strong>The urn's refusal to identify the figures (&quot;what 
                men or gods are these?&quot;) that are, however, clearly visible.<br>
                <strong>3. </strong>Difficulties posed by the difference in genre 
                between the urn's tale and &quot;our rhyme&quot;; the impossibility 
                of constructing a narrative about the figures on the urn.<br>
                <strong>4.</strong> Whether to read the lovers' static relation as 
                unfulfilled or undying.<br>
                <strong>5.</strong> The frustration resulting from the desire to interpret 
                an iconic work, representative of a classical past.<br>
                <strong>6. </strong>How to evaluate the &quot;Urn&quot;&#151;is it 
                a &quot;cold Pastoral&quot; or a true &quot;friend&quot; or both?</blockquote>
            </li>
            The list of our own interpretive difficulties (which can legitimately 
            include what advanced students might see as &quot;dumb&quot; questions) 
            might look something like this:<br>
            <blockquote><strong>1.</strong> How do we make sense out of a poem that 
              is so unsure of itself, given the above?<br>
              <strong>2.</strong> If we are supposed to be those who hear the urn's 
              message in the future &quot;in midst of other woe&quot; than the speaker's, 
              how do we deal with the fact that our access to the urn is even more 
              mediate than the speaker's, since it is filtered through his poem? That 
              is to say, how do we read the message of truth and beauty? As a message 
              for us? As a construct of the speaker's? As a message for us mediated 
              by the poem?<br>
              <strong>3. </strong>Who is saying that last line and a half? Who is 
              the message of truth and beauty for and who is telling whom that this 
              is all we know and all we need to know?<br>
              <strong>4. </strong>Are we supposed to take seriously the equation of 
              truth and beauty and the apparent idealization of the Greek past? (The 
              students will have read the letter to Benjamin Bailey of 22 November 
              1817 in which Keats says, &quot;What the imagination seizes as Beauty 
              must be truth&#151;whether it existed before or not,&quot; a phrase 
              with plenty of interpretive difficulties of its own. The inevitable 
              discussion of ways to understand the relationship between the biographical 
              Keats and the speaker of the poem often occurs here.)<br>
              <strong>5. </strong>Why can't we agree on an interpretation of this 
              poem after all this time? The words are all right there in front of 
              us.<br>
              <strong>6. </strong>How do we evaluate the poem&#151;is it good art? 
              How do we know? What criteria do we apply? Can we really read all those 
              &quot;happy&quot;s in stanza three with a straight face?</blockquote>
            The lists have a number of things in common: both we and Keats find the 
            combined proximity and distance of the object of interpretation disconcerting 
            and question-generating. The speaker's difficulties foreshadow our own, 
            particularly if we take the poem literally and see ourselves as the future 
            addressees of the urn, living &quot;in midst of other woe&quot; than the 
            speaker&#8217;s after his generation has been wasted by old age. We address 
            the canonical poem with questions as the speaker addresses the canonical 
            urn, and, like the speaker, we find both maddeningly unanswerable questions 
            and &quot;cold&quot; general truths. We try to make a narrative out of 
            the poem, as the speaker tries to make a narrative out of the figures 
            on the urn, and we both are aware of the impossibility of that task. Our 
            evaluation of the poem is likely to be as ambiguous as the speaker's evaluation 
            of the urn.</p></li>
              
              <li><p>At the same time there are important differences. We probably aren't 
              as worried about the possible equation of truth and beauty, or about 
              an iconic ancient Greece, as Keats is. Even if we aren't new historicists, 
              we are interested in locating the poem within a cultural and aesthetic 
              milieu, rather than directly addressing a mysterious artifact. We have 
              a somewhat readable text before us&#151;a higher-order interpretive 
              act&#151;while his is a lower-order (in the sense of more &quot;basic&quot;) 
              encounter with an object that is translated into a higher-order text. 
              The speaker in the ode is singing a displaced hymn, we are writing an 
              interpretation.</p></li>
              
              <li><p>Am I imposing unfair assumptions about the homogeneity of the students 
              in this use of &quot;we&quot;? That's always worth talking about in 
              this kind of discussion. The fact of the matter is that the students 
              in this class were mostly white, middle-class North Carolinians between 
              the ages of 18 and 22; the &quot;we&quot; of the present reader might 
              have been factually more complex in a culturally more diverse setting. 
              However, the constitution of the &quot;we&quot; is not solely determined 
              by the cultural make-up of the particular interpretive community. The 
              poem itself, as a common object of interpretation, establishes a common 
              horizon for even a culturally diverse group of readers, as does the 
              syllabus and my own agenda. That double determination of the reader 
              (by both his or her culture and the context established by the class, 
              text, and teacher) gives us an interesting perspective on the second 
              list above: some of our interpretive difficulties stem from differences 
              between our cultural milieu and Keats's, such as our difficulty in taking 
              seriously the equation of truth and beauty, and our lack of reverence 
              for the Greek classical past as an ideal. (It's easier to generalize 
              about what &quot;we&quot; are <em>not</em> interested in than what we 
              are interested in.) The nature of these differences will vary with different 
              readers' backgrounds. Other difficulties are posed by the poem itself, 
              such as the actual ambiguities of language (the opening line's &quot;still&quot; 
              as adjective or adverb, the long-standing question of who speaks the 
              last line and a half) and the speaker&#8217;s unanswerable questions. 
              Still other difficulties result from the <em>fact</em> of historical 
              distance (as opposed to the <em>content</em> of the historical differences 
              between then and now), including the double mediacy of our access to 
              the &quot;Urn&quot;&#151;he's writing a poem about his encounter with 
              an urn, we are discussing our encounter with his poem about an encounter 
              with an urn&#151;and the need to evaluate the poem as a historical object 
              that has settled into a canon.</p></li>
              
              <li><p>We share a horizon with Keats in that we are pursuing an interpretive 
              path with him (both in following his interpretive moves in the poem 
              and in interpreting his poem as he interprets the urn), but an important 
              part of that shared horizon is an acknowledgment of otherness: the inaccessibility 
              to the speaker of the urn's story and even the message about truth and 
              beauty (spoken to future generations, not to him) mirrors, with a difference 
              in register, the distance between us and the poem. The poem is &quot;relevant&quot; 
              to us not because its concerns match our own, and definitely not because 
              we construct the text as we read it, but because the interpretive effort 
              it instigates will &quot;tease us out of thought&quot; in forcing us 
              to recognize the value of this shared interpretive work in a conversation 
              between past and present, as we also recognize the importance&#151;both 
              as a reminder of our horizon's finitude and as a reminder that there 
              are worlds beyond our own&#151;of a conversation with that which ultimately 
              resists interpretation. </p></li>
              
              <li><p>Am I universalizing the poem's &quot;message&quot;? Yes and no. No, 
              in that I'm seeing many of the poem's concerns, such as the equation 
              of truth and beauty and the Hellenistic ideal, as part of a historical 
              horizon most of us do not share. Yes, in that I'm trying to show that 
              the kind of interpretive work performed in and instigated by the poem 
              is, if not strictly a universal phenomenon, at least a legacy of Romanticism 
              that is still an important part of what we do. I admit that this hermeneutic 
              emphasis is partly a strategic choice, perhaps influenced by my role 
              as the chair of an English department, who by virtue of that role is 
              necessarily invested in the institutional context of teaching. Especially 
              at a time when university education is becoming more and more technical 
              and product-oriented, I think it is important to put in a word for interpretive 
              process as a good in itself, and as something worth conscious study. 
              It is true, as I say to prospective English majors, that the interpretive 
              skills you learn doing this kind of thing may get you a better job or 
              a promotion, but it is a more important truth that reading a poem like 
              Keats's "Ode on a Grecian Urn" forces you to become self-conscious about 
              your own interpretive processes. The point is not exactly that this 
              kind of interpretive self-consciousness will make us better people&#151;too 
              much self-conscious interpretation can stall action, ethical or otherwise, 
              and plenty of bad people are expert interpreters&#151;but that our education 
              toward ethical participation in society can in fact be advanced when 
              we simultaneously participate in and observe an interpretive process 
              that actively engages the otherness of the past, the finitude of the 
              interpretive horizon, and the desire to understand that which is both 
              immediately present and just out of reach.</p></li>
