            <li><p>In both survey courses and specialized seminars on Romanticism, I 
              like to engage students in the tension between the &quot;internal,&quot; 
              personal, romantic poem and its &quot;external&quot; participation in 
              the historical context. Particularly in discussions of hypercanonical 
              works, often presented as &quot;timeless,&quot; it is useful for students 
              to grapple with ways in which such a work can be reconstituted within 
              its historical moment. Interesting discussions and debates emerge since 
              students generally like to locate themselves in various camps, defending 
              the timeless work of art, defending the poem as solely the author's 
              personal expression, or just as adamantly reading the work as a public 
              statement, bound by its particular historical moment. Moreover, students 
              often see these modes of reading as incompatible. Is the poem a deeply 
              felt personal expression, or is it a public statement, having less to 
              do with the poet's emotional interior than it does with the volatile 
              politics of nineteenth-century England? Or does the poem's significance 
              reside in a transcendent realm of art, outside the bounds of history 
              or biography altogether? My goal is to allow for a discussion of the 
              poetry that can encompass all of these registers simultaneously. Naturally, 
              Keats's&quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; presents a remarkably rich site 
              in which to explore these tensions.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>At the point of the course when we get to the &quot;Urn,&quot; students 
              have noted that, for Keats, nature is the realm not only of the timeless 
              beauty of &quot;rocks and stones and trees,&quot; but also of sensuality, 
              sexuality, and notably of suffering and mortality - a perpetual curb 
              to any transcendent ideal. They have seen this exemplified most profoundly 
              in the Nightingale ode, and it is crucial to consider &quot;Ode on a 
              Grecian Urn&quot; in relation to this poem. Helen Vendler and others 
              have stressed that Keats's odes should be read in relation to one another, 
              and this holds particularly true for these two odes. It is useful to 
              remember that &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; follows the nightingale 
              ode in both the 1820 volume and in their earlier, first, publications 
              in <em>The Annals of Fine Arts</em>. In significant ways the second 
              ode, in Vendler's phrase, is &quot;as near a twin to the earlier ode 
              as one poem can be to another&quot; (<em>The Odes of John Keats</em>, 
              116). It answers and continues the first. The &quot;Ode to the Nightingale,&quot; 
              celebrates the &quot;immortal Bird,&quot; like the urn, as a generalized 
              ideal of beauty. In the <em>Annals</em> publications, however, both 
              poems are surrounded by essays by Hazlitt and B.R. Haydon which severely 
              criticize the aesthetic ideal promoted by Sir Joshua Reynolds and the 
              Royal Academy. Both Hazlitt and Haydon strenuously promote the verisimilitude 
              of the Elgin Marbles, their truth to nature, over what they cast as 
              the conceptual and artificial aesthetic favored by the Royal Academy, 
              which is treated in these essays as an extension of the corrupt Regency 
              government. (Haydon reminds his readers that it is no accident this 
              body is known as the <em>Royal</em> Academy.) Students have seen photocopies 
              of selections of these essays, as well as of the versions of the odes 
              printed in the <em>Annals</em>. They are familiar with some of the political-reformist 
              implications of this debate over &quot;legitimate&quot; aesthetic authority 
              and of the subtle innuendoes inherent in this discourse. In this context, 
              the tensions concerning the timelessness of a work of art and its engagement 
              with an historical moment are profoundly apparent as the <em>subject 
              matter</em> of Keats's odes. Students can see that Keats himself, in 
              these poems, is grappling with some of the same issues of art and meaning 
              that they are also now confronting. The title, for starters, of the 
              Nightingale ode, both in the <em>Annals</em> and in Keats's manuscripts 
              is significantly not &quot;Ode to a&quot; but to &quot;<em>the</em> 
              Nightingale.&quot; As Robert Gittings has pointed out the &quot;a&quot; 
              of the 1820 volume seems to have been the publisher's decision. Keats's 
              &quot;<em>the</em>&quot; presents a &quot;universal,&quot; which stresses 
              the timeless ideal of beauty represented by the nightingale&#151;beyond 
              the realm of suffering (detailed in stanza III) which Keats would escape. 
              Stanza III, however, anchors this visionary experience in an excruciating 
              awareness of human limitation. Students have devoted a good amount of 
              class time discussing how, with cold skill, these lines present a list 
              of unavoidable &quot;natural&quot; facts, facts the students must face 
              themselves, including age, loss of love, sickness, suffering and death, 
              all of which prefigures the failure of the imagined ideal in the final 
              stanza: &quot;Adieu, the fancy cannot cheat so well/ As she is fam'd 
              to do, deceiving elf&quot;! If the imagination can seem a &quot;cheat,&quot; 
              however, Keats is loath to rest with this. Here, in relation to the 
              poem's conclusion, I have the students consider Keats's concept of negative 
              capability. The concluding lines, students gradually note, leave us 
              hovering in an ambiguous, or negatively-capable, state in which the 
              transcendent ideal vies with mortal limitations for the last word: &quot;Was 
              it a vision? Or a waking dream? / Fled is that music? Do I wake or sleep?&quot; 
              The question mark after &quot;Fled is that music?&quot; (present only 
              in the <em>Annals</em> version) adds to the ambiguity. Naturally this 
              gives rise to an open-ended discussion, which suits well my goal of 
              unsettling students' desires for a single &quot;legitimate&quot; interpretation. 
              Does the music of the bird, and all its implications of transcendent, 
              eternal presence remain, merely unperceived by the &quot;dull brain 
              [that] perplexes and retards&quot;? Is its <em>absence</em> the illusion? 
              Set in relation to Hazlitt's and Haydon's discourses, the ode seems 
              less a duplication of their arguments than an active working out of 
              a critique. By both positing and unsettling universal ideals of beauty, 
              whether natural or conceptual, Keats marks his own place in the public 
              discourse, with an impassioned questioning of issues that deeply concern 
              him personally&#151;enmeshed with his own grappling with personal suffering, 
              and his personal poetic project. But also, in this &quot;timeless&quot; 
              work, Keats overtly participates in a contemporary public dialogue concerning 
              the potential meanings of art.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>This engagement with public issues, beyond the merely personal, continues 
              in the ode &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn,&quot; where the first-person 
              &quot;I&quot; of the Nightingale ode interestingly shifts to a more 
              distanced, subtly more &quot;objective,&quot; &quot;thou.&quot; The 
              ode has traditionally been read as <em>either</em> a successfully autonomous 
              poem celebrating an ideal of aesthetic beauty, or, more recently, as 
              an attempt at this goal but fraught with all the ideological contradictions 
              and paradoxes inherent to an idealist aesthetic. Paul Magnuson notes, 
              however, that this line of criticism &quot;has appropriated [Keats's] 
              poem for an ideology opposite that of the <em>Annals of the Fine Arts</em>,&quot; 
              and that &quot;the strange fate of the 'Ode On a Grecian Urn' is to 
              have become an idealized object, when its original context strongly 
              denied the existence of that ideal&quot; (<em>Public Romanticism</em>, 
              169). While the &quot;Ode to the Nightingale&quot; ambiguously keeps 
              the ideal in float, &quot;On a Grecian Urn&quot; echoes Haydon's and 
              Hazlitt's denial of a &quot;beau ideal,&quot; favoring a poetics of 
              sensation, and vehemently reconfiguring the ideal as emerging from the 
              empirical. Haydon (in a passage from the <em>Annals</em> I photocopy 
              for students), clarifies the debate in terms which frame Keats's poem:<br>
              <blockquote>There was but one period of art in the world which can be 
                said to approach perfection, viz. the period of Phidias [sculptor 
                of the Elgin Marbles], whose great principle was to restore every 
                object represented to the qualities and properties bestowed on that 
                object at its creation, adapted to its intellect or instinct, and 
                then to clear these qualities or properties from the results of accident 
                and disease, to their essential powers: thus, a god was only a human 
                being in his highest perfection, with the qualities of a human being 
                restored, and not violated; a horse, was characteristically a horse; 
                a cow, a cow, a dog, a dog; a fish, a fish, and so forth, essentially 
                and characteristically a horse, a cow, a dog, a fish; whereas in the 
                time of Alexander, and after that, in the time of the Roman emperors, 
                the artists then living wandered from the sound path, and attempted 
                to <em>elevate</em> nature, by a violation of many of her great principles, 
                and never suffered action or repose to have their due influence, if 
                that influence at all disturbed the <em>shape</em> of the figures 
                they represented, or the '<em>beau ideal</em>' of the human form they 
                had fixed on in their own minds as a standard of perfection. The figures 
                <em>then</em> produced have thus misled the world with false and pernicious 
                notions of ideal beauty; which were no other than making nature bend 
                to a capricious system, and never bending the system established to 
                the great and eternal laws of nature. The 'ideal beauty' of Phidias 
                was but to restore nature to the essential qualities given her by 
                God.</blockquote></p></li>
            
            <li><p>For Haydon and Hazlitt, the &quot;'ideal beauty' of Phidias,&quot; 
              means an ideal derived from nature&#151;as represented by the Elgin 
              Marbles. This &quot;natural&quot; ideal is posited against the later 
              Roman, and neoclassical &quot;beau ideal&quot; which would elevate nature, 
              presenting, in Hazlitt's words, the notion of an &quot;<em>ideal perfection</em> 
              which never existed in the world, nor even on canvas&quot; (Works, VIII, 
              144). Haydon's attention to &quot;<em>shape</em>,&quot; &quot;action,&quot; 
              and &quot;repose,&quot; and his emphasis upon natural objects cleared 
              of &quot;the results of accident and disease,&quot; articulate the central 
              tensions in Keats's ode. I pair students and have them examine the figures 
              represented on the urn. The figures are caught in action: in Bacchic 
              revelry bold lovers pursue &quot;Maidens loth,&quot; while a &quot;happy 
              melodist&quot; pipes &quot;songs for ever new.&quot; Students are quick 
              to note that, like the Nightingale, these figures represent a realm 
              of beauty, of sensual bliss at its peak, forever beyond the world of 
              flux and sorrow: &quot;All breathing human Passion far above, / That 
              leaves a heart high sorrowful and cloyed / A burning forehead and a 
              parching tongue.&quot; While fully natural in expression of active sensual 
              desire, the figures may yet, however, present a &quot;cheat&quot; in 
              that the permanence of their beauty is an atemporal fiction&#151;blissfully 
              freed from time and change, &quot;accident and disease.&quot; The question 
              emerges: what is Keats saying here about the truth or fictionality of 
              an ideal of beauty? At this point it is useful, again, to have students 
              review stanza III of the Nightingale ode in relation to the figures 
              on the urn. Ironically, the very pathos of this tension between mortality 
              and an immortal ideal heightens the beauty frozen on the urn. But this 
              is an ideal of beauty not bent to fit a &quot;capricious system,&quot; 
              imposed upon the natural, but one that recognizably emerges from the 
              full-blooded experience of human passion in action, caught at its height.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>The sacrificial procession in stanza IV furthers and deepens this 
              aesthetic dialectic, also engaging the volatile context of pagan religion. 
              Here I introduce students, briefly, to some scholarly commentary on 
              this mysterious stanza. As Ian Jack, in <em>Keats and the Mirror of 
              Art</em>, has shown, the stanza's imagery with its &quot;mysterious 
              Priest,&quot; and &quot;Heifer lowing at the skies, / And all her silken 
              flanks with garlands drest,&quot; derives in part from an Elgin frieze 
              which depicts just such a sacrifice. However, as Robert Gittings has 
              pointed out, it also echoes an article by Haydon. Haydon's article describes 
              and discusses a &quot;Cartoon&quot; (or drawing) by Raphael depicting 
              the &quot;Sacrifice of Lystra,&quot; a Biblical scene in which St. Paul, 
              who has just cured a cripple, looks with disdain upon a Priest and procession 
              leading a bull to be sacrificed in gratitude to Paul for his miraculous 
              act of healing. As Gittings notes, Haydon's description of the drawing 
              provides &quot;the garlanded heifer [here a &quot;Bull&quot;], the priest 
              and worshippers, the town emptied of its inhabitants to attend sacrifice, 
              even the players on the sylvan pipes, whom Haydon described as 'wholly 
              absorbed in the harmony of their own music' . . . Even the central theme 
              of the agelessness of art was put in almost the same words by Haydon, 
              who, passing on to the classical statuary of Michaelangelo, remarked 
              that they 'look as if they were above the influence of time; they seem 
              as if they would never grow old, and had never been young'&quot; (<em>Odes 
              of Keats and their Earliest Known Manuscripts</em>, 70).</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Along with these imagistic and thematic influences, the drawing, as 
              described by Haydon, significantly depicts a moment of tension between 
              paganism and Christianity. Haydon quotes the relevant Biblical passage 
              from Acts in which &quot;when the people had seen what Paul had done, 
              they lifted up their voices, saying . . . the Gods are come down to 
              us in the likeness of men.&quot; Haydon notes that the apostles were 
              mistaken for Mercury and Jupiter. The passage concludes with the apostles, 
              Barnabas and Paul, rending their clothes and crying, &quot;men why do 
              you do these things? We also are like you, and subject to the same infirmities, 
              and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the 
              living God, who made the heaven and earth and the sea, and all things 
              that are in them.&quot; Keats would also have relished the populist 
              message in the Biblical passage: the divine power of healing is not 
              imparted directly from hierarchically superior pagan divinities, but 
              is diffused through the agency of mortals: &quot;We also are like you,&quot; 
              cry Paul and Barnabas, &quot;subject to the same infirmities.&quot; 
              Students can continue to explore connections. This passage, for example, 
              complements Haydon's discussion (above) of the Phidian ideal in which 
              &quot;a god was only a human being in his highest perfection, with the 
              qualities of a human being restored.&quot; For Haydon, again, &quot;the 
              'ideal beauty' of Phidias was but to restore nature to the essential 
              qualities given her by God.&quot; But Keats's attention to the desolation 
              of the town, &quot;emptied&quot; this morning of all its pious inhabitants, 
              may also, in the context of epochal change, lament with Leigh Hunt, 
              in the latter's critiques of the corrupt national church, the passing 
              of such &quot;cheerful&quot; pagan piety, here bound up with the loss 
              of a more &quot;natural&quot; sense of aesthetic beauty. The urn, and 
              the ideal it presents, as the final stanza reminds us, is a relic of 
              antiquity, an &quot;Attic shape.&quot;</p></li>
            
            <li><p>In the final stanza, the &quot;Attic shape&quot; becomes a &quot;fair 
              attitude,&quot; a &quot;silent form&quot; that &quot;dost teaze [sic] 
              us out of thought / As doth eternity!&quot; Keats's pronounced attention 
              to &quot;shape&quot; calls up Haydon's key statement concerning the 
              neo-classical aesthetic, which &quot;never suffered action or repose 
              to have their due influence, if that influence at all disturbed the 
              <em>shape</em> of the figures they represented, or the '<em>beau ideal</em>' 
              of the human form they had fixed on in their own minds as a standard 
              of perfection.&quot; Disjoining the &quot;ideal&quot; from the human 
              figure and transposing this to the more purely abstract formal perfection 
              of the urn, Keats quite deliberately &quot;disturbs&quot; that shape, 
              imposing fully the dialectic of &quot;action and repose&quot; upon the 
              &quot;silent form,&quot; &quot;with brede / Of marble men and maidens 
              overwrought.&quot; At this point, when students are immersed in a multiplex 
              of possible interpretations, it is good to, once again, remind the class 
              of Keats's concept of negative-capability. A complex of double-entendres 
              and puns (&quot;attitude&quot; &quot;brede&quot; &quot;overwrought&quot;) 
              climaxes in the poem's crucial paradox, &quot;Cold Pastoral.&quot; Keats 
              holds the disjunctive energies of the poem in a tense equipoise: &quot;Perfection,&quot; 
              in this dialectic, exists not solely in the permanence of these figures 
              within an ideal work of art, but rather in conjunction with the exacerbating 
              impermanence of the fleeting scene they simultaneously represent and 
              belie. This scene exists forever, paradoxically, as a frozen moment 
              in the history of human passion, framed on this &quot;Attic shape,&quot; 
              and captured in the &quot;leaf-fringed legend&quot; of the urn as &quot;Sylvan 
              Historian.&quot; The &quot;truth&quot; equated with &quot;beauty&quot; 
              in the poem's concluding lines may be that of a &quot;timeless transcendent,&quot; 
              (similar to the neoclassical &quot;beau ideal&quot;), or of the &quot;time-bound&quot; 
              world of natural mortality (as in Hazlitt's and Haydon's verisimilitude&#151;a 
              beauty and truth arising out of nature). Or it may be both simultaneously, 
              hovering in Keatsian negative capability.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Introducing students to this kind of contextual reading unsettles 
              without demolishing the idea of the &quot;timeless&quot; classic. By 
              opening up possibilities of interpretation and understanding beyond 
              the boundaries of the work in itself, students begin to see that works 
              of art, particularly hypercanonical works, may give way to a multitude 
              of possible, responsible, readings, dependent on the version of the 
              work one is reading, and in what particular context(s). Indeed the continued 
              hypercanonical status of a work like &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; 
              may be owing to the poem's uncanny ability to comply with various readings, 
              to be several works at once.</p></li>
