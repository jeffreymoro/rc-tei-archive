            <li><p>Who is Keats? What is a Grecian urn? What is an ode? These questions 
              are common ones in my classroom. I teach Keats's poetry as part of a 
              third-year, twelve-week survey course on English Romantic Literature 
              in the School of English, Film, and Theatre at Victoria University of 
              Wellington, New Zealand, in the context of a three-year BA programme. 
              Two hours per week are devoted to lectures to the whole group of students 
              (53 in 2002); in addition there is a weekly one-hour tutorial, a discussion 
              session in groups of about fifteen. Three lectures and one tutorial 
              are assigned to Keats. Our textbook is Duncan Wu's <em>Romanticism</em> 
              (second edition; Blackwell).</p></li>
            
            <li><p>My students' ignorance of Keats and nineteenth-century British literature 
              in general has nothing to do with lack of brains or motivation. In order 
              to fulfil their English major requirement our students take two "pre-twentieth 
              century courses", a very modest requirement which leaves them, at the 
              end of their degree, likely to be just as familiar with New Zealand, 
              Australian, South African literature as with so-called canonical English 
              literature.<a name="text1"></a><a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a> "Ode 
              on a Grecian Urn" is generally not taught in secondary school, and at 
              university one can easily major in English without having come across any 
              of Keats's poetry. No wonder then that, while we as university teachers and researchers 
              think of Keats's poetry as canonical, burdened with jaded conservatism, the students, 
              who have consciously taken this course as a choice among many, are not burdened with such thoughts at
              all. For most of them, the encounter with Keats's poetry is an exciting discovery&#151;a new planet 
              swimming into their ken&#151;as opposed to imposition of an outdated canon.
            </p></li>
            
            <li><p> The fact that we still think of Keats as a canonical author, an inevitable, 
              and, in fashionably theoretical terms, unwelcome, jaded presence in 
              our curriculum may have something to do with the separation between 
              research and teaching which has become part of our profession. The theoretical 
              debate, and its research outcomes, about the problematic nature of the 
              canon was originally based on a particular curriculum of so-called masterpieces, 
              and the pedagogical, largely New Critical approach, associated with 
              it. For funding and prestige purposes universities in the US, the UK, 
              and the richer nations of the Commonwealth in general, have been moving 
              towards an apartheid system of lavishly paid, tenured full-time research 
              stars and underpaid, non-tenured adjunct instructors. Tenure and promotion 
              are, despite lip service to excellence in teaching, largely research 
              based, but research about pedagogical issues has become increasingly 
              divorced from any actual classroom practice. It is, ironically, possible 
              for a research professor to write about the theoretical context of pedagogical 
              approaches to "Ode on a Grecian Urn" without actually having to deal 
              with the poem in the classroom on any regular basis. The main challenge 
              for me as a tenured university researcher and teacher is to establish 
              and maintain a teaching-research nexus, a dynamic connection between 
              two aspects of my job, namely the exploration of and communication about 
              beautiful and stimulating Romantic texts. This process is an exchange 
              between the students and me, and any ideas or approaches which I may 
              hope to convey cannot be divorced from the responses and the contributions 
              of the students. Bearing the importance of a common meeting ground in 
              mind, I have decided that the tutorial is to be devoted to the close 
              reading of a poem, that it should be in other words an opportunity for 
              the students to encounter the poem itself (as opposed to critical writings 
              about the poem).</p></li>
            
            <li><p>The only difference between research and teaching is audience and the 
              knowledge or skills we expect our audience to have. In scholarly articles 
              I write for a community of peers who have a longstanding familiarity 
              with the period and its texts. In the classroom no assumptions about 
              specific prior or common knowledge of the materials can be made, but 
              the students do bring with them a range of living experiences which 
              influence their reading. Most remarkably, for the majority of them the 
              fact that Keats was writing when he was roughly their age strikes a 
              crucial chord, and this perceived sense of contemporariness makes their 
              study of Keats different from their perception of, for instance, Wordsworth 
              and Coleridge, the two other major authors in the course. Keats's youth 
              and tragically early death conspire with the immediacy of his letters 
              (so many of which emphasize empathy, discovery, passionate intensity 
              and the inevitable vulnerability which accompanies it) to attract students 
              who are in the first stages of independent adulthood themselves. In 
              "Ode on a Grecian Urn" the passionate intellectual curiosity of the 
              speaker appeals to the students. The reality that most of my students 
              "fall for" Keats, almost instantly like and admire him, is a tremendous 
              advantage. With Keats, more than with any of the other poets in the 
              course (with the exception perhaps of John Clare), the students are 
              fascinated by the combination of his personal and poetical qualities. 
              As a teacher I make the most of my students' partiality for Keats by 
              organizing my lectures and tutorials around the possible grounds for 
              this fondness. The quality which makes Keats most appealing to my students 
              is his openness to experience and its bafflements, his delight in articulating 
              the dynamics of trial and error in exploration and discovery, in encounters 
              with texts, nature, people, and artefacts such as Grecian urns. What 
              makes Keats specifically attractive to students who are about twenty 
              years old (or who remember what it was like to be twenty years old) 
              is the ardour of the pursuer as we find him or her portrayed in letters 
              and poems.<a name="text2"></a><a href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a> At the same time, 
              what makes Keats particularly admirable to young adults is his moral 
              intelligence, his striving for unselfish friendship and love, and his 
              acknowledgment of a complex picture which cannot be fully comprehended 
              or contained: "Things cannot to the will / Be settled, but they tease 
              us out of thought" ("Dear Reynolds, as last night I lay in bed", ll. 
              76-77) (181). In particular, in the classroom I address the same issue 
              which informs my own research about Keats: his ability to express the 
              necessity to give form to, to substantiate desire into a passion which 
              lasts beyond the moment by focusing on the dynamics and the energy of 
              encounters.</p></li>
            
            <li><p> I teach "Ode on a Grecian Urn" in a context which emphasizes Keats's 
              poetics of encounter and the passionate intensity which characterizes 
              these encounters. "Form" figures prominently, particularly so for "Ode 
              on a Grecian Urn," a poem about an artefact (a formal structure about 
              a formal structure). In a questionnaire conducted in the first trimester 
              of 2002 I asked my 53 ENGL 311 students to comment on what they found 
              most helpful and most enjoyable in their study of "Ode on a Grecian 
              Urn." Many students commented on how they enjoyed formal analysis in 
              a discussion-style tutorial ("coming to terms with the actual structure, 
              building blocks of the poem"). The "thing itself", the poem, is their 
              preferred starting point in discussion (as opposed to an article about 
              the poem), in very much the same fashion that the urn is in front (mentally 
              or physically) of the speaker of the poem. One student commented on 
              how this approach gives them all something "to sink their teeth into" 
              and how it gives them "a sense of ownership." In practical terms our 
              tutorial about "Ode on a Grecian Urn" takes initially the form of a 
              discussion about the plot of the poem (who is speaking? how does this 
              speaker address the urn? what does the speaker want? what does the speaker 
              "see" on the urn? how do we find out about this?), an approach which 
              I was introduced to in graduate school at the University of Illinois 
              at Urbana-Champaign in the Romantic seminars of Jack Stillinger and 
              the Professional Seminar on teaching literature of Nina Baym. First 
              of all, the advantage of this approach is that straightforward, supposedly 
              "fact" focused questions trigger discussion of more complex, ambivalent 
              questions. For instance, as we worked our way through the poem it became 
              obvious that the initial address, the initial substantiation of the 
              urn, goes through a process of transformation. From addressing the urn 
              in problematic human terms (unravished bride, fosterchild, sylvan historian), 
              the speaker ends up acknowledging the urn as an artificial, but stimulating 
              presence to human eyes ("a friend to man"). The initial encounter, a 
              very one sided tribute from the speaker to the urn in the opening lines, 
              has been turned into an affirmation of a dynamic in which beauty and 
              truth need to be couched in an interpretive act of the beholder. Secondly, 
              the "plot" approach also ensures that we do not take any of the ingredients 
              of the poem for granted. The idea of a "Grecian urn", for instance, 
              is not necessarily familiar to the students; overheads and illustrations 
              are brought in (based on those in Ian Jack's <em>Keats and the Mirror 
              of Art)</em> to give an idea of the kinds of materials which may have 
              inspired Keats.</p></li>
            
            <li><p> The initial anthropomorphic "loneliness" of the urn is replaced at 
              the end of the poem by an affirmation of its formal features (shape, 
              attitude, brede of marble men and maidens, silent form, cold pastoral). 
              The speaker's recognition of the urn's form substantiates its meaning 
              of beauty and truth for those who view it. The fictional little town, 
              the urn's original home, is a representation of a possible living context 
              from which the urn has been lifted. The importance of context for the 
              Grecian urn and the problem of substantiating it within formal constraints 
              can be extended to Keats's larger cultural context. This is where the 
              lectures are useful: Keats's literary and cultural context, his reading 
              and thinking are directly related to the poems.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>The first lecture is devoted to a number of points, all of which clarify 
              Keats's context and which illustrate the differences from, primarily, 
              Wordsworth's and Coleridge's poetics. Keats's friendships with Leigh 
              Hunt and Benjamin Robert Haydon introduced him to <em>The Examiner</em> 
              and <em>The Annals of the Fine Arts</em>, in which "Ode on a Grecian Urn" 
              was first published. The political connotations of <em>The Examiner</em> 
              and the larger cultural context of <em>The Annals</em> are briefly considered 
              By considering some of the major letters (truth of the imagination, 
              human life as mansion of many apartments, poetical character and chameleon 
              poet, negative capability) and sonnets ("Chapman's Homer", "When I have 
              fears", "On sitting down to read King Lear"), I stress the importance 
              of reading and formally articulating a response to reading in Keats's 
              work. Reading Homer through the lens of an Elizabethan, re-reading Shakespeare, 
              reading the sky for new planets all affirm the importance of exploration 
              and discovery which is channelled in a poetical form. Those processes 
              often take the form of a greeting, a salutation which incorporates a 
              sense of astonishment and confirmation at the same time. Before moving 
              on to the odes we spend some time on "The Eve of St Agnes" and "La Belle 
              Dame Sans Merci." Both poems are read primarily for their portrayal 
              of sexually charged encounters which do not conform to fairy tale scenarios 
              despite the formal markers of romance. Both poems also portray problems 
              which the main characters face when attempting to substantiate their 
              desire into tangible reality. "Isabella" and "Lamia" would also be good 
              choices here. The possibly tragic vision implicit in these poems is 
              counterbalanced by the intensity of characters or speakers to substantiate 
              their desires into actual encounters which accommodate these desires. 
              Isabella's fervent digging, Lamia's painful transformation, Madeline's 
              loss of control over her ritual all suggest the breakdown, or the transcendence, 
              of boundaries of embarrassment or social decorum (which is also what 
              we witness on the urn to some extent). Because of time constraints I 
              usually leave out "Lamia" and the <em>Hyperions</em> altogether in favor 
              of focusing on the odes as a group in the second lecture.</p></li>
            
            <li><p> The odes stage encounters between speakers and concepts (Psyche, 
              nightingale, urn, autumn, melancholy) in which the speaker needs to 
              accommodate or substantiate the addressed abstraction or form. For "Ode 
              on a Grecian Urn" I emphasize how difficult it is to attribute meaning 
              to something which has been taken out of its original context. Problems 
              of context are a major issue for museums, and for the students it comes 
              as quite surprise that public access to works of art, by way of the 
              museum, was a relatively new experience in Keats's time. As James Heffernan 
              pointed out, Keats's ode on the urn "was made possible by the collections 
              of classical vases and marbles Keats saw at the British Museum, founded 
              in 1753, which acquired the vases in 1772 and the marbles (from Lord 
              Elgin) in 1816, just three years before Keats wrote his ode&quot; (93). 
              The frustration of fragmentation, of isolation, is also part of the 
              debate surrounding the then recently acquired Parthenon marbles by Lord 
              Elgin, as their originality was championed by Benjamin Robert Haydon 
              in the pages of <em>The Annals of the Fine Arts</em>. And for the middle 
              class consumer, the taste for Grecian urns was also catered for by the 
              tremendously popular Wedgwood pottery. In the lectures I try to illustrate 
              that there was indeed a cultural context for Keats's poems to originate 
              in.</p></li>
            
            <li><p> The focus on context, both in tutorials and lectures, emphasizes 
              that banal generalities such as "beauty" and "truth" can only be substantiated 
              by the interpretive act of the beholder. The fragmentation which befell 
              the Parthenon Marbles after having been removed from their context is 
              also applicable to the urn in the poem, which has been lifted out of 
              its original context into a world of artifice, the museum pedestal or 
              the engraving. When I saw the Parthenon Marbles in the British Museum 
              in April 2002, I was impressed by the video set-up in an adjacent room 
              which illustrated the position of the marbles on the original building. 
              The evocation of the sacrificial ritual and the little town in stanza 
              four of "Ode on a Grecian Urn" serves a similar purpose of creative 
              reconstruction. For Keats, "Truth" is always the "truth of the imagination," 
              the positive construction of a desired vision, and the resultant "Beauty" 
              is the enduring form in which this vision has been cast. What we achieve 
              in the classroom or in the lecture theatre is a creative, dynamic reconstruction 
              of the contexts in which Keats's poetry took shape.</p></li>
