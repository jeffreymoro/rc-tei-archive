            <li><p>When James O'Rourke asked me to contribute to this forum, I reacted 
              with a spasm of embarrassment. What could I say that I hadn't said already? 
              Except for some local adjustments, I hadn't fundamentally changed my 
              way of reading or teaching &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; in almost 
              25 years. It was Keats's odes that made me an English major, inspired 
              my doctoral dissertation, shaped my first book. A key concern in one 
              of my first articles was the dynamics of reading "Ode on a Grecian Urn." 
              The poem has always been on my syllabi, not just for Keats's sake, but 
              as a primer of what may be gained by ear industrious and attention meet&#151;those 
              pleasurable labors of careful reading, not as a search for information 
              or an occasion for exposures of ideology, but as a tracking and tracing 
              of language as event, as field of play, as a discovery of indeterminacy 
              in the desire for determinations. My branchings out therefrom have been 
              numerous, infused by gender criticism, new historicism, textual scholarship 
              and theory. All this new growth can still be mapped on to "Ode on a 
              Grecian Urn," and my teaching has developed therefrom, too. At the same 
              time, I have to say, the core is still close-reading, however much the 
              curricula have shifted. Preparatory to writing this essay, I revisited 
              the essays from which I learned how to read this Ode: the incisive description 
              of the dramatic arc in Jack Stillinger's &quot;Imagination and Reality,&quot; 
              and the engagements with rhetoric and language in Kenneth Burke's &quot;Symbolic 
              Action,&quot; Cleanth Brooks's &quot;Keats's Sylvan Historian: History 
              Without Footnotes,&quot; Stuart Sperry's &quot;Romantic Irony,&quot; 
              David Perkins's &quot;Keats: The Uncertainties of Vision.&quot; I liked 
              these essays as much as I ever did. One thing I'm not embarrassed about 
              is my pleasure in still recommending this lucid, and lucidly debatable, 
              work to my students.</p></li><li><p>I also decided to sit down and reread my reading of the Ode in <em>The 
              Questioning Presence</em>, a prospect I faced with wincing apprehension 
              rather than any narcissistic clucking. I articulated this reading in 
              the late 70s and early 80s, when the disorientations of deconstruction 
              were prevailing over the orientations of orthodox new criticism, and 
              when the feminist and new-historicist views of Romanticism and then 
              of Keats that have mattered a great deal to me since were not yet in 
              play. I guess it's the unreconstructed formalist in me, but I found 
              I still like the close reading of poetic events, even if I'd write it 
              up a bit differently now. I'm still impressed by the way Keats mobilizes 
              the ode's linguistic activity&#151;of words, of syntaxes, of poetic 
              forms&#151;to shape for his reader an analogue for his speaker's encounter 
              with the figures and configurations on the urn, an encounter described 
              in projections of desire that fail to tease out a certain or stable 
              legend for understanding. This reflexiveness involves not only a phenomenology 
              of reading (Wolfgang Iser's phrase for the unfolding of meaning and 
              meanings) but also (in ways that don't always interest Iser) ironic 
              relays on the frustrations of reading. The ode's inception in questions 
              leads to a witty interrogative trial of contradictions and, ultimately, 
              an answer that is no answer, but a circular statement (&quot;Beauty 
              is Truth, Truth Beauty&quot;) that, for all its subsequent canonization, 
              including a chiseling on the walls of the Library of Congress, turns 
              out to be as baffling as the circular urn itself.</p></li><li><p>Without rehearsing the reading in <em>The Questioning Presence</em>, 
              I'd like to review a couple of phases that students enjoy puzzling over. 
              I was, and am, interested in the way certain key lines in the ode, about 
              reading as the attention of eye and ear, figure doubly, not only for 
              eye and for ear, but also in the doubling of urn-reading and ode-reading. 
              In the wake of that initial barrage of questions (&quot;What leaf-fring'd 
              legend haunts about thy shape of . . .?&quot;), Keats has the frustrated 
              questioner step back, in a new stanza, to theorize (maybe to ravish) 
              the productivity of its unyielding silence:<br>
              <blockquote>Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, 
                play on;<br>
                Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone: 
                (11-14)</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>Keats deftly plays these lines past the sensual ear (its pleasures 
              baffled by the atonal, slant rhymes) to the readerly eye: the word <em>ear</em> 
              appears folded into end<em>ear</em>'d, as if to configure, visually, 
              and to echo faintly the audience of an inner ear, more endeared to silence. 
              It matters that this ear-echo is not registered by the first line's 
              rhyme-framing by &quot;Heard . . . unheard,&quot; words that contain 
              the spell of <em>ear</em> but refuse the sound. To &quot;canopy the 
              heard&quot; (that's how Keats first wrote out this line from Shakespeare's 
              Sonnet 12 in a letter to fellow poet Reynolds; 22 November 1817), Keats 
              puts forth a visual semiotic, a shape of letters. The visual double-play 
              also shapes the other rhyme that refuses to satisfy an ear for harmony: 
              <em>play on</em> / <em>no tone</em>. With a preliminary patterning from 
              the &quot;Not to&quot; that frames the front of this qualifying clause 
              (11), the visual text of &quot;no tone&quot; is on the verge of playing 
              (to the eye) &quot;not one.&quot; This spell of words isn't the issue 
              of my overworking brain: the verse that follows in this stanza is famously 
              not one, but a sustained equivocation of description (&quot;Though . 
              . . yet . . . / . . . though&quot;) about the urn's eternal stasis, 
              in which (male) erotic desire is simulcast both &quot;for ever&quot; 
              and &quot;never never.&quot; Not one, but two ways of reading, for ever 
              contradictory and never to be disjoined: this may not be all ye need 
              to know on earth, but in the beholding of the urn, it is all ye know. 
              <br>
              <br>
            <li>In a new stanza, Keats has his urn-reader try gamely to shake off 
              this toil of double information by pushing everything--trees, melodist, 
              and especially, lovers--into a &quot;for ever,&quot; a &quot;happy, 
              happy&quot; eternity of art. At the same time, Keats himself tunes and 
              tones the verse to suggest urn-reading in overdrive, and plots its accelerating 
              gradations of happiness toward a sharp reverse. This reversal happens 
              in a shift of syntax as much as on the level of cognition. A virtually 
              panting urn-reader depicts the lovers.<br>
              <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
                ever panting and for ever young;<br>
                All breathing human passion far above,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and 
                cloy'd,<br>
                A burning forehead, and a parching tongue. (27-30)</blockquote>
            </li>
            With considerable syntactic momentum in the phenomenology of reading, 
            the poem-line &quot;All breathing human passion far above&quot; solicits 
            regard as the summary description of the world for ever on the urn. &quot;Breathing&quot; 
            even seems part of the train of participles also involved with breath 
            (&quot;piping,&quot; &quot;panting&quot;): All are breathing human passion 
            on a plane far above mortal humanity. OK, the semicolon after &quot;young&quot; 
            (27) seems to mark a syntactic divide; but not necessarily. The stanza's 
            second and fourth lines (&quot;. . . nor ever bid the Spring adieu;&quot; 
            / &quot; . . . songs for ever new;&quot;) end in semicolons that register 
            mere pauses to catch one's breath in the heat of ardent pursuit. Two manuscripts 
            (George Keats's and Charles Brown's), moreover, show just a comma after 
            &quot;young.&quot; All this tentative punctuation helps credit the sensation, 
            on first looking into the line, that &quot;All breathing human passion 
            far above&quot; is a summary of the developing surmise. Earl Wasserman, 
            for one, never doubted it: &quot;The love is indeed a human passion, and 
            at the same time it is far above all mutable human passion,&quot; effecting 
            in the &quot;syntactical oxymoron&quot; an analogue to the &quot;mystic 
            oxymoron&quot; of &quot;mortal and immortal&quot; in synthesis (<em>The 
            Finer Tone</em> 39-41). But where he sees Keats stumbling, caught and 
            bewildered in oxymoron, I read a melodious plot: Keats has set up the 
            line up to woo us with the oxymoron Wasserman discerns; then, at the line's 
            turn, pivots its information into the human differential. &quot;Breathing&quot; 
            gets divorced from the company of piping and panting, and gets wed to 
            the ensuing somatics of human passion, &quot;burning&quot; and &quot;parching,&quot; 
            while the possibility of &quot;far above&quot; as a location in imaginative 
            surmise subsides to a sighing recognition of high aesthetic privilege, 
            from which mortal humanity is excluded. This drama of syntactic reorientation 
            plays out for the ode-reader the recognitions that signal the urn-reader's 
            impending disenchantment, and for both, the stage is set for recuperated 
            reading. What is absent &quot;for ever&quot; in urn-worlds is a speaking 
            historian of a particularly poetic cast: &quot;not a soul to tell / Why 
            thou art desolate, can e'er return&quot; (39-40)&#151;the last syllable 
            calling us back, by rhyme, to the title of poet's telling, &quot;Ode on 
            a Grecian Urn.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            <li>As I reviewed my reading in <em>The Questioning Presence</em>, I actually 
              wound up rethinking, refining, revising and rewriting it--an activity 
              that seems to me an extension of, or the promised epiphenomenon of, 
              the dynamics of reading that Keats's ode teaches. Even as my returns 
              to the &quot;Urn&quot; have branched out into gender criticism, new 
              historicism, and textual theory, I've continued to keep company with 
              those for whom reading, by which I mean the close attention that constitutes 
              literary pleasure, remains important. I've become a better reader of 
              <em>Ode on a Grecian Urn</em> by reading it with Peter Manning, with 
              Garrett Stewart, with Grant Scott, among others. And I'm more confident 
              about why the Ode matters to me in these lively and productive textures 
              from working out with the oppositional force of Jerome McGann's critiques. 
              </p></li><li><p> These days, I make more than I used to (twenty years ago) of the 
              gender-marking of questioning and interpretation in the spectatorial 
              drama of the Ode: a male poet, the female object he would ravish, the 
              heightening of his aggression, and perhaps disdain, in relation to her 
              refusals. Students (teenagers and twenty-somethings that they are) take 
              well to the invitation to think about reading as an activity energized 
              by desire and prospective satisfaction. I raise some questions from 
              the start: To what degree does a poem such as this require a reader 
              both to play the part of a desiring young man and to imagine the focus 
              of desire as female? What is gained by this gendering? How would the 
              Ode be different if these positions weren't gendered, or differently 
              gendered? How does your agreement to play the male part, even if implicit, 
              unrecognized, untheorized (unfelt, unheard, unseen), affect your sensitivity 
              to the ironies of expectation and effect in the poem's play of language? 
              Do we women read this eroticized drama with more alienation (or theatricalized 
              alterity) than men? Questions about gender are one way of demonstrating 
              how reading is inflected by who is reading, in what sort of circumstance, 
              with what sort of culturally induced habits and expectations. Though 
              the words on the page may be what they were in 1819 or 1820, they can 
              spell out different systems of meaning, new configurations of information, 
              depending on the energies, attentive interests, and even ideological 
              formation of the readers.</p></li><li><p>This is what new-historicist criticism, with a particular vigorous 
              and not always sympathetic focus on Keats, asked us to reflect on. And 
              yet, while I am surely much more historicist than I used to be, the 
              new historicist handling of Keats's odes has had less consequence for 
              me, partly because it has seemed to require a flattening out of ironies 
              and complications&#151;or, if not a flattening, then a consignment to 
              the false consciousness of aesthetic ideology, which (the story goes) 
              purchases these complexities with an evasion of historical contradictions. 
              So even McGann's landmark essay, &quot;Keats and the Historical Method 
              of Literary Criticism,&quot; which provocatively situated Keats's aesthetic 
              practices and their history of reception within determinative cultural, 
              social, and especially political contexts, has not really altered what 
              I do with the poem in the classroom. My engagement with questions of 
              &quot;history,&quot; in fact, tends to show deconstructive roots. When 
              I first wrote about the Ode, I was caught by the poet's epithet for 
              the Urn, &quot;Sylvan historian&quot;&#151;a historian, as Cleanth Brooks 
              put it in what I still think is one of the best ever essays on the poem, 
              who proceeds &quot;without footnotes.&quot; What's at stake (I wondered) 
              in Keats's projection of a chronicler and a mode of chronicle in contradiction 
              to temporality? (That's what history's about: events, a narrative of 
              events.) The Urn emerges from some obscure history, but how can something 
              unspeaking (except perhaps in a summary banality), displaying a static, 
              unchanging tableau, be hailed as a &quot;historian&quot;? When I looked 
              into the etymological history of &quot;history,&quot; I suspected that 
              Keats might not only have anticipated this protest (he's always ahead 
              of his readers this way) but also wanted his readers to think of their 
              engagement as proto-historiographic. <em>Historia</em>, I found, comes 
              from a Greek word for &quot;learning or knowing by inquiry,&quot; inquiry 
              naming not only the method but also its motive. Historians develop histories 
              from the questions they ask, the questions they're moved to ask, want 
              to ask, burn to ask. The poet who addresses the Urn as a &quot;Sylvan 
              historian&quot; and then, in this opening stanza and stanza IV, produces 
              ten questions himself, is a rival historian, working in a medium of 
              unsylvan rhyme. And since his questions, students tend to see, are simultaneously 
              posed for our interest, we start to think about reading as a mode of 
              questioning, about history as determined by the questions we ask.</p></li>
              
              <li><p>A reading of the ode as a reflection on history-making was not what 
              the new-historicist &quot;historical method&quot; was after; its focus 
              was on the determinative contextual forces that produce the text and 
              the story of its readings. What this agenda means for the 1820 <em>Lamia</em> 
              volume (and its odes) is that Keats&#151;still smarting from the abuse 
              his first two volumes suffered from his association with Hunt as well 
              as his own Cockney insurgency (his outsider bid for legitimacy)&#151;cast 
              "Ode on a Grecian Urn" &quot;not to provoke but allay conflict&quot;: 
              it's part of a &quot;reactionary&quot; (by 1819 lights) endeavor &quot;to 
              dissolve social and political conflicts in the mediations of art and 
              beauty&quot; (McGann 53). Not for nothing did Keats shun Hunt's <em>Examiner</em> 
              (even Hunt's <i>Indicator</i>) to debut his poem in <em>Annals of the 
              Fine Arts, for MDCCCXIX</em> (4 [January 1820]: 638-39), edited by his 
              friend B. R. Haydon, noted champion of the British government's acquisition 
              of the Elgin Marbles. When the poem appeared in the <em>Lamia</em> volume, 
              its title added a first word, "Ode," that affiliated it with "Ode to 
              a Nightingale" (which it followed), "Ode to Psyche" (which followed 
              it), "Ode" (&quot;Bards of Passion and of Mirth&quot;), a few pages 
              on; "Ode on Melancholy," the last poem of the sub-unit of &quot;Poems&quot;; 
              and even "To Autumn," just before "Melancholy," and evidently an Ode. 
              For McGann, these aesthetic assignments amount to de-politicizing, even 
              anti-politicizing moves. &quot;The ode's urn,&quot; he proposes, &quot;is 
              placed before its readers (both past and present) as an ideal example 
              of such vases,&quot; the example standing for the idealism of Romantic 
              Hellenism, which understands Greek art as producing &quot;perfect and 
              complete embodiments of a perfect and complete idea of The Beautiful&quot;&#151;an 
              understanding to which the Ode is allied by force of its initial publication 
              in <em>Annals</em>, &quot;one of [the] age's chief ideological organs 
              for disseminating such ideas&quot; (44).</p></li>
              
              <li><p>As interested as I am in the contexts of publication and reception, 
              I have found this containment of the Ode a distortion. If the Ode evokes 
              this ideal, I'm not persuaded that this is the same thing as saying 
              that it is a straightforward example of it: the play of the poetry also 
              frustrates it, ironizes it, maybe even subverts it--possibilities that 
              don't interest McGann except as aspects of the dangerous illusion of 
              aesthetic self-criticism. I always give McGann's bracing critiques to 
              graduate students; but I hesitate to key my undergraduates' discovery 
              of the poetry to his report on <em>Annals</em>-ideology, nor, especially, 
              do I want to encourage them to assume (at least not without a struggle) 
              that the Ode is out to embody a perfected ideal, let alone finds that 
              leaf-fringed legend in &quot;Beauty is truth, truth beauty&quot; (45; 
              McGann doesn't quote the <em>Annals</em> text, but the <em>Lamia</em> 
              one). What I like about Keats's wit here (in my Garrett Stewart mode) 
              is the way &quot;leaf-fringed&quot; slides into &quot;leaf-ringed&quot;&#151;the 
              unknown information &quot;about&quot; the shape of the Ode that is (to 
              me anyway) only desperately, only problematically, translated by the 
              syntactic ringing of &quot;Beauty is Truth, Truth Beauty.&quot;</p></li>
              
              <li><p>This ringing utterance brings me to my branchings out into textual 
              criticism&#151;an interest related to, but not equivalent to, the historical 
              motivations for textual choices and the history of reading about which 
              McGann cares (it's no coincidence that he is an important editor, too). 
              The textual tangle comes into focus for students (undergraduate as well 
              as graduate) when we get to the famous closing lines that are so launched 
              (49-50). The 1820 <em>Lamia</em> volume (whose production Keats was 
              too ill to supervise and so was managed by advisers to his publishers) 
              has lower-cases after the first <em>Beauty</em>. The text in <em>Annals</em> 
              (which Keats could have supervised) reads:<br>
              <blockquote> Beauty is Truth, Truth Beauty.&#151;</blockquote>
            
            Although capitalization, especially up through the nineteenth century, 
            might be (usually is) regarded as an &quot;accidental&quot; variant (versus 
            &quot;substantive&quot; variants, of semantic import), such a distinction 
            is dicey to argue here, in the wake of the poem's overt quest for answers, 
            and especially in such a climactic, curtain-lowering event, cast not just 
            as an answer, but <em>the</em> answer: has the desiring urn-reader suddenly 
            imagined access to two out of three of the Platonic ideals, as the capitals 
            urge us to think? Or might the lower-casing signify, by evident refusal 
            of this purchase, a modern skepticism, even a hermeneutic mystery? Beyond 
            teasing these capitals, there is the encompassing question of the thirteen 
            words that follow. As if to clarify the rhetorical situation, the hand 
            that guided the <em>Lamia</em> volume put only &quot;Beauty is truth, 
            truth beauty&quot; in quotation, with the effect of distinguishing this 
            voice from the one that follows:<br>
            <blockquote>"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,"&#151;that is all<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know. 
              (<em>Lamia</em>)</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Beauty is Truth, Truth Beauty.&#151;That is all<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye know on Earth, and all ye need to know. 
              (<em>Annals</em>) </blockquote>
            In this variety, we are left asking, as Jack Stillinger so succinctly 
            put in back in 1958, &quot;Who Says What to Whom at the End of <em>Ode 
            on a Grecian Urn</em>?&quot; The poet imagines that the urn &quot;say'st&quot; 
            (48) the bit about beauty and truth, but what of the rest? In his youth, 
            Stillinger summarized the four proposals in the critical literature, each 
            one proffered and debated (poet to reader; poet to urn; poet to the urn's 
            figures; urn to reader).</p>
            </li>
            
            <li><p>For all this helpful priming, I think Stillinger's cautionary prelude 
              to his anatomy of criticism more to the point: &quot;As to critical 
              interpretation of who says what to whom, no single explanation can satisfy 
              the demands of text, grammar, dramatic consistency, and common sense&quot; 
              (171). And that's what I teach, with a deconstructive spin on issues 
              about textual stability (issues that Stillinger would, in later decades, 
              address with the full force of his scholarship and theoretical smarts). 
              I'm less inclined than Stillinger in 1958, the decade of Eisenhower 
              and &quot;reconciliation&quot;-prone New Criticism, to press for dramatic 
              consistency or to argue common sense (I suspect Stillinger is, now, 
              too), but otherwise, the multiple demands of text, grammar, drama and 
              sense are exactly what I hope students will learn to read by reading 
              the Ode, from beginning to end, and then back again, and again. Every 
              time I sit down to read "Ode on Grecian Urn" once again, I find that 
              even if I'm not forever young, the poem is still to be enjoy'd. It promises 
              to sustain reading, when old age shall this generation waste, by its 
              remarkable capacity to generate fresh reviews of what we think we know 
              and to give us new ways of knowing.</p></li>
