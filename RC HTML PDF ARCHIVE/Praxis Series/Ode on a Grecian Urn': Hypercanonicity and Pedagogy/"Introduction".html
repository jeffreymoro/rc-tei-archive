            <li><p>This volume on the "Ode on a Grecian Urn" is part of the Romantic 
              Circles Praxis series on seminal texts in Romantic literature. When 
              I was asked to edit a volume of essays on the "Urn," I decided that 
              instead of looking for original scholarship on the poem, it would be 
              more useful to inquire into the present pedagogic state of this hypercanonic 
              text. As I put it to the prospective contributors to the volume: Every 
              English major knows something about this poem, but what is it that they 
              know? </p></li>
            
            <li><p>If the eleven essays in this volume are representative, it seems that 
              there is a surprising consistency to what students are learning about 
              Keats's "Urn." In classrooms across the US, and in at least one classroom 
              in New Zealand, they are hearing that this poem is about questions, 
              and not about answers. They are being asked to look for the dominant 
              punctuation mark in the poem, and to consider why the question mark 
              recurs so frequently; they are hearing about negative capability as 
              the cultivation of uncertainty; and they are contemplating the enigmas 
              of Keats's poem as an analogue for the urn that so perplexed and intrigued 
              him. </p></li>
            
            <li><p>In sending out the request for contributions to this volume, I suggested 
              a few general questions that respondents might consider: What sort of 
              balance do you strike in the classroom between formalist close reading 
              and historical contextualization? Do you teach the poem differently 
              in classes set at different levels? Does the poem's concern with "beauty" 
              and "truth" resonate with twenty-first century American college students? 
              I asked contributors to focus their remarks on how they talk about this 
              poem to the nonprofessional audience of our students, and not about 
              what they would like to say to an audience of their peers. </p></li>
            
            <li><p>I may have put the first question a bit too polemically. When I asked 
              whether "we replicate the problem that is often raised in other periods 
              of early modern studies, where scholars confess that while they are 
              New Historicists in their research, they often fall back into formalist 
              New Criticism in the classroom," this phrasing suggested to at least 
              one contributor that I was equating formalism with "bad faith." I saw 
              the question as more of a practical and logistical one. While it is 
              pretty much a demand of scholarly research that a critical analysis 
              of a literary text be accompanied by the placement of the work within 
              a coherent cultural context, and there is a high degree of expectation 
              that a new essay on a work as familiar as Keats's "Urn" should offer 
              some important new raw material about the poem's origin, teaching the 
              poem requires that we figure out how to get that material into the classroom, 
              and how to make sure that its inclusion sharpens the focus on the literary 
              text. </p></li>
            
            <li><p>What was most striking about these essays, on the whole, is the energy 
              with which the contributors attacked these questions. We are all too 
              familiar with the endlessly repeated charge from the cultural right 
              that college professors are no longer interested in teaching, and with 
              the refined versions of that charge: that we are only interested in 
              teaching our own specialized research, and that we no longer care to 
              teach the "great books." We know this is propaganda, but we hear it 
              so often that we may begin to believe that it is only an exaggeration, 
              and not an inversion of reality. </p></li>
            
            <li><p>The essays here suggest that the canon, and American college students, 
              have never been in better or more solicitous hands. The contributors 
              to this volume detail the close attention they pay to the text and to 
              their students, varying both the amount of contextual material brought 
              into the classroom and the style of close reading according to the class 
              level. While upper-division and graduate courses generally offer more 
              of an opportunity to explore the cultural context of the poem, there 
              is a recurrent stress on not allowing the poem to get lost in that context. 
              </p></li>
            
            <li><p>The primary challenge of teaching the "Urn" seems to be, at every 
              level, to find a way of conveying the poem's resistance to being reduced 
              to a consumable meaning or a predictable narrative. Students sometimes 
              arrive at college believing, as one contributor put it, that "We did 
              this poem in high school." Nonprofessional readers want to believe that 
              once a text has been solved, like an algebraic equation, one needs only 
              to remember the formula in order to reiterate the answer. This problem 
              can be replicated at higher levels when the ability to provide a rich 
              cultural context for the poem can offer the temptation to make the poem 
              fully explicable through that context. The resistance to this semiotic 
              desire emerges in the ways that various contributors work to make the 
              daily lives of their classrooms as unpredictable as possible. Some of 
              the contributions suggest that the longer one is at this, the more radical 
              one's methods become. </p></li>
            
            <li><p>Our contributors suggest that many students do, eventually, appreciate 
              the idea that Keats's "beauty" and "truth" are neither ideological effects 
              nor transcendent truths, but markers of a strange, elusive desire. In 
              the best of cases, they discover that desire within themselves, and 
              they recognize its difference from the simpler, utilitarian desires 
              of their everyday lives. If any of our students' parents (or our deans) 
              are alarmed by media claims that professors no longer care about teaching, 
              they need only look at the evident fervor with which this random sample 
              of professors has approached what might look like the most routine pedagogical 
              exercise&#151;"How do you teach the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn?'"&#151;in 
              order to be reassured that their children's education is being treated 
              with a good deal more seriousness than they ever imagined. </p></li>
            
            <li><p>When I asked the contributors to this volume to focus on how they 
              taught the poem, I suggested that citations should be kept to a minimum, 
              and that familiar texts needed no citation. Some contributors have included 
              lists of Works Cited with their essays, while others have not. I have 
              added <a href="volume_wc.html">a composite list of Works Cited for the entire volume.</a></p></li>
