            <li><p>Far too much has been said, in relation to Keats's &quot;Ode on a 
              Grecian Urn,&quot; about its invocation of aesthetic transcendence, 
              culminating in the last two lines' identification of beauty and truth. 
              I begin, therefore, with Nabokov's refutation of that entanglement in 
              his reading of Kafka's <em>Metamorphosis</em>: &quot;Beauty plus pity&#151;that 
              is the closest we can get to a definition of art. Where there is beauty 
              there is pity for the simple reason that beauty must die: beauty always 
              dies, the manner dies with the matter, the world dies with the individual&quot; 
              (<em>Lectures on Literature</em>, 251).</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Keats knew this with a sense so profound that his &quot;Grecian Urn&quot; 
              stands as an anomaly, or a compromise, and certainly a surprise. &quot;She 
              lives in beauty&#151;Beauty that must die&quot;&#151;the mournful gnats 
              of &quot;To Autumn&quot;&#151;the opening of &quot;Endymion&quot;&#151;and 
              the last poem Keats wrote&#151;&quot;This living hand&quot;&#151;all 
              point to his insistence not only on mortality but on poetry arising 
              out of a direct and violent confrontation with it. &quot;This living 
              hand&quot; is a stunning tour de force in this respect, because it forces 
              upon those who survive&#151;including and most especially the reader&#151;the 
              guilt that attaches to the living breath with which one reads and traces 
              the poem. </p></li>
            
            <li><p>The &quot;Grecian Urn&quot; appears to be a reaction to these meditations, 
              or an escape from them. The echoes of mortality that traverse these 
              other poems are not there on the surface, and the ending (beauty is 
              truth, truth beauty) seems to emphasize the triumph of the aesthetic. 
            </p></li>
            
            <li><p>Though one is tempted to begin at the beginning, there is something 
              to be said for starting at the end, as if an &quot;end&quot; were possible, 
              as if the &quot;end&quot; signalled not merely termination but the fulfillment 
              of desire. The last two lines of the poem&#151;&quot;Beauty is truth, 
              truth beauty,&#151;that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to 
              know&quot; are hardly Keats (though they are often taken as Keats distilled), 
              and hardly great. Keats certainly played with them, putting on and taking 
              off quotation marks. But finally, it matters little whether the urn 
              speaks, or the poet distills. For it is the very nature of the quotation 
              mark to disrupt whatever sense of aesthetic totality the poem might 
              have been aiming at by invoking an &quot;other&quot; context. To quote 
              is to point elsewhere and otherwise&#151;to a foster-child incapable 
              of naming itself or its origin.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>That elsewhere and otherwise are the poem&#8217;s construction of 
              a counter-aesthetic, one in which the very marks of speech (with or 
              without quotation marks, the poem ends with the urn&#8217;s words, or 
              Keats' articulation of them) signal the failure, and not the culmination, 
              of the aesthetic phenomenon. Or as A.R. Ammons puts it, &quot;it is 
              not that words cannot say; it is that what is said cannot be missed 
              if spoken.&quot; From the title on, the poem contemplates not so much 
              the urn as its silence, its refusal to yield the secrets that have led 
              to this scene, this poem. Unlike &quot;Nightingale,&quot; this is an 
              Ode &quot;on&quot; an object, as if each word, each stanza, were at 
              once revelation and occlusion, a layering process that deepens the difficulty 
              or the impossibility of (the) last words.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>The questions, raised to a fever pitch, underscore this impossibility. 
              The poem is &quot;on&quot; an urn which depicts scenes wrought &quot;on&quot; 
              it, and this layering effect distances the object from its origin, enfolds 
              it in a silence resistant to the questions raised around it and about 
              it. The urn, the scene, the bride are &quot;still,&quot; poised (and 
              posed) in arrested movement, as if a catastrophic event (like lava from 
              a volcano) had halted the movement of mortality. Whether eternity is 
              curse or blessing is not at all certain, and Keats knew full well the 
              ancient gods' fascination with mortality: the force that annihilates 
              us, but also the force that makes human passion, and love, possible. 
              The passion the poem describes as &quot;human&quot; (&quot;All breathing 
              human passion far above&quot;) is in some sense no longer passion but 
              &quot;far above&quot; the turmoil of emotions.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>It is not enough to say that the force that drives the poem is a desire 
              for immortality; or, conversely, that in that gesture toward immortality 
              the poem loses touch with the temporal, mortal desires constitutive 
              of poetry. For the fact is, the poem &quot;is&quot; there, a gesture, 
              but a complex one that moves in both directions. Or perhaps not &quot;moves,&quot; 
              but is rather arrested in its double gesture. Arrested, yet poised, 
              and waiting, for an identification (truth/beauty) that cannot take place. 
              Truth would, like Perseus's Medusa, demolish the possibility of meaning; 
              and meaning is precisely what the poem cannot &quot;know.&quot; Despite 
              the certainty and evenness of the poem's pronouncement(s), its force 
              lies in its subtle hesitation, in its almost inaudible doubling back 
              and questioning not the urn but its own progression.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>And perhaps that moment of hesitation is itself the &quot;sacrifice&quot; 
              the poem makes of its voice, stilling itself in the face of something 
              it does not know how to name any more than it can name itself. The poem 
              is and is not the urn, for the poem layers the silence of the urn with 
              its own inaudibility. Between silence and speech, between the urn's 
              (or poem's) annunciation and its refusal to yield a response to its 
              own questions, the poem hovers, a &quot;silent form&quot; that takes 
              the shape of a lyric punctuated by exclamation marks, colons, and commas 
              hung and taken away. It is as if the poem were not exactly an &quot;offering&quot; 
              but a &quot;waiting,&quot; or rather as if its offering were in its 
              waiting.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Not exactly a happy ending, not even with&#8212;or especially because 
              of&#8212;the promise, and the expectation, that such waiting will be 
              endless, that hovering and hesitation are the mode of being of poetry 
              itself. The erotic, in all its mournfulness, is merely one of its figures. 
              The simultaneity in stanza three of exuberant happiness and a heart 
              sorrowful and cloyed underscores this imbrication of eros and death. 
              It is this intersection that, in the end, gives the poet voice and parches 
              his tongue, makes him remember and forget, in a strange admixture of 
              awaiting and oblivion. Awaiting oblivion. Awaiting not the eternity 
              and transcendence the urn promises, but a silence so profound that it 
              makes of the urn the funereal artifact for the poet's (the poem's) remains. 
              Though distanced by the direction of its subject matter from &quot;Nightingale,&quot; 
              &quot;Melancholy,&quot; &quot;To Autumn,&quot; &quot;This Living Hand,&quot; 
              and so on, &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; returns to the space where 
              the living and dead are not that far apart, where they speak sotto voce, 
              in &quot;whispers out of time.&quot;</p></li>
            
            <li><p>The whispering is heard into the French twentieth century, in the 
              writing of Maurice Blanchot:<br />
              <blockquote>&quot;Is there still an instant? &#151; The instant that 
                is between remembering and forgetting. &#151; A brief instant. &#151; 
                Which does not cease. &#151; As for us, neither remembered nor forgotten. 
                &#151; Remembering through forgetting.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Why this happiness in forgetting? &#151; Happiness itself forgotten.&quot;<br />
                <br />
                It is death, she said, the forgetting to die that is death. (<i>Awaiting 
                Oblivion</i>, 43)</blockquote>
              Keats never forgets to remember, and the Grecian Urn is his most muted 
              yet eloquent <br />
