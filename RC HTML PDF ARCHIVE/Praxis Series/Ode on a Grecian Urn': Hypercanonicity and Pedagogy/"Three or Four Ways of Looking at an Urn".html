            <li><p>I teach Keats's &quot;Urn&quot; regularly in three undergraduate courses&#151;in 
              our core freshman-sophomore course called &quot;Understanding Literature&quot; 
              and in two upper-division courses, &quot;The Romantic Movement,&quot; 
              and &quot;Romanticism and Its Others.&quot; My approach to the poem 
              varies pretty widely, both across these courses and even within them. 
              Our angle of vision depends a good deal not only on the aims of the 
              course, but on my sense of the preparation and responsiveness of the 
              students. And the immediate context provided by other readings makes 
              all the difference. If pressed, I suppose I'd waffle and call what I 
              do most of the time in all three courses &quot;historicized formalism,&quot; 
              with the emphasis more on &quot;formalist&quot; in the core course, 
              on &quot;historicized&quot; in the course on Romanticism's &quot;others,&quot; 
              and right in the middle (or more explicitly on the fault line) in &quot;Romantic 
              Movement.&quot; In all three courses, I try to mingle appreciation for 
              the poem as a powerful and enduring work of art with an understanding 
              that its artistic power flows not in spite of, but in complex combination 
              with, constraining conditions imposed by historical forces.</p></li>
            <li><p>With freshmen, the goal is either to resurrect the poem from the historical 
              graveyard where many students are wont to plant it, or to reclaim it 
              from the insipid poetic heaven into which a revered high-school teacher 
              has catapulted it. For students who tend to think of the poem as just 
              one more of those old-fashioned, frustratingly convoluted, incomprehensible 
              blobs of rhetorical excess that they've been told are the great poems, 
              the &quot;Urn&quot; needs to be dusted off; for devotees, it needs some 
              scuffing up. Both groups need to be encouraged to see the poem as something 
              that still has a life in the here and now. </p></li>
            <li><p>I try to present the poem to these students as a dynamic, self-conflicted, 
              and fruitfully perplexing artifact, written by a poet when he was not 
              much older than they are themselves, that explores love and loss, art 
              and life, confidence and doubt, permanence and temporality, feeling 
              and thinking in ways that can touch upon their own experience and might 
              even move them in some significant way. In the process I try to challenge 
              a view of poetry that I'm finding increasingly and distressingly prevalent, 
              according to which a poem is a more or less elaborate code. Even among 
              those with high verbal SATs and a professed interest in literature, 
              the goal of reading seems to be to find a &quot;hidden meaning&quot; 
              lurking beneath the surface of the poem. The urn is not an urn at all, 
              but a clue to an allegorical or narrative (usually biographical but 
              sometimes more broadly historical) level. Find the organizing substructure 
              and you've &quot;deciphered&quot; (they write tellingly) the poem. You've 
              &quot;done&quot; it, as in &quot;we did this poem in tenth grade.&quot; 
              Unless students are awakened to a lively appreciation of the surface 
              of the poem and to the possibility that the poem means exactly what 
              (and everything that) it says, nothing else that we teachers of Romantic-period 
              literature wish to &quot;do&quot; with the poem will amount to much 
              more than doing it in under various guises.</p></li>
            <li><p>In English 130 (the core course), then, the focus is constructing 
              as precise as possible a reading of what the poem actually says, appreciating 
              the intricacies of exactly how it's said, and exploring the relationships 
              between the &quot;what&quot; and the &quot;how.&quot; We read the poem 
              in the context of thirty or forty relatively brief lyric poems, written 
              between 1600 and about 1990 by poets from throughout the English-speaking 
              world. Because of its relative length and complexity, and because of 
              its cultural and linguistic distance from us, the &quot;Urn&quot; comes 
              fairly late in the semester, after a good deal of instruction and/or 
              review in the usual topics: diction and figurative language, meter and 
              sonic effects, imagery. Recently, I have been using Helen Vendler's 
              textbook, <em>Poems, Poets, Poetry</em>, which I like because it refuses 
              to apologize, as many textbooks do, for poetic complexity and difficulty. 
              Vendler's book is excellent for teaching students to pay attention to 
              the many ways in which good poems employ the dynamics of sentencing, 
              patterns of imagery, sequence of rhetorical structures, or the minutiae 
              of rhythmic and phonetic organization to swerve significantly from expectations. 
              It returns constantly to the theme that good poems repay careful attention 
              especially to points at which multiple overlapping structures&#151;metrical 
              and syntactical, rhetorical and generic, propositional and imagistic&#151;converge 
              or pull apart, reinforce or undermine one another. The book is particularly 
              good in its emphasis on the potential for creative interplay of temporal 
              and spatial forms of organization. So by the time that my students turn 
              their attention to the &quot;Urn,&quot; they have had a good deal of 
              practice in thinking of a poem as simultaneously a performable sequence 
              of speech acts creating what Vendler calls an &quot;emotional arc&quot; 
              and a visual artifact composed of lines, stanzas, and other markers 
              of the poem's constructedness as a text to be seen all at once as well 
              as heard sequentially.</p></li>
            <li><p>Not surprisingly, such an approach leads us where it led Vendler herself 
              in <em>The Odes of John Keats</em>; that is, to a consideration of the 
              poem as a work of meta-poetics, in which the rival claims of visual 
              art and poetry are inextricably bound up with the more overt claims 
              of the speaker. Depending on my sense of the level of skepticism about 
              claims of the meta-poetic (it never ceases to amuse me how students 
              will watch, enjoy, and clearly understand a film like <em>American Beauty</em>, 
              and at the same time rebel against reading poems as simultaneously about 
              themselves and about their &quot;subject&quot;), I may provide them 
              with some passages about poetry from Keats's letters, just to convince 
              them that, yes, Keats really did think hard about poetic art, beauty, 
              and truth. Or I might mention that the poem was originally published, 
              as was &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; in a journal called <em>Annals 
              of the Fine Arts</em>. About half the time (for variety's sake), I will 
              have assigned &quot;Nightingale&quot; to be read in tandem with the 
              &quot;Urn.&quot; In semesters where these Odes are paired, the argument 
              for the meta-poetic is, of course, easier to make, as students can see 
              the clear emphasis on expressive sound in one poem, and on silent mimesis 
              in the other.</p></li>
            <li><p>For the most part, however, I am able to keep the contextual information 
              to a minimum in this course, as I encourage students to begin the poem 
              as the speaker does&#151;confronting a perplexing artifact from the 
              past, at a loss to make it speak intelligibly and meaningfully, and 
              therefore thrown into interrogative mode. Without such encouragement 
              to read the poem with what Susan Wolfson calls, quoting Coleridge, &quot;a 
              'perpetual activity of attention' to the dynamics of a language which, 
              in turn, shapes a drama of the mind's uncertain pursuit of mystery&quot; 
              (305), students will all too readily grasp at one of two views of art 
              which, as the poem itself suggests, threaten to short-circuit complex 
              aesthetic response by explaining away surface dynamics (and gaps, confusions, 
              contradictions, or surprising coalescences). They will want either to 
              sink the poem into narrative or elevate it into philosophical abstraction. 
              (See Vendler on these two options as present within the poem itself; 
              <em>Odes</em>, 118-121). For the sinkers, questions raised by the poem's 
              difficulties soon resolve themselves in a view of the poem as an episode 
              in the (sentimentalized) life of Keats, whom they know to have died 
              young in 1821, frustrated in his search for love and poetic fame. The 
              difficulties in the poem are attributable to his &quot;confusion&quot; 
              or &quot;depression&quot; over his own life. In this view, the &quot;bad&quot; 
              poetry of stanza three&#151;&quot;More happy love! more happy, happy 
              love!&quot;&#151;is an eruption straight from the heart of the wounded 
              Keats, more or less excusable in proportion to one's sympathy for failed 
              heartbroken poets. The banality of the closing lines is similarly resolved 
              through an entirely expressive view of art: if it is inadequate that 
              is because Keats wasn't up to making it better. On the other side, the 
              &quot;elevators&quot; tend to ignore the expressive gaps and fissures 
              in the texture of the poem and value it primarily for providing the 
              vehicle for the concise expression of universal truths. &quot;Heard 
              melodies <em>are</em> sweet, but those unhear'd /<em> Are</em> sweeter.&quot; 
              In such a view, the closing lines are unproblematic, as the entire poem 
              has aspired all along to the condition of propositional statement, with 
              some bumps along the way.</p></li>
            <li><p>My task at this level is to encourage students to understand that 
              the poem's surface itself--with all its false starts, undeveloped or 
              contradicted hypotheses, vague or confusing historical or mythological 
              references, unanswered questions, abrupt transitions, rhetorical unevenness, 
              expressive banality and grandeur, sonic brilliance and monotonousness, 
              and architectonic promise and disappointment--is not a code for but 
              an embodiment of what the poem &quot;means.&quot; It is a lyric, expressive 
              poem that aspires to the condition of mimetic sculpture and fails significantly 
              in that attempt. It is an impassioned utterance, warmly expressing the 
              desires, fears, hopes, and regrets of John Keats. It is also a deliberately 
              controlled, coolly constructed artifact in which the biographical, expressive 
              Keats is difficult to pinpoint, especially (but not only) in those last 
              lines, so abstracted and detached that we still can't agree about who 
              (or what) &quot;says&quot; them.</p></li>
            <li><p>I've spent a good deal of time discussing my treatment of the &quot;Urn&quot; 
              outside the context of courses in Romanticism because I think that most 
              of what I try to do in situating the &quot;Urn&quot; in an explicitly 
              Romantic context--whether from the &quot;inside&quot; in my &quot;Romantic 
              Movement&quot; course or from the periphery in &quot;Romanticism and 
              Its Others&quot;&#151;depends at some level on an understanding that, 
              however we place the poem in these contexts, it will continue, by virtue 
              of its being a powerful poem, to elude that placement. In &quot;Romantic 
              Movement,&quot; the poem tends to become a representative text for one 
              or more themes running through the course, whether it be the historical 
              development of the English lyric, the place of romantic art and theories 
              of imagination in the history of ideas, relations between first- and 
              second-generation poets (especially Keats and Wordsworth), or relationships 
              between poetry and politics, poetry and gender relations, poets and 
              audiences. In this course, students come to the &quot;Urn&quot; very 
              late in the semester, so it is very heavily contextualized by arguments 
              about poetry in the period (especially in Wordsworth's prefaces, Coleridge's 
              <em>Biographia</em>, Shelley's &quot;Defence,&quot; and Keats's letters), 
              by historical treatments of the lyric (especially Stuart Curran on the 
              ode), by accounts of the development of Keats's imagination (especially 
              Stuart Sperry's), by Wordsworth's poems, other Keats poems (especially 
              the other odes, the Hyperion fragments, and <em>Lamia</em>, in which 
              parallels between Lycius's seeing of Lamia and the speaker's seeing 
              in the ode bring out nicely the sorts of gender issues that have been 
              explored by recent critics), by &quot;The Cockney School,&quot; and 
              by recent explorations of Keats in relation to the history and politics 
              of his time (especially Nicholas Roe's work). Each of these lenses is 
              helpful and instructive in its way. But if students do not have a sense 
              of the poem as something that is large (or capacious, or complex) enough 
              to admit of being viewed in many different ways, then we run the risk 
              of having one or another of our contexts become the pretext for reducing 
              the poem to allegory or abstraction.</p></li>
            <li><p>In &quot;Romantic Movement,&quot; I try to address this concern by 
              incorporating weekly, brief writing assignments in close reading. So, 
              while in class we may be treating the &quot;Urn&quot; primarily in terms 
              of romantic hellenism and the political tensions arising from the Elgin 
              marbles controversy (in fact the tack I've taken most recently, in part 
              because the marbles have been in the news), the student may be writing 
              that week a brief explication of the poem, with special attention to 
              the function of the transitions. Throughout the term, I tell them that 
              much of class time will be spent flying well above the surface of the 
              poems, mapping all sorts of macro-movements in the broad cultural phenomenon 
              (or phenomena) we call &quot;romanticism,&quot; but that they need to 
              bail out of the plane periodically really to get the lay of the land.</p></li>
            <li><p>In &quot;Romanticism and Its Others,&quot; which I tell students is 
              a course &quot;in everything I didn't need to know about the Romantics 
              when I was in your shoes,&quot; it is even more imperative that students 
              have the capacity to appreciate the &quot;Urn&quot; as a poem, since 
              my treatment not only of the &quot;Urn,&quot; but of Romanticism in 
              general, is almost entirely focused on what is missing from, or suppressed 
              or occluded in texts conventionally labeled &quot;romantic.&quot; The 
              text for this course is Mellor and Matlak's <em>British Literature, 
              1780-1830</em>, and I follow the editors in treating Romanticism as 
              but one chapter (actually a part of a chapter) in the story of a fifty-year 
              period of intellectual, cultural, artistic, and political ferment. The 
              &quot;Urn,&quot; along with Wordsworth's &quot;Ode: Intimations of Immorality,&quot; 
              Coleridge's &quot;Kubla Khan,&quot; and Shelley's &quot;Hymn to Intellectual 
              Beauty,&quot; plays the role of representative romantic text in a course 
              largely about texts that are very differently situated in their historical 
              contexts. Fascinating things happen to the &quot;Urn,&quot; both as 
              poem and as cultural document, when it is encountered in the context 
              of a course that works, week-by-week, through the large themes of Mellor 
              and Matlak--The French Revolution and the Rights of Man; the Rights 
              of Woman; Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Abolition; Society and Political 
              Economy; Science and Nature; and Aesthetic Theory and Literary Criticism 
              (which includes Romanticism along with Neoclassicism, the Sublime, the 
              Beautiful, and the Picturesque, and Sensibility). Students read the 
              poem early in the course and are asked to locate in it quintessentially 
              Romantic stances such as the focus on the eternal extension of the moment 
              of anticipated sexual fulfillment in stanza two or the flirting with 
              a religion of the aesthetic throughout. As we work through the course 
              we return periodically to the &quot;Urn&quot; and the other &quot;greatest 
              hits of romanticism&quot; to ask how our response to such moments is 
              altered by subsequent readings, whether in Burke and Paine and Wollstonecraft, 
              in Wilberforce on the Slave Trade, in historically undervalued (as &quot;un-romantic&quot;) 
              poetic genres (verse epistle, satire, occasional poem, domestic lyric, 
              drama), or in the work of hitherto neglected poets (especially women 
              poets, in the context of whose work &quot;still unravish'd brides of 
              quietness&quot; and passionately pursued nymphs can have a very different 
              resonance indeed). To take just one example, after reading some poems 
              by women poets, especially Lucy Aikin's &quot;Epistles on Women,&quot; 
              one student offered the observation that the speaker of the Urn doesn't 
              seem interested in how desirable it would be to <em>be pursued</em> 
              throughout eternity. The remark led to a very useful discussion of stanza 
              two of Keats's poem and of our whole project of reading &quot;other&quot; 
              romantic-period texts that I think sharpened our reading both of Keats 
              and of the others, not least because it helped us to see clearly the 
              ironies of stanza two as a moment in the poem where it might be said 
              that beauty is purchased at the expense of (the whole) truth.</p></li>
            <li><p>Such moments notwithstanding, the danger of reducing the &quot;Urn&quot; 
              to an allegory or statement is greater in &quot;Romanticism and its 
              Others&quot; than in &quot;Romantic Movement,&quot; in part because 
              the scope of &quot;Others&quot; makes it very difficult to cultivate 
              the sort of close reading that has been the critical consort of the 
              romantic lyric at least for the past fifty years, if not since <em>Biographia 
              Literaria</em>. The &quot;otherness&quot; of &quot;Romanticism and its 
              others&quot; is as frequently a matter of genre as of gender, class, 
              ethnicity, or political party. The greater romantic lyric mingles promiscuously 
              with philosophical and literary essays, prose fiction, narrative poems, 
              plays, reviews, political writing, and other genres, with the result 
              that students (and their teacher) must cultivate a more flexible, more 
              comparative and reticulative kind of reading, through which they may 
              connect disparate scraps of text into a provisional whole. The goal 
              of comprehensiveness, good in itself, tends to preclude the sort of 
              patient attention to detail and the ability to remain quietly in the 
              midst of doubts and uncertainties that powerful art demands. I haven't 
              solved this problem to my own satisfaction yet, except insofar as I 
              try frequently to remind students that I've chosen for them a syllabus 
              and an approach that stacks the deck against the Romantic poems, that 
              we're using (with all of the connotations of that verb) the &quot;Urn&quot; 
              and other poems for particular purposes (as indeed we're always using 
              the texts of our courses), and that these poems have a life that extends
