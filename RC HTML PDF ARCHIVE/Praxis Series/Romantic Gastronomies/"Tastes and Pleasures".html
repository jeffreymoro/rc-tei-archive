              <li>
                <p>At the advent of the nineteenth century Grimod de la
                Reyni&egrave;re confidently declared, "It is widely
                held to be true that all of the arts are
                interconnected, that they overlap, and that they are
                mutually beneficial . . . Chemistry, painting,
                sculpture, architecture, geometry, physics,
                pyrotechnics, all are more or less closely allied with
                the great art of fine dining" (qtd. in Gigante,
                <em>Gusto</em> 8). Great culinary accomplishment, he
                recognized, entails that the sense of taste is
                correspondingly capable of the development of "an
                extreme delicacy of the palate, which allows the
                appreciation, in tasting, of a full range of flavors"
                far beyond the register of basic sensation (6). Such
                sentiments were to be repeated and embroidered many
                times in the rich literature on gastronomy that
                blossomed in the ensuing decades (Weiss 1-15).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The proliferation of gastronomic literature came on
                the heels of a similar expansion of theoretical
                interest in what would seem to be a parallel subject:
                theories of "aesthetic" taste. For the previous century
                was so full of philosophical writing on taste, as well
                as on beauty, the sublime, and what came to be known as
                "aesthetic" experience, that the entire eighteenth
                century has been termed the "century of taste"
                (Dickie). As Denise Gigante puts it, "Modern gastronomy
                developed as an expansion of the eighteenth-century
                discourse of aesthetic taste, as a cultural field
                opening onto the material pleasures of appetite."
                (Gigante, <em>Gusto</em> xix) A number of gastronomic
                writers took their cues directly from philosophic
                texts, perhaps particularly from David Hume&rsquo;s
                famous essay "Of the Standard of Taste" of 1757,
                allusion to which is apparent in Grimod&rsquo;s
                comments about delicacy of palate. Launcelot Sturgeon
                mentions Hume prefatory to his own description of the
                sensibility of an epicure: "a delicate susceptibility
                in the organs of degustation, which enables him to
                appreciate the true relish of each ingredient in the
                most compound rago&ucirc;t" (qtd. in Gigante,
                <em>Gusto</em> 83; see also Gigante, <em>Taste</em>
                270-71). And an anonymous writer in an 1858 issue of
                <em>Harper&rsquo;s</em> magazine eagerly quotes
                philosopher Dugald Stewart&rsquo;s comparison between
                cookery and the fine arts: "<em>Sweet</em> may be said
                to be <em>intrinsically</em> pleasing, and
                <em>bitter</em> to be <em>relatively</em> pleasing;
                while both are, in many cases, equally essential to
                those effects which, in the <em>art of cookery</em>,
                correspond to that <em>composite beauty</em> which it
                is the object of the poet and the painter to create"
                (qtd. in Gigante, <em>Gusto</em> 249). Given the
                central role of the concept of taste in both philosophy
                and gastronomy, writers on food and eating rather
                naturally merged their interests with philosophical
                theories.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>However, this was a one-way endeavor, rarely
                reciprocated by the philosophers who systematized the
                discipline that would come to be called "aesthetics."
                Despite the efforts of gastronomic writers, the two
                discourses never converge&mdash;even at the points
                where they first seem to join. Had the
                <em>Harper&rsquo;s</em> writer read more carefully, he
                would have noticed that in Stewart&rsquo;s own opinion
                the gustatory and artistic comparisons remain merely
                metaphoric. Stewart insists on the "exclusive
                restriction (among our different external senses) of
                the term Beauty to the objects of Sight and Hearing,"
                referring to the</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  intimate association, which . . . is formed between
                  the Eye and the Ear, as the great inlets of our
                  acquired knowledge; as the only <em>media</em> by
                  which different Minds can communicate together; and
                  as the organs by which we receive from the material
                  world the two classes of pleasures, which, while they
                  surpass all the rest in variety and in
                  duration,&mdash;are the most completely removed from
                  the grossness of animal indulgence, and the most
                  nearly allied to the enjoyments of the intellect.
                  (Stewart 304-5)
                </blockquote>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>This is a typical sentiment, for the vast majority
                of philosophers writing about aesthetic taste dismiss
                or even disparage the literal sense of taste, its
                objects, and its pleasures, developing the concept of
                the aesthetic in explicit contrast to bodily taste
                sensation. Kant&rsquo;s famous distinction between the
                sense pleasure of eating and the aesthetic pleasure of
                beauty merely reiterates in his own idiom what was
                essentially a philosophical commonplace. As Lord Kames
                put it some years earlier, "The fine arts are contrived
                to give pleasure to the eye and the ear, disregarding
                the inferior senses" (Kames 6-7). Even years after
                gastronomy had produced volumes, the same opinion
                continues to be repeated. At the end of the nineteenth
                century George Santayana asserts:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  The pleasures we call physical and regard as low ...
                  are those which call our attention to some part of
                  our own body, and which make no object so conspicuous
                  to us as the organ in which they arise. There is
                  here, then, a very marked distinction between
                  physical and aesthetic pleasure; the organs of the
                  latter must be transparent, they must not intercept
                  our attention, but carry it directly to some external
                  object. The greater dignity and range of aesthetic
                  pleasure is thus made very intelligible. (Santayana
                  24)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>In a mid-twentieth-century book described as "the
                work that was to set the tone of clarity and hard
                thinking for the discipline" of aesthetics (Kivy ix),
                Monroe Beardsley dispenses with the claims of cuisine
                to be an art form in a mere two paragraphs, noting
                dismissively that: "We are told by Fanny Farmer that
                &lsquo;cooking may be as much a means of
                self-expression as any of the arts,&rsquo; but that
                only goes to show that there is more to art than
                self-expression" (Beardsley 98-99). In later works,
                while the difference between aesthetic pleasure in art
                and sensuous enjoyment of food continues to be
                reiterated from time to time (e.g. Scruton 1979: ch.
                4), as a rule the distinction is simply presumed by the
                complete omission of the latter subject in most
                discussions of aesthetics.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>To be sure, there are many points of similarity
                between the literatures on gustatory and on aesthetic
                taste. Perhaps the most important is that both
                gastronomers and philosophers endorse a hedonic
                foundation for the defining values of their arts.
                Aesthetics developed its modern iterations with the
                rejection of objectivist analyses of beauty and the
                adoption of empiricist theories of
                properties&mdash;according to which value-terms such as
                "beauty" refer to an "idea" constituted by the pleasure
                of the percipient, rather than to an external,
                objective quality. So too do gastronomers extol
                well-prepared foods for the refined pleasures they
                afford and the delicacy of palate they demand. Yet even
                as gastronomers advance their case for both the
                aesthetic and artistic standing of cuisine,
                philosophers continue to exclude taste from the
                aesthetic senses and cuisine from the arts. This essay
                explores the persistent division between the two sorts
                of taste and the pleasures they afford. There are
                actually three topics mingled here: the nature of the
                sense of taste and its alleged limits; the status of
                taste enjoyment to qualify as aesthetic pleasure; and
                the claims of cuisine to be considered an art form. I
                shall focus only on the first two.</p>
    
                <h4>The sense of taste</h4>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Let me review very briefly some familiar territory
                about the appropriation of taste as the governing
                metaphor&mdash;even model&mdash;for aesthetic
                discrimination. There is some inevitable shift of
                terminology in part of this discussion, for "taste" is
                the label for a set of receptors of the tongue and
                mouth, and as such it can be distinguished from smell
                and touch. But outside the laboratory taste almost
                never functions alone, and gastronomers usually use
                "taste" to refer to the multi-sensory experience of the
                flavor and texture of food and drink. I trust that
                context will make clear which meanings are
                intended.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Taste (narrow sense) and its cousin smell have
                always ranked low in the hierarchy of the senses
                established since classical antiquity. This assessment
                involves a set of charges that one finds in the
                philosophical literature from Plato to the present, and
                that may be found in scientific studies as well. Taste
                is often considered a rather simple sense that performs
                only a basic function: to determine whether or not a
                substance is safe for ingestion; otherwise, it is not
                terribly significant (Gleitman 116). Because of their
                crucial role in protecting the organism, both of the
                chemical senses are designated as relatively
                "primitive" sense modalities (McLaughlin and Margolskee
                538). With these perspectives, scientific approaches
                underwrite traditional assumptions about the built-in
                limits of the sense of taste.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Philosophically, taste is viewed as an impoverished
                sense on epistemic, moral, and aesthetic grounds. Taste
                does not furnish significant information about the
                external world; it delivers only bodily pleasures; and
                hence it offers temptations that without strict control
                can lead to gluttony and intemperance. The sense
                modality with which taste contrasts most dramatically
                is vision, which along with hearing cooperates with
                reason to develop knowledge of the world. Though touch
                is granted some cognitive standing coordinate with
                vision, smell and taste compete for last place in a
                hierarchical ordering that puts the distance or
                "intellectual" senses of sight and hearing above the
                proximal or "bodily" senses of touch, smell, and taste.
                In modern times, the distinction between "aesthetic"
                and "nonaesthetic" senses supplements this rank
                ordering.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The kind of pleasure furnished by taste demonstrates
                both its moral danger and its aesthetic limits.
                Experiences of the bodily senses are
                <em>sensations</em>; that is, they register
                phenomenally as effects on the perceiver&rsquo;s body.
                In contrast, the distance senses provide
                <em>perceptions</em>, which have no phenomenal "feel"
                but in their typical exercise are wholly directed
                outward towards their objects. (There are exceptions;
                extreme stimuli such as high volume or piercing light
                cause physical discomfort.) Enjoyment from the bodily
                senses is correspondingly physical and sensuous, and
                paradigmatic examples of those pleasures invariably
                refer to eating and to sex. Because the pleasures of
                vision and hearing normally do not arouse bodily
                sensations, they do not invite the kind of
                self-indulgence in pleasure that taste does. Aristotle
                is one of many who warned that the bodily senses
                provide appetitive pleasures that are pursued by brutes
                as well as humans, and he advised careful moderation in
                their exercise. That sensory pleasures require control
                is a common observation, of course, and one duly
                recognized by gastronomers. "Men who stuff themselves
                and grow tipsy know neither how to eat nor how to
                drink," reads one of Brillat-Savarin&rsquo;s opening
                aphorisms (Brillat-Savarin 2). But moderation addresses
                only excesses of bodily pleasure; it does not provide a
                rebuttal to the charge that the pleasure to be had from
                eating or drinking is simply the wrong <em>type</em> to
                be aesthetic.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>All of these concerns are summed up in the common
                classification of taste as a "subjective" sense,
                meaning that it directs attention largely inward to the
                state of our own bodies, to our mouth and tongue and
                what is going on as food slides into our interiors.
                Therefore, taste experiences furnish the paradigm of
                <em>private</em> experiences that are <em>relative</em>
                to individuals. "One man&rsquo;s meat is another
                man&rsquo;s poison," as the saying goes; and <em>De
                gustibus non est disputandum</em>: "There is no
                disputing about taste." Actually, we dispute about
                taste all the time, but philosophy is not alone in
                finding taste sensations idiosyncratic and private, as
                these commonly quoted adages attest.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>But of course there is another side to the
                philosophical story, for taste also provides the
                guiding metaphor used to describe the ability to
                discern beauty in nature and art. Given the poor
                reputation of the gustatory sense, one might be
                surprised to see it pressed into such delicate service.
                But several features of the sense of taste dispose it
                for this usage. A backdrop to the acceptance of the
                metaphor of taste is a deeply-rooted controversy that
                heated up in the eighteenth-century: philosophers were
                divided between those who believed that reason remains
                the chief mental faculty to apprehend value, and those
                who reinterpreted the operation of the mind and
                attributed evaluative function to a capacity they
                variously termed "sensibility," "sentiment," or "inner
                sense." On the whole, and especially with regard to
                aesthetic matters, the latter side prevailed.
                Therefore, to identify a sense as the metaphor for the
                mechanism of value apprehension suited the waning
                allegiance to reason as the guiding evaluative
                faculty.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Taste requires intimate, first-hand acquaintance
                with its objects. One cannot judge the taste of food
                from second-hand reports, and the same may be said of
                an object of beauty. Furthermore, taste is a sense that
                nearly always has a value valence&mdash;that is, one
                either likes or dislikes what is tasted. (This feature
                continues to be part of scientific studies of taste,
                which is the one sense about which researchers
                consistently inquire about pleasure reactions.) Because
                modern philosophy widely associates beauty with
                pleasure&mdash;indeed according to the most influential
                theories, such as the empiricism of Hume and
                Kant&rsquo;s analysis of feeling, beauty is actually
                identical with a certain type of pleasure&mdash;the
                likes and dislikes that eating typically occasions are
                parallel to the pleasure-displeasure responses that
                characterize aesthetic evaluations.<a href=

                Perhaps most paradoxically, given the dismissal of this
                sense for its tendency to direct attention only inward
                toward the body, taste was selected also for its
                extreme <em>sensitivity</em> to the qualities of its
                <em>objects</em>. Properly cultivated, the sense of
                taste can detect fine distinctions among different
                kinds of food and drink, just as the good critic is
                able to discern subtle qualities in works of art. Hume
                posits a "great resemblance between mental and bodily
                taste" in his famous retelling of a story of a
                wine-tasting contest from <em>Don Quixote</em>:
                According to this tale, two kinsmen of Sancho Panza
                possessed amazingly "delicate" taste. To test their
                pretensions, their fellow villagers had them assess the
                contents of a hogshead of wine. Very good, said one,
                except for a slight taste of metal; excellent, agreed
                the other, save for that faint whiff of leather.
                Everyone else laughed, for they tasted only wine; but
                later when the hogshead was emptied, at the bottom was
                found a dropped key attached to a leather
                thong&mdash;proof of the greater delicacy and accuracy
                of the taste of Sancho&rsquo;s kinsmen (Hume
                141-2).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>One might expect that the widespread adoption of the
                taste metaphor to speak of beauty and art would repair
                the traditional dismissal of the literal, gustatory
                sense. However, many theorists were insistent&mdash;far
                more insistent than Hume&mdash;that "taste" is
                <em>only</em> a metaphor. From one point of view,
                philosophical stubbornness on this point might be
                regarded simply as unwonted conservatism, but there is
                far more to the story than disciplinary prejudice.
                Because of the radical identity thesis of beauty and
                pleasure, philosophers carefully stipulated the
                parameters of aesthetic pleasure in order to illuminate
                how this venerable value could preserve its importance
                yet lose its objectivity. That is, the subjectivity of
                taste suited the sense as a metaphor for aesthetic
                judgments&mdash;which are also subjective, as any
                pleasure is by definition; but the idea that there is
                "no argument" about taste in the absence of standards
                is an unacceptable extension of the similarity of the
                two sorts of taste. In the course of debates over the
                standards that could be ascertained for aesthetic
                subjectivity, philosophers revisited and considerably
                revised traditional analyses of the nature of pleasure
                itself&mdash;long regarded as the signal that a desire
                or interest has been satisfied. Hence the birth of the
                celebrated criterion of "disinterestedness" for
                aesthetic enjoyment.<a href=

              <li>
                <p>However urgent that agenda, even a defender of the
                philosophical mainstream has to admit that the nature
                of gustatory taste has been distorted in the contrast
                that it supposedly provides to aesthetic taste. Several
                questions need to be addressed to determine the
                legitimacy of gastronomy&rsquo;s case for the aesthetic
                standing of gustatory taste. How does the sense of
                taste really operate? Is its alleged "subjectivity" any
                more private or indisputable than the experiences
                furnished by other senses? And what kind of enjoyment
                does it&mdash;or can it&mdash;furnish to the attentive
                percipient? One need look for answers no further than
                one of the foundational texts of romantic gastronomy:
                Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin&rsquo;s <em>Physiology of
                Taste</em> of 1826, which Patricia Parkhurst Ferguson
                has called "perhaps <em>the</em> exemplary text" of
                this period&rsquo;s culinary writing (Ferguson 31).</p>
    
                <h4>Brillat-Savarin: pleasure and the sense of
                taste</h4>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Just how much Brillat-Savarin was aware of either
                the unsavory reputation of taste in the history of
                philosophy or the uses of "taste" in the growing
                traditions of aesthetics I do not know. It seems likely
                he was familiar with some of the current popular
                treatments of taste, such as those written by his
                favorite, Voltaire. Regardless of his acquaintance with
                predecessor literature, Brillat&rsquo;s book is an
                intriguing reflection based on wide experience from the
                point of view of a self-made "doctor, chemist,
                physiologist, and scholar," and in his eclectic
                ruminations he addresses many familiar issues
                concerning the bodily senses (Brillat-Savarin 18).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Brillat&rsquo;s focus on pleasure also steers his
                remarks to the chief zone of contention between
                aesthetics and gastronomy. Indeed, his book might have
                been titled "The Physiology of Pleasure," so central is
                that concept in his study. Pleasure, he contends,
                serves as a gauge indicating that the entire human
                machine is functioning according to plan. Pleasure is a
                signal that bodily indulgence has been proportionate
                and well-executed, just as was intended by nature and
                nature&rsquo;s Creator, "who, having ordered us to eat
                in order to live, invites us to do so with appetite,
                encourages us with flavor, and rewards us with
                pleasure" (151). In his view, the association of taste
                and sexual pleasures indicates how the senses work
                towards the preservation of the individual and the
                continuation of the species, for he classes sexual
                desire as a sixth sense (30). (He enthuses about this
                association frequently, as with his encomium to the
                aphrodisiac truffle.) Against over-indulgence, he
                sensibly recommends his own brand of Aristotelian
                moderation (though he may have preached this more than
                practiced it) (MacDonogh). "It is in the nature of
                things that what is excessive does not last long" he
                observes (2, 307-8). The motive for moderation is
                probably more hedonistic than moral, because gorging
                reduces taste pleasure; but the directive economically
                serves both ends. Gluttonous indulgence carries its own
                punishment, indicated by Brillat&rsquo;s piteous
                descriptions of those who must spend most of the day
                engaged in strenuous digestion.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Brillat distinguishes three referents for the term
                "taste": the sense organ, the sensation aroused, and
                the properties of sapid, or tastable, substances (33).
                Although smell and taste have been designated
                "chemical" senses for some centuries, the precise way
                that chemical action produces different tastes is only
                now being discovered. Therefore it would not be
                reasonable to expect any early insights about chemical
                interactions from Brillat, who does not go much beyond
                the ancient observation that substances need to be
                soluble in order to be tasted. However, some of his
                other comments are remarkably prescient of contemporary
                taste research.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Consider for instance his study of the tongue. The
                tongue is the chief organ of taste, and many have
                surmised that the little bumps on its surface are
                somehow responsible for sensations. Current physiology
                distinguishes four types of papillae on the tongue,
                three of which contain taste buds in humans. Those that
                contain the most taste buds are the fungiform papillae,
                so called because when magnified they look like little
                mushrooms. These are the larger of the two types of
                papillae that appear to the naked eye as tiny dots on
                the tongue&rsquo;s surface. Brillat (who uses "buds"
                and "papillae" interchangeably) observes:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Now the study of anatomy teaches us that all tongues
                  are not equally endowed with these taste buds, so
                  that some may possess even three times as many of
                  them as others. This circumstance explains why, of
                  two diners seated at the same feast, one is
                  delightfully affected by it, while the other seems
                  almost to force himself to eat: the latter has a
                  tongue but thinly provided with papillae, which
                  proves that the empire of taste may also have its
                  blind and deaf subjects. (35)
                </blockquote>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In this surmise Brillat is correct. Taste researcher
                Linda Bartoshuk distinguishes what she calls
                "supertasters" from "nontasters," referring to people
                who are especially sensitive to certain bitter
                chemicals as well as to a large range of taste
                qualities. Supertasters are endowed with far more
                fungiform papillae than nontasters, she reports, as one
                can discover by simple experiment: Paint your tongue
                with blue food coloring, shine a flashlight on it, and
                look in a mirror. The fungiform papillae appear rosy,
                and a supertaster&rsquo;s tongue is virtually tiled in
                hot pink. Lots of blue spots indicate the less
                sensitive nontaster (Bartoshuk).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Discovery of a physical reason why taste sensations
                can differ provides causal grounding for one aspect of
                the alleged relativity of taste preferences. Physical
                reasons for this sort of variation are hardly unique to
                taste, however, as Brillat notes with his comparison to
                variant hearing capacities (28). His analysis of the
                organ of taste furnishes the beginnings of an implicit
                rejoinder to one of the most complicated claims about
                the subjectivity of taste: that it is an
                inward-directed sense the experience of which is
                essentially private, and therefore about which there is
                no disputing. Taste is not just inwardly-directed. It
                registers the flavor-properties of objects just as
                touch informs us that a surface is rough or hearing
                that a sound is high-pitched; moreover, there are
                perceptual norms for taste sensitivity. Taste does
                register the properties of objects by means of
                sensation "of" or "in" the body, but attention is
                directed towards the tasted object as much as towards
                the site of sensation.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Brillat&rsquo;s study of taste also neatly analyzes
                the interaction of taste and smell, addressing certain
                detractors who would denigrate this sense because it is
                supposedly sensitive to just four qualities: sour,
                bitter, sweet, and salty, the rest of the taste
                spectrum being supplied by smell. Of course, anyone
                with a bad cold could tell you the same thing. But when
                gastronomers refer to taste they are not limiting
                themselves to the contribution of the tongue alone
                anyway, and Brillat is especially eloquent about the
                combination of senses that contribute to the full
                tasting experience. With typically vivid imagery he
                declares: "I am tempted to believe that smell and taste
                form a single sense, of which the mouth is the
                laboratory and the nose is the chimney" (38). He also
                points out that a good deal of what, strictly speaking,
                belongs to smell actually takes place in the mouth. For
                not only do vapors waft into the nose when foods
                approach our lips, as the chewed bites pass to the back
                of the throat they interact with the retronasal
                passages where nose and mouth connect. And after we
                swallow and exhale there is yet more savoring at the
                stage of taste he designates "reflective" (39). What is
                more, the vocabulary to describe arousal of the
                chemical senses is particularly deficient, he believes.
                The number of tastes is "infinite," varying with the
                unique properties of each substance taken into the
                mouth; and taste experience is further modified in
                combination with other foods (36-7). All the more
                reason to cultivate the discerning capacities of this
                subtle sense so that experience can be acknowledged in
                the absence of labels&mdash;an aspect of cultivated
                gustatory taste that conforms squarely with the
                sought-after delicacy of aesthetic taste.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The analysis of the physical workings of the organ
                of taste is only the beginning of Brillat&rsquo;s study
                of how this sense operates. He is equally attuned to
                the situational factors that make some people better
                tasters than others. The pleasures of <em>eating</em>
                are relatively basic, indicating the satisfaction of
                appetite when the organism is functioning properly; but
                this is little more than the human variety of an animal
                need &mdash; although Brillat also insists that the
                anatomy of humans endows them with superior taste
                sensitivity (43-5). Of more interest and considerably
                wider scope are the pleasures of the <em>table</em>,
                which are independent of need or appetite
                (Brillat-Savarin 188; Gigante 7-8). Education of this
                sense to make it a discerning instrument is a long-term
                project. Brillat suggests that it can be interrupted
                both for individuals, when the physical make-up of the
                tongue is deficient or when scarcity imposes limits,
                and for entire cultures when fine eating is not a
                social norm. He pictures the barbarians who destroyed
                the legendary customs of the Roman table as having
                "snarling mouths and leathery gullets, insensible to
                the subtleties of refined cookery" (307).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Brillat&rsquo;s investigation of the physiology of
                the tasting apparatus is as fully developed as it could
                have been in his time, and indeed it stands up well to
                its contemporary scientific supplement. His surmises
                about the taste properties of various foods are a bit
                indeterminate. On the one hand, he repeats fairly
                frequently the adage that about taste there is no
                disputing, by which he seems mainly to have meant that
                there are no rules governing whether one should prefer
                one type of food over another. "Every man reacts
                differently to a thing: his fleeting sensations cannot
                be expressed in any known symbols, and there is no
                scale for determining whether a cod, a sole, or a
                turbot is better than a salmon trout" (91). On the
                other hand, his discussion of cooking techniques
                observes that foods have distinctive properties that
                behave in regular ways in their preparation and in the
                sensations they predictably arouse. He is absolutely
                clear, for example, that a well-aged partridge is
                better than a freshly-killed bird. Evidently, then,
                about some sorts of tastes there is not only
                disputation but also definitive resolution.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Where Brillat is at his most eloquent, however,
                concerns that most elusive feature of taste: the felt
                quality of the experience. He analyzes three stages of
                tasting: "Direct" sensation refers to the first
                impression that food makes when it enters the mouth.
                Chewing begins, releasing more flavors, and as the food
                slides down the throat olfaction contributes further to
                "complete" taste. After swallowing, the taster exhales
                and the final stage of taste commences, that which he
                calls "reflective": "the opinion which one&rsquo;s
                spirit forms from the impressions which have been
                transmitted to it by the mouth" (39). This final phase
                of taste sets the stage for the integration of
                subjective sensation into social rumination, for what
                can be reflected upon is also the subject of
                conversation, debate, and judgment. (Following this
                line of thought, other gastronomers advanced communal
                standards for culinary judgments with the foundation of
                gastronomic "juries" whose opinions stood as shared
                norms for gustatory taste) (Gigante, Gusto
                xxvi).<a href=

              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>But even without words, common experience can be
                discerned. Brillat frequently reports that he knows
                from their beatific expressions that others have shared
                his taste pleasures. Taste is thereby an eminently
                social sense, an observation that implicitly further
                discredits its alleged privacy and indisputability.
                That food must enter our interiors in order to register
                is an undeniably "subjective" feature of taste, but not
                one that entails relativity. Both flavor and consequent
                enjoyment are the culmination of shared eating
                experience, rhapsodically described in this report from
                a "gastronomical test" Brillat conducted on dinner
                guests:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  All conversation ceased as if hearts were too full to
                  go on; all attention was riveted on the skill of the
                  carvers; and when the serving platters had been
                  passed, I saw spread out in succession on every face
                  the fire of desire, the ecstasy of enjoyment, and
                  then the perfect peace of satisfaction (184).
                </blockquote>

              <li>
                <p>There can be little doubt that the pleasure shared
                by these diners was a common experience. Now the hard
                question remains: does Brillat&rsquo;s study help to
                accredit the sense of taste and its objects as equal
                participants in the discourse of aesthetics? Or to put
                the question more specifically: does it serve to revise
                the traditional concept of aesthetic pleasure to
                include gustatory enjoyment?</p>
    
                <h4>Pleasure &mdash; concluding thoughts</h4>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>This question is easier to raise than to answer.
                Pleasure is an obscure phenomenon that &mdash; despite
                all the attention it received in eighteenth-century
                discourse &mdash; was only partially theorized in the
                philosophical tradition within which romantic
                gastronomy arose. Locke called pleasure a "simple
                idea," by which he meant it could not be analyzed into
                components. Even if that be the case, however, pleasure
                is not at all simple in any other sense of the word, as
                all the stipulations that have been advanced qualifying
                different types of pleasures indicate (Herwitz). Once
                it endorsed a hedonic analysis of value, modern
                aesthetics concentrated on regularizing aesthetic
                pleasure, showing how it is "disputable" and, despite
                its singularity, manifests standards even in the
                absence of rules or principles. The contrasts between
                aesthetic and gustatory taste that are traditionally
                enlisted to illustrate this particular issue are at
                least partially unsound, for acute analyses such as
                Brillat-Savarin&rsquo;s demonstrate that whatever
                differences may obtain between the two kinds of taste,
                it is not that the one is purely subjective and
                relative and the other amenable to intersubjective
                discussion and agreement. Variations in sensitivity to
                taste qualities have both physiological and social
                explanations, as is the case with the other senses as
                well; moreover, the discourse of gastronomy itself
                indicates that shared judgments and normative standards
                are not out of the question. Granted, the scope of this
                sense is limited; taste does not provide as much
                information about the "external world" as does either
                vision or hearing. On the other hand, vision and
                hearing are quite dumb about flavor qualities, so
                unless one wants to subtract them from the experience
                of objects altogether there is no reason to doubt a
                cognitive dimension to taste. What is more, taste is
                educable and refinable, and its use as the model for
                aesthetic sensitivity is fully warranted.
                Brillat-Savarin &mdash; and a host of other
                gastronomers &mdash; convincingly demonstrates that
                attentive savoring ought to qualify as a type of
                aesthetic discernment. Can we extrapolate further and
                erase the traditional distinction between sensory and
                aesthetic pleasures?</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>There is quite a lot at stake in revising the
                concept of pleasure, central as it is not only to
                aesthetic theories but also to theories of value in
                general. This essay has addressed the topic only as it
                appears in a historically restricted range of
                philosophies, and these final few paragraphs indicate
                some further paths of inquiry that remain to be
                pursued. The concept of disinterestedness was intended
                to free aesthetic pleasure from bodily sensation, to
                clear the way for enjoyment that is not self-directed
                and therefore relative to individuals, and to remove
                the obstacles for shared standards of taste. The latter
                two objectives obtain for both aesthetic and gustatory
                taste, reducing the contrast between the two. But there
                is no way to sever gustatory from physical pleasure;
                although one can certainly add reflection to eating and
                reduce its ties to appetite, one cannot uproot the
                pleasure of eating from sensation altogether. And
                indeed why would one want to? However, combining the
                sensory prominence of gustatory experience with a
                hedonic measure of value cannot but sustain one
                important element of the intractable distinction
                between gustatory and aesthetic value. Romantic
                gastronomy proceeds to make its case almost entirely on
                hedonic grounds. But there are good reasons not to
                identify aesthetic value with pleasure, <em>unless</em>
                that concept is clearly distinguished from the
                pleasures of sensation (Levinson). Gastronomy thus
                faces a dilemma: either relinquish its apparently
                strongest similarity with aesthetic experience (refined
                and discerning pleasure), or embrace it only to
                discover that aesthetic theories disavow the pleasure
                criterion.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>I believe this rather old-fashioned problem persists
                to this day, despite the fact that with the passage of
                time the philosophical agenda that sustained the
                exclusion of gustatory from aesthetic taste have
                altered and weakened. There is now considerably more
                theoretical interest in bodily aspects of human
                subjectivity than in the past, and it might seem as if
                the final barriers to merging gastronomic and aesthetic
                projects have withered away. But far more investigation
                of sensation, perception, imagination, and what is
                meant by "pleasure" and its connection with aesthetic
                value is required before that conclusion can be
                ventured with confidence. Therefore, I do not believe
                that we are positioned to answer this final question
                without undertaking a thorough reassessment of the
                concept of aesthetic pleasure and the theoretical
                frameworks within which this discussion has taken
                place.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>As traditional philosophical approaches are
                reevaluated, so as well should be the empiricist
                revolution that yielded the hedonic foundation for the
                concept of the aesthetic in the first place. The key
                point of contention, I believe, lies not with the fact
                that there needs to be a strict division between bodily
                and aesthetic experience. Insistence on that
                distinction not only renders aesthetic experience
                cold-hearted and dull, but it also fails to accommodate
                certain paradigmatic aesthetic affects, including the
                important role of emotions and their somatic register
                in the apprehension of art (Robinson; Shusterman). The
                deeper difficulty lies with the original identification
                of beauty with pleasure, later generalized as aesthetic
                value, and with the subsequent merging of artistic with
                aesthetic value under the umbrella of fine art.
                Attention to romantic gastronomy suggests a first step
                in this revaluation, since it demonstrates that the
                fundamental contrast used to articulate the concept of
                aesthetic taste cannot be as clearly maintained as it
                seemed when pleasure was first taken to be the root
                concept of aesthetic value.</p>

    <p class="indent"><sup><a name="1"></a>1</sup>I omit from
            this discussion the empiricist distinctions among primary,
            secondary, and tertiary qualities. While a detailed
            treatment of the senses would require tackling this
            subject, few if any aesthetic properties count as primary.
            Thus these distinctions will not distinguish gustatory from
            aesthetic taste.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name=
            "2"></a>2</sup>Disinterestedness originates equally as a
            concept in theories of moral evaluation.</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="3"></a>3</sup>This approach
            to locating standards for gustatory taste is fairly
            congruent with empiricist perspectives, though it cannot
            address Kant&rsquo;s theory, for which any sense pleasure
            lacks the grounds for the universality and necessity that
            he ascribes to judgments of aesthetic taste. What is more,
            certain of the more frivolous elaborations of gastronomic
            standards, such as Kitchener&rsquo;s insistence that
            particular dinner hours and styles of invitation be encoded
            in principles of taste, weaken rather than strengthen the
            formulation of standards for gustatory taste.</p>
