                <p class="epigraph">Alexis Soyer [was] as kind a
                hearted Christian as you might find, an admirable cook,
                an inventive genius, a brave, devoted, self-denying
                man, who served his adopted country better in the
                Crimea than many a starred and titled CB [Companion of
                the Order of Bath] . . . . He had no call to be a
                quack; there was no earthly reason why he should
                inundate the newspapers with puffs, and wear impossible
                trousers, or cloth-of-gold waistcoats, cut diagonally.
                The man had a vast natural capacity, could think, ay,
                and do things; yet he quacked so continually, that many
                people set him down as a mere shallow pretender, and
                some even doubted whether he could cook at all. He was,
                nevertheless, a master of his difficult art . . .

                <p>Alexis Soyer (1809-1858) was a colorful character,
                one of the most famous chefs of his day, and a key
                precursor of our modern celebrity chefs. While largely
                forgotten today, he has nonetheless been the subject of
                three recent titles: a children's book, Ann Arnold's
                <i>Alexis Soyer: The Adventurous Chef</i> (2002); and
                two biographies, Ruth Brandon's <i>The People's Chef:
                The Culinary Revolution of Alexis Soyer</i> (2005), and
                Ruth Cowen's <i>Relish: The Extraordinary Life of
                Alexis Soyer, Victorian Celebrity Chef</i>
                (forthcoming, 2006). Soyer does merit a closer
                look&mdash;in particular, at the role he played in the
                broader evolution of the chef as a public figure. But,
                before this, some more general background is
                needed.</p>
    
                <h4><b>The Chef as man of letters</b></h4>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Antonin Car&ecirc;me (1783-1833) was, arguably, the
                <i>first</i> celebrity chef. Yet, in the best-known
                portrait of him, the Blanchard engraving after the
                Steuben painting <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig1.jpg">fig.
                1</a>]</b>, nowhere to be seen are the chef's toque, or
                any other culinary attributes. Instead, with unruly
                hair, broad thinker's forehead, dark eyes gazing into
                the unknown, and body wrapped in swirling drapery,
                Car&ecirc;me appears a Romantic genius&mdash;a Lord
                Byron perhaps, or a young Victor Hugo. But why should
                this be?</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The now international phenomenon of the celebrity
                chef&mdash;which has found its most emphatic expression
                in the largely Anglo-American model of television chefs
                like Julia Child, James Beard, Graham Kerr, Emeril
                Lagasse, or Nigella Lawson&mdash;originated in
                post-revolutionary France. Across the nineteenth
                century, and into the twentieth, in concert with the
                rise of culinary nationalism in France (Ferguson),
                French chefs achieved unprecedented prestige and
                authority, both at home and abroad. Yet, from Antonin
                Car&ecirc;me through Auguste Escoffier (1846-1935),
                famed culinarians were rarely depicted as chefs.
                Rather, the various portraits, frontispieces, and
                prefaces constructing their public image would invoke
                well-worn paradigms of literary distinction&mdash;for
                example, highlighting Car&ecirc;me's signature and pen,
                his accomplishments as a writer, and the monumentality
                of his creative aspirations (Ferguson 49-82). Likewise,
                if Car&ecirc;me's portraits recall a young Victor Hugo,
                then Escoffier's cast him as an older Hugo, minus the
                trademark white beard but with a Clemenceau-like
                moustache: a paradigm of grandfatherly authority, and
                universal ambassador of French culture. Even in a
                frontispiece portrait commemorating the silver jubilee
                of his culinary career <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig2.jpg">fig.
                2</a>]</b>, Escoffier strikes a contemplative pose,
                surrounded with conventional writerly
                paraphernalia&mdash;pen, paper, inkwell, books, desk.
                Rather than seasoning a sauce, he seems to ponder his
                next sentence.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Such contradictions point to an underlying dilemma:
                how to envision this new category of public
                figure?&nbsp; Mentalities often lag behind innovations,
                and we see new things in terms of older
                ones,&nbsp;making sense of novelty through reassuring
                precedent. Much as early automobiles resembled
                horse-drawn carriages, the apotheosis of the writer in
                France, from Voltaire through Hugo, was modeled largely
                on pre-existing paradigms of military and aristocratic
                glory; in turn, chefs' new-found fame emulated
                established modes of literary renown. Under the ancien
                r&eacute;gime, chefs had long been lowly, largely
                itinerant domestic servants, giving rise to a
                persistent vision of them as comical, subservient
                figures, which survived well into the
                post-revolutionary period, in popular and humorous
                contexts, like this 1898 illustrated menu <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig3.jpg">fig.
                3</a>]</b>. Casting chefs as monkeys implies clownish
                behavior, subhuman status, and ability only for clumsy
                imitation, far from the transcendent culinary artistry
                posited by gastronomic writers from
                Alexandre-Balthazar-Laurent Grimod de la
                Reyni&egrave;re (1758-1838) onward.<a href=
                "#1"><sup>1</sup></a>
                In order to be seen as important personages and artists
                in their own right, figures like Car&ecirc;me and
                Escoffier would be styled,&nbsp;and style themselves,
                as great men of letters. Indeed, by the middle of the
                nineteenth century, chefs' writerly pretensions were so
                familiar that they became the butt of satire. In
                Briffault's <i>Paris &agrave; table</i> (1846), for
                  example <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig4.jpg">fig.
                4</a>]</b>, illustrator Bertall puts the would-be cook
                of letters back in his place, in the kitchen, an
                ill-fitting chef's uniform accentuating his ungracious
                form, the toque turned into a nightcap, pulled down
                over the forehead for a more neanderthal effect, his
                brain taxed by the effort of composing a treatise on
                "the influence of foodstuffs upon the dispositions of
                the soul." If a chef could be lampooned for trying to
                be a writer, so too could a writer for trying to be a
                chef, guilty not of aspiring beyond his station, but
                rather of stooping below it. So it was for Baron
                L&eacute;on Brisse (1813-1876), a provincial
                aristocrat, former bureaucrat, and minor man of
                letters, who achieved notoriety late in life by
                publishing recipes, menus, and gastronomic advice: his
                culinary dabbling made him a favorite target of
                contemporary caricaturists, dismissed by Lemot as a
                third-rate <i>r&ocirc;tisseur</i> <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig5.jpg">fig.
                5</a>]</b>, and quite literally roasted by Gill
                  <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig6.jpg">fig.

              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>As Baron Brisse's example suggests, gastronomic
                writers and professional chefs were closely
                interrelated, but not parallel public figures. This is
                all the more apparent in the <i>Galerie des Gastronomes
                et Praticiens fran&ccedil;ais, de Brillat-Savarin
                &agrave; nos jours</i>, a revealing collective portrait
                in Chatillon-Plessis's <i>La Vie &agrave; table
                &agrave; la fin du XIXe si&egrave;cle</i> (1894)
                  <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig7.jpg">fig.
                7</a>]</b>. The title appears to promise equal
                treatment, and gastronomic writers and chefs do stand
                together in the print, but all styled as debonair men
                of letters at an elegant garden party. With nary a
                toque nor skimmer to distinguish practitioners from
                theoreticians, chefs seem subsumed into the domain of
                writers.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Despite its focus on personalities since
                Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin (1755-1826), the
                <i>Galerie</i> includes statues of the medieval chef
                Taillevent (Guillaume Tirel, 1310-1395) and renaissance
                writer Fran&ccedil;ois Rabelais (1494-1553), both
                placed in the garden, as well as of the
                seventeenth-century <i>officier de bouche</i>
                Fran&ccedil;ois Vatel (1631-1671), installed beyond
                them, on the balustrade.<a href=
                "#3"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;
                Seeking prestige and legitimacy through venerable
                predecessors, revered all the more emphatically through
                public "statufication," the print indulges in a
                combination of self-serving strategies&mdash;genealogy
                and monumentalization&mdash;not limited to, but
                particularly characteristic of nineteenth-century
                French literary culture (Garval 2004a). Among the
                precursors invoked and honored here, there are two
                hands-on culinarians, and only one man of letters,
                which might seem to suggest the primacy of praxis over
                commentary, at least historically. Among the moderns
                however, writer Brillat-Savarin, not chef Car&ecirc;me,
                is highlighted as number one, both in the print and in
                its numerical key <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig8.jpg">fig.
                8</a>]</b>. Indeed the whole composition, and
                particularly this detail, recall Nadar's 1854 pantheon
                of literary luminaries, where Victor Hugo plays the
                equivalent starring role (Garval 2004a, 17-19). The
                <i>Galerie</i> offers chefs a place of honor within an
                analagous gastronomic pantheon but, alongside this
                consecration, it also reveals the limits of their
                new-found status for, nearly a century after
                Car&ecirc;me rose to prominence, chefs' fame was still
                filtered through the lens of literary renown.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Unfortunately, there has been little critical
                reflection on how chefs from Car&ecirc;me to Escoffier,
                as well as self-styled public gastronomes from Grimod
                de la Reyni&egrave;re to Curnonsky (Maurice Edmond
                Sailland, 1872-1956), shaped the development of the
                modern celebrity chef. But, as Chatillon-Plessis's
                <i>Galerie</i> suggests, chefs long remained formulaic
                and fundamentally conservative in their relationship to
                fame: content to continue emulating men of letters;
                reluctant to abandon this flattering literary guise. On
                the whole, gastronomic writers proved more daring and
                entrepreneurial vis-&agrave;-vis their public image, as
                evidenced for example by the provocative and
                self-promoting frontispieces to the eight volumes of
                Grimod's ground-breaking <i>Almanach des gourmands</i>
                (Garval 2004b), or by Curnonsky's much-touted election
                to the fanciful post of&nbsp; "Prince des Gastronomes"
                (Vrinat). Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about
                the extraordinary Alexis Soyer is that, while he too
                fashioned himself a man of letters, he would also
                transcend the constraints of this literary model and,
                far ahead of his time, prefigure the flamboyant
                personas of today's celebrity chefs.</p>

                  of light camlet cloth, with voluminous lapels and

                  trousers, with lavender stripes down the seams; very

                  have been the terror of his tailor, his hatter, and
                  his maker of cravats and underlinen; since he had, to
                  all appearance, an unconquerable aversion from any
                  garment which, when displayed on the human figure,
                  exhibited either horizontal or perpendicular lines.

              <li>
                <p>Alexis Soyer was born in France and raised there,
                first in Meaux-en-Brie&mdash;known for its
                cheese&mdash;then in Paris. During the Revolution of
                1830, he was working in the kitchen at the Foreign
                Office, when it was attacked by angry insurgents. He
                ended up singing, not for his supper, but for his
                life:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  The cooks were driven from the palace, and in the
                  flight two of Soyer's <i>confr&egrave;res</i> were
                  shot before his eyes, and he himself only escaped
                  through his presence of mind, in beginning to sing
                  <i>'la Marseillaise' et 'la Parisienne;'</i> when he
                  was in consequence carried off amid the cheers of the
                  mob. (Volant and Warren, 6)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Soyer soon fled to England, where he would make his
                reputation, notably as chef of London's prestigious
                Reform Club from 1837 to 1850. But his close call
                during the July Revolution remains an oddly revealing
                point of departure for his later, successful career.
                Casting him in the suggestive role of the
                faux-revolutionary, it already offers a glimpse at his
                general propensity for theatrics; his talent for
                rallying the public, and for making the most of
                unlikely opportunities; as well as his ambivalent class
                status and loyalty. A modestly-born opportunist,
                slaving away in service to the upper crust, and belting
                out Rouget de Lisle's or Casimir Delavigne's
                rabble-rousing lyrics at gunpoint, he appears at once a
                man of the people and lackey of the elite.</p>

              <li>
                <p>Soyer was, in so many ways, a study in
                contradictions, "who drew the breath of his being from
                the French Romantics and who won the respect of
                Victorian England for his practical resourcefulness and
                powers of administration" (Morris 1). He served refined
                food to the rich and powerful, and strained to
                ingratiate himself to them as well. But, amid the
                social and intellectual ferment over the problem of
                poverty, in the years surrounding the Revolution of
                1848, he also put his skills to more humanitarian and
                egalitarian use. He toiled to feed Ireland's poor in
                the 1840s, or starving British soldiers in the Crimea a
                decade later, and published invaluable information to
                help the needy better feed themselves: first in a
                booklet, "The Poor Man's Regenerator" (1847), from each
                copy of which he gave a penny to the poor; then more
                extensively in his <i>Shilling Cookery for the
                People</i> (1854). A versatile, compassionate, and
                inventive cook, he was a prolific inventor as
                well&mdash;of bottled sauces and drinks, culinary
                gadgetry of all sorts <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig9.jpg">fig.
                9</a>]</b>, numerous innovations in the Reform Club's
                celebrated new kitchens, and many other things,
                including an excellent field stove <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig10.jpg">fig.
                10</a>]</b>, a variant of which, still called the Soyer
                stove, was used by the British army through the first
                Gulf War (Brandon 241).</p>

                <p>Soyer was known for his exuberance, and eccentric
                style. A wit, prankster, raconteur, fine
                singer&mdash;and not just of revolutionary
                ballads&mdash;his first ambition was to be a comic
                actor, and for much of his life he frequented theaters
                and theatrical performers. A dapper Frenchman among
                drabber Victorians, he dressed as a Romantic dandy, in
                a style no longer the height of fashion at the height
                of his career in the 1840s and 50s&mdash;and did so
                even in the kitchen, eschewing the conventional chef's
                uniform. Beyond their rich embroidery, lavish silks,
                and extravagant colors, Soyer's clothes were
                characterized by their insistent cut on a bias,
                "<i>&agrave; la zoug-zoug</i>" in his own coinage, an
                idiosyncratic rendering of "zig-zag," the English
                phrase itself taking on the gallic flair of its
                inventor. Indeed, this predilection for diagonal lines
                was not limited to clothing designed and worn
                "studiously awry" (Sala 1894, II, 241), but rather part
                of a broader pattern. As biographer Helen Morris
                notes,</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Soyer's desire to be noticed, to be admired, above
                  all to be extraordinary, grew ever more dominant. He
                  tried not only to cook differently from everyone
                  else, but to dress and talk and walk differently too.
                  . . . [H]e would not wear a single garment with
                  either horizontal or perpendicular lines. His hats
                  were specially built so that when clapped on at any
                  angle they slanted in a coquettish way&mdash;in his
                  own phrase, <i>&agrave; la zoug-zoug</i>. His coats
                  had to be cut on the cross . . . . His visiting card
                  . . . was not a rectangle but a parallelogram; so was
                  his cigar-case, and even the handle of his cane
                  slanted obliquely. (25)

                <p>To this list could be added many things:
                advertisements for Soyer's products, like these for his
                Sultana's Sauce, one with the central bottle tilted
                diagonally through the copy <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig11.jpg">fig.
                11</a>]</b>, the other with the copy inside a
                  parallelogrammic field <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig12.jpg">fig.
                12</a>]</b>, recalling the shape of his <i>carte de
                  visite</i> <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig13.jpg">fig.
                13</a>]</b>; a whimsical dish created in honor of the
                  ballerina Fanny Cerrito <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig14.jpg">fig.
                14</a>]</b>, with whispy diagonals spiraling round a
                conical base, surmounted by a dancing figurine on
                pointe atop a thunderbolt-like stand composed of
                alternating angles; "a zig-zag passage," which Morris
                calls a "true Soyer touch" (78), leading into the model
                soup kitchen that Soyer designed in Dublin; his
                fanciful menu for a "GRAND SUPPER LUCULLUSIEN &Agrave;
                LA ZOUG-ZOUG" (Volant and Warren 152); and, as we shall
                see, numerous diagonal elements in the portraits of
                Soyer that accompany his published work. As such varied
                examples suggest, <i>&agrave; la zoug-zoug</i> might
                best be understood as the central trope in Soyer's
                creative imagination, and in his dandified public
                persona, emblematic of his drive to distinguish
                himself&nbsp;&mdash;both to achieve distinction, and to
                do so by being different.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Soyer's position as chef of the Reform Club secured
                him some prominence but, in itself, does not explain
                the magnitude of his fame. His constant letters to
                various London papers, particularly the
                <i>Times</i>&mdash;touting his own accomplishments,
                promoting his latest schemes, weighing in on the
                questions of the day&mdash;helped keep him in the
                public eye. So too did the extensive marketing of his
                products, notably "Soyer's Sauce" <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig15.jpg">fig.
                15</a>],</b> as well as his several successful books on
                food and cookery. Combined with his flamboyant personal
                style, these forms of exposure made Soyer a favorite
                target of popular satire which, for better or worse,
                only increased his renown. He "figured more often in
                the pages of <i>Punch</i> than many a Cabinet Minister"
                (Morris 1), as in this rendering of his resignation as
                chef of the Reform Club <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig16.jpg">fig.
                16</a>]</b>. His face remains hidden by his hand, all
                the better to draw attention to him, and to point up
                the extent of his celebrity.<a href=
                "#4"><sup>4</sup></a>
                Soyer's face is so familiar that its features have
                become superfluous. Other attributes suffice to
                identify him: the hat rakishly askew, his chef's
                knives, and stylish street clothes that contrast with
                the ordinary kitchen garb of his staff, whose faces
                register varying degrees of shock and dismay at their
                sovereign's abdication. "King Soyer" himself stands
                above them, in front of an armchair throne beneath a
                coat of arms, with kitchen utensils replacing heraldic
                symbols in the quadrants.<a href=
                "#5"><sup>5</sup></a>
                The accompanying text below the caricature mocks
                Soyer's "pride," his "gigantic" schemes, his supposed
                "genius," and concludes with a swipe at his
                publicity-mongering, that plays on the double meaning
                of "puff" as both pastry shell and undue or exaggerated
                praise: "As to the puffs, the loss of SOYER will not be
                so severely felt, as most of the puffs he was so famous
                for manufacturing were for his own use."</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Other contemporary satirical treatments of Soyer
                include, notably, his parodic double Alcide Mirobolant,
                in Thackeray's novel <i>Pendennis</i> (1849). Thackeray
                and Soyer had known and esteemed each other since
                meeting at the Reform Club in 1837, and the novelist
                often poked fun at his friend the chef in his
                contributions to <i>Punch</i>, which also afforded
                Soyer considerable free publicity. In <i>Pendennis</i>,
                Mirobolant&mdash;whose surname means "dazzling" in
                French&mdash;arrives in a small English town to become
                chef to the local lord, and creates a stir among the
                inhabitants. Thackeray has also made him a Gascon, that
                legendary figure of strutting braggadocio. To wit,
                Mirobolant strides about town of a summer afternoon, in
                outlandish attire reminiscent of Soyer's:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  his light green frock or paletot, his crimson velvet
                  waistcoat with blue glass buttons, his pantalon
                  &Eacute;cossais of a very large and decided check
                  pattern, his orange satin neckcloth, and his
                  jean-boots, with tips of shiny leather,&mdash;these,
                  with a gold embroidered cap, and a richly-gilt cane,
                  or other varieties of ornament of a similar tendency
                  . . . in which he considered that he exhibited the
                  appearance of a gentleman of good Parisian
                  <i>ton</i>. (Thackeray 1898, 222; all references to
                  this edition, unless noted otherwise)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Fancying himself irresistibly attractive, he "walked
                down the street, grinning and ogling every woman he met
                with glances, which he meant should kill them outright"
                (222) for, as a Frenchman, he was "accustomed to
                conquer" (225). Recalling Soyer's own histrionic bent,
                he declares "with a deep bass voice, and a tragic
                accent worthy of the Porte St. Martin and his favourite
                melodrames" that he is "a fatal man," destined to
                inspire "hopeless passion" (226). Mirobolant's
                self-proclaimed "determination to marry an Anglaise,"
                to find a mate among "[t]he blonde misses of Albion,"
                (225) perhaps alludes to Soyer's own marriage to an
                Englishwoman (cf. below), or even to the dedication of
                <i>The Modern Housewife, or M&eacute;nag&egrave;re</i>
                  to "The Fair Daughters of Albion" <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig17.jpg">fig.
                17</a>]</b>. In any case, it is left to the reader's
                judgment "[w]hether Alcide was as irresistible a
                conqueror as his namesake, or whether he was simply
                crazy" (226). This remark calls attention to the chef's
                given name, which is both reminiscent of Soyer's
                (<i>Al</i>cide-<i>Al</i>exis), and echoes that of the
                protagonist in Jean-Baptiste Lully's opera <i>Alceste,
                ou le Triomphe d'Alcide</i> (1674), as well as in the
                lesser-known <i>Alcide, ou le Triomphe d'Hercule</i>
                (1693, written by Jean Galbert de Campistron, with
                music by Louis Lully and Marin Marais)&mdash;ironic
                associations for, while a conqueror of men and even of
                death, and despite vigorous attempts at amorous
                conquest, the Alcide figure in both these operas ends
                up unhappy in love.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Mirobolant harbors artistic pretensions as well:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  It was a grand sight to behold him in his dressing
                  gown composing a <i>menu</i>. He always sate down and
                  played the piano for some time before. If
                  interrupted, he remonstrated pathetically with his
                  little maid. Every great artist, he said, had need of
                  solitude to perfectionate his works. (Thackeray 1849,
                  I, 218)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>One of Thackeray's own illustrations for the novel
                  depicts this scene <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig18.jpg">fig.
                18</a>]</b>, with the maid scolded by the chef in his
                elegant dressing-gown, and diagonally-slanted cap
                reminiscent of Soyer's. In the Frenchman's quarters, a
                saucepan stands next to a couple of thick volumes, and
                on the wall above this hang portraits honoring two key
                culinary figures: Louis-Eustache Ude, the best-known
                French chef in England before Soyer; and, the Marquis
                de B&eacute;chamel, a seventeenth-century nobleman and
                supposed inventor of the famed sauce bearing his name.
                Mirobolant worries, moreover, that his "genius" is
                wasted upon England's "dull inhabitants": "the poesy of
                my art," he laments, "cannot be understood by these
                carnivorous insularies" (225). Indeed, so emphatic is
                his artistic and, with it, social affectation that,
                when the novel's title character calls him a cook, he
                takes this as an affront to his honor: "'I am Chevalier
                de Juillet,' said [Mirobolant] . . ., slapping his
                breast, 'and he has insulted me. . . . Il m'a
                appel&eacute;&mdash;<i>Cuisinier</i>'" (258). Others
                intercede to avert a duel, a possibility hinging,
                precisely, on the cook's problematic social status.
                Pendennis contends that he "can't fight a cook"
                (261)&mdash;a domestic, hence an inferior&mdash;and is
                furious that Mirobolant accosts him, as if his
                equal:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  To be tapped on the shoulder by a French cook was a
                  piece of familiarity which made the blood of the
                  Pendennises to boil up in the veins of their
                  descendant, and he was astounded, almost more than
                  enraged, at such an indignity. (257)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>In contrast, Mirobolant sees himself, not only as an
                exalted artist, but as an heroic insurgent, a
                "Chevalier de Juillet" who "killed four <i>gardes du
                corps</i> with his own point in the barricades" (261).
                This claim to glory, doubtless exaggerated in
                stereotypical Gascon fashion, caricatures, indeed
                cleverly reverses the terms of Soyer's own, far less
                swashbuckling role in the July Days&mdash;Mirobolant
                would have slain elite troops while standing his ground
                in the street, whereas Soyer was nearly lynched by a
                revolutionary mob while fleeing from a palace
                kitchen.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>To be sure, Thackeray's treatment of this fictional
                chef&mdash;and, by extension, of his model
                Soyer&mdash;is hyperbolic, yet good-hearted, even
                tender, conceived "in the fulness of our love and
                respect for Monsieur Mirobolant" (212). Satirical barbs
                are aimed as much at the English townspeople as at the
                colorful Frenchman in their midst: "Not having been
                accustomed to the appearance or society of persons of
                the French nation, the rustic inhabitants . . . were
                not so favourably impressed by Monsieur Alcide's
                manners and appearance" (222). Curious little children
                begin to follow him, soon joined by older ones,
                "laughing, jeering, hooting, and calling opprobrious
                names to the Frenchman" who "at length . . . began to
                perceive that he was an object of derision rather than
                of respect to the rude grinning mob" (223). So too does
                another of Thackeray's illustrations evoke the
                misunderstandings between the locals and their foreign
                visitor, with a group of children forming behind the
                bizarrely-clad Mirobolant&mdash;the older ones seem
                amused, while the youngest, clutching her doll, appears
                frightened&mdash;and a young woman looks baffled and
                perhaps scared as well by the predatory stare he fires
                her way <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig19.jpg">fig.
                19</a>]</b>. On another level, Mirobolant's misfortunes
                during his stroll about a small English town&mdash;his
                hapless&nbsp;pursuit of local ladies, and persecution
                at the hands of a juvenile "mob"&mdash;offer an ironic
                counterpoint to his supposed heroism on the street, in
                the French capital, during the July Revolution.</p>

                <p>In his day, Soyer even enjoyed considerable renown
                in America, where his books were widely read and
                admired, and his various schemes, inventions, and
                exploits received ample coverage in the popular press.
                For example, a review of the American edition of
                Soyer's <i>The Modern Housewife or
                M&eacute;nag&egrave;re</i>, in the <i>Southern Literary
                Messenger</i>, accords the author great reverence:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  We sit down to discuss a volume of M. Soyer as the
                  undergraduate rises to address an assemblage of
                  professors and doctors of divinity; that is to say,
                  with an unaffected sense of our own incapacity, and
                  an overwhelming conviction of the magnitude and
                  difficulty of the task. (210)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Similarly, the review of Soyer's <i>Culinary
                Campaign</i>, in <i>Harper's Monthly</i>, declares,
                "Every one has heard of Alexis Soyer, the celebrated
                <i>chef de cuisine</i>, . . . [a] <i>litterateur</i>,
                as well as the greatest living master of the mageric
                art" (325).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>While multiple factors contributed to such far-flung
                fame, Soyer's publications were the most important.
                Long before chefs could serve themselves up to a mass
                public on television, Soyer's books were both widely
                distributed, and offered ample opportunity for
                self-presentation, in prefaces and title pages,
                frontispieces and other illustrations, and even
                throughout the text, as we shall see in the case of his
                <i>Culinary Campaign</i>, in which he stars as the hero
                of this autobiographical narrative.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Soyer published his first book in 1845, in French,
                called <i>D&eacute;lassements culinaires</i>, which
                features a ballet, "La Fille de l'Orage," dedicated to
                dancer Fanny Cerrito. The slim volume also includes
                gastronomic essays&mdash;like the recipe for <i>La
                Cr&egrave;me de la Grande Bretagne</i>, actually an
                elaborate compliment to British society
                ladies&mdash;more reminiscent however of
                Brillat-Savarin's entertaining "Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s"
                than of the practical culinary advice Soyer would
                proffer, with such success, in the years ahead. Oddly
                enough, the part of <i>D&eacute;lassements
                culinaires</i> most suggestive of the future course of
                Soyer's career is the curious frontispiece portrait of
                the author <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig20.jpg">fig.
                20</a>]</b>. Like other prominent nineteenth-century
                figures&mdash;notably Napoleon, Byron, Hugo, P.T.
                Barnum, and Sarah Bernhardt&mdash;Soyer seems to have
                intuited much about the importance of images within the
                period's burgeoning fame culture. He no doubt benefited
                in this respect from marriage, in 1837, to the artist
                Emma Jones (1813-1842) <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig21.jpg">fig.
                21</a>]</b>, an accomplished portraitist, whose work he
                venerated, and all the moreso after her untimely death
                in childbirth&mdash;as in this print from <i>The
                  Gastronomic Regenerator</i> (1846) <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig22.jpg">fig.
                22</a>]</b>, in which Emma's absence from Soyer's
                "table at home" is made all the more poignant by the
                presence of her canvases, and by the caption, with its
                Lamartinian undertones, deploring the barrenness of a
                gastronomic gathering "sans Dames." In the frontispiece
                portrait for <i>D&eacute;lassements culinaires</i>
                Soyer's face appears elongated, as if distorted in a
                fun-house mirror. This seemingly unflattering likeness
                nonetheless inspired a "complimentary epistle,"
                reported in Volant and Warren's <i>Memoirs of Alexis
                Soyer</i>, that ends revealingly:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Behold this phiz, of awful length,<br />
                  Equipped with brains of wondrous strength,<br />
                  Compared with which Car&egrave;me's [sic] were
                  dull,<br />
                  And Ude can scarcely boast a skull.<br />
                  Long-headed Soyer, long may thy name<br />
                  Be <i>stretched</i> upon the rolls of Fame.&mdash;L.
                  (57)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>While in jest, Soyer's anonymous contemporary
                (presumably a friend, based on the familiar tone) makes
                a key connection between the elongation of Soyer's
                physiognomy ("phiz"), and his desire for renown.
                Aspiring to rival, even to surpass the most celebrated
                French chefs of the previous generation, Soyer does not
                hesitate to bend and stretch the lines of his portrait,
                to manipulate his image both literally and
                figuratively. We shall see how his penchant for
                self-aggrandizement, for diverging from constraining
                norms, and for reinventing himself, all in the service
                of his reputation, informs his later works,
                particularly their frontispiece portraits. But this
                propensity is already here, in embryonic form.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><i>D&eacute;lassements culinaires</i> seems to have
                been well-received. In particular, Fayot, the editor of
                <i>Les Classiques de la Table</i>, who prided himself
                on having befriended such seminal gastronomic figures
                as Car&ecirc;me, Brillat, Grimod, and the Marquis de
                Cussy, congratulated Soyer at once on the work's
                culinary and literary merits: "Chez vous, monsieur," he
                wrote, "le cuisinier rempli de go&ucirc;t et d'une
                charmante &eacute;l&eacute;gance, &eacute;tincelle dans
                l'&eacute;crivain" (Morris 46). Here, if needed, was
                ample encouragement for Soyer to continue in this
                writerly path. But, in fact, his next publication had
                already been announced, on the last page of
                <i>D&eacute;lassements culinaires</i>: "a work on a
                very different scale, . . . which was to set the seal
                on his reputation and give him his nickname, <i>The
                Gastronomic Regenerator</i>" (Morris 46). What needs to
                be remembered though is that writing of any sort was a
                dubious proposition for Soyer, whose scant formal
                education&mdash;typical for a chef of his
                generation&mdash;had left him in a state of "uneasy
                semi-literacy"; specifically,</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  He could read and write French, though his spelling
                  was shaky and his orthography laborious. But he never
                  learned to write English, though he spoke it, and may
                  have been able to read it . . . . He was therefore
                  forced to rely upon amanuenses, . . . [a] role . . .
                  filled by his wife, . . . and after her death, by a
                  series of secretaries. (Brandon xiii-xiv)&nbsp;
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>In short, Soyer's books were always a pose, passing
                him off as something that, on the most basic level, he
                was not: a writer. This necessarily involved wrestling
                with deep-rooted societal prejudices against cooks,
                still seen largely as lowly domestic help&mdash;indeed,
                "when, in the 1841 census, Soyer gave his occupation as
                a cook, the census-taker automatically listed him among
                the servants, when in fact he was the householder"
                (Brandon 73). So too might chefs, whatever their
                pretensions, be dismissed as ill-educated
                simpletons&mdash;like the dim-looking gent in Bertall's
                illustration <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig4.jpg">fig.
                4</a>]&mdash;</b>the antithesis of the urbane men of
                letters whom ambitious sorts like Soyer sought to
                emulate. As a follow-up to <i>D&eacute;lassements
                culinaires</i>, <i>The Gastronomic Regenerator</i>
                exhibits both the contradictions inherent in Soyer's
                status as would-be man of letters, and his efforts to
                make the most of this tenuous situation. <i>The
                Gastronomic Regenerator</i> would appear, at first
                glance, to be more of a challenge for his questionable
                literacy. It was much longer, and written in English, a
                language he mastered even less than his native French.
                Yet it was also far less literary than its predecessor,
                not a gastronomical essay but rather a practitioner's
                compendium of useful advice, that fit easily within a
                long tradition of similar efforts by distinguished
                French culinarians, from Taillevent to Menon to
                Car&ecirc;me, and continued afterward by figures like
                Jules Gouff&eacute;, Escoffier, or Bocuse. Despite
                whatever difficulties English presented&mdash;largely
                mitigated by the efforts of his
                secretaries&mdash;<i>The Gastronomic Regenerator</i>
                staked out familiar territory, in which Soyer could
                operate from a position of greatest strength.
                Addressing the public of his adopted land in its
                vernacular, and in a popular format that showcased his
                expertise, Soyer hit upon a combination most likely to
                boost his fame, but not to raise doubts about his
                qualifications as an author.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The preface of <i>The Gastronomic Regenerator</i> is
                particularly revealing. Soyer begins with his supposed
                reluctance to embark on a project of this sort, despite
                requests from distinguished visitors to the Reform
                Club, especially ladies:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Why do you not write and publish a
                  Cookery-book?&nbsp;was a question continually put to
                  me. For a considerable time this scientific word
                  caused a thrill of horror to pervade my frame, and
                  brought back to my mind that one day, being in a most
                  superb library in the midst of a splendid baronial
                  hall, by chance I met with one of Milton's
                  allegorical works, the profound ideas of Locke, and
                  several chefs d'oeuvre of one of the noblest
                  champions of literature, Shakspeare; when all at once
                  my attention was attracted by the nineteenth edition
                  of a voluminous work: such an immense success of
                  publication caused me to say, 'Oh! You celebrated
                  man, posterity counts every hour of fame upon your
                  regretted ashes!' Opening this work with intense
                  curiosity, to my great disappointment what did I
                  see&mdash;a receipt for Ox-tail Soup!&nbsp;The
                  terrifying effect produced upon me by this succulent
                  volume made me determine that my few ideas, whether
                  culinary or domestic, should never encumber a
                  sanctuary which should be entirely devoted to works
                  worthy of a place in the Temple of the Muses.
                  (vii-viii)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Tellingly, the idea of producing his own cookbook
                conjures up in his mind the most prestigious works in
                the British literary canon, mentioned ostensibly in
                contrast with culinary works not worthy of such
                elevated status. Yet it is precisely such a book that
                beckons him. Its numerous editions, its "immense
                success of publication," and the extraordinary fame of
                its author arouse his "intense curiosity," even if he
                feigns "great disappointment" upon discovering it to be
                a cookbook. Through this amusingly contrived anecdote,
                Soyer grapples with traditional notions of literary
                glory, in order to stake his own, alternate claim
                within the world of letters. Within this context, it
                does not seem coincidental that he refers to great
                works of literature as "chefs d'oeuvre"&mdash;he could
                have used the English term "masterpieces"&mdash;making
                "chefs" intrude into a category that would seem to
                exclude them. This turn of mind becomes all the clearer
                in the preface's concluding sentence. Having now
                written a book of recipes, he begs the reader to "put
                [it] in a place suited to its little merit, and not
                with Milton's sublime Paradise, for there it certainly
                would be doubly lost" (viii). This last phrase is
                particularly suggestive for, if side-by-side with
                Milton, Soyer's volume would be condemned to nether
                regions of literary endeavor, yet also, in the rarefied
                space of a baronial library, it would not be available
                to the far broader public it targets. Foregoing the
                "sublime," Soyer aims instead at popular "success."
                Perhaps most tellingly, and notwithstanding his
                pretense of modesty throughout the preface, the last
                line is followed by a large, bold facsimile of Soyer's
                signature&mdash;the graphic measure of his authorial
                ambition.</p>

                <p>The frontispiece portrait of Soyer in <i>The

                23</a>]</b> is far less unusual than the one in his
                first book. It is a flattering likeness, lovingly
                rendered by his wife, in which, with his dark eyes and
                sensuous mouth, he appears handsome, sensitive,
                thoughtful, and also younger than at the time of the
                book's publication (necessarily so, since Emma had died
                four years earlier). There is no border here, in
                contrast to the increasingly elaborate ones that would
                frame his portrait in his next two major publications,
                <i>The Modern Housewife</i>, and <i>The
                Pantropheon</i>. His attire is also more restrained
                than in other likenesses, though he does wear his
                signature cap on a characteristic diagonal&mdash;a

                24</a>]</b> uses the same portrait by Emma Soyer, but
                surrounds it with a fanciful border that combines
                floral garlands with other decorative motifs which, at
                the level of the author's head, morph into chimera-like
                winged creatures, likely an allusion to the flights of
                his creative imagination. Above his head we find a
                <i>fleur-de-lys</i>-like motif, perhaps betokening the
                author's Frenchness, and below him the border forms a
                frame around his signature, the quintessence of
                authorial identity. Already, this image tries harder to
                portray Soyer as an important personage and,
                specifically, as an author.</p>

              <li>
                <p>Soyer seems to have found himself increasingly
                emboldened by the success of these books. His authorial
                pose thus continues, indeed culminates in his next
                publication, the <i>Pantropheon</i> (1853). The
                  frontispiece <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig25.jpg">fig.
                25</a>]</b> offers an elaborate iconographical program,
                seemingly appropriate for an ambitious work subtitled
                "History of Food, and its preparation, from the
                earliest ages of the world." The central portrait of
                the author&mdash;again, the same one by Emma
                Soyer&mdash;is surrounded by a gastronomic allegory
                spanning food production, preparation, service, and
                writing, in vignettes organized clockwise, around five
                putti figures. In addition, parallel staffs flank the
                composition: at left, topped by a pineapple and hung
                with fowl, symbolizing hospitality and plenty; at
                right, topped by a trident and hung with fish,
                symbolizing&nbsp; the ocean's bounty.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>At lower left, one putto sits wedged between a sheaf
                of wheat that rests upon a pile of game, and grape
                vines surmounted by a cluster of hanging fowl. He gazes
                downward at the bunch of grapes in his hands, which he
                squeezes into a chalice, the fruits of the natural
                world thus transformed by human hands. Above, three
                more putti display finished products, in divergent
                realms of gastronomic endeavor: wine and spirit-making,
                as the figure at left hoists a massive, crystal
                decanter; pastry-making, as the one at right holds up a
                decorative, circular confection upon a platter; and
                cooking, as the central putto lifts the lid from a
                steaming cauldron set upon a lively fire, an archetypal
                <i>pot au feu</i>. There is upward movement throughout,
                accentuated by ardent flames and ascending puffs of
                smoke and steam, figuring a Hegelian <i>Aufhebung</i>,
                toward what Brillat-Savarin called "transcendent
                gastronomy." Indeed, this whole scene is reminiscent of
                the upper vignette in Bertall's "Les Aliments"
                  <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig26.jpg">fig.
                26</a>]</b>, a plate for the 1846 (and then still
                recent) edition of Brillat-Savarin's <i>Physiologie du
                go&ucirc;t</i>, in which the raw is cooked,
                transfigured through the alchemy of fire and artistry
                of a professional chef, as smoke and steam billow up,
                into a celestial vision of gastronomic delight, crowned
                by a giant mouth, from which beatific rays project
                outward&mdash;illustrating both Brillat's concept of
                transcendent gastronomy, and the broader French ideal
                of cultural "rayonnement."</p>

                putto, his right (and writing) hand resting upon a pile
                of giant books marked with the names of classical
                authors; his left held pensively to his mouth, pathway
                to gastronomic experience; his head tilted and brow
                furrowed, further signifying thoughtfulness; with, at
                his feet and alongside the oversized tomes, water
                running across and down, toward the lower right
                corner&mdash;spilling over, as it were, into the text
                that follows. In this way, it depicts the contemporary
                food writer's work, his reflections both&nbsp;inspired
                by gustatory remembrances and flowing from classical
                'sources,' thus completing the sweep of this
                gastronomic allegory, from raw ingredients, through
                prepared food and drink, on to the written appreciation
                thereof.</p>

                <p>The five putti, as well as the branch and vine motif
                linking them, recall another Bertall plate for the 1846
                <i>Physiologie du go&ucirc;t</i>, "Les Sens"
                  <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig27.jpg">fig.
                27</a>]</b>, and through this the long philosophical
                and iconographical traditions of five senses
                allegories, so often invoked in gastronomic contexts
                like this (Garval 2005). In addition, the allusions
                here to earth, air, fire, and water call to mind
                allegories of the four elements. Together, the
                intimations of these two venerable allegorical
                traditions elevate the gastronomic allegory at hand,
                lending classical resonance and philosophical depth to
                the engraving and, by extension, to the work that
                follows. Indeed, the next plate in the volume continues
                in this vein, suggesting yet more emphatically the
                scope of Soyer's ambition. Set opposite the dedication
                "To the Genius of Gastronomy," the print shows the
                earth, floating in space, amid the brilliant rays of
                the sun and dramatically-shaded masses of clouds, and
                encircled by a giant banner inscribed with the motto
                "DEUS CREATOR, TERRA NUTRIX." Soyer's seemingly humble
                subject&mdash;food&mdash;takes on cosmological
                dimensions. <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig28.jpg">fig.

              <li>
                <p>But what of the central author's portrait in the
                  frontispiece <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig25.jpg">fig.
                25</a>]</b>?&nbsp;At bottom center, an antler projects
                into this space on a bias, directing our gaze toward
                Soyer, and drawing attention to the diagonal skew, not
                only of his hallmark hat, but also of the oval frame
                surrounding his effigy. These angles are likewise
                echoed and emphasized by those of the wheat sheaf and
                books below, as by the decanter and pot lid above, with
                the uppermost putto similarly coiffed but facing the
                opposite way, at once a visual counterpoint in the
                composition and mirror image of the mature chef he
                emulates. While less obvious, the upright staffs and
                the portrait itself also lean slightly in the same
                direction as the oval vignette, as if pulled by an
                alternate, tilting gravitation, a subtle warping of
                ordinary physical laws. Contemplating this
                idiosyncratic rendering of an eccentric figure, who
                looks out at us, and we in at him, through an unusual,
                diagonal window, we stand before a portal into Soyer's
                realm&mdash;into a text that promises his peculiar,
                gastronomic slant on the world, and world history.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>We thus might well expect the originality of Soyer's
                thought in this work to rival the legendary originality
                of his appearance. However, the biggest put-on here is
                not the pretentious frontispiece, but the text that
                follows. Soyer's contemporaries did not know it, but it
                has since been revealed that he most likely did not
                compose it himself, with the exception of the chapter
                on "Modern Banquets" (McKirdy). The rest of this
                sizable work was probably written by a certain Adolphe
                Duhart-Fauvet, an obscure French teacher living in
                London at the time, whose knowledge of ancient Greek
                and Latin (in contrast to Soyer's marginal literacy in
                modern French and English) would have enabled him to
                handle the book's roughly 3,000 classical references.
                Soyer seems to have paid Duhart-Fauvet for his efforts,
                had the work translated into
                English&mdash;"mis&eacute;rablement traduit en Anglais
                par je ne sais quels manoeuvres litt&eacute;raires,"
                according to Duhart-Fauvet's hand-written notes on his
                copy of the book (McKirdy 19)&mdash;and then he took
                all the credit. Perhaps, as Brandon suggests, this "one
                truly dishonest act of his life" can be explained
                through his state of mind at the time, which she
                qualifies as "something as near depression as was
                possible in so buoyant a character," following the
                collapse of his grandiose <i>Symposium of All
                Nations</i> restaurant project, in 1851 (Brandon 228).
                But, as the visual evidence of his increasingly
                elaborate frontispieces suggests, this was also a
                logical next step in Soyer's ongoing, authorial
                masquerade: to appear in the most exalted of guises, as
                a savant who appropriates the wisdom and prestige of
                the ancients. This was an ideal all the more desirable
                for a man with Soyer's great ambition but negligeable
                education. After realizing it, however disingenuously,
                he retreated from this encroachment upon the hallowed
                ground of classical scholarship, and returned in short
                order to more familiar territory, publishing another
                cookbook the following year. Perhaps, a fundamentally
                decent man, he found it impossible to continue such a
                flagrant imposture. Perhaps he just decided that it
                didn't pay, since the <i>Pantropheon</i> sold
                badly.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In contrast to the <i>Pantropheon</i>'s arid
                classical erudition, the lively popularizing bent of
                Soyer's <i>Shilling Cookery for the People</i> (1854)
                made it a great publishing success. In the frontispiece
                  <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig29.jpg">fig.
                29</a>]</b>, Soyer's portrait has, finally, been
                updated, and looks more like the 45-year old he had
                become. It does appear again inside an attractive, oval
                vignette, but this time standing sensibly upright, and
                minus the surrounding decorative and allegorical
                program: a more sober presentation, seemingly in
                concert with this work's common-sense, no-frills theme.
                There are still however three "signature" elements,
                within the oval frame, that all run on the same jaunty
                slant: his hallmark hat; a copy of this book, which its
                author holds in his hand (the spine reads "Soyer's
                Shilling . . ."); and, his signature itself, far larger
                and bolder than those, on either side, of the artist
                and engraver. Soyer cuts a rakish figure in this
                portrait, with his elaborately-knotted cravat,
                embroidered vest, and silk moir&eacute;-trimmed
                waistcoat. To be sure, there is some contradiction in
                such a self-presentation leading off a volume
                "embracing an entirely new system of plain cookery and
                domestic economy." Yet, while his writerly pose is less
                emphatic here than in the <i>Pantropheon</i>
                frontispiece, Soyer still aims to fashion himself in a
                literary mold, not so much as the author of this work,
                but more generally as an Author, whose <i>oeuvre</i>
                projects well beyond this particular volume. To this
                end, on the title page, his name is followed by an
                implicitly expansive list of his works: "Author of 'The
                Modern Housewife, Etc., Etc." Similarly, beneath this,
                he quotes from the <i>Pantropheon</i>:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  "Religion feeds the soul, Education the mind, Food
                  the body."
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>His would-be pearl of wisdom is doubly unoriginal:
                "Food feeds" is the most uninspired of gastronomic
                reflections and, like the rest of the
                <i>Pantropheon</i>, probably plagiarized. But, this
                irony notwithstanding, by citing his <i>Pantropheon</i>
                at the head of a new volume, Soyer points toward his
                larger <i>oeuvre</i> and also indulges in a
                quasi-Napoleonic gesture of auto-apotheosis, anointing
                himself as an Author and, in the original sense of the
                word, as an Authority. This suggests, once again, the
                lengths to which he might go to advance his reputation.
                Yet <i>Shilling Cookery</i> also found Soyer at a
                crossroads of distinct but related evolutions within
                his career. On the one hand, his literary pretensions
                had risen in a crescendo, from <i>The Gastronomic
                Regenerator</i>, to <i>The Modern Housewife</i>, to a
                veritable paroxysm of bad faith in the
                <i>Pantropheon</i>. On the other, his popularizing bent
                had grown more pronounced over the years as well, from
                <i>The Gastronomic Regenerator</i>, aimed at well-to-do
                readers; to <i>The Modern Housewife</i>, which targeted
                a bourgeois audience; to <i>Shilling Cookery</i>
                (anticipated by his earlier booklet, "The Poor Man's
                Regenerator") which catered to the working class. In
                short, in his ongoing quest for fame, he had already
                pushed his authorial masquerade to the maximum in the
                <i>Pantropheon</i>, and now retreated from this extreme
                stance; so too he had worked his way from the top to
                the bottom of the social ladder in his cookbooks,
                striking an egalitarian note as well with his
                interesting though short-lived <i>Symposium of All
                Nations</i>.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Within Soyer's career there were also suggestive
                parallels with that of another ambitious Frenchman
                living in London in the 1840s: Louis-Napol&eacute;on
                Bonaparte. In 1846, Napol&eacute;on Bonaparte's nephew
                published <i>De l'extinction du paup&eacute;risme</i>,
                a utopian socialist tract on the problem of poverty; in
                1847 Soyer did much the same, in a gastronomic
                register, with "The Poor Man's Regenerator." Both works
                appealed to the masses and, riding the wave of social
                unrest leading to the Revolution of 1848, cast their
                authors advantageously as concerned champions of the
                people. Louis-Napol&eacute;on's populism, which helped
                get him elected President of the French Republic,
                turned authoritarian and megalomaniac with his <i>coup
                d'&eacute;tat</i> of December 2, 1851, and ascent to
                the imperial throne as Napol&eacute;on III, on the
                coup's anniversary (these dates deliberately echoed the
                glory of Napol&eacute;on I, who crowned himself Emperor
                o&ograve;n December 2, 1804, and prevailed at
                Austerlitz exactly one year later). Soon Soyer ventured
                an analogous self-promotion, with the publication of
                his <i>Pantropheon</i> (1853), a gesture likewise
                imperialist in scope&mdash;covering food across the
                globe, throughout history&mdash;while also
                fundamentally bogus. But, at least at this point in
                history, a Bonaparte could still get away with a level
                of dubious self-aggrandizement that a chef, however
                renowned, could not. Faced with the lukewarm reception
                accorded his most recent work, Soyer was wise to stake
                his reputation instead on a more genially
                crowd-pleasing volume: the flatulent pretense of the
                <i>Pantropheon</i> thus yielded to the frank populism
                of <i>Shilling Cookery</i>.</p>

                <p>One could imagine that a less restless, more
                boringly sensible sort would feel that he had found his
                path at last and, nearing 50, would settle down to a
                comfortable life writing popular cookbooks. But not
                Soyer. So what would this peripatetic figure do
                next?<br />

                <p>The Crimean War offered Soyer an unexpected
                opportunity to try something new, to reinvent himself
                yet again and, in the process, to further his renown.
                Dismayed by the newspaper accounts of British troops
                starving, Soyer volunteered his expertise. He designed
                a superior field stove <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig10.jpg">fig.
                10</a>]</b> and, despite the many dangers, traveled to
                the Crimea where, from the Spring of 1855 to the Spring
                of 1857, he reformed the British Army's kitchens, as
                well as its inefficient ways of provisioning them.
                While there, he also hobnobbed with British and French
                high commanders, and with the war's other humanitarian
                celebrities, Florence Nightingale and Mary Seacole. His
                efforts attracted attention in the press, and provided
                fodder for contemporary satirists, as in the comic
                sketch "Camp Cookery"&mdash;attributed to "Alicksus
                Sawder" and published in the humorous collection <i>Our
                Miscellany</i> (1856)&mdash;which poked fun at the
                  preparations Soyer designed for the troops <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig30.jpg">fig.
                30</a>]</b>. His work did, nonetheless, improve the
                plight of British soldiers, making a real contribution
                to the war effort.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>When Soyer returned to London, he published an
                account of his adventures in the Crimea, entitled
                <i>Soyer's Culinary Campaign</i> (1857). Reviewers
                ridiculed the <i>beau r&ocirc;le</i> Soyer accorded
                himself in these historical events, their criticisms
                enlivened with abundant culinary references: <i>The
                Times</i> of London remarked, for example, that "Alexis
                the Savoury opens his box of condiments, and shows us
                indisputably how fields are won. Such and such
                proportions of pepper and salt went to make such a
                breach or to repulse such a night attack." <i>The North
                American Review</i>, while published in faraway Iowa,
                also refused to be duped by the famed foreign chef's
                visions of grandeur, and decried "this very inordinate
                vanity, this exaggeration of the value of his services
                and the importance of his reforms, this singular
                simplicity of egotism" (262). But, if nothing else, the
                book brought Soyer renewed attention&mdash;and perhaps
                there is no such thing as bad publicity, as P.T. Barnum
                is supposed to have said.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In his previous published works, Soyer's efforts at
                self-presentation were limited largely to the paratext,
                i.e. the prefaces, title pages, and especially
                frontispieces. His <i>Culinary Campaign</i> however
                offered Soyer an unprecedented forum for
                self-fashioning and promotion, turning himself into a
                sort of bold, humanitarian Mirobolant&mdash;the
                multifaceted if deluded hero of his own narrative. As
                the <i>Times</i> review remarks, "Soyer the Great, like
                the heroes and demigods of ancient mythology, . . .
                with his compound functions, is nevertheless a
                consistent personage, except where, possibly from his
                wanting a little medicine, he forgets for a moment that
                he is the centre of creation."</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Conversely then, the paratext here is remarkably
                understated, giving little hint of the fanciful memoir
                that follows. The frontispiece <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig31.jpg">fig.
                31</a>]</b> is sober, with no tell-tale borders,
                depicting "The Author" simply as the tired, aging,
                ailing veteran of this "culinary campaign," without
                even his signature cap. While the engraving of his
                likeness "From a Photograph" does, at this early point
                in the history of photography, confer upon the sitter a
                certain stylish and modern air, it also suggests a kind
                of documentary seriousness, which Soyer's grave facial
                expression seems to confirm. So too does the title page
                present the work in earnest tones, as<br /></p>

                <p>His "principal object," he claims in the preface, is
                to "perpetuate the successful efforts made by him" to
                improve&nbsp;British soldiers' diet. The preface also
                alludes to the book's "literary portion [which] the
                Author has dished up to the best of his ability," yet
                downplays it, allowing that readers may not "relish"
                this, and hoping that the work's "literary
                deficiencies" would be compensated for by the
                "succulence" of "the many new and valuable receipts,
                applicable to the Army, Navy, Military and Civilian
                Institutions, and the public in general" (Soyer 1995,
                xiii; all references to this edition, unless noted
                otherwise). His use of culinary vocabulary ("portion,"
                "dish up," "relish," "succulent"), like the title
                page's qualification of him as "Author of 'The Modern
                Housewife,' 'Shilling Cookery for the People,' Etc.,"
                underscore the modesty of the role he seems to be
                assuming, as no more than a simple cookbook author.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Should all this make one expect a dull treatise on
                mess-hall dining, the book's opening plate and opening
                line promise far more spectacular fare instead, in line
                with Soyer's well-known histrionic proclivities.
                "'HURRAH! hurrah! Bravo! Bravo!'" (1) begins the
                narrative, with "rounds of applause" that mark the end
                of a show Soyer attended at "Old Drury," making the
                reader wonder what other sorts of performances lie
                ahead. So too the opening plate <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig32.jpg">fig.
                32</a>]</b>, by illustrator G.H. Hine, on the preceding
                page, offers a kind of alternate frontispiece, far more
                theatrical, and suggestive of what is to come, than the
                official one, with its subdued portrait. Here Soyer
                stands center stage within a scene that, in concert
                with the work's title, juxtaposes kitchen and
                battlefield. He stands in the foreground, next to one
                of his field stoves, from whence rise smoke and steam
                that mix with the surrounding battlefield haze, the
                literal fog of war, to form a cloud in which appear the
                work's title and author's name, the latter on a
                characteristic, sharp diagonal. At Soyer's feet
                lie&nbsp;battlefield debris, like broken wood or
                various-sized cannonballs, and, most prominently, next
                to the stove, provisions for cooking. These include a
                large cabbage beside a large cannonball, and smaller
                soup vegetables (onions, turnips) that resemble the
                smaller cannonballs nearby. The similar size and shape
                of foodstuffs and munitions, and their proximity,
                suggest their affinity&mdash;their parallel role in a
                "culinary campaign." In the hazy background we can just
                make out the silhouettes of two cannoneers, who load
                guns to be fired out, beyond our field of vision, into
                the battle, thus placing Soyer and his field kitchen
                squarely behind the lines and, paradoxically it
                seems&mdash;given his starring role here&mdash;behind
                the scenes.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In the middleground two soldiers carry a stockpot,
                suspended on a pole, toward the line of battle. A few
                steps away, a kneeling artilleryman lifts one
                cannonball from a pile, presumably to bring it to the
                cannoneers for loading. He faces us, his back to the
                hostilities, but when he has lifted the cannonball, he
                will no doubt turn and head the same way as his
                stockpot-toting comrades. In the other direction, in
                the space separating him from Soyer, providing a visual
                link between the two men and the spaces they occupy,
                sits an unidentified case, fitted with wooden supports
                to facilitate carrying, suggesting its use transporting
                supplies to and fro, yet the nature of these
                contents&mdash;culinary, or military?&mdash;remains
                indeterminate. Along similar lines the <i>Times</i>
                reviewer asks, about the "spherical objects" in this
                print, "Are they cannon-balls to be stewed into cannon
                broth, or Dutch cheeses about to be fired from a
                mortar? . . . the culinary and combative emblems are so
                mixed that our judgment is perplexed and we stumble
                over our history." Indeed, starting from the provisions
                at lower right, sweeping across and upward like the
                stove's copious exhaust, through chef Soyer, to the
                kneeling artilleryman, to the soup carriers, and on to
                the distant cannoneers at upper left, the composition
                traces a supply chain, visually compelling and
                coherent, yet heterogeneous, systematically mixing food
                and weapons. Despite the scene's apparent seriousness
                and sense of purpose, there also lurks, just beneath
                the surface, the carnivalesque spectacle of a
                Rabelaisian food-fight, with cabbages as cannonballs,
                and stockpots as war engines.<a href=

              <li>
                <p>This plate reverses conventional battlefield
                imagery, highlighting not some bold cavalry officer's
                charge into hostile territory, but rather the chief
                culinary campaigner's efforts behind the lines. The
                focal point of the composition, Soyer stands next to
                both his signature invention and byline writ large, his
                name and hat both on a characteristic diagonal, the
                latter less emphatically so, however, than in other
                portraits. Indeed, his garb is less dandified than
                elsewhere, and generally martial, but still with
                original twists&mdash;in addition to the cocked hat,
                his extra-wide trouser stripe, or broad, flaring
                lapels. "Standard issue" was just not Soyer's
                style.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The small cannonballs on the ground around him,
                whether stray British munitions or vestiges of enemy
                volleys, signal the nearness of hostilities, and thus
                danger to the would-be warrior-chef, who strikes an
                appropriately resolute pose. On some level, this may be
                a wishful reworking of Soyer's far less heroic stance
                under fire during the July Revolution. But, more than
                just unflappable here, Soyer appears virtually
                immobile. His hands are absent, lost in his pockets.
                His tiny feet, while signifying elegance and refinement
                to the nineteenth-century viewer, also seem inadequate
                for his well-nourished frame, offering dubious support
                for a man of action. These apparent handicaps only make
                sense within the context of his broader efforts to
                fashion himself an author and inventor. A man not so
                much of action, but of ideas&mdash;less a warrior, than
                a wizard&mdash;he accomplishes extraordinary things
                less through physical agency than through sheer force
                of will, as if by magic.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>There are indeed, in this plate, intimations of
                something greater, grander, beyond the seemingly
                mundane, repetitive tasks being performed. These
                include the eerily bright light bathing Soyer, the high
                seriousness of his facial expression, or various
                literary and cultural resonances&mdash;from the
                Rabelaisian undertones, to the message emerging from a
                puff of smoke, shades of Aladdin's lamp, the sorcerer's
                cauldron, and even the Angel of God in the burning
                bush. So too, in Soyer's narrative, what seems ordinary
                never is: thus, a ragged young stowaway, "in spite of
                his attire, looked as brisk and independent as a modern
                Diogenes" (300); or, Lord Raglan's headquarters which,
                while "by no means grand nor imposing," brings to mind
                illustrious comparisons, "Shakespeare's house at
                Stratford, or the humble cot of the poet Burns in
                Ayrshire" (124). Likewise, a visit to the hospital and
                barracks at Kululee, to take stock of kitchen utensils
                and provisions (including "some very nice calfs'-foot
                jelly"), and to evaluate the inefficiency of the stoves
                (which used "about 170 per cent. more wood than was
                necessary"), is framed by astonishing panoramas of
                Constantinople, spied from the road&mdash;first under
                the blazing midday sun, then by "beautiful Oriental
                moonlight" on the return trip&mdash;views "so sublime
                and picturesque . . . that in an enchanted dream alone
                one could hope to realize the effect of the mirage"
                (77-79). In Soyer's Romantic turn of mind, the sublime
                always looms on the horizon.</p>

              <li>
                <p>Much like his contemporary Victor Hugo who, in exile
                during the Second Empire, turned increasingly to
                distinguished precursors (e.g. Moses, St. John the
                Baptist, Dante, or Voltaire) to defend and illustrate
                his reputation (Garval 2004a 177-187), Soyer conjures
                up notable ghosts. At an unexpected luncheon encounter
                with "the scion of a celebrated epicure," his
                apostrophe to the departed <i>gourmand</i> recalls
                Hugo's dabbling in spiritism at the time: "Oh! Sefton,
                Sefton! may your noble ashes repose in peace in your
                tomb!&nbsp; The glory of your name has not faded: your
                grandson, the youthful Lord Sefton, is an epicure!"
                (284). The other gastronomic and culinary figures he
                invokes include the ancients Apicius (196) and Lucullus
                (278); his "countryman" Brillat-Savarin (166); and
                especially Vatel, the patron saint and holy martyr of
                French cuisine&mdash;actually an <i>officier de
                bouche</i> or steward, whom Soyer, like many others,
                mistakes for a <i>chef de cuisine</i>, an inaccuracy
                that exaggerates chefs' social status at the time: "O
                Vatel! my noble master . . . . Fortunately you lived in
                an era of gastronomic grandeur, when a <i>chef de
                cuisine</i> bore a high rank, and had your own
                aristocratic weapon wherewith to do the noble deed
                which gilds your name" (280-281; cf. also 229). With no
                such weapon at hand, but likewise facing a grand dinner
                "in jeopardy," the incurably cheerful Soyer does not
                imitate his paragon's suicide; instead, he opens a
                bottle of champagne and, he notes, "At the second glass
                . . . everything appeared <i>couleur de rose</i> . . .
                I felt that success was certain" (280).</p>

              <li>
                <p>Soyer relishes basking in the reflected light, not
                just of such past "gastronomic grandeur" but,
                revealingly, of grandeur <i>tout court</i>. Napoleon,
                Romantic paradigm of glory, is of course an unavoidable
                reference. En route from Marseille to Constantinople,
                Soyer stops at the emperor's birthplace in Corsica, and
                provides an account of the visit, reproduced in his
                <i>Culinary Campaign</i>.<a href=
                "#7"><sup>7</sup></a>
                Always eager to distinguish himself, he turns this
                by-then standard pilgrimage into an original, and
                appropriately culinary one: presumably mustering the
                same lady-killing charm as his <i>sosie</i> Mirobolant,
                he convinces La Signora Grossetti, the Buonaparte
                family's 83-year old housekeeper, to show him the
                kitchen, "a request having never before been made by
                the numerous travellers who daily visit" (40). Relating
                to Napoleon by examining the "ruins" of his kitchen,
                chef Soyer stakes out an idiosyncratic, personal
                connection with the now-defunct great man. He thus pens
                his narrative of the visit "upon the stove in this
                celebrated kitchen&mdash;which first alimented the
                brain of that great hero," and which, we infer, now
                inspires these lines. He lays claim to culinary
                souvenirs "from that epoch"&mdash;"a piece of tile from
                the charcoal stove, and a rough wooden meat-hook . . .
                found in the larder"&mdash;which he intends to place in
                his kitchen at Scutari. In questionable taste, but
                likewise revealing of this keen desire to establish an
                intimate link with Bonaparte, he boasts to his travel
                companions of his "amorous adventure with the nurse of
                the first Napoleon" (40-41). In the accompanying
                illustration <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig33.jpg">fig.
                33</a>]</b>, Soyer stands alone, peering into the
                shadowy opening of the stove, as if contemplating the
                mysteries of Napoleon's destiny, the darkness that
                emanates and enshrouds him suggesting both the stove's
                erstwhile radiance, and that of the luminary it once
                nourished.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>In much the same way, Soyer takes pains to place
                himself in the footsteps of that other great Romantic
                hero, Lord Byron, epitome of passion and flair, and
                celebrated champion of the underdog, who wrote famously
                of his travels in Greece and Turkey, and perished on a
                mission to free the Greeks from Turkish rule. Byron,
                like Napoleon, was an exemplar for nineteenth-century
                glory-seekers, and particularly for creative figures
                like Soyer, but the latter's affinity for the Romantic
                poet and ill-starred revolutionary was especially
                wide-ranging and long-standing. Soyer dressed with the
                exuberance of the 1820s well into the sober 1850s, a
                dashing, Byronic character amid dour, black-suited
                Gladstones. His culinary campaign aided the British war
                effort in general, yet benefited most directly the
                undernourished rank and file, much like his crusade to
                feed the Irish poor during the Potato Famine, or like
                his increasingly popularizing cookbooks, which offered
                the masses appetizing but inexpensive recipes. In
                addition, Soyer's humanitarian mission to the Crimea
                took him to the same part of the world, and even to
                some of the same locales Byron had visited decades
                earlier; he too fell gravely ill while away and, though
                he did return to London, his health was altered, and he
                would survive just over a year, before his untimely
                death.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>While Soyer's career ended on this dramatically
                Byronic note, it had also begun&mdash;and, in large
                measure, played out&mdash;in the same "key of B."
                Arriving in London in 1831, the strains of a
                fortuitously-intoned <i>Marseillaise</i> still ringing
                in his ears, the young faux-revolutionary took on, and
                took off with, the recently-defunct radical Romantic's
                dandified persona. Not unlike the beret-coiffed,
                baguette-toting American exchange student in Paris,
                straining to be more French than the French, Soyer came
                to London and strove to out-Byron Byron. And,
                throughout his career, Soyer's fervent emulation of the
                Byronic model largely defined the tenor of his fame,
                fashioning a figure at once endearing and ridiculous,
                avant-garde and retrograde, a champion of the common
                people cloaked in the most uncommon frippery, his
                extraordinary singularity served up in frenzied pursuit
                of mass-market ubiquity.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>As in the case of Napoleon, Soyer's <i>Culinary
                Campaign</i> stresses his personal connection to Byron.
                He notes of his "first-class interpreter" at Scutari,
                Mr. Black:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  . . . what was more remarkable still, he was the
                  husband of the celebrated Maid of Athens, whose
                  company I had the pleasure of enjoying several times;
                  and although this interesting personage is now in her
                  tenth lustre, some remains of the great Byron seem
                  still engraved on the physiognomy of the once
                  celebrated Greek beauty; and she informed me that
                  when Lord Byron wrote his poem on her, she was but
                  ten years of age, he at the time residing opposite
                  the house of her parents at Athens. (75)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Here, as with Napoleon's housekeeper, Soyer makes
                this connection through a very old woman, who spans the
                generations separating him from these illustrious
                predecessors. Soyer even finds Byron worth mentioning
                when this is not really relevant, quoting his dragoman
                who recounts a "curious tale" about the Leander Tower,
                but then remarks that "it has not the least relation to
                the legend of the two lovers celebrated by Lord Byron,
                who also swam from Sestos to Abydos" (49).<a href=
                "#8"><sup>8</sup></a>
                In Soyer's narrative, he includes as well a letter he
                addressed to the <i>London Illustrated News</i>, dated
                "ACROPOLIS, ATHENS, <i>March 18</i>": "At the present
                time," he notes, "in the ancient Parthenon, I am
                cooking, with my new camp-stove, on a fallen capital of
                the stupendous ruins, a <i>petit d&eacute;jeuner
                &agrave; la fourchette</i>, with Greek and Sicilian
                wines, for my distinguished fellow-travelers" (42-43).
                His choice of a cook-out site is strategic, for this is
                not only one of the most prestigious monuments in
                western civilization but, more specifically, a place
                haunted by the memory of Byron, whose impassioned
                defense of the Greek claim to the Parthenon friezes so
                identified him with the ancient temple that it was even
                suggested he be buried there. The accompanying
                illustration <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig34.jpg">fig.
                34</a>]</b> parallels the earlier one of Soyer at
                Ajaccio. As his travel companions look on, Soyer once
                again stands in the foreground, toward the left, facing
                a stove that effects his communion with the "ruins" of
                a distinguished past. What indeed might emerge here
                from his suggestively-named "Magic Stove"?&nbsp;A trio
                of hungry officers watch and gesture at the flash of
                light rising from the pan Soyer heats over the stove: a
                vision of the fork-breakfast ahead, and perhaps also
                the ghostly afterglow of Byron's presence.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>But summoning spirits is a tricky business. Implied
                comparisons between the great men of yore and the
                contemporary aspirant can backfire, as the example of
                Napol&eacute;on III so amply demonstrated at the time,
                with tragedy repeating as farce, and grandeur shrinking
                to pettiness.<a href=
                "#9"><sup>9</sup></a>
                Still, the temptation to invoke the prestige of past
                glory can be irresistible, even for those who should
                know better. Victor Hugo excoriated Napol&eacute;on III
                for emulating an illustrious uncle, while he himself
                indulged in far greater genealogical pretensions,
                verging on messianic delusion, for which he in turn was
                lampooned by contemporary commentators and artists
                (Garval 2004a 178-179). What then of Soyer, who rivaled
                Hugo in his verve and hunger for fame, but without a
                shred of the critical perspective that, alas, would
                fail the exiled poet?&nbsp;Not surprisingly, Soyer cuts
                a ridiculous figure vis-&agrave;-vis his chosen
                exemplars. Where Vatel once brandished a sword, he
                wields a champagne bottle; where Bonaparte led <i>la
                Grande Arm&eacute;e</i>, he commands a field kitchen;
                and, where Byron leapt to the defense of the Greek
                people, he prepares an omelette.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Soyer can seem ridiculous in many ways, both as
                protagonist and narrator of his <i>Culinary
                Campaign</i>. He cannot resist a gag or pun, no matter
                how awful&mdash;for instance, about Mary Seacole, a
                Jamaican mother figure or <i>m&egrave;re noire</i>, at
                the Black Sea or <i>Mer Noire</i>. He also interlards
                his narrative with copious commercial plugs, dropped
                names, celebrity endorsements, and testimonials. Yet,
                amid such manic foolishness and puffery, there remains
                the admirable spectacle of a man who, in a very real
                way, contributed more to the war effort than the
                military commanders of this dismally mismanaged
                conflict. Since then, Soyer's innovations have also
                been recognized for their more general usefulness, by
                militaries worldwide. Already in 1861, for example, in
                U.S. Army Colonel H. L. Scott's influential <i>Military
                Dictionary</i>, the "Cooking" entry quoted 16 pages
                worth of Soyer's recipes, directly from his <i>Culinary
                Campaign</i>. Similarly, an online "Short History" of
                logistics, maintained by the Canadian armed forces,
                still notes Soyer's "quantum leap in the art and
                science of food services during the Crimean War . . . .
                [He] invented a mobile kitchen, which virtually took
                military cookery from the Middle Ages into the modern
                world."</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p><i>Soyer's Culinary Campaign</i> is remarkable as
                well for the way it renegotiates his public persona
                and, in a larger sense, redefines prominent chefs'
                place in society. The book's prefatory material already
                resists the literary pretense so prevalent elsewhere in
                his <i>oeuvre</i>, the standard recourse of
                image-conscious chefs for a half-century already, and
                at least another half-century to come. Turning away
                from the the man of letters paradigm allowed Soyer to
                envision other possibilities. In his Crimean
                adventures, he adopts the seemingly most unglamorous
                role for a chef, presiding over poorly-appointed
                military kitchens, performing an institutional function
                far from the ideals of genius and artistry invoked by
                ambitious chefs from Car&ecirc;me onward, to boost
                their prestige and authority. It is a paradoxical,
                almost Christ-like ploy, embracing the most humble of
                incarnations, in order to propel himself to the
                loftiest of heights. He takes the obscure realm of the
                chef or logistician&mdash;behind the scenes, behind the
                lines, or "back of the house," in contemporary
                restaurant lingo&mdash;and thrusts it into the
                limelight. He thus emerges in a novel role, as an actor
                not just in the Crimean theater of operations, but on
                the greater stage of world events, a bold
                Napoleonic-Byronic man of destiny, making his mark on
                history. In this, as in so many other ways, Soyer was a
                hard act to follow, but whether or not another chef
                would assume such a grandiose role anytime soon is
                beside the point. What matters is the underlying shift
                here in the vision of the chef as a public figure.
                Soyer's example established that chefs did not have to
                pretend to be great writers in order to be seen as
                noteworthy personages. And this is precisely the change
                in perspective underpinning the later emergence of
                chefs as broadcast stars.<br />

              <li>
                <p>Alexis Soyer was an odd, anomalous figure,
                reminiscent of Grimod de la Reyni&egrave;re in seeming
                at once quaintly behind and radically ahead of his
                time. While Soyer's ostentatious personal style struck
                his contemporaries as outmoded, his ideas and
                initiatives anticipated much of our own culinary and
                gastronomic modernity. His unconventional dress in the
                kitchen prefigured the vogue today for "non-traditional
                'fun' chef's attire" (George 9). Even allowing for the
                ambiguities and contradictions in Soyer's relation to
                the masses, he had a degree of social conscience not
                seen again in a prominent chef before Alice Waters
                (who, in a book jacket endorsement for Ann Arnold's
                <i>The Adventurous Chef: Alexis Soyer</i>, praises
                "this chef who cooked with great talent and
                compassion"). Soyer was interested in regional and
                foreign cuisines and even, in his <i>Symposium of All
                Nations</i>, as well as in the book he did not live to
                write&mdash;to be called <i>The Culinary Wonders of All
                Nations&mdash;</i>anticipated what has come to be
                known, for better or worse, as "world cuisine."
                Likewise, long before Julia Child or Emeril Lagasse, he
                was an unapologetic popularizer, an enterprising
                promoter of his own image and marketer of associated
                products, as well as an extraordinary performer and
                impresario. Indeed, his <i>Symposium</i>, with its
                diverse attractions, strolling entertainers, fireworks,
                and other visual effects, was more than a restaurant,
                "it was also what would today be called a theme park"
                (Brandon 197). So too the contradictions of Soyer's
                existence as a famed French chef in Victorian
                England&mdash;caught between ridicule and veneration,
                Bonaparte and Byron, <i>Cailles en sarcophage</i> and
                Yorkshire pudding&mdash;already acted out something
                much like the "cosmic ambivalence about French culture"
                which Toby Miller identifies as characteristic of&nbsp;
                "Anglo-speaking countries," and central to the rise
                there of food television (223).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>How then to gauge Soyer's legacy?&nbsp;Questions of
                cultural transmission and transformation become all the
                more thorny when dealing with such a forward-thinking
                figure. Much of his originality was misunderstood in
                his day&mdash;misconstrued as just vanity, dismissed as
                simple eccentricity&mdash;and largely forgotten
                afterward. By the 1880s, his books were out of print,
                and long remained unavailable. In the early years of
                the twentieth century, "the grandson of 'the great
                Soyer'" (9) did revive his ancestor's memory a bit. In
                a career reminiscent of his grandfather's,
                French-born-and-trained Nicolas Soyer rose to
                prominence as chef of an exclusive London club
                (Brooks's), and achieved considerable though
                short-lived renown for his popularizing efforts and
                technical innovations&mdash;in particular, for what he
                called "Soyer's Paper-Bag Cookery" <b>[<a class="colorbox" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/gastronomy/garval/images/fig35.jpg">fig.
                35</a>]</b>.<a href=
                "#10"><sup>10</sup></a>
                Despite the "great furor" (5) this caused at the time,
                the "era of Paper-Bag Cookery" (99) turned out to be
                brief.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>There is, however, a suggestive if indirect
                connection to be made between Alexis Soyer and the
                stars of today's televised food shows. Like Soyer,
                Xavier Marcel Boulestin (1878-1943) was, for his
                generation, the best-loved French culinarian in
                England. His life also began and ended in ways that
                recall Soyer. He was born and raised in France
                (actually a native of the P&eacute;rigord, thus a
                Gascon like Thackeray's Mirobolant); toward the end of
                his life, at the start of the Second World War, and in
                the spirit of Soyer's "culinary campaign," he
                petitioned the British government (unsuccessfully) to
                let him use his expertise to help the war effort, by
                reforming the country's rationing system.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>As a young man, Boulestin came to Paris to pursue
                his literary ambitions, and was engaged as secretary
                and collaborator by Willy, husband of the novelist and
                performer Colette. He also performed opposite Colette,
                and with some success, in a couple of
                plays,&nbsp;including one by Willy "in which Colette
                appeared as a gigolo and Boulestin as an English barman
                speaking poor French" (Hooker 7). Wary though of
                Willy's character and motivations, he left
                Paris&mdash;like Soyer before him&mdash;to seek a new
                life in London. There, he frequented leading artists
                and writers of the day, and was even invited to Soyer's
                old haunt, the Reform Club. He tried his hand at many
                things, including interior decorating in the modern
                style, translating plays, editing and publishing luxury
                editions, and writing theatrical reviews and other
                commentary for the French and British press. In late
                1922 or early 1923, seemingly in spite of himself,
                Boulestin stumbled upon cookbook writing. His account
                of this turning point recalls Soyer denying his own
                interest in writing cookbooks, in the preface to <i>The
                Gastronomic Regenerator</i>. Boulestin had met with an
                acquaintance in publishing, about another matter:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Just before leaving and hardly realizing what I was
                  saying, I said:<br />
                  <br />
                  'By the way, you would not be interested in a cookery
                  book, would you?'<br />
                  <br />
                  'It's exactly what we want', answered Byard. The
                  contract was signed there and then. Not a line was
                  written, and I was given &pound;10 in advance of the
                  royalties. (Hooker 20)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Thus began a series of successful cookbooks and,
                with it, Boulestin's unexpected new career as an expert
                in French cuisine. He opened his first restaurant, the
                Restaurant Fran&ccedil;ais, in 1925, at Leicester
                Square; the even more successful Restaurant Boulestin
                opened in 1927, in Covent Garden, with walls and
                ceilings painted by Jean-&Eacute;mile Laboureur and
                Marie Laurencin, curtains designed by Raoul Dufy, and a
                cosmopolitan clientele of London's high society and
                distinguished foreign visitors. Boulestin came to be
                known however for his simple, unpretentious, but
                delicious food, and soon began disseminating his
                culinary ideas in various ways. He opened "X.M.
                Boulestin's School of Simple French Cookery" (Hooker
                26), realizing Soyer's unfulfilled dream of founding a
                "College of Domestic Economy" (Volant and Warren 192);
                he wrote articles for the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, the
                <i>Evening Standard</i>, <i>Country Life</i>, and
                <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>; he made sound recordings of
                cookery lessons for H.M.V.; he was featured in British
                Movietone News, showing how to prepare the famed
                <i>Omelette Boulestin</i>; and, on January 21, 1937, in
                a BBC studio in London, he hosted the first installment
                of a television series called "Cook's Night Out."
                Sharing Soyer's penchant for popularization, Boulestin
                took his message to the new media of his day, and
                reached an ever-larger public. He was Soyer's spiritual
                heir in many ways and, not surprisingly, he was the
                world's first television chef.</p>

            Steward to the Prince de Cond&eacute;, Vatel stabbed
            himself fatally with his own sword, during a feast in honor
            of King Louis XIV, when an important seafood delivery was
            delayed. The provisions arrived soon after. (cf. Dominique
            Michel,&nbsp; <i>Vatel ou la naissance de la

            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="4" id="4"></a>4</sup> This
            is similar to Jean-L&eacute;on G&eacute;r&ocirc;me's
            <i>Phryn&eacute; devant le tribunal</i> of 1861, in which
            the courtesan's gesturing to cover her face, while
            ostensibly out of modesty, all the more surely calls
            attention to her resplendent nudity, and to her identity as
            an incomparable beauty: she was supposedly the model for
            Praxiteles's <i>Venus of Knidos</i>, the archetypal nude in
            Western art.</p>
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="5" id="5"></a>5</sup> This
            is similar in conception to Marcelin's caricature "Romans

            Eug&egrave;ne Sue, Honor&eacute; de Balzac, Victor Hugo,
            and Alexandre Dumas <i>p&egrave;re</i>, through heraldic
            shields displaying "not the author's coat of arms, but
            instead a witty emblem of the work in question" (cf. Garval
            2004a, 16-17).</p>

            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="7" id="7"></a>7</sup> Soyer
            explains that this "letter to the public press" never made

            Nicolas Soyer was the son of&nbsp; Alexis Soyer junior,

            liaison before the former's departure for London. Alexis
            Soyer senior apparently did not learn of his son's
            existence until 1851, and recognized him officially as his
            child in 1853 (Volant and Warren 239-242).</p>
