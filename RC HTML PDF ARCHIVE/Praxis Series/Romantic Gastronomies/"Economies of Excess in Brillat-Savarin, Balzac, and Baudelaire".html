              <li>
                <p>The pages which follow offer a preliminary inquiry
                into the relationship between Charles Baudelaire's
                writing on drugs and Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin's
                writing on food. As we will see, Baudelaire's attitude
                towards Brillat-Savarin was dismissive to the point of
                open contempt. At the same time, Baudelaire's most
                sustained philosophical study, <em>Les Paradis
                artificiels</em>&mdash;described by Michel Butor as
                Baudelaire's "fundamental work on the nature of
                poetry"(15)&mdash;begins with a chapter on "The Taste
                of the Infinite" ("Le Go&ucirc;t de l'infini"), thus
                situating itself from the outset, however ironically or
                unintentionally, within the rhetorical field of the
                <em><em>Physiology of Taste</em></em>'s "Meditations on
                Transcendental Gastronomy." Without concerning
                ourselves with questions of influence, which in this
                instance are trifling at best, is there some deeper
                pattern of historical development we can discern in
                this unlikely conjunction? My argument will experiment
                with the idea that in both Brillat-Savarin's
                <em>Physiology of Taste</em>'s and Baudelaire's
                writings on drugs, here represented by his pivotal
                essay "On Wine and Haschisch Compared as Means for the
                Multiplication of Individuality ("Du Vin et du hachisch
                compar&eacute;s comme moyens de multiplier
                l'individualit&eacute;"), the consumption of substance,
                rather than subserving the economy of the healthy body,
                becomes human only insofar as it vehiculates an
                <em>excess</em> of desire. I would also tentatively
                suggest, following Denise Gigante's lead, though my
                story angles off in a somewhat different direction,
                that this progressive transformation of the consuming
                subject into a figure of human perversity, partially
                occulted in Brillat-Savarin<sup><a href=
                "#note1">1</a></sup>,
                spectacularly displayed in Baudelaire, may be
                correlated with stages in the emergence of consumer
                capitalism. Coming between the two, Honor&eacute; de
                Balzac offers indications as to how this process
                happens.</p>
    
                <h4>Savor and Savoir</h4>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Though initially published at the author's expense
                in 1825, the <em>Physiology of
                Taste</em>'s<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup>
                quickly gained wide recognition not only as an
                authoritative disquisition on the pleasures of the
                table but also as a significant contribution to the
                world of letters. Thus we find Balzac writing the entry
                on Brillat-Savarin for Michaud's <em>Biographie
                Universelle</em> in 1835 and attributing the
                <em>Physiology</em>'s rapid success&mdash;of which he
                was a keen and interested observer&mdash;to the "savor"
                of a prose style which he goes so far as to compare
                with those of de la Rochefoucauld and La
                Bruy&egrave;re. As evidenced by the number of editions
                which appeared throughout the 1840s, Brillat-Savarin's
                standing as a writer continued for some time to grow
                apace, strengthened now in part by the association with
                Balzac, just as Balzac had earlier traded on the
                success of the <em>Physiology of Taste</em>'s in
                publishing <em>The Physiology</em>.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Not surprisingly, Baudelaire did not share in the
                general admiration, his allegiance to the older Balzac
                notwithstanding, though he seems to have drawn some
                inspiration from Brillat-Savarin by taking him as a
                target of abuse. Thus his brief 1851 essay "On Wine and
                Hashish Compared as Means for the Multiplication of
                Individuality," begins with an insulting reference to
                Brillat-Savarin, "[a] very famous man, who was at the
                same time a great dolt" (377), followed by a
                misquotation from the <em>Physiology of
                Taste's</em>&mdash;"Noah the patriarch is said to be
                the inventor of wine; it is a liquor made from the
                fruit of the vine"<sup><a href=
                "#note3">3</a></sup>&mdash;whose
                banality and insufficiency he proceeds to devote
                several paragraphs to mocking:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then? Then,
                  nothing: that's it. Leaf through the volume, turn it
                  every which way, read it backwards, upside-down, from
                  right to left and left to right, you'll find nothing
                  else on wine in the <em>Physiology of Taste</em> of
                  our most illustrious and most respected
                  Brillat-Savarin: "Noah the patriarch" and "it is a
                  liquor. . . "
                </blockquote>
    
                <blockquote>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[. . . ] How altogether
                  digestive. How very explanatory [. . . ] (377-78)
                </blockquote>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>To better understand why Brillat-Savarin receives
                such rough treatment at Baudelaire's hands, we will
                first need to examine more closely the focus of his
                attack. Like the misquotation, Baudelaire's claim that
                the <em>Physiology of Taste</em> has nothing else to
                say about wine is something less than accurate, but
                neither is it entirely wide of the mark. Other
                references to wine do occur here and there throughout
                the book, usually in the course of an anecdote, but
                there is far less on the subject than Brillat-Savarin's
                reputation as the classic French authority on the
                pleasures of the table would lead one to expect,
                especially when compared with the pages devoted to such
                items as coffee, chocolate, truffles and turkey (a
                legacy of Brillat-Savarin's years of exile in
                America).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>On a casual reading, the comparative omission may
                seem yet another reminder, if one is needed, of just
                how idiosyncratic and unsystematic a book the
                <em>Physiology of Taste</em><sup><a href=
                "#note4">4</a></sup>
                can be. Thus while the meditation "On Thirst" is
                followed, logically enough, by a meditation "On
                Drinks," the connection between "On Drinks" and the
                succeeding meditation "On the End of the World" is more
                elusive. Similarly, one understands why the long
                central meditation "On Foods" is divided into two
                parts, the first on foods in general, the second on
                special kinds of foods. But why it should be capped
                with a meditation on "The Theory of Frying" is more of
                a puzzle.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Examined more closely, however, the limited
                attention Brillat-Savarin pays to wine is an indication
                of the contradictory role played by excess in the
                economy of his discourse. On the one hand, the mere
                pleasure of eating, "the actual and direct sensation of
                a need being satisfied," which is common to humans and
                animals alike, must be distinguished from the
                specifically human "pleasures of the table," "the
                reflective sensation which arises from the various
                circumstances of occasion, place, things and persons
                accompanying a meal," and which emerges distinctly only
                once hunger and appetite are satisfied &mdash;thus, in
                Brillat-Savarin's analysis, typically with the second
                course (162-163).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>On the other hand, "gourmandise" defined by
                Brillat-Savarin as a "passionate, reasoned and habitual
                preference for whatever is agreeable to the taste"
                (130), must be distinguished from sheer gluttony and
                voracity, with which, however, it is regularly
                confused, beginning with the fact that the same word is
                used for both.<sup><a href=
                "#note5">5</a></sup>
                Here it is Brillat-Savarin who has consulted his
                references in vain:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  I looked through all the dictionaries under the word
                  <em>Gourmandise</em>, and I was not at all satisfied
                  with what I found. There is a perpetual confusion of
                  <em>gourmandise</em> properly speaking with
                  <em>gluttony</em> and <em>voracity</em>: from which I
                  conclude that the lexicographers, however worthy
                  otherwise, are not among those amiable
                  <em>savants</em> who nibble with grace a wing of
                  partridge <em>au supr&ecirc;me</em> and then wash it
                  down, pinky raised, with a glass of Laffitte or clos
                  Vougeout.

                <p>As we shall see, however, in the very act of
                distinguishing the gourmand from the glutton, the
                depiction <em>en vignette</em> of the gourmand also
                combines savant, savorer, and Savarin in one
                overdetermined figure, in a process of rhetorical
                condensation of which the glass of wine is ultimate
                repository. Unlike the gross excess of the selfish
                glutton who eats <em>everything</em>, the "fine excess"
                (Keats) of the "social" gourmand is characterized by
                discrimination, discrimination in what he eats and in
                the way that he eats. Indeed, the very analysis of the
                act of dining into four distinct
                moments&mdash;disposition, execution, savoring, and
                judgment&mdash;is such an exercise in discrimination.
                These discriminations are energetic&mdash;"il savoure
                avec energie"&mdash;because they are the expression of
                a force of desire that, like labor power in Marx's
                theory of surplus-value, is in excess of the
                requirements of self-preservation, which is also why
                they are essentially social in character&mdash;and at
                risk of being confounded with gluttony. The
                proliferation of discriminations represents a
                channeling of the surplus of desire which in the
                glutton manifests as excessive appetitive into the work
                of reinforcing and elaborating a symbolic code.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>These discriminations are also self-reflexive,
                "r&eacute;flechie," a feature which is the mark and
                mechanism of their refinement, but which also points to
                the fact that the gourmand's energy of discrimination
                is directed back on and embodied in the activity of
                consumption rather than being placed in the service of
                another aim. In partaking of his meal, the gourmand
                savors his own knowing exercise of taste, his
                <em>savoir</em> and <em>savoir-faire</em>. His powers
                of gustatory discrimination differ from the common not
                only in degree, differentiating a subtler spectrum of
                qualities than others are capable of detecting, but in
                kind, since every perception of difference is
                compounded with a perception of his own heightened
                sensibility&mdash;heightened <em>because</em> thus
                compounded and made available to itself for enjoyment.
                The activity of the gourmand transforms food into an
                object of refined knowledge, and the process of its
                consumption into the cultivation, exercise, and display
                of that <em>savoir</em>, but by the same token that
                <em>savoir</em> becomes bound up in the object of
                gustatory enjoyment, an inextricable part of the
                <em>savor</em> of food. That the gourmand, <em>amiable
                savant</em>, is pictured as nibbling on a partridge
                wing (itself related to the arm which raises it to the
                diner's mouth) <em>au supr&ecirc;me</em> (mark of
                invested expertise), thus with the expertly prepared
                food neither completely inside or outside the mouth
                even as it is consumed, a circumstance that works to
                prolong the process of eating and its attendant
                pleasure, emphasizes this ambiguity.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Just as its practice is reflexive, the
                <em>discourse</em> of gourmandise is characteristically
                the self-savoring discourse of the initiate, an
                expansion into the arena of linguistic
                performance&mdash;the realm of knowledge
                proper&mdash;of the specifically reflective pleasure
                that distinguishes the gourmand's experience of eating.
                To distinguish semantically between "gourmandise" in
                its proper application ("la gourmandise proprement
                dite") and the common understanding of "gourmandise" as
                gluttony one must partake in the gourmand's powers of
                discrimination&mdash;unlike the lexicographers, but
                quintessentially like Savarin, whose prose, in
                portraying the gourmand's enjoyment of his expertise,
                takes pleasure it itself. <em>Savarin sait savourer et
                savoure son savoir</em>. The circularity of this
                relationship can be read as both a sublimation of the
                pleasure of eating and a regressive transformation of
                the written word into a repository and source of oral
                pleasure. The elegantly managed glass of Lafitte or
                clos Vougeot with which the gourmand washes down his
                morsel of partridge <em>au supr&ecirc;me</em>,
                represents both the distillation of savor that defines
                him and the inherited threat of imbalance that
                accompanies it.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The association of wine, not simply with excessive
                consumption, but with an exorbitant circuit of desire
                that attaches to the very logic of gourmandise can also
                be read in the distinction Brillat-Savarin draws
                between "latent or habitual thirst," which serves to
                replenish the loss of bodily fluids and thus
                participates in the natural economy of the healthy body
                and "factitious thirst," which, like the pleasures of
                the table, adds a uniquely human dimension to the
                cyclical processes of consumption:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Factitious thirst, which is specific to the human
                  race, comes from that innate instinct which leads us
                  to seek in drinks a force not put there by nature,
                  and which comes about only through fermentation. It
                  constitutes an artificial pleasure more than a
                  natural need: this thirst is inextinguishable,
                  because the drinks one takes to appease it have the
                  unfailing effect of causing it to arise anew; this
                  thirst, which ends up becoming habitual, makes for
                  the drunkards of all countries; and it almost always
                  happens that the impotation ceases only when the
                  liquor is lacking, or when it has vanquished the
                  drinker and put him out of action. (118)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>The difference in kind, especially as it correlates
                with the subdivision of the section on drinks into
                "drinks" and "strong drinks," stands in marked contrast
                to the difference of degree between "appetite" and
                "large appetites," which latter tend to be associated
                not with unregulated excess but with the prowess of the
                "well-constituted" man (51). Neither entirely
                artificial, since "factitious thirst" comes from an
                "innate instinct," nor simply natural, since "strong
                drink" contains a power that is not "put there" by
                nature but the product of human effort, the addictive
                cycle which binds them together is the demonic double
                of the healthy reflexivity that joins the "passionate,
                reasoned, habitual preferences" to the objects which
                gratify and sustain his discerning tastes.
                Brillat-Savarin's analysis of "factitious thirst"
                registers, while localizing as a danger confined to
                drinking, the possibility that the cultivation of
                gustatory refinement, rather than constituting a
                distinctly human enrichment of the balanced cycles of
                organic life, might operate a parasitic expropriation
                of those processes by a kind of mechanical desire whose
                workings tend to exhaust and ultimately vanquish the
                subject.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Finally, that the topic of wine or, more generally,
                strong drink functions for Brillat-Savarin as something
                of a negative space within the discursive economy of
                the <em>Physiology</em> is also suggested by the
                following curious footnote appended to the title of the
                "Ninth Meditation: On Drinks":</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  This chapter is purely philosophical: the detailed
                  enumeration of the different kinds of drinks cannot
                  enter into the plan I have formed myself: there would
                  be no finishing. (124)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>The note is curious since no similar concern had
                impeded Brillat-Savarin from devoting the entirety of
                the sixth meditation to a long and detailed, though of
                course highly selective, discussion of special foods
                [63-111]). It is thus yet another indicator of the way
                in which the <em>Physiology</em>'s pursuit of
                distinction is shadowed by a threat of excess. It also
                offers further evidence of how the "containing" of that
                threat is integral to Brillat-Savarin's establishment
                of the "theoretical bases of gastronomy."</p>
    
                <h2>Epicuri de Grege</h2>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>An early and enthusiastic admirer of
                Brillat-Savarin, Balzac clearly understood his wish to
                divorce the theory and practice of the higher
                gourmandise from any association with waste and excess,
                though he also seems to have found it difficult to
                honor that wish straightforwardly. Thus, writing the
                entry for the <em>Biographie Universelle</em> mentioned
                earlier, he assures his reader in a tone of devoted and
                protective eulogy, "It would be far from the truth to
                imagine that Brillat-Savarin's gastronomic sincerity
                degenerated into intemperance. He formally declares, on
                the contrary, that those who get indigestion or become
                inebriated <em>do not know how to eat</em>
                (<em>aphor</em>. 10). He everywhere distinguishes
                between the pleasures of the table and the pleasure of
                eating." But the classical reference with which Balzac
                then continues, "In a word, he may take as his motto
                Horace's <em>Epicuri de grege</em>, but let none add to
                it the sad spondee which ends the hemistich," is more
                unsettling, since it mainly seems devoted to playing,
                through negation and elaborate periphrasis, with the
                possibility of referring to its subject as "an
                Epicurean pig."<sup><a href=

              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>A related oscillation between homage and satire
                figures prominently in Balzac's supplement to the
                <em>Physiology</em>, his "Treatise on Modern
                Stimulants" ("<em>Trait&eacute; des excitants
                modernes</em>").<sup><a href=
                "#note8">8</a></sup>
                Solicited in 1838 by Charpentier, who had published
                that year a new edition of both the <em>Physiology of
                Marriage</em> and the <em>Physiology of Taste</em>,
                Balzac's treatise first appeared as an appendix to
                Charpentier's reprinting of the latter a year later, in
                1839.<sup><a href=
                "#note9">9</a></sup>
                In the "Treatise," Balzac pays tribute to
                Brillat-Savarin as "one of the first to have remarked
                on the influence of what goes into the mouth on human
                destinies" (326), and thus as having opened up the
                field of knowledge to which Balzac's appendix makes its
                supplementary contribution.<sup><a href=
                "#note10">10</a></sup>
                That there is already an element of tongue-in-cheek in
                this way of characterizing Brillat-Savarin's enterprise
                would not necessarily undercut the indebtedness, since
                what Balzac claimed to admire <em>most of all</em>
                about Brillat-Savarin's writing was its combination of
                a goodheartedness with a comic undercurrent, "le
                comique sous la bonhomie" (<em>Biographie
                Universelle</em> 537). Indeed, the treatise as a whole
                may be seen as an exercise in writing in the mode of
                Brillat-Savarin, but in a more exaggerated fashion.
                Thus we find the same heterogeneous mix of
                philosophical disquisition; "scientific" reportage on
                the nature and effects of different kinds of
                "alimentation"; extended "illustrative" anecdotes,
                whether personal or on the order of "lore," (such as
                the story of the English convict who, in the interest
                of science, was given the choice of being hanged or
                subsisting on a diet of nothing but tea, and who, in
                consequence of the latter, grew so thin and diaphanous
                at the time of his death that "a philanthropist was
                able to read the <em>Times</em>, a light having been
                placed behind the body" [310]); and expert guidance on
                proper techniques for the preparation and consumption
                of particular foodstuffs. Throughout Balzac's treatment
                is sufficiently broad that his editor Charpentier feels
                obliged to alert the reader in a prefatory note to the
                fact that the treatise is a "satire"
                (393)&mdash;whether of contemporary manners or of
                Brillat-Savarin is never entirely clear.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The comparative exorbitance of Balzac's writing, in
                which ghastly burlesque supplants the diverting
                anecdote and the sage maxims of the gastronome take a
                lurid turn ("Inebriation is a temporary poisoning"
                [314]; "To smoke cigars is to smoke fire" [322]) is
                obviously of a piece with Balzac's thematic focus on
                exorbitant forms of consumption, that is, forms of
                consumption that do not subserve the economy of the
                healthy body.<sup><a href=
                "#note11">11</a></sup>
                Thus Balzac emphasizes from the start that "The excess
                of tobacco, the excess of coffee, the excess of opium
                and of spirits," the three principle subjects of the
                treatise, "produce grave disorders and lead to a
                precocious death" (308). Though the valuation remains
                the same&mdash;excess is bad for you&mdash;the shift in
                attention effectively displaces Brillat-Savarin's
                axiomatic emphasis on the connection between taste and
                good health: "Taste, which is stimulated by appetite,
                hunger, and thirst, is at the base of several
                operations whose result is that the individual grows,
                develops, sustains itself and repairs the losses caused
                by vital evaporations."<sup><a href=
                "#note12">12</a></sup></p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>A revisionary, critical tendency emerges as the
                treatise develops and further narrows its focus. Balzac
                announces in the beginning of the "Treatise" that he
                will deal with five substances: l'eau-de-vie (which he
                appears to equate with spirits in general), sugar, tea,
                coffee, and tobacco. However, sugar, which
                Brillat-Savarin treats at length, comes in for only
                scattered remarks, and the discussion of tea is limited
                to the story of the diaphanous convict and a more
                analytic paragraph at the end of the section on coffee.
                By contrast, several pages are devoted to coffee on
                which matter "Brillat-Savarin is far from complete"
                (404). And with regard to tobacco, Balzac finds
                Brillat-Savarin even more remiss:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  It is astonishing that Brillat-Savarin, in taking as
                  the title of his work the <em>Physiology of
                  Taste</em>, and after having demonstrated so well the
                  role in its pleasures of the nasal and palatial [sic]
                  cavities, should have forgotten the chapter on
                  tobacco.(411)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>Both remarks obviously anticipate the form of
                Baudelaire's complaint.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>As has already been suggested, the shift in focus
                does not simply supplement Brillat-Savarin's normal
                gastronomy with an abnormal gastronomy, adding to the
                <em>Physiology of Taste</em> a chapter on pathologies
                of taste. Rather, it signals a reorientation of the
                discourse as a whole. The scope and basis of this
                reorientation are especially apparent from Balzac's
                introductory "theoretical" sections, which mimic in
                abbreviated form the "grave elubrications"
                (Brillat-Savarin's phrase), which make up the first
                forty pages of the <em>Physiology</em>. From the start,
                Balzac makes it clear that <em>his</em> physiology is
                concerned at least as much with the production of waste
                as with the consumption of food:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our organs are the
                  ministers of our pleasures. Almost all serve a double
                  function: they apprehend substances, incorporate
                  them, and then return them, in whole or in part,
                  under one form or another, to the common reserve, the
                  earth. These few words are the entire chemistry of
                  human life. The experts will have no trouble
                  digesting this formula. (307)<sup><a href=
                  "#note13">13</a></sup>
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>The <em>bouffonnerie</em> of these remarks
                notwithstanding, they prepare a line of argument that
                is more explicitly initiated with the dictum that, "For
                social man, to live is to expend oneself more or less
                quickly" (ibid.) and which is then developed throughout
                the treatise. Whereas for Brillat-Savarin, leisure and
                wealth allow for the further accumulation of
                gastronomic pleasure (45), for Balzac the more man is
                freed from serving his basic needs, the more he is
                <em>driven</em> to expend his surplus energies in the
                pursuit of excess. "The less human force is occupied,
                the more it tends to excess, borne there irresistibly
                by thought" (ibid). One can question whether Balzac's
                theory of surplus psychic energy represents an
                improvement on Brillat-Savarin's psychological (and
                economic) ideas. What matters for our purposes is the
                way in which it explicitly reconceptualizes a theory of
                managed consumption as one of managed excess.</p>
    
                <h2>The Wine Talking</h2>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>While Baudelaire makes no direct reference to
                Balzac's treatise, there is good reason for thinking
                that it served as one source of inspiration for the
                essay on wine and hashisch (and consequently, <em>Les
                Paradis artificiels</em>). First of all, the mocking
                attack on Brillat-Savarin as a celebrated fool which
                launches the essay is answered at the conclusion of the
                same section by a sympathetic evocation of the
                late-earned success of "our dear and great Balzac," who
                had died a few months before the essay's publication
                (379).<sup><a href=
                "#note14">14</a></sup>
                The juxtaposition of the two figures makes particular
                sense if we suppose that Baudelaire had the treatise in
                hand as he was writing, a circumstance all the more
                possible since they were regularly published
                together.<sup><a href=
                "#note15">15</a></sup>
                Secondly, the association of Balzac with "modern
                stimulants" would have been reinforced by his presence
                at a hashish soir&eacute;e in Baudelaire's lodgings in
                1845, an occasion recalled by Baudelaire 15 years later
                in <em>Les Paradis artificiels</em>
                (438-439).<sup><a href=
                "#note16">16</a></sup>
                Thirdly, and most significantly, the claim by both "On
                Wine and Hashish" and <em>Les Paradis artificiels</em>
                that drugs throw out of balance the "equation between
                organs and pleasures" ("Il n'y a plus &eacute;quation
                entre les organes et les jouissances" [393, 420]) is
                closely related to Balzac's thesis in the treatise that
                "All excess is based on a pleasure that man wishes to
                repeat beyond the ordinary laws promulgated by nature"
                (307), a thesis which is explicitly identified by
                Baudelaire in the essay as the theme of Balzac's <em>La
                Peau de chagrin</em> (393).</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Whether or not Balzac's treatise exercised any
                direct influence on Baudelaire's essay, it offers a
                valuable intermediate case for thinking about the
                relationship between Brillat-Savarin's writing on food
                and Baudelaire's writing on drugs, since it shows us
                the former in the process of becoming the latter. Some
                perspective on the larger historical context of this
                process may be gleaned again from Balzac's entry in the
                <em>Biographie Universelle</em>, where he mourns
                Brillat-Savarin as the representative, not exactly of
                the ancien r&eacute;gime, but of a class that preserved
                its memory:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Their pleasures were stamped with that <em>je ne sais
                  quoi</em> of that earlier time which conserved the
                  distinction of manners and ideas, even as our youth

                  are passing away, and our current ways will not bring
                  them back. It is thus a sad advantage to have known
                  these old men seated astride two centuries, who have
                  taught us all that our own has lost in amiabilities.

                <p>The nostalgia of this reflection has the same
                structure as Balzac's satiric gestures of tribute: it
                amplifies while repeating a sense of dislocation that
                already defines the historical situation of
                Brillat-Savarin, who seeks to adapt courtly distinction
                of manners&mdash;manners that are memories of
                themselves, even as he acquires them&mdash;to the
                context of a post-revolutionary bourgeois economy. This
                is the same historical moment that Denise Gigante
                describes in <em>Gusto</em> with a more forward-looking

                  ancient r&eacute;gime. Yet, the very publication of
                  these taste rules performed a democratizing function,
                  giving the nouveaux riches access to a previously

                <p>Yet. . . as Balzac writes in 1835, 1848 is already
                looming: "la jeunesse oublie tout." Brillat-Savarin
                preserves the memory of the ancient regime sufficiently
                to enact some version of its manners. Born at the
                beginning of the new century, Balzac only preserves the
                memory of Brillat-Savarin. Born a generation later
                (though the child of a father who was in fact
                Brillat-Savarin's exact contemporary), Baudelaire's
                stake in 1851 is in confronting the bourgeois
                pretensions to which Balzac retains an ambivalent
                attachment with claims of equality and difference so
                radical they simply put out of operation codes of
                intersubjective differentiation. Thus Baudelaire's
                "defense" of wine in "On Wine and Hashish" begins by
                addressing itself to the false feelings of superiority
                of which Brillat-Savarin has been made the
                spokesman:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Wine resembles man. We will never know how far it is
                  to be prized or scorned, loved or hated, of how many
                  sublime actions or monstrous crimes it is capable.
                  Let us not then be more cruel towards it than we are
                  towards ourselves, and let us treat it as an equal.
                  (380)
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>The equating of man and wine, here based on their
                shared and limitless capacity for both good and evil,
                is a central theme of the essay. The idea is presented
                later in similar terms, ". . . I have said that wine is
                assimilable to man, and have agreed that their crimes
                are equal to their virtues" (382), and it underlies
                Baudelaire's subsequent assertion that when a "true
                doctor-philosopher" appears he will (in implicit
                contrast to Brillat-Savarin and his "false masterpiece"
                [378]) "undertake a powerful study of wine, a kind of
                double psychology in which wine and man will constitute
                the two terms." Developing the idea yet further,
                Baudelaire allows that "he would not be surprised
                should some reasonable minds, seduced by a pantheistic
                idea, attribute to wine a kind of personality"
                (387).</p>

              <li>
                <p>"Attributing to wine a kind of personality" is in
                fact precisely what much of the first part of
                Baudelaire's essay does. Thus, the admonition to "treat
                wine as our equal" is followed immediately by a prose
                rendering of the early poem, "L'&Acirc;me du vin," an
                extended prosopopeia in which wine, from within its
                "prison of glass" addresses to man, in "that voice of
                spirits which is only heard by spirits"( "cette voix
                des esprits qui n'est entendue que des esprits"), a
                "song filled with brotherly love" (380). To understand
                what happens to the identification of wine with excess
                in Baudelaire's essay we will need to reflect further
                on this figuration, which, in recognizing wine as man's
                equal by conferring on it the power of speech,
                transgresses a rhetorical limit which shapes both
                Brillat-Savarin's <em>Physiology</em> and Balzac's
                "Treatise."</p>

              <li>
                <p>A consideration of the next section of Baudelaire's
                essay, this time a prose recasting of "The Ragpickers'
                Wine" ("Le Vin des chiffoniers"), can guide us in that
                reflection, for here again the personification of wine,
                and more specifically the figure of wine speaking or
                singing, plays a governing role, though this is not so
                immediately obvious. Rather than directly attributing
                the power of human speech to wine, the passage works by
                implicitly identifying the unfolding in time of the
                ragpicker's movement and song with the <em>flow</em> of
                inebriation. The ragpicker's song of triumphal progress
                ("'Forward! march! division, head, army!'[. . . ] Now
                he compliments his army. The battle is won, but the day
                was heated. He passes on horseback under triumphal
                arches." [381-2]) as he picks his drunken way at night
                through the debris of the city's day is not only the
                <em>effect</em> of wine, but the <em>analogue</em> of
                its transformative passage though the individual human
                body and the collective body of humanity. The
                underlying analogy approaches explicitness with the
                concluding sentences of the passage, where the latent
                figure of the voice of wine also surfaces:</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                  Wine, like a new Pactolus, rolls through languishing
                  humanity an intellectual gold. Like good kings, it
                  rules by serving and sings its exploits through the
                  throat of its subjects. (382)
                </blockquote>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>Wine <em>flows</em> like a transformative
                river,<sup><a href=
                "#note17">17</a></sup>
                but also and especially it <em>sings</em> like a king
                through a voice that is not its own. Since the
                appropriated voice of the king's subject is clearly
                that of the ragpicker, who in playing the part of the
                beneficent king "swears solemnly that he will make his
                people happy," the entire passage becomes a different
                kind of dramatization of "the wine talking."</p>

              <li>
                <p>Coming just after the attack on Brillat-Savarin,
                Baudelaire's initial call for the "equal treatment" of
                wine seeks to reverse the condition of neglect to which
                it is consigned in the <em>Physiology of Taste</em>, a
                condition it shares with the ragpicker-king of "Le Vin
                des chiffoniers," obviously, but also with Hoffman and
                Balzac, who in Baudelaire's accounting only in their
                latter days began to enjoy commercial success
                (379).<sup><a href=
                "#note18">18</a></sup>
                The underlying analogy is threefold: to consume wine or
                to abstain from its consumption is to welcome into or
                exclude from the body politic an outcast which is also
                to grant or deny representation within a symbolic
                order.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>The manner in which Baudelaire's writing brings wine
                into the field of "medical-philosophical" discourse
                from which Brillat-Savarin had excluded it, however,
                goes beyond any metaphor of organic or political
                integration, for it is precisely because the power of
                wine always has the potential to exceed itself, for
                good or evil, that it deserves to be treated as an
                equal: "We will never know how far it is to be prized
                or scorned, loved or hated, of how many submlime
                actions or monstrous crimes it is capable." The
                prosopoepia does not transfer an attribute, voice, from
                man to wine, based on some stable common measure or
                principle of equivalence (of the kind, for example,
                proposed by Brillat-Savarin's famous fourth aphorism:
                "Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you
                are" [1]). Casting the relationship between wine and
                man as intersubjective gives rise to an extended series
                of specular reversals and equivalences summed up in the
                figure of the king who "rules by serving." But this
                same substitution by means of prosopoeia of a
                symmetrical intersubjective relationship for one that
                is precisely not intersubjective is itself an
                exorbitant rhetorical imposition.</p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>An object-lesson in the production and management of
                quotidian surplus-value, the discourse of gastronomy,
                like its pleasures, is constituted by a tendency to
                excess which, at the same time, it seeks to regulate as
                an exercise in good taste. Baudelaire's "Essay," like
                Balzac's "Treatise," exposes that underlying tendency
                both through stylistic exaggeration and by taking the
                consumption of excess as an explicit theme. Unlike
                Balzac, however, whose satiric heightenings, however
                broad, remain within the limits of what Baudelaire's
                refers to in "The Essence of Laughter" as "signifying
                comedy," based on intersubjective relations of
                superiority and inferiority, Baudelaire's "absolute" or
                "hyperbolic" comedy, in transgressing those limits,
                holds up to the prosaic discourse of gastronomy a
                phantasmagoric, poeticizing, mirror in which the voice
                of the other talks back.</p>

            <em>gastronomic</em> perversion, as described by B.-S. (and
            on the whole it could hardly be described better), always
            implies a kind of affable and accommodating acknowledgement
            which never departs from the tone of <em>good

            drinks, whether we owe it to Noah, who planted the vine, or
            to Bacchus, who pressed the juice of the grape, dates from
            the infancy of the world" (126). The suppressed phrase,
            "qui planta la vigne" is biblical, "Et No&eacute; planta la
            vigne et connut l'ivresse," Baudelaire's "citation"
            accentuates the partriarchal note and flattens out

            Brillat-Savarin's reserve on the subject was in some ways
            characteristic of the gastronomic writing of the period. As
            Denise Gigante observes in <em>Gusto</em>, "Despite the
            emphasis on wine connoisseurship in gourmet circles today,
            wine and other psirituous liquors came second to food in
            nineteenth-century gastronomy. Intoxication was thought to
            dull the sensibility and lessen the capacity to exercise
            discernment. . . Modern gastronomy rises or falls by
            moderation, and all writers in this tradition insist on
            temperance as a key to good taste" (25). As will be seen,
            my argument, at least in part, is that the gastronome
            <em>indulges</em> in gustatory discernment, making of his
            show of temperance a screen.</p>

            "gourmand," in the first instance, as an adjective with a
            substantive employment signifying "Qui mange avec
            avidit&eacute; et exc&egrave;s</em>") ("[one] who eats
            avidly and in exces"). The gastronomic sense is secondary,
            "Il se dit queslquefois pour Gastronome." ("Sometimes used
            for Gastronome.") "Gourmandise" is defined exclusively as:
            "Vice de celui que est gourmand" ("the vice of one who is a

            <em>Physiology of Taste</em> from this point on will bring
            a certain literary legitimation to the emergence of a new
            gastronomic discourse, while extending to the novellistic
            the scientific covering of a physiology it needs to
            establish itself as a genre" (76).</p>
    
            <p class="indent"><sup><a name="note10" id=
            "note10"></a>10</sup> Thus, according to Gortassier
            (explaining why the treatise was published as an appendix
            rather than a preface), "in [Balzac's] mind, the 'Treatise
            on Modern Stimulants' is a complement to the <em>Physiology
            of Taste</em>, since Balzac addresses there material that
            Brillag-Savarin hadn't treated. The text thus quite
            logically ought to follow that the <em>Physiology of
            Taste</em>" (982). My argument, in part, is that the
            subject matter of the "Treatise" upsets the balance of
            Brillat-Savarin's project.</p>

            Thus Balzac devotes the most famous passages of the essay
            to instructions for the preparation of coffee, which he
            drank on a nightly basis in staggering quantities as an
            essential part of his writing regimen. This fact alone
            summarizes the exorbitant economy in Balzac which links
            together writing and excessive consumption.</p>

            separately from the <em>Physiology</em> in 1855. While
            other editions of the <em>Physiology</em> did exist,
            Charpentier's had been reprinted frequently, most recently
            in 1847.</p>
