<p align="left"><b>Morris Eaves</b> <em>is co-editor of the</em> William Blake Archive <em>with Robert Essick and Joseph Viscomi and</em> Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly <em>with Morton D. Paley. He is author of</em> William Blake's Theory of Art <em>and</em> The Counter-Arts Conspiracy: Art and Industry in the Age of Blake<em>.</em> The Cambridge Companion to Blake<em>, with new essays by fourteen contributors, will be published later this year. His research has been principally concerned with literature and the visual arts in connection with the histories of technology and commerce. In that vein, his current projects focus on the implications of editorial theories and practices. "Posterity," a book in progress, is about the editorial powers of the audience. He is Professor of English at the University of Rochester.</em></p>
<p align="left"><b>Robert N. Essick</b> <em>has been collecting and writing about Blake for over 30 years. Current projects include continued work on the online Blake Archive, an essay (with Joe Viscomi) on Blake's color printing methods, a facsimile edition of the Huntington Library copy of</em> Visions of the Daughters of Albion<em>, a Blake exhibition at the Huntington Art Gallery to open in January 2003, an essay (with Rosamund Paice) on some newly-discovered Blake pencil sketches, and the annual review of Blake sales for</em> Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly<em>. He is a Professor of English at the University of California, Riverside.</em></p>

He is also the author of</em> Blake and the Idea of the Book <em>and</em> Prints by Blake and His Followers<em>, a catalogue to an exhibition he organized at the Herbert Johnson Museum, Cornell University, and the co-editor of volumes 3 (with Eaves and Essick) and 5 (with Essick) of the Blake Trust's</em> The Illuminated Books<em>. He is currently working on a web site for his 1983 theatre adaptation of Blake's</em> An Island in the Moon<em>, which will include video of the performance, music, text, and photographs; and on an essay on nineteenth-century Blake reproductions and forgeries. He is the James G. Kenan Professor of English Literature at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</em></p>

<strong>Kari Kraus</strong><em>, a doctoral student in English at the University of Rochester, is interested in the changes that texts, paintings, other artifacts, and their reproductions undergo in the transmission through time and space. Extensions of that interest are the various techniques&mdash;ranging from capricious guesswork to textual stemmatics to state-of-the-art image processing advances&mdash;that have evolved over thousands of years to deal with information loss and gain. Conjectural criticism, the subject of her dissertation, is the attempt to reconstruct what an object once was or predict what it might be in the future. The dissertation in part takes a case study approach, examining the conjectural tradition in the history of Blake editions and reproductions.</em></p>
