<div type="abstract">
<p rend="noCount">This essay investigates how the concept of fandom might make sense of a reading practice that emerged in the romantic period, the practice of visiting places associated with authors and their works in order to re-read their works in situ.  Focussing on Lady Frances Shelley as a typical romantic literary tourist, the essay considers the ways in which she (and by extension others) produced new constructions of reading and the reader in response to the emergent figure of the romantic author. Shelley's various accounts of visiting romantic locales associated with Rousseau, Scott and Byron not only provides a conspectus of possible tourist-stances and practices but suggests that romantic readers strove to represent themselves on a footing not only of intimacy but of social equality with the author, re-establishing a sense of a coterie audience in the face of the realities of an increasingly heterogenous mass reading public.</p>

<epigraph>
<quote>I was filled with timidity and affection: if I had dared, I would have burst into tears and kissed <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name>’s hand.</quote>
<bibl>
<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Henri Beyle</name>, to Romain Colomb, August 24, 1829</bibl>
</epigraph>
<p>So <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Henri Beyle</name> recalls his introduction to <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> in <name ref="#MilanIT" type="place">Milan</name> in October 1816 in the theatre of La Scala,
					in the box of <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name>'s friend, Monsieur Ludovic de Brême: “I
					entered M. de Brême's box on my return from an excursion on Lake Como. I found that the gathering had a sort of solemn and
					awkward air: everybody was silent. I was listening to the music when M. de Brême said to me, indicating my neighbour,
					'Monsieur <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name>, this is <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name>'.” (<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 196) At this moment, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> is freshly exiled and just arrived in Italy, trailing scandalous
					celebrity and the opening flourishes of “[t]he pageant of his bleeding heart” (<name ref="#ArnoldMatthew" type="person">Arnold</name>, <title level="a">Stanzas</title>) that came with the separation from his wife, Annabella
					Milbanke, the ensuing public scandal, and the flight from England. After travelling via Switzerland, where he stayed with Percy
					Bysshe and Mary Shelley at Lake Geneva, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> has been just over a week in
					Italy, where he was to live for the rest of his life. <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name>, also in exile,
					has been mainly in <name ref="#MilanIT" type="place">Milan</name> since 1813, when he took leave from Napoleon's army after the
					retreat from Moscow, and where he would spend the next seven years. When they meet, Monsieur <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> is still just <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name>, not yet '<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>,' as he will soon become when he adopts this pseudonym for the first
					time as the author of <title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence in 1817</title> (1817), in which he will recount a different
					version of this first meeting with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>—one of many, as it turns
					out, in private letters and published texts.</p>
<p>While Monsieur <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> is still <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name>, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> is for <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> very much the author identified with his works: “At that time I was mad about <title level="m">Lara</title>. From the second glance, I no longer saw <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>
					as he really was, but as I thought the author of <title level="m">Lara</title> should be” (<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 196). Here, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> registers both the power
					and the radical partiality that marks the gaze of the fan, in the form of this “second glance” and its prerogative to
					wilfully misread. <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name>'s “second glance” enacts what <name ref="#MillerDA" type="person">D. A. Miller</name> has referred to as the “Stendhalian eros [that] would seem to depend
					on love plots engendered from misjudgements and blind spots. Error, as it were, permits the narrateable movement of errantry
					(wandering, elapsing, delaying) in which finally comes to lie the erotic” (225). Indeed, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s fondness for irony means that he congenially <emph>throws</emph> such blind spots and errors
					to his correspondents and readers as though they were gifts. <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s generous capacity for error in relation to dates, for example,

<p>This essay examines the love plots and errantry that proliferate in <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s
					recollections of his meeting with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>. <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s work and life (and the intermediating code of “<foreign xml:lang="fr">beylisme</foreign>”) is associated most famously with “<foreign xml:lang="fr">la chasse au bonheur</foreign>”
					(“the pursuit of happiness”). As I wish to suggest, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s
					recollections of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> are marked by the happy over-investment of affect
					that has come to be identified with fan practices. A significant feature of <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s account of the meeting is that his emotion is produced after the event, in the act of recollection. The
					recollections embody, then, a typically Stendhalian concern with the fraught interrelation between desire and memory. For the
					historical figure of <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Henri Beyle</name> has offered the consummate allegory of the
					distortions of memory, and of the contradictions between reason and feeling that memory dramatizes. In <name ref="#SebaldWG" type="person">W. G. Sebald</name>'s historical fiction, <title level="a">
<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name>, or Love is a Madness Most Discreet</title> (included in <title level="m">Vertigo</title>), <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> is made to offer “eloquent proof
					of the various difficulties entailed in the act of recollection” (<name ref="#SebaldWG" type="person">Sebald</name> 5).
					Likewise, the fan <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> who meets <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> embodies love as a madness most discreet: “if I had dared, I would have burst into tears and
					kissed <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name>'s hand” (<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 196).</p>
<p>In the first full-length biography of <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>, <title level="m">
<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Henry Beyle</name> (otherwise De Stendahl [sic]) A Critical and Biographical
						Study</title> (1874), <name ref="#PatonAndrewArchibald">Andrew Archibald Paton</name> foregrounds such contradictions between
					reason and feeling as vital to his subject: “<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> was a man of genius,
					but he had a hundred irresistible impulses which could not be squared with reason” (9). <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
<name ref="#PatonAndrewArchibald" type="person">Paton</name>'s biography displayed a certain contradictory charm itself, as
							<name ref="#JamesHenry" type="person">Henry James</name> noted in a review in the <title level="j">Nation</title> (17
						September 1874): “It contains hardly an opinion which is not ludicrously erratic, and hardly a quotation, a foreign
						phrase, or a proper name which is not misspelled or misprinted. But the author writes with a garrulous <foreign xml:lang="fr">
							bonhomie</foreign> —that of an easy-going cosmopolite ... —which will soften the edge of the reader's
						displeasure; and he is to be thanked at any rate for bringing <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> once
						more before the world” (<name ref="#JamesHenry" type="person">James</name> 187). </note> As I wish to suggest, it is
					precisely such “irresistible impulses” that make up the affective repertoire of fan culture. And nowhere are these
					impulses offered more readily than in these recollections by <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>, the
					master of memory and emotion. <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s response to <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> is informed both impulsively and masterfully by a withholding or
					disguising of emotion. As <name ref="#JamesHenry" type="person">Henry James</name> wrote in his (<emph>un</emph>withholding and
					rather mixed) review of <name ref="#PatonAndrewArchibald" type="person">Paton</name>'s biography, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s work has “that singular something ... —a kind of painful tension of feeling under
					the disguise of the coolest and easiest style” (<name ref="#JamesHenry" type="person">James</name> 189). The beauty of the
					impulse, and its significance as a way of illuminating fan practices, is that it occupies a liminal position between the desire to
					act and the act itself. By narrowing the distinction between desire and act —as mere as “a wave of excitation in the
					nerve” (OED) or an “influence acting upon the mind” (<name ref="#JohnsonSamuel" type="person">Johnson</name> 1:
					954) —the category of the impulse enables a focus upon the mobility and changeability of desire. In this way, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s impulse to burst into tears and kiss <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name>'s hand is both expressed and checked.</p>
<p>The impulse is a very similar emotional creature to the sensation. <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>
					was a keen follower of the sensationalism of the <foreign xml:lang="fr">idéologues</foreign> — materialist philosophers
					and psychologists such as Condorect, Condillac, Tracy, and <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s revered
					Cabanis, the physician and materialist philosopher from whom he borrowed his “woman's skin”: “I will borrow for
					an instant the language of Cabanis. I have too fine a skin, a woman's skin ...; I graze my fingers, which are very fine, for a
					trifle; in a word, the surface of my body is feminine” (<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>,
						<title level="m">Life</title> 120). Revolutionaries and Republicans with a total system that conceived of personal happiness
					as an effect of political liberty, the <foreign xml:lang="fr"> idéologues</foreign> disregarded the question of classical
					form when it came to literature and emphasized the effect of the literary work upon reason, sensibility and imagination —its
					status, in other words, as sensation.</p>
<p>As I will argue in this essay, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s emphasis on sensation is also
					legible in relation to the forms of celebrity culture. <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s
					recollections of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> offer a different way of approaching the classic
					Stendhalian affective repertoire of sensation; the pursuit of happiness; the <foreign xml:lang="fr">mal du siècle</foreign>;
					and the intrigued and intriguing engagement with memory and love. I read <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s recollections as the revelatory staging of a close encounter between celebrity and fan, and I argue that
						<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s recollections suggest how practices of sensation can be
					understood as part of the affective routines of the fan that are such a vital part of celebrity culture. This essay explores,
					then, this constellation of interests in memory, sensation and love, by examining <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s recollections of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> in relation to the
					productivity and affectivity of the fan. Hence, my emphasis is primarily on the fan, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>, rather than on the celebrity, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>. Focusing on the
					meeting between <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> as a particular form of ritualized sociable encounter in the box at La Scala, I examine how <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s recounting of this meeting enacts celebrity culture's transformation
					of stranger to intimate, and how the fan-celebrity relation between <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>
					and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> is mediated both by the social materiality of place and by a
					shared devotion to another contemporary idol, Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
<p>
<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s recollections come to us in various textual forms, and are produced
					over about fifteen years from 1817—1832, in private correspondence, autobiographical fragments and published texts
					(collected in <name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 1954: 196-206). <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">

					included recollections by such figures as Thomas Medwin, Lady Blessington, John Galt, Thomas Moore and, some time later, Teresa

In this essay, deciding the veracity of <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s memories in relation to the historical record is not my concern.

					transcriptions of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s conversations. I am interested rather in the
					significance of these memories as participants within a new culture of celebrity encounter, and seek to engage their productive
					and necessarily inventive power.</p>
<div>
<head>II.</head>
<p>The meeting between <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> was destined to be: a match made in heaven on account of worldliness, a shared love of
						Napoleon, a keen interest in the fraught pains and pleasures of amorous memory, and in sensation. Sensation, after all, is
						what <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> found in the poetry of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>: “Since my first childhood imaginings, I have found a sensation, comparable by its
						immensity and its tenacity, triumphing over all other memories, only in the poems of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>
</name>” (<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>
<title level="m">Roman Journal</title>, 21). With this marvellous billow of ambiguity that attends the Romantic invocation of
						childhood, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> suggests both that the sensation of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s poetry is the only thing that compares with “childhood
						imaginings” <emph>and</emph> that even childhood itself could only imagine the “sensation” that <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s poetry later realized. Here, the poems of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> are not so much the secondary compensation for a lost
						childhood as the sensation that <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> has been searching for since
						childhood. <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s poetry is the long-lost discovery that transcends
						“childhood imaginings,” even as it is augured and desired through them. <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s poetry is the sensation that makes this precocious life worth the wait. In such a way, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> suggests, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> retrospectively creates his readers and authors their earliest and most precocious longings.</p>
<p>As <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> eloquently elaborates, it is the sensation of the poetry
						itself, and not the moral or the truth it represents, which matters, and which so moved <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s early readers, for better and worse. As a later reader, <name ref="#ArnoldMatthew" type="person">Matthew Arnold</name>, wrote in one of his tributes written in that ambivalent moment of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s re-evaluation that occurs around 1850: <quote>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent2"> He taught us nothing; but our soul</l>
<l rend="indent2"> Has <emph>felt</emph> him like the thunder's roll.</l>
</lg> (<title level="a">Memorial Verses, April 1850</title> 270) </quote> In this aptly sensational meteorological figure,
							<name ref="#ArnoldMatthew" type="person">Arnold</name> suggests how “<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s force” (272) licensed the deeply participatory reading practices that privileged the
						corporeal and emotional effects of the poetry upon the reader (“With shivering heart ... with reverential awe”). A
						privileged topos of celebrity culture is reading —private, transportable and what <name ref="#RanciereJacques" type="person">Jacques Rancière</name> terms “random” reading experiences (<name ref="#RanciereJacques" type="person">Rancière</name> 14), and the sensations that are affected through these reading experiences.</p>
<p>The culture of celebrity that <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s poetry both authorizes and is
						expropriated by places a premium on sharing such readerly sensations with the author himself: “As I told him [<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>] this one day in Venice, quoting <title level="m">The
							Giaour</title>, he replied, 'That is why it is full of dotted lines. The moment the experience of the age of reason can
						attack one of my images, I abandon it, I don't want the reader to find the same sensations in my work as at the Stock
						Exchange'” (<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>, <title level="m">Roman Journal</title> 21).
						Here, as <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> is made to corroborate the fan's sensation, he produces
						a distinction between reason and sensation and adopts a characteristically anti-commercial stance. Ironically, these very
						sensations that <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> identifies as constitutively opposed to the
						Stock Exchange are in fact dependant upon such commercial institutions. For it is only through highly-developed capitalist
						relations of production and consumption that the particular sensations of print culture and celebrity culture can be
						disseminated as the commodified cultural pleasures “full of dotted lines” that they are. <note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> On <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s relation to the commercial entailments
							of fame and celebrity culture, see <name ref="#ManningPeterJ" type="person">Manning</name>, <name ref="#ChristensenJerome" type="person">Christensen</name> and <name ref="#MoleThomas" type="person">Mole</name>. </note>
</p>
<p>Against the clichés of celebrity culture as gushy and excessive, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s meeting with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> is marked primarily by
						“timidity” and suggests an encounter that is restrained, discreet and even courtly. Indeed, it is so restrained
						that <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> is rendered speechless: “Since the conversation had
						languished, M. de Brême sought to make me speak. This was impossible for me” (<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 196). But even in silence, there is cliché and emotion and gushiness enough. For when
							<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> recovers himself sufficiently to be able to speak, he goes
						on to share with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> “the finest conversation I have ever
						known in my life; a volcano of new ideas and generous sentiments, so mingled that one believed himself to be enjoying them for
						the very first time” (<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 198). Recounting this moment of the social
						sublime, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> subtly draws attention to the difference between
						illusion and reality, and between the past moment of high emotion and the present moment of sober recollection. However, he
						also suggests that this distinction is barely legible and, in the end, rather negligible. For the impulse of the passage is to
						catapult the speaker and the reader of the present moment of recollection back into the past as experienced.</p>
<p>
<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s recollections of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> offer an abbreviated form of “the exact and scientific description of a brand of
						madness” that is produced in <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s 1822 work <title level="m">Love</title> (<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>, <title level="m">Love</title> 25). As with
							<title level="m">Love</title>, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s recollections work to
						demonstrate the specificity of literary representation as distinct from scientific description, but they also show how
						nonetheless emotion can be imbricated with cognition. The cognitive literary critic <name ref="#WaughPatricia" type="person">Patricia Waugh</name> has referred to the unique capacity of literature to “embody ... the problem of
						knowledge” by enabling the tension between the subjective and objective points of view to be experienced (<name ref="#WaughPatricia" type="person">Waugh</name> 1999: 51, 52). <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s recollections do this too. By inhabiting, in the form of the recollection, both the first-person and
						third-person perspective, and thereby splitting the subject between present and past, they enable the tension between past and
						present to be experienced. This suggests an alternative way of approaching <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s famous disrespect for chronology. Far from casually disregarding chronology, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> was acutely aware of chronology as a rhetorical convention of
						narrative — indeed as a rhetorical effect of narrative —and displayed this awareness in direct addresses to the
						reader: “After all these observations, I will now be born” (21), he writes in his autobiography, <title level="m">The Life of Henri Brulard</title> (completed in 1836 and published posthumously in 1890). In this way, he draws attention
						to the tensions and distortions between past and present that are created by the act of retrospective narration.</p>
<p>We know, then, that these “new ideas and generous sentiments” <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> claims to enjoy in conversation with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> can't
						be so new, if <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> is not enjoying them for the first time. But what
						really matters here is the feeling itself —the sensation. This sensational affective regime of the fan is a fetishistic
						regime. For <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s statement —“a volcano of new ideas and
						generous sentiments, so mingled that one believed himself to be enjoying them for the very first time” —does not
						so much produce a redeeming and enlightening epistemological distinction between the original and the copy, reason and
						emotion, as recapitulate what <name ref="#ŽižekSlavoj" type="person">Slavoj Žižek</name> refers to as
						“the formula of fetishism”: “I know, but nevertheless ...”. <note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
							These are the words (“<foreign xml:lang="fr">Je sais bien, mais quand même</foreign>”) of Octave
							Mannoni's famous patient in <title level="m">

See also <name ref="#SchorNaomi" type="person">Schor</name> 113-116. </note> (<emph>I know that I was not experiencing these ideas and sentiments for the very first
							time, but nevertheless</emph>.) Such a vindication of affect in the face of disbelieving reality works to consecrate the
						entry into social life of the intense affectivity of fandom, or what <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s contemporaries termed “idol worship.”</p>
<p>Fandom would seem to proceed, then, according to the fetishistic logic that <name ref="#SchorNaomi" type="person">Naomi
							Schor</name> refers to as “a perpetual oscillation between two incompatible beliefs” (<name ref="#SchorNaomi" type="person">Schor</name> 114). It is this logic of fetishism that <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s narrative draws attention to in that earlier moment when he says: “At that time I was mad about
							<title level="m">Lara</title>. From the second glance, I no longer saw <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> as he really was, but as I thought the author of <title level="m">Lara</title> should be.” This is
						both the knowledge of hindsight (<emph>Only now do I realize I no longer saw <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> as he really was</emph>), and the knowledge that is fetishism's disavowal (<emph>I knew my <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> was the <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> I thought he should be rather than the <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> he

<p>
<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s recollections participate in the genre of the celebrity
						sighting or what <name ref="#RojekChris" type="person">Chris Rojek</name> has referred to as the “out-of-face
						encounter” between celebrity and fan (17). As the dynamic of presence and absence is critical to celebrity affect, the
						textual revisitation of the “out-of-face” encounter is about staging the author's presence as a moment of private
						life and staging familiarity with the author. The genre of the celebrity sighting dramatizes celebrity culture's preoccupation
						with embodiment, which is predicated upon distance (see <name ref="#RojekChris" type="person">Rojek</name> 12). As such, it
						engages one of the most striking ironies of celebrity culture, which is that the desire for intimacy increases as access
						becomes more unattainable and distance greater. For this reason, technologies of simulation become more prolific in the labour
						of transforming the distant celebrity stranger into an intimate, predicated as they are upon the disavowal of the distance
						that they in fact materialize. The genre of “conversations of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>” speaks to celebrity culture's premium upon embodiment and authorial presence, and to a certain
						disavowal of textual mediation. As <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s conversations speak the
						genre, they present the exquisitely productive power of textual mediation in conjuring authorial presence.</p>

<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s celebrity sighting of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> is a moment of high emotion. Most significantly, this is a moment of emotion shared between two
						men, one of whom presents himself with the intensity of a lover. This moment encapsulates a particular intensity of emotion
						that informs the proverbial devotion of fan to idol, and which mimics the gestures and emotional intensities of Romantic love.
							<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s episodic narratives mimic, too, the narrative that Roland
						Barthes has analysed in <title level="m">A Lover's Discourse</title> as the “scene” of “love at first
						sight”: <quote rendition="#indent2"> the first thing we love is <emph>a scene</emph>. For love at first sight requires
							the very scene of its suddenness (what makes me irresponsible, subject to fatality, swept away, ravished): and of all the
							arrangements of objects, it is the scene which seems to be seen best for the first time: a curtain parts: what had not yet
							ever been seen is discovered in its entirety, and then devoured by the eyes: what is immediate stands for what is
							fulfilled: I am initiated: the scene <emph>consecrates</emph> the object I am going to love. (Barthes 192)</quote>
<lb/> In
							<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s love-at-first-sighting of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, the scene is set at La Scala, <name ref="#MilanIT" type="place">Milan</name>, where the curtains part, and what takes place off-stage —more precisely in the box of M. de
						Brême —is moved to centre-stage. (“I entered M. de Brême's box on my return from an excursion on Lake
						Como. I found that the gathering had a sort of solemn and awkward air: everybody was silent. I was listening to the music when
						M. de Brême said to me, indicating my neighbour, 'Monsieur <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name>,
						this is <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name>'.”)</p>
<p>As <name ref="#MoonMichael" type="person">Michael Moon</name> notes of Barthes' scene of ravishment, the scene of
						love-at-first-sight requires not so much the “beloved-at-first-sight” as “the scene itself” (<name ref="#MoonMichael" type="person">Moon</name> 6). For <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>, as he
						writes in <title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence</title>, it was love at first sight for the scene itself a few weeks
						earlier, when he returned to La Scala after a brief absence from <name ref="#MilanIT" type="place">Milan</name>, but presents
						it as though for the very first time, devouring it with his eyes: <quote rendition="#indent2">I was limp with exhaustion; but
							I dragged myself straight off to La Scala ... and there, at one stroke, lay the justification of my journey. My senses
							were so weary that they were beyond the furthest reaches of pleasure. Yet all the fantasy that the most exotic intricacy
							of an oriental imagination may evolve, all that is most baroque and most bizarre, all that is most sumptuous in
							architectural devising, all that can be made to live and breathe through the soft brilliance of draperies, all that can be
							coaxed into reality through the symbolism of characters who have not merely the costume, but the very faces and gestures
							of their make-belief and alien lands ... all this and more have I seen tonight.</quote>
<lb/> Not only as a stage, but as a
						whole social world La Scala dazzles: <quote rendition="#indent2">
<lb/>La Scala is the focal point of the entire city; it is
							the universal salon, the hub of society, which is here, and here only; ... <emph>Rendez-vous at La Scala</emph>

							<foreign xml:lang="fr">Rendez-vous</foreign> to conduct business and pleasure were lavishly decorated affairs that
						functioned as multi-purpose sociable spaces within the theatre. As Robert Alter elaborates, “a box at La Scala was more
						like a small parlor than the little overhanging pockets jammed with fixed seats of modern theatres. A party of eight or ten
						could comfortably deploy themselves where they chose, around a pedestal table convenient for reading and card playing, in
						movable chairs by the railing, or on the cushions of the divan set against one wall of the box. This meant that a party at La
						Scala was very much a social group whose activities were limited neither in nature nor duration by the performance on the
						stage below” (134).</p>
<p>Taking place on-stage that night of 23 October 1816 was a performance of the opera <title level="m">Elena</title>, a success of
						that season, by Johann Simon Mayr (1763-1845), himself a successful opera composer despite being later eclipsed by the
						renowned Gioacchino Rossini (1792-1868). <note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Rossini became the young idol of the Italian
							opera-going public virtually overnight in 1813 with the success of <title level="m">Tancredi</title>, which <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> and <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name>
							saw in Venice in November 1816, performed, as <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> writes, by
							“the famous Marchesini [who] delighted me, and indeed affected us both, more than [Angelica] Catalani” (<name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> I: 61). As <name ref="#WaltonBenjamin" type="person">Benjamin
								Walton</name> notes, Rossini was “the <name ref="#ScottWalter" type="person">Scott</name>, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> or Napoleon of music, depending on the fancy of individual
							critics” (<name ref="#WaltonBenjamin" type="person">Walton</name> 82). Despite Rossini's enormous popularity,
							however, in 1816 he endured the scandalous failure of the first performance of <title level="m">The Barber of
								Seville</title> in Rome on Feb 26 1816. (The second performance, in Bologna, was a big success.) <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> writes about the episode in his <title level="m">Vie de
								Rossini </title> (1823), itself a scandalously plagiarized text “cribbed” from Guiseppe Carpani's <title level="m">Rossiane</title>. See <name ref="#WaltonBenjamin" type="person">Walton</name> on the mixed reception of
							Rossini in London. To note another Napoleonic intertext: Rossini's father, the town trumpeter, very famously welcomed the
							Napoleonic troops into their northern Italian town, a gesture for which he was later thrown into jail after the Habsburg
							restoration of 1796. </note> In <title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence</title>, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> writes: “La Scala has revived <title level="m">Elena</title>, an opera by Mayr... .
						Dear God, how dull it seems! Yet what wild enthusiasm still survived to greet the <emph>sextet</emph> in Act II! ... There is
						genius in such a passage: old Mayr must have saved it up from the days of his youth, or else pilfered it where he chanced to
						light upon it. Alone, this passage rescued the entire opera from disaster” (21). <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> too it seems was suitably impressed by the sextet, according to <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> in <title level="m">
<foreign xml:lang="fr">Vie de Rossini</foreign>
</title> (1823): “<foreign xml:lang="fr">

							5:125). </note>
</p>
<p>For all its ravishing social sublimity, the celebrity sighting delivers nevertheless an emphatically different kind of
						ravishment to the love-at-first-sighting. The celebrity sighting is very much a second sight, a “second-order
						intimacy” (<name ref="#TurnerGraeme" type="person">Turner</name> 92-3), the deliriously misprisioning sight of what
							<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> refers to as the “second glance.” The celebrity
						is always already known, and so a certain belatedness is at play. Such belatedness also marks the post-Napoleonic social,
						affective and psychic armature of the <foreign xml:lang="fr">mal du siècle</foreign>, that constitutive feature of French
						Romanticism, with its nostalgic but inhibited desire for the great gesture, compromised by suspicion of gallantry (see
						Brookner, <title level="m">Romanticism</title>, 41ff).</p>
<p>
<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s biographer, <name ref="#PatonAndrewArchibald" type="person">Paton</name>, would beg to differ from a reading of the meeting between <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> as a scene of ravishment and idol
						worship: “But <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> was not on his knees before <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, as if he had been an idol, like thousands of others, whose
						admiration of his verses made them blind to all the personal defects of the man; and <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> tells us roundly that those who saw him close at hand considered him haughty, and even a little
						mad” (<name ref="#PatonAndrewArchibald" type="person">Paton</name> 1874: 122). Indeed, in another recollection of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, the 20 October 1816 letter to Louis Crozet, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> refers to <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> as “the original of Lovelace,” and, in <title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence in
							1817</title> (1817), as “the most amiable monster that I have ever seen” (quoted in <name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 196). Celebrity affect is, after all, an ambivalent mode of affect. “The purpose of
						gossip about celebrities,” as Graeme <name ref="#TurnerGraeme" type="person">Turner</name> points out, “is not to
						elevate or idealize them as exemplary individuals” (107); it is about “modelling, fantasy and
						identification” (<name ref="#GamsonJoshua" type="person">Gamson</name>, quoted in <name ref="#TurnerGraeme" type="person">Turner</name> 110). As a practice of the fan's identity work, gossip involves, then, the production of
						identity through <emph>dis</emph>-identification as much as identification with such amiable monsters. The fan's obsessive
						preoccupation with the private life of the celebrity necessarily entails revealing the bad, the mad and the dangerous to know.
						And, as it turns out, there is quite a lot for <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>
<emph>not</emph> to like about <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>. <note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> On <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s character flaws, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> writes that “<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> could have pardoned Napoleon more easily if he had had a little of the colourlessness
							of Washington. Amusingly, it was not at all the despotic and odious part of Napoleon's character which displeased the
							English peer” (<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 197). He also presents a <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> jealous of Brummell: “in his moments of dandyism, he
							always pronounced the name of Brummell with a mingled emotion of respect and jealousy” (201). </note>
</p>
<p>In any case, as we already know, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name>
<emph>was</emph> on his knees inside the box of M. de Brême, if only in the form of the repressed impulse expressed in
						the letter to his cousin, Romain Colomb: “I was filled with timidity and affection: if I had dared, I would have burst
						into tears and kissed <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name>'s hand” (<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 196). This is love at first sight —or, at least, “second
						glance” — and he is rendered speechless by the <foreign xml:lang="fr">coup de foudre</foreign> of this first
						sighting. But this speechlessness too is an active structuring impulse, just as his “timidity” reflects the
						impulse acting on him as a “wave of excitation in the nerve.” Whilst this restraint holds <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> back from outwardly going on his knees for <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, the withheld emotion is later displayed in the autobiographical
						disclosure: not-daring-to is purely rhetorical, for <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> does dare,
						if only in the disclosure. In this way, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s disclosure produces
						one of the ironies of the affect of the fan: that a moment of the display of intense emotion can also be a moment of
						withholding. <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s disclosure thereby dramatizes a certain
						complication of the distinction between private feeling and public display that is central to the workings both of celebrity
						affect and the poetry of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> as it is read. <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s life and work habitually inspired such displays of emotion, such
						reworkings of the boundaries between public and private, and the spectacularly rhetorical disclosures of the heart that he
						referred to in <title level="m">Don Juan</title> as “The truth in masquerade” (XI, 37, 290, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> 1986: 476). A feature of that rhetorical sophistication is that
							<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s poetry, to borrow <name ref="#McGannJerome" type="person">Jerome McGann</name>'s memorable formulation, “is always, at whatever register, elaborating reciprocities with its
						audiences” (<name ref="#McGannJerome" type="person">McGann</name> 85-6).</p>
<p>Celebrity culture enables —indeed would seem to demand —the mimicry of Romantic love, even in the space of a
						relationship between two men. (So much so that the cultural and discursive genre we refer to as “Byromania” also
						involved elaborate recantations, usually on the part of mature authors, such as Edward Bulwer-Lytton and Benjamin Disraeli,
						who looked back on their love of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> as a youthful folly [see <name ref="#ElfenbeinAndrew" type="person">Elfenbein</name>].) But what kind of relationship between two men? In underscoring
						the proximity of the fan's devotion as a form of love and “Stendhalian eros,” I am not suggesting that <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s revelatory staging of intense feeling for <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> is intended as a kind of unmasking of himself and his feeling as
						self-evidently homosexual <note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Not that <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> does not have his own homosexual fans, such as the openly homosexual Second Empire dandy Jean Lorrain
							(1855-1906), who paid his homage by adopting the effeminate, diminutive <emph> nom-de-plume</emph>
							“Stendhaletta”. As Rhonda Garelick writes, the “[h]eavily rouged, powdered, openly gay” Lorrain,
							who presented himself not as a man of fashion but as a <foreign xml:lang="fr">femme du monde</foreign>, was also the
							author of an initiatory fashion text that identifies fashion with cultural memory, <title level="m">
<foreign xml:lang="fr">La nostalgie de la beauté</foreign>
</title> (1912). See Garelick 43-6. Proust challenged Lorrain to a duel after Lorrain publicly implicated Proust as a
							homosexual. See <name ref="#NyeRobertA" type="person">Nye</name> 122-3. </note> —or even indeed as definitively
							<emph>sexual</emph> (as though what is being revealed here is a knowable and consolidated sexual identity rather than the
						desiring play of eroticised identifications and investments) —although it is certainly, in all its mobility and
						intensity, very queer. And even though <name ref="#PatonAndrewArchibald" type="person">Paton</name>'s image of <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>
<emph>not</emph> on his knees suggests Leo Bersani's “seductive and intolerable image of a grown man, legs high in the
						air, unable to refuse the suicidal ecstasy of being a woman”, that is, of “getting fucked” (<title level="a">Rectum</title> 212), unable to refuse the pleasures of “self-divestiture” (<title level="m">Homos</title>
						128), and of willingly sacrificing disciplined self-mastery for “self-shattering and solipsistic jouissance”
							(<title level="a">Rectum</title> 222).</p>
<p>The affect of the fan is proverbially like that of the lover, but also <emph>un</emph>like, perversely freighted as it is with
						all kinds of mobile identifications, impulses and intensities of emotion and desire that exceed the boundaries of traditional
						masculine homosociality and subjectivity yet which are not to be overdetermined by sexuality. The affective and discursive
						practices of Romantic fandom are vitally significant because they usher this impulsiveness into sociability, into a world
						where impulse is legible, meaningful and valuable, for all its contradictions. <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s scandalous celebrity licenses such perversity and inspires a re-imagining of author-reader
						relations, endowing them with new pleasures and sensations. The fandom it generates is a productive affective and social
						economy that spectacularizes the transformative agency of the reader. Far from entailing an exclusively passive position (in
						docile thrall to the sovereignty of author and text), fandom can be seen to transform a traditional textual economy of active
						and passive, thereby enabling reception as a mode of delirious productivity —proliferating often disobedient and
						indiscreet disclosures —as <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s fan practices demonstrate in
						abundance.</p>

<head>IV.</head>
<p>
<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s numerous recollections are characterized by repetition, the
						habitual revisiting and restaging of the scene of the first sighting, and the connoisseurial selection and discrimination of
						“moments” to recount — <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s “moments of
						genius” as well as more “prosaic moments” (<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 197). This
						devotional practice involves the multiplication of nuance and detail, to compare and contrast, enabling the obsessive return
						to the scene of encounter. As I mentioned earlier, these versions did not go unchallenged. In the years after <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s death, <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">John Cam
							Hobhouse</name>, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s closest friend and executor, was fierce
						in his attempts to regulate the posthumous accounts that flooded the market, as well as the letters and memoirs that enabled
						people to profit from these memories. (Having said that, <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name>'s position
						was complicated and somewhat compromised by his own vested interest in always having to be seen to be <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s first-best friend.) <note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">
<name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name>'s role in the destruction of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s memoirs and the publication of Moore's subsequent <title level="m">Life</title> is
							illuminating here, suggesting how fraught this position could be. <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> had originally given Moore the MS of his memoirs to raise money. Moore opposed the destruction of the
							memoirs (a campaign which <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> initiated and completed within three
							days of learning of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s death), and wrote his <title level="m">Life</title> of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, which brought in the money that would
							have been his from the memoirs. <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> seems to have been a little bit
							jealous of Moore for having been entrusted with the MS, which possibly makes him suspect Moore's motives. As <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> wrote in the <title level="a">Narrative of Events Connected with
								the Destruction of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name>'s Memoirs</title>, “<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> made a present of himself to Mr. Moore, and Mr. Moore
							sold his Lordship to the booksellers” ( <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> III: 331). And in
							his diary of 14 May 1826: “Moore owned very frankly to me that he would make a book to get the money he wanted, but
							not a book of real merit as a Life of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name>... . I am sorry
							that circumstances have made this interview necessary, but as I feel that <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> certainly intended a benefit to Moore, I cannot but assist him in some degree to gain his 2, 000 out of
								<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name>'s memory. That is his motive; he has no

								<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> as “one of the thousand and one squabbles which my

For a detailed analysis of this episode, see <name ref="#HamiltonIan" type="person">Hamilton</name>. </note> As “keeper of the flame,” <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> could claim at least a legal obligation or entitlement to regard all memories of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> as a form of property. Less convincing are contemporary critics of
						celebrity who (without such cause) would naturalize this traditional economy of authorial sovereignty whereby the authorial
						image is understood to be the exclusive property of the author and to be controlled by the author. <note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"> Recent legal theory has challenged this idea of publicity as a form of property. As <name ref="#LangeDavid" type="person">David Lange</name> points out, “if the right of publicity was to be a new

						an understanding, I emphasize the expropriation of the author by the fan. <note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors"> The
							authorial image, like the star image, as Richard Dyer points out, includes “what people say or write about him or
							her, as critics or commentators, the way the image is used in other contexts such as advertisements, novels, pop songs,

<lb/> How dare one speak of self, but
						speak of himself <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> does and must. In this spectacular
						subordination of fan to celebrity, the beloved celebrity is made over into the creature or the darling of the fan, through the
						self-same gestures of revelation that stage intimacy between <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> and
						“self,” distinguish <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> as a fan and mark <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> with those distinguishing features of <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s love. What we see is <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s display of the supreme prerogative of unveiling authorial presence, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s staging of privileged access, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s narrative manipulation of the dynamic of presence and absence that is critical to
						celebrity affect's preoccupation with embodiment. In this way, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s
						rendition of the Byronic conversation and recollection proceeds like the fan website, with the “interpolation of
						autobiographical example ... [implicitly declaring] this is my site, my contents ... my way” (Hoxter, quoted in <name ref="#HillsMatt" type="person">Hills</name> 91).</p>
<p>The meeting between <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> and <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> is a close encounter between celebrity and fan, a sighting of the celebrity. But it is also
						a moment of social presentation: being introduced to a stranger. This drama of social presentation involves reading that
						stranger through social signs. For his part, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> initially gets
						these signs wrong, as <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> coolly informs us in <title level="a">
<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> en Italie</title> (1830): <quote rendition="#indent2">
								[<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name>] had been informed that in the course of the
							evening he would probably be introduced to a stranger who had performed the celebrated campaign of Moscow, which still
							possessed the charm of novelty, as at that time we had not been spoiled by any romances on the subject. A fine-looking
							man, with a military appearance, happening to be one of your party, his Lordship naturally concluded that he was the hero.
							(quoted in <name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 200)</quote>
<lb/> The “hero” is not the
						“fine-looking man, with a military appearance,” but <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>,
							<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">
<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> the man may not have had the “military
							appearance,” but his sentences do, as Anita Brookner suggests, in her subtle and appreciative account of <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s gift for a peculiar kind of emotion constrained by
							formality: “Hence too the depth and subtlety of the emotion which eventually goes into the novels disguised or
							wrapped up in short, military sentences” (<title level="m">Genius</title>, 36). </note> so <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> is mistaken. But only temporarily: “The next day, however,
							<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> was undeceived ... [and] did me the honour to address me on
						the subject of Russia” (<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 200).</p>
<p>The moment in the box is a moment of high emotion, but it is also constrained —and enabled —by social ritual. As we
						have seen, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s response to <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> is informed by a withholding of emotion: “if I had dared I would have.” However,
						this not-daring “timidity” is also an active structuring impulse, in play with “affection,” for <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> is “filled” with both. To conceive of fandom as a form
						of social ritual is to understand it as something more than a debased, excessive, inauthentic mode of emotion. Rather, it is
						to see it as a complex form of social modernity, aligned with new modes of social performance and presentation, affect and
						publicity, and to see it as an exemplary form of intimate publicity. For what marks the particular encounter between <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>
						is both the intensity of emotion and also the restraint with which it is controlled and produced: the ritualization of that
						emotion. As the social theorist Erving Goffman has suggested, “When in the idol's immediate presence we act with ritual
						care” (quoted in <name ref="#SmithGreg" type="person">Smith</name> 28).</p>
</div>
<div n="5">

<p>We act with ritual care, but also with a sense of strategy. For once the introduction between <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> has been made, strategic
						skirmishes ensue on the subject of the recent Anglo-French hostilities. As <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> writes: <quote rendition="#indent2"> I idolized Napoleon, and replied to his Lordship [<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>] as I should have done to a member of the legislative assembly

<quote rendition="#indent2"> My determination to be cold offers some explanation for the marked kindness with which, at the

<quote rendition="#indent2"> (<title level="a">
<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> en
								Italie,</title> 1830, quoted in <name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 1954: 200)</quote>
<lb/> This
						passage elaborates a gradual transformation from stranger to intimate, as each man is required to negotiate the often oblique
						social signs that the other puts into circulation. It is about the tactical manoeuvres of social affect and social intimacy,
						which involve emotional withholding: giving out coldness when one feels warmth. But it is also about the expectation that this
						paradoxical coldness will be read, and worked through, as indeed it is, when <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> discovers that <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> is not the typical
						“member of the legislative assembly who had exiled the ex-emperor to St Helena. I subsequently discovered that <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> was at once enthusiastic in favour of Napoleon, and jealous
						of his fame.” This mutual love for Napoleon explains in retrospect that intriguing paradox of social emotion: “My
						determination to be cold offers some explanation for the marked kindness with which at the end of a few days, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> did me the favour to regard me.” <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> is determined to be cold, and this results in kindness from <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>. Why? The discovery of a shared Napoleon-love not only rescues and
						redeems an awkward social moment, but also reconfigures the co-ordinates of a map of first impressions shared by the two men
						that assumes national identity to determine political identification. After the discovery, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> rewards <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> with kindness for his
						loyalty to Napoleon, even when that loyalty has entailed coldness toward himself. The exchange is about the enigma of making a
						connection through being cold. <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s friends think they won't be
						friends but they are wrong, for <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> has taken his arm.</p>
<p>These meetings occur in a relatively circumscribed social space, the theatre box of M. de Brême, an intriguing figure who
						as a consecrated priest, almoner of the ex-king and leader of the Italian Romantics, mixed exotic forms of Italian social and
						cultural capital. Clearly charmed, <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> gives a detailed account of his
						first impression of <quote rendition="#indent2"> Monsignore Lodovico de Brême, one of Napoleon's almoners for the Kingdom
							of Italy, whence his title. The son of a noble Piedmontese family, destined for the Church, who has been offered two
							bishoprics by Napoleon and one by the people, but wishes rather to unfrock himself than to put on the mitre. He is a young
							man about thirty, wears his dark hair combed upright, which gives him a wildness of expression not unlike that of Alfieri
							[the Italian Romantic poet]. He is, on the whole, one of the most attractive men I ever saw. He gave <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> a most warm reception, and as Madame de Stäel had
							introduced me to him in her letter in favourable terms, was pointedly civil to me. He spoke with a certain degree of point
							on every subject, delivering his apothegems and ironies in the gravest tone, which made him quite irresistible. (<name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> I: 40-41)</quote>
<lb/> Unable to resist, we might say smitten,
							<name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> has his own moment of love-at-first-sight. Heady fan-love is in
						the air, and the scene takes on the aspects of a mid-summer Shakespearean romance of mistaken identities, multiple love
						objects and deliriously mobile desires, all predicated upon what <name ref="#GirardRene" type="person">René Girard</name>
						refers to as the “idolatrous worship of otherness” (197). A sucker for grave ironies, <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> sees in Brême the same combination of social, cultural and physical power associated
						with the Byronic aura. Brême’s “wildness of expression not unlike that of Alfieri” also mediates the Byronic
						aura (as Alfieri's likeness to <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> was noted by contemporaries [see
							<title level="j">BLJ</title> 9: 11]). It is as though <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> here
						displaces his own desire for <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> via Alfieri onto Brême, who is
						himself drifting in the homosocially shared trancelike obsession with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> that he sponsors in his box. In this series of displacements, the cycle of mimetic desire is routed first
						through <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> and now through Brême, to produce two couples of
						admirer and admiree: <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Beyle</name> and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> and Brême, with Napoleon and
						to a lesser extent Alfieri mediating idols in between.</p>
<p>This circle of love recalls another one tenderly fantasized by <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>
						barely two years before, when he had written to <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> to break the news
						of his engagement to Annabella Milbanke. This extraordinarily moving letter entwines <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s most gentle and optimistic feelings for Milbanke (“my intended”, before she
						becomes “ <emph>that woman</emph> ” [<title level="j">BLJ</title> 5: 120]) within a textbook illustration of
						homosocial triangulation, when <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> asks <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> to be witness to the ceremony in the same breath as expressing the fond wish that he too
						might be married, so that they might share the experience, “like people electrified in company through the same
						chain” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 4: 213). As it turned out, <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> witnessed the marriage, the bitter separation and the never-ending degradation of “my
						intended,” Annabella Milbanke, into “the bitch my wife” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 6: 95), “that
						infernal fiend” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 6: 129), that “<foreign xml:lang="it">Porca
						buzzerena</foreign>” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 6: 131), or sodomite sow.<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">
<name ref="#CromptonLewis&gt;" type="person">Louis Crompton</name> helpfully glosses <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s nasty little Italian neologism: “'Porca' means sow; 'buzzerena' is a Venetian
							dialect term derived from 'buggerone,' a 'sodomite'” (<name ref="#CromptonLewis&gt;" type="person">Crompton</name>,
							235, fn 83).</note> And here in these early weeks of exile, <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name>
						joins hands to witness the electric chain of fan-love with the adoring Italian Romantics. As he wrote after <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s death, “No human being could approach him without being
						sensible of this magical influence” (<name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> III: 41).<note n="17" place="foot" resp="editors">Earlier in 1816, just before coming to <name ref="#MilanIT" type="place">Milan</name>, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> had been the centre of another homosocially configured magic

								Shelley</name>, <name ref="#ShelleyMaryWollstonecraftGodwin" type="person">Mary Shelley</name> and Claire Clairmont
							from May until August. As <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> was to write of this summer of

							“I was half mad during the time of its composition, between metaphysics, mountains, lakes, love
							inextinguishable.”</note> However, as he also knew, especially as keeper of the flame, the magical current generated
						by this Byronic “electrified company” could also turn. <note n="18" place="foot" resp="editors"> And turn it did,
							quite badly, with the Italian Romantics. The morning after the magical night of October 1816 came in July 1818, when <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name>'s <title level="a">Essay on the Present Literature of
								Italy</title> appeared as part of his <title level="m">Historical illustrations of the fourth canto of Childe Harold:
								containing dissertations on the ruins of Rome; and an essay on Italian literature</title> (London: John Murray, 1818)
							and contained not a single mention of the irresistible Brême. Brême wrote to <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> to indicate his displeasure, and then <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> wrote back to <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>: “Di Breme may be
							damned! ... Breme is vexed because I have ventured to tell some disagreeable truths about poor dear Bonaparte and because
							I have said nothing about his behissed comedy. You had better tell him so and then you will succeed to your heart's
							content in making him hate me as much as you have made me hate him” (quoted in <name ref="#VincentER" type="person">Vincent</name> 21). In fact, the author of the “Essay” was not <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> but the exiled Italian patriot and poet Ugo Foscolo, whom <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> had met in <name ref="#LondonUK" type="place">London</name>, and who agreed to write the
							“Essay” on the condition of secrecy about his authorship. <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> himself seemed to enjoy the falling out between <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> and Brême. As he wrote to <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> on 3 August
							1818, “Enclosed is Breme’s scrawl ... he gives you devilish bitter words —and I long to see you by the ears
							—that I do.—” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 6: 63). And as he wrote to Guiseppino Albrizzi, the son of
							Countess Albrizzi, a major Venetian hostess, known as the Madame de Staël of Italy: “Tell <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> —his letter to De Breme has made a great Sensation
							—and is to be published in the Tuscan &amp; other Gazettes” (<title level="j">BLJ</title> 6: 91). </note> As
							<name ref="#GirardRene" type="person">Girard</name> writes, “the disquieting infrastructure of mimetic desire”
						entails the “necessarily jealous and conflictual nature of mimetic convergence on a single object” (197). Jealousy
						is alive and well for <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name>, both in <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s life and death, and he was notoriously jealous of other pretenders (such as Thomas Moore) to
						the title of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s first-best friend (see <name ref="#HamiltonIan" type="person">Hamilton</name>). Despite these rivalries, he acknowledged that <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s “power of attaching those about him to his person was such as no one I knew
						possessed” (<name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> I: 41).</p>
<p>
<name ref="#GirardRene" type="person">Girard</name> writes about the love triangle using fan-love —the “idolatrous
						worship of otherness” —as his model for all desire. Likewise, what Bersani says about sexual desire also holds
						true of fan-love in this giddy scene of homosocial desire: “Displacement is endemic to sexuality” and
						“sexual desire initiates, indeed can be recognized by, an agitated fantasmatic activity in which original (but from the
						start, unlocatable) objects of desire get lost in the images they generate” (221). The confusion is such that objects of
						hero worship become confused with appropriate objects of desire. Napoleon was particularly vulnerable to such confusions and
						displacements, and offers the exemplary case in point here. The case is dramatized with spectacular force and piquancy in the
						bedroom farces of <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s <title level="m">The Red and the
							Black</title> (1830), where a portrait of Napoleon hidden under the bed of Julien Sorel in the home of his Ultra-Royalist
						employer is mistakenly thought to be a portrait of an unidentified secret lover, and <name ref="#HazlittWilliam" type="person">Hazlitt</name>'s <title level="a">Liber Amoris</title> (1823), where H. is simultaneously the rival of a bust of Napoleon
						for the affections of S., “She is my heart's idol,”, and the rival of S. herself for that precious little bust of
						Napoleon, “the god of my idolatry” (<name ref="#HazlittWilliam" type="person">Hazlitt</name> 45, 28). Struggling
						in the box at La Scala to maintain the line between homosocial and homoerotic desire, it is perhaps just as well that, as
							<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> writes, “The company there assembled consists entirely
						of men of letters. No woman ever passes the threshold” (<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>,
							<title level="m">Rome</title> 64). And sure enough, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> presents
							<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> “declin[ing] the honour” of introductions to the
						“assemblage of lovely women as that which chance had collected in <name ref="#MilanIT" type="place">Milan</name>”
							(<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 202).</p>
<p>This is, then, a highly gendered, male-homosocial space. It is an aristocratic social space, but also a cosmopolitan one, and a
						specifically Italian form of cosmopolitanism, as <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> is at pains to
						point out, noting the social genre of meeting in the box of the aristocrat as a particular form of Italian warmth and
						informality: “This Italian custom, not generally followed in France, banished all ceremony. The affectation that chills
						the atmosphere of a French saloon is unknown in the society of <name ref="#MilanIT" type="place">Milan</name>.” As his
						dismissive remarks about French social custom underscore, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>, like
							<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, is in happy self-exile from his own country (“his
						blood / Is all meridian” [<title level="a">Stanzas to the Po</title> ], and he will eventually have inscribed on his
						gravestone “Arrigo Beyle, <name ref="#MilanIT" type="place">Milan</name>ese”). In this congenial setting, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>
						rewrite the hoary old script of chilly Anglo-French hostilities into a congenial dialogue of transnational camaraderie, hosted
						by the Italian informality of the box of M. Brême, which welcomes exiles, and the saloon of La Scala. They too might have
						been trapped as prisoners of memories of war, but they move beyond these dim, shabby “hulks” into the light,
						bright and airy, liberal and cosmopolitan, space of the box at La Scala. <note n="19" place="foot" resp="editors"> As a
							radical Whig who opposed the Congress devised by the Liverpool administration, <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> also thrived in this space: “A persuasion that I am of the Liberal English and, more than all,
							have a hatred of the Congress Castlereagh system, gives me a willing audience in this place, which is not elsewhere found,
							at least I have not found it” (<name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> II: 47). </note>
</p>
<p>The meeting between <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> and <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> dramatizes the poignant liminality of this historical moment when <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> and
						Napoleon are all freshly exiled, Napoleon himself living on in the period that can only just be referred to as
						post-Napoleonic, so that <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s store of Napoleonic reminiscences
						“still possessed the charm of novelty” (<title level="m">Rome, Naples and Florence,</title> 1817, quoted in <name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 200). The spectres of “hulks” and torture and “infernal
						machines” of recent military conflict, that loom early in the conversation and chill the air (making it “rather
						warm” in the sense of unfriendly), disintegrate under the spell of an ecumenical Napoleonic aura that banishes these bad
						memories and baleful animosities as so many gloomy ghosts at the table. This reminds us of the powerful mediating force that
						Napoleon was throughout Europe as “an embodiment of liberty and opposition to monarchical power” (Bainbridge 137)
						both while he was in power and after. (Of course, Napoleon was also for many the contemporary embodiment of despotism. And
							<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, who could be full of adoration for Napoleon, was also of
						course famously ambivalent about him and so could be very critical too. But that's another story.) <note n="20" place="foot" resp="editors"> This ambivalence is manifest in the <title level="a">Ode to Napoleon</title> (1814), written on the
							occasion of the first abdication. For a compelling analysis of <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s ambivalent relation to Napoleon in the “Ode” and elsewhere, see Bainbridge 134-52. On the
							diversity of views amongst English sympathizers with Napoleon, see the classic study by <name ref="#LeanETangye" type="person">E. Tangye Lean</name>, <title level="m">The Napoleonists: A Study in Political Diasaffection
								1760-1960</title>. </note>
</p>
<p>For all his later attacks on <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>, <name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> —also a lover of Napoleon —entered a highly appreciative account in his diaries
						of the anecdotes that <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> gave them of Napoleon. <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>, who had been in charge of dispatches, tells of the Emperor
						Francis carefully cutting the seal off dispatches from Napoleon for his Minister, and then “rubbing it against his
						clothes, smelling it, and giving it its due praise. The eagle was well done, the sword perfect” (<name ref="#HobhouseJohnCam" type="person">Hobhouse</name> I: 52-3). He tells of how Napoleon “never would pronounce the
						word Kaluga” (a key site in the retreat from Moscow), “but called it sometimes Caligula, sometimes
						Salamanca,” and how “[h]is attendants, who knew what he meant, went on writing or listening without making any
						remark” (53). And he tells of how he was there during the retreat from Moscow (“as the reader of any given five
						pages of his writing will not fail to discover” [<name ref="#JamesHenry" type="person">James</name> 188]), and of how
						during the retreat “the soldiers burst into tears” (54).</p>
<p>In this encounter in the box at La Scala, the stranger who is being introduced is well-known at a distance but can still be
						introduced into a relatively closed circle, according to traditional social protocols. As such, the encounter dramatizes a
						transitional moment in the history of celebrity, which is the transition between the domain of the social and what <name ref="#RojekChris" type="person">Chris Rojek</name> refers to as the “para-social”, interactions that occur at
						a social distance with people we don't know (<name ref="#RojekChris" type="person">Rojek</name> 52). This is not strictly an
						interface between the poet and the anonymous public, for the box of M. de Brême is a kind of liminal space between the
						traditional, known audience of social equals, and the wider, anonymous public that literature is moving towards. It is an
						extremely privileged social space, too, that mixes old social class and old money. As <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> observed, “A box at La Scala is treated as freehold property, like a house, and may
						change hands for as much as twenty-five thousand francs” (<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>,
							<title level="m">Rome</title> 24-5). Indeed, after the original theatre of <name ref="#MilanIT" type="place">Milan</name>
						(the Teatro Regio Ducale) had burned down in 1776, it was the owners of the boxes who lobbied Archduke Ferdinand to build a
						new one, and it was the sale of new boxes that financed the building of La Scala to replace it. The box at La Scala
						emblematises the particular conjunction of social, economic and cultural power that M. de Brême embodied.</p>
<p>Not only <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>, but <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s poetry itself charms the box of M. de Brême, as their host M. de Brême points out: “So
						keenly are his works relished by those of his friends who know English that, without ever mentioning it, we are endlessly
						showing him our private admiration” (<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 206). This reserve about
							<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s poetry is maintained apparently even despite the fact that
						they have an Italian poet in their midst, “the celebrated Monti,” who “graciously recited [his poetry] for
						us,” and who puts “<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> ... in raptures.” So
						relished, so precious is <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s poetry that it has the power to
						become an object of the unspoken in this circle of socially elite men who count a poet among their number. They negotiate this
						desire, and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s charm, through feats of “private
						admiration.” Again, like <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> not daring to kiss <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s hand, we see another form of restraint in this meeting with
							<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>. As we've seen, celebrity culture works not always or only
						in terms of the spectacular displays of outrageous affection. It is marked, too, with the protocols of an elite social culture
						of discretion. And <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s discretion is rewarded. For, after the
						poetry recitation: “From that day, I passed almost every evening with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name>” (<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 197).</p>
</div>
<div n="6">
<head>VI.</head>
<p>In <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name>'s 1829 letter to Colomb, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> and <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> make their farewells at the
						end of a delightful evening. The recollection is marked by one last moment of self-deprecation, as <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> responds to <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s request for street directions: <quote rendition="#indent2">
<name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Lord Byron</name> asked me, as the only one who knew English, to tell him
							the names of the streets that he would have to pass through on the way back to his inn. It was at the other end of town,
							near the fortress. I saw that he would go astray: in that part of <name ref="#MilanIT" type="place">Milan</name>, at
							midnight, all the shops were closed. He would wander amidst empty and ill-lit streets, and without knowing a word of the
							language! In my devoted affection I was so foolish as to advise him to take a carriage. At once a shade of haughtiness
							passed over his face: he gave me to understand, with all necessary politeness, that what he wanted of me was the names of
							the streets, and not advice as to how to use them. He left the box, and I understood why he had reduced it to silence.
								(<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name> 196)</quote>
<lb/> In this brilliant moment, when <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> advises <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> to take a carriage, <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> fantasizes being <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s chaperone, and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> a stranger in need of protection. <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> declines his
						advice, and the anecdote ends as it opened with <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> reducing the box
						to silence. Another masterful Stendhalian ending that eludes closure: returning to the anecdote's beginning —to that
						“sort of solemn and awkward air” and that fraught form of silence that opens the encounter —the ending
						transforms this awkwardness by turning it into a moment of comedy.</p>
<p>But the story does not end there, for there are other versions of that evening that end more optimistically and keep the
						electrified company there despite <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>'s departure. Later that very
						same evening, as the 1824 letter to Louise S. Belloc recounts, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name>
						strolls with <name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> around the “immense and solitary foyer of La
						Scala.” This time, <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> is successfully transformed from
						stranger into intimate. Again, memories of Napoleon are the currency of this transformation, which is aided by the social
						lubricant of their mutual devotion: <quote rendition="#indent2"> I had the good fortune to excite his curiosity, in giving him
							some personal details concerning Napoleon and the retreat from Moscow, which in 1816 were not yet commonplace. This
							species of merit procured for me many strolls tête-à-tête, in the immense and solitary foyer of Scala.
								(<name ref="#LovellErnest" type="person">Lovell</name>, 197-8)</quote>
<lb/> Once again, the curtain parts, and the
						scene of the fan's love at second glance is consecrated. The supreme transformation of the stranger to intimate occurs as
							<name ref="#StendhalHenriBeyle" type="person">Stendhal</name> and <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> share “strolls tête-à-tête.” What we also note, as the curtains part, is the
						particular kind of social space that stages—and houses—this transformation from stranger to intimate: “the
						immense and solitary foyer of Scala.” This paradoxical figure encapsulates marvellously the transformative effect of
						celebrity as a mode of publicity, a mode of intimacy, a mode of public intimacy. That this immense public social space should
						also be nonetheless so “solitary” enables it to host and to hold and to bear witness to all the paradoxes of
						intimate strangeness that attend the meeting between <name ref="#ByronGeorgeGordonLord" type="person">Byron</name> and his
						enraptured fan of “a hundred irresistible impulses.”</p>

							<title level="a">Introduction</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">In recent decades skirmishes about how to read literature and
						culture have at times polarized critics, who find themselves identified, or
						identify themselves, with distinct critical dispositions toward either
						historicism or toward some version of poststructuralist writing, in particular
						deconstruction, supposed to be suspicious of historicism for espousing an
						empiricist, neo-positivist perspective on the past. What emerges from this
						standoff can seem comical or simply bizarre as one side imagines the other as
						its constitutive other, and as such productive of readings in which something is
						missing. Deconstructive and poststructural readers who ground their readings in
						philosophical argument and rhetorical nuance are at the very least bemused by
						the focus on detail in new historicist readings or the large gestures of
						cultural studies readings. In reply historicist and cultural critics find the
						lacunae in arguments from philosophical points of departure damaging to the
						lived temporality of writing and culture. Although this dispute animates more
						than one moment of literary study (it has become more marked in Victorian
						studies), its most sustained version has concerned Romanticism, understood
						variously since the 1980s as the disputed subject of new historicism and
						deconstruction.</p>
<p rend="noCount">Whatever else it is, Romanticism arises in a moment of
						extraordinary and divisive recognition of differences among races, peoples, and
						political programs. And at least since the 1980s, the era has remained the focus
						of critical dissent as deconstructive, new historicist and other critical
						arguments debated whose Romanticism was theirs. This debate has in turn helped
						to shape public understanding of how we read literature and culture now as an
						enterprise strangely and contentiously divided between thinking about the work
						of language or the character of historical difference as though each goal could
						be separated from the other. This opposition is strangely rigid, easy to
						caricature and, as importantly, easy to dismiss. What gets lost in this critical
						antagonism is the shimmer of historical and philosophical friction in
						Romanticism itself and in compelling Romantic criticism in the last decade.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<title level="m">Romantic Frictions</title> emphasizes this
						important critical turn, which supposes that the pressure of Romantic difference
						is as much historical and cultural as it is philosophical and theoretical and
						that it is ongoing in critical discourse. So positioned, these essays address
						the rub of critical differences as the work at hand as well as the work that
						Romanticism itself frequently performed. Hearing critical voices rather than
						taking stands, these essays stage frictions that make Romanticism engaging for
						modern readers, precisely because this era and its modern critics remind us of
						the value of difference as the work of thought in time and culture. The essays
						in <title level="m">Romantic Frictions</title> find in Romanticism what
						philosophical modernity has often found there: a disposition to recognize
						oppositions that cannot be squared or resolved precisely because they constitute
						the ongoing work of culture and writing. Such frictions are embedded in a
						shifting temporal moment whose inner complexity is similarly textured such that
						neither history nor philosophy assumes a master (and fictional) disguise. Both
						are instead crosscut and assembled in ways that sustain an inner friction that
						invites being read.</p>

<anchor xml:id="DuncanAbstract"/>Ian Duncan</hi>, <title level="a">The Trouble with Man: Scott, Romance, and World History in the Age of Lamarck</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">Sylvan the giant captive Ourang-Outang is only the most
						spectacular figure in an array of monsters, prodigies, and other anomalous
						characters who trouble the categories not just of culture, gender, ethnicity
						and race but of humanity as a species in Walter Scott's late romance <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title> (1831). Dismissed by most
						commentators as a bizarre effusion of Scott’s dotage, <title level="m">Count
							Robert of Paris</title> sets its scene decisively outside the
						developmental continuum specified for “the classical form of the historical
						novel” by Georg Lukács. Eleventh-century Constantinople is scarcely the
						scene of “our own” past, a setting that may provide “a concrete prehistory
						of the present” (<title level="m">The Historical Novel</title> 269). It
						is doubly divided from modern British readers: by the schism between the
						Greek and Roman churches, which cast Byzantium as the decadent shadow of a
						more vigorous “western civilization”; and by the Ottoman conquest of 1453,
						which cut off the Greek empire from the progressive path to modernity. J. H.
						Alexander’s new edition of <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris
						</title>(Edinburgh, 2006), restoring extensive passages that were cut by
						Scott’s executors, allows us to see more clearly than was hitherto possible
						the novel’s philosophical investment in alien histories, alien origins. </p>
<p rend="noCount">Among the passages published for the first time is a
						conclusion in which Scott acknowledges the unprecedented, experimental
						character of what is “probably the last of my fictitious compositions”
						(362). The quest for “novelty at whatever rate” has driven him to “lay his
						scene in distant countries, among stranger nations, whose manners are
						imagined for the purpose of the story – nay, whose powers are extended
						beyond those of human nature.” Scott’s prime example of a romance that goes
						beyond human nature is “a late novel . . . by the name of Frankenstein”
						(363). Scott had reviewed <title level="m">Frankenstein </title>for <title level="m">Blackwood’s </title>in 1818, and a new edition of the novel,
						revised by Mary Shelley, was published just over one month after he
						completed <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title> (and less than two
						months before its publication). On Scott’s own authority, then, this essay
						will read <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title> not as a historical
						novel but as a work of anthropological science fiction. Scott’s late romance
						reveals the link between the historical novel and science fiction to be more
						intimate than we might have thought, genetic as well as analogical, soon
						after the foundation of both genres (<title level="m">Waverley</title>,
							<title level="m">Frankenstein</title>) in British Romanticism. </p>
<p rend="noCount">The name of that link, “man,” designates the philosophical
						problematic of <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title> and marks the
						novel’s station not just at the end of Scott’s career but at the end of a
						century-long project of cultural modernization, the so-called Scottish
						Enlightenment. In 1739 David Hume had given that project a name, “the
						science of man.” By the 1770s it seemed as though history had become
						established as the discipline best equipped to realize the science of man,
						in conjectural histories of society, of manners and institutions, the arts
						and sciences, as well as of particular nations. It was the attempt to
						totalize these projects, to write the history of man as a species that laid
						bare a fault-line in the secular category of “man”—a fault-line
						constituted by its biological foundation. “The Human Species is in every
						view an interesting subject,” wrote Lord Kames in the preface to his <title level="m">Sketches of the History of Man</title> (1774): however, “there
						is still wanting a history of the species, in its progress from the savage
						state to its highest civilization and improvement.” “The subject of this
						volume is the History of Man, by which I mean, not what is commonly called
						History, that is the History of Nations and Empires, but the History of the
						Species Man”: thus Lord Monboddo, introducing the fourth volume of his
							<title level="m">Antient Metaphysics</title> (1795). These best-known of
						Scottish essays in the history of man as a species<hi/>are notorious
						for their disruption of the category they invoke: Kames for his argument
						that humankind consists of different species (originally unified but then
						marked with biological as well as linguistic difference after Babel),
						Monboddo for his insistence that the mysterious great ape, the Orang-Outang,
						is man in his natural state, lacking only the artificial acquirement of
						language. For these accounts, it seems, “man” signifies at once too much and
						too little. By the time Scott was writing <title level="m">Count Robert of
							Paris</title>, in 1830-31, the trouble with man had blown up into a
						scandal. Amid a rising tide of mainly French morphological speculation on
						the transmutation of species, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck had cited the orang-utan
						as a human prototype—not just a type of natural man but a figure for man’s
						animal origins and the mutability of species. Lamarck’s work was diffused
						across British literature by the controversy that peaked in the early 1830s,
						in endorsements by “Edinburgh Lamarckians” such as Robert Jameson and Robert
						E. Grant, as well as in refutations, most notably by Charles Lyell in the
						second volume of <title level="m">Principles of Geology</title> (published
						one month after <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title>, in January
						1832).</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title> finds its imaginative opening
						in the contemporary crisis of world history and the science of man. Scott’s
						Constantinople swarms with different creeds, nations, races and species, in
						which the boundaries between nation and race and species, and between human
						and non-human species, shift and blur. The main figure for this
						boundary-flux is the Orang-Outang, who, among his other accomplishments,
						understands instructions given in Anglo-Saxon and kills off the principal
						villain of the story. The newly restored text of <title level="m">Count
							Robert of Paris</title> allows us to see that various forms of
						biological difference (including sexual as well as racial and species
						difference) are everywhere in play in the novel. <title level="m">Count
							Robert</title> earns its place beside <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, if we understand Shelley’s novel (following
						Maureen McLane’s analysis in <title level="m">Romanticism and the Human
							Sciences</title>) as enacting a radical critique of the “specifically
						anthropological discourse of man” that underwrites the newly-won autonomy of
						imaginative literature in British Romanticism. Scott’s Constantinople opens
						a new kind of setting for a new kind of historical romance: the cosmopolis
						or world-city as conjectural arena for the natural history of man. Within
						this radically heterodox imaginary space, <title level="m">Count Robert of
							Paris</title> explodes the monogenetic trajectories of national progress
						charted in the Scottish Waverley Novels for a fantastic exploration of the
						multiplicity of developmental paths and forms that humankind might take. </p>

							<title level="a">Field of History, Field of Battle</title>

<p rend="noCount">Over the course of the eighteenth-century, Great Britain built
						a formidable military power stoked in no small part by financial instruments
						devised not by merchants but by the state. "The ability of government
						administrators to establish the routine by which revenues were collected,
						money raised and supplies requisitioned," writes historian John Brewer,
						"could make the difference between victory and humiliation." The rise of the
						"fiscal-military state" strengthened both British military forces and the
						state itself to an unprecedented degree. The financial, even clerical mode
						of waging war gained extraordinary value over the course of the
						eighteenth-century; hardly visible to the public at large, their effects
						were felt more than they were seen. New modes of taxation and deficit
						spending "put muscle on the bones of the British body politic, increasing
						its endurance, strength and reach" (xvii). Brewer's magisterial account
						deliberately turns attention away from military exploits and heroes, even
						away from devastating violence, to focus on the driest aspects of a nation
						dedicated to its martial power: taxes, book-keeping, numbers. In doing so,
						his account translates a system of fragile abstractions into corporeal
						tissue, converting what might be dead matter—the bare bones of the field
						of history or the field of battle—into a robust "body politic." More
						curious perhaps, and a sign of the uneasy passage of numbers to bodies, is
						Brewer's acknowledgement that the fictive body is also a feeling one:
						"humiliation," rather than defeat per se, is the haunting alternative to
						British victory.</p>
<p rend="noCount">The figurative conjunction and conversion of numbers and flesh
						under the banner of war remains familiar. Harder to analyze in these verbal
						maneuvers is the level of sentience involved: what can the bodies born of
						numbers feel? The form of modern war emergent in the eighteenth century via
						taxes and debt financing is allied with other emergent regimes associated
						with numbers and finance: to what degree did the force of numbers amplify,
						dampen or otherwise transform the feeling body? If, as Brewer suggests, the
						economic repercussions of war in this period "are difficult to measure," how
						much more difficult is measurement when it tries to align what one
						contemporary called "the system of war" with the nervous system (xxi)? I
						would like to argue for a particular emphasis and delineation in the
						Romantic period on feeling numbers, especially among a group of
						reform-minded tinkers: Bentham, Godwin and Shelley—often in conversation
						with non-reformists such as Malthus. Heirs to and subjects of the fiscal
						military state, commenting both during and after the cataclysmic global wars
						with France that opened the new century, these writers unravel the neat
						allegory that Brewer paints, where the numbers of state finance and the
						cells of human bodies appear neatly woven together in the history of war.
						They employ numbers, by contrast, that tax the body to the point of
						disintegration so that, in fact, only numbers are left to register feeling. </p>
<p rend="noCount">Following recent critical studies on numbers and finance
						capital by Mary Poovey and Ian Baucom; and studies of the history of affect,
						I consider Romantic debates on the numbers of war, and how reformists
						developed philosophical and rhetorical instruments to convert a system of
						value so closely associated with and productive of imperial warfare, into a
						system of feeling numbers that resists and works to disintegrate the fiction
						of the robust body politic. My aim is less to show how these writers argued
						against the system of numbers, but rather how they embraced and
						reconstituted numbers, insisting on the correspondence between pained and
						suffering bodies and state accounting, pushing that correspondence for its
						affective yield. In these cases, it is difficult and perhaps
						counter-productive to decide whether the appeal to numbers by opponents of
						the "war system" can be read as irony or complicity. "In the scale of just
						calculation," observes James Callender, a reformist forced to leave Britain
						for his criticism of Britain's war policies, "the most valuable commodity,
						next to human blood, is money." In his tirade against the "war system,"
						Callender literally seethes with numbers. Here is just his concluding
						flourish: “The question to be decided is, are we to proceed with the war
						system? Are we, in the progress of the nineteenth-century, to embrace five
						thousand fresh taxes, to squander a second five hundred millions sterling,
						and to extirpate twenty millions of people?” (8) The question that motivates
						my essay concerns what "just calculation" might mean in this view of
						history. I argue for war as a particularly potent site, indeed, perhaps the
						most potent and generative site for friction between universals and
						particulars, between theoretical (or in this case, numerical) systems and
						those forces (in this case, feeling or affect) that accompany as much as
						they disrupt such systems. The putative "difference" between calculation and
						sentience may be more complex than conventional accounts of Romanticism have
						led us to believe, especially when we are asked to respond to something like
						an unembodied sentience. </p>

							<title level="a">Of Extension and Durability: Romanticism’s Imperial
							Re-Memberings</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">William Hodges’s <title level="m">Travels in India During the
							Years 1780, 1781, 1782 and 1783</title> (1793) is a text literally
						structured by war. Hodges’s travels and his narrative are repeatedly
						interrupted by armed conflict between the forces of the East India Company
						and resistant native powers across the subcontinent. The particular
						conflicts in question did not go well for the British and the humiliating
						loss at Pollilur not only raised questions regarding Warren Hastings’s
						bellicosity, but also haunted representations of British rule in India until
						the final defeat of Tipu Sultan in 1799. In spite of the fact that the
							<title level="m">Travels</title> appears to be a pro-Hastings document,
						published in London at the turning point in the impeachment proceedings
						against the former Governor-General of Bengal, the narrative disjunctions
						instantiated by these conflicts destabilize Hodges’s explicit argument that
						British governance in the region is not only benevolent, but also far
						superior to prior examples of Moslem rule. The aim of this paper is to
						demonstrate how the text’s figural economy–both textual and visual–attempts
						to ameliorate the narrative disjunctions which everywhere threaten to
						disclose the Company’s precarious claim to sovereignty. Through a close
						analysis of Hodges’s figuration of good and bad governance in the region,
						the argument will isolate precisely how his–and by extension, the
						Company’s--historical predicament erupts into the text and call in to
						question the very models of governmentality figured forth in his remarkable
						rendering of the banyan tree.</p>
<p rend="noCount">Michel Foucault, in his essay “Governmentality”, defined
						“Government as the right disposition of things”. From the period immediately
						prior to the passing of the Regulating Act to the East India Company Charter
						Act, the hybridity of the East India Company generated significant
						controversy regarding the appropriate form and quality of colonial rule.
						Hodges’s text engages with this problematic by presenting figures of the
						right disposition of men and things. The most important of these, the banyan
						tree, is the subject of an extensive textual description and also one of the
						volumes most accomplished engravings. In the text, the tree offers shade and
						sustenance to all who come under its canopy and it is metaphorically linked
						to Hastings’s management of Indian affairs. Its vitality and above all its
						naturalness accrue to the governmentality of the Company and thus it
						ostensibly stands as a figure of prosperity, hope and stability in a time of
						war and economic uncertainty. It also stands in marked contrast to Hodges
						similarly iconic description of the ruins of Agra and especially of Acbar’s
						tomb later in the text. As ruins architectural traces of a similarly ruined
						Mughal empire, these descriptions ostensibly testify to the fundamental
						inability despotic powers to rule effectively. Akbar’s tomb is especially
						important in this regard because it is Akbar’s name itself, as rendered on
						the mausoleum that operates as the ultimate contrast to the banyan tree. In
						other words, a dead name, an almost Wordsworthian epitaph, figures forth the
						disappearance and obsolescence of entire period in Indian history and in its
						place, Hodges offers a living thing. What interests me about this contrast
						is that in both cases the historical obfuscations depend upon key slippages
						in the distinction between word and image, between living and dead, between
						name and metaphor.</p>
<p rend="noCount">My essay’s concluding gesture demonstrates how the visual
						renderings of the banyan tree and of architectural ruins attempt to contain
						or regulate what amounts to a crisis in figuration. Of particular importance
						is the way Hodges’s image engages with prior images, most notably in Picart,
						which link the tree to suspect forms of sexuality. At the heart of Hodges
						engraving is a resonant act of visual surrogation which figures forth a
						remarkable fantasy of phallic Company rule well before the East India
						Company fully consolidated its power in the region. In other words, one can
						discern within the relationship between textual figuration and the visual
						strategies of the engravings the kind of “wishful thinking” or self-delusion
						that C. A. Bayly has identified as a crucial element of British governance
						prior to and during the imposition of the Permanent Settlement.</p>

<anchor xml:id="RowlinsonAbstract"/>Matthew
						Rowlinson</hi>, <title level="a">Allegory and Exchange in the Waverley
							Novels</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">This essay will propose that for an historical understanding
						of Scott’s fiction—or Romantic texts more generally—we should read them not
						as representations but rather as objects of exchange that embody social
						labor. The historically specific forms of the exchanges in which they took
						part and of the equivalents in which their value was realized determined the
						texts’ formal traits, which when this determination is ignored have the
						appearance of unmotivated play. The essay will offer its critical practice
						as an example to show that by a formalist reading of Scott’s fiction we can
						gain an historical understanding of textual production in the years of
						British publishing’s takeoff into capitalism. This reading will attend above
						all to the topic of signature, to the differentiations of text and paratext,
						and to those of writing as material practice and as abstraction, both as
						motifs in the Waverley novels and as problems in their social production and
						circulation.</p>
<p rend="noCount">In Marx, capital is formally a moment of self-referentiality
						in the system of mediations that is a money economy. As capital money
						appears to lose the mediating relation to other commodities that normally
						defines it, and to relate only to itself in a process for which Marx gives
						the elementary formula M-&gt;M. The project of <title level="m">Capital</title>
						is to dissolve this appearance of capital’s identity. In discussing Scott,
						however, we are concerned with an historical moment at which that identity
						has scarcely yet been constituted. Scott wrote at a time and in a place
						where the money supply was in practice extremely heterogeneous and the
						question of money’s identity was a hotly debated topic in political economy. </p>
<p rend="noCount">My main theoretical claim in this essay is that the
						indeterminacy of the money form for which Scott exchanged his labor as a
						novelist is allegorized in traits of the novels themselves. I will make this
						case principally through a reading of <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>
						(1816), the third Waverley novel and one of the most playfully
						self-referential. In this novel the inhomogeneity of money and the
						difficulty of recognizing it is a recurrent topic; two of the novel’s
						subplots turn on representations of transactions in the form M-&gt;M as comedies
						of error. In one, the Tory Baronet Sir Arthur Wardour becomes the dupe of a
						German swindler, who in exchange for an investment of “dirty Fairport
						banknotes” promises him “pure gold and silver, I cannot tell how much!" In
						the other, Wardour’s comic foil, Jonathan Oldbuck, the antiquary of the
						title, pays in good money for what he takes to be curious old coins, only to
						find that what he has purchased, though old, is a still-current instance of
						Scottish token coinage. Money, far from providing a uniform standard of
						value, becomes the novel’s principal instance of irreducible difference. </p>
<p rend="noCount">Monetary difference in <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>
						certainly allegorizes cultural and political difference; elsewhere in
						Scott’s work, in <title level="m">The Letters of Malachi
							Malagrowther</title> (1826), written to defend Scots’ use of small
						denomination banknotes where the British system used coin, this allegory
						becomes explicit. The Scottish monetary system is defended not as superior
						to others, but on the grounds of difference itself. The frugality of a paper
						circulation that does not withdraw any useful commodity from circulation is
						explained as the expression of a frugal national character, formed by a
						harsh climate and poor land. </p>
<p rend="noCount">This essay argues, however, that the monetary difference that
						repeatedly disrupts exchange within the diegesis of <title level="m">The
							Antiquary</title> also corresponds to formal traits of the text that do
						not readily lend themselves to culturalist interpretations of the kind that
						Scott himself pioneered. The uncertain boundary between what is and what is
						not money in the novel is the expression of a specific conjuncture in the
						historical development of capital and also an instance of a general
						problematic of the textual boundary that pervades the Waverley novels, with
						their serial form, indistinguishable protagonists, and extensive textual
						periphery in Scott’s introductions, prefaces, notes and other apparatus.
						When money is represented in <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> as
						bearing effaced or illegible signatures the novel incorporates within itself
						another instance of one of its own formal traits, framed as it is by the
						long performance of his own anonymity that Scott carried on before finally
						acknowledging in 1827 that he was the author of the Waverley novels. These
						formal traits of the Waverley novels, I will show, are determined by the
						historically specific forms of exchange by which the value of Scott’s labor
						was realized and ultimately transformed into capital.</p>

<anchor xml:id="JagerAbstract"/>Colin Jager</hi>, <title level="a">Can We Talk About Consciousness Again?: (Emergence, Natural
							Piety, Wordsworth)</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">Talk about consciousness has largely disappeared from Romantic
						studies and, indeed, from literary studies more generally. As a symbol of
						this disappearance we might look to Harold Bloom’s edited volume <title level="m">Romanticism and Consciousness</title> (1970). While the volume
						was officially dedicated to the proposition that to talk about Romanticism
						simply <title level="m">was</title> to talk about consciousness, its
						inclusion of Paul de Man’s proto-deconstructive essay “Intentional Structure
						of the Romantic Image” in fact marked the beginning of the end of the
						association between Romanticism and consciousness. Sometime later de Man
						could retrospectively mark his own deconstructive turn as a break, however
						imperfect, from consciousness-talk. Noting the emphasis on “rhetorical
						terminology” in his landmark essay “The Rhetoric of Temporality,” de Man
						writes in 1983: “[t]his terminology is still uncomfortably intertwined with
						the thematic vocabulary of consciousness … that was current at the time, but
						it signals a turn that, at least for me, has proven to be productive.” One
						could note other similar turns at about this same time, not only within the
						“Yale School” and its turn away from phenomenology (Geoffrey Hartman and J.
						Hillis Miller) but also for example in Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy’s <title level="m">Literary Absolute</title> (1978).</p>
<p rend="noCount">Meanwhile, the historicism that has dominated Romantic studies
						for the past-quarter century has likewise had little patience with
						consciousness talk, which, particularly under the influence of Marx and
						Engels’s <title level="m">German Ideology</title>, it has tended to identify
						with “false consciousness.” The Frankfurt School, from Horkheimer and Adorno
						through to Habermas, has also been suspicious of consciousness, for largely
						cognate reasons. </p>
<p rend="noCount">The end result of these powerful intellectual movements has
						been to deprive students of literature in general, and of Romanticism in
						particular, of a vocabulary for describing what goes on in the mind as
						anything other than a series of effects produced by some other structure,
						such rhetoric, history, or ideology. </p>
<p rend="noCount">There are, of course, many good reasons to be skeptical about
						consciousness-talk, and this essay is not intended as a jeremiad. Rather, I
						seek here to remark upon an ironic countermovement in intellectual history,
						namely that just as consciousness-talk was disappearing from literary study
						it was re-emerging in the disciplines of cognitive science and analytic
						philosophy of mind. The result of this re-emergence has been an
						extraordinarily rich body of work—empirical and conceptual—on consciousness
						over the past 20 years: a rich body of work about which literary scholars,
						with one or two exceptions, has had nothing to say. It is that lack of
						conversation, the missed opportunity, which my essay dwells upon.</p>
<p rend="noCount">One immediate objection to any effort in this direction is
						that reintroducing consciousness will result in mind-body dualism, and this
						result needs to be avoided for a variety of political and intellectual
						reasons. A stronger version of this claim is that the Romantic writers
						themselves were anti-dualist, but that this fact went unappreciated until
						the advent of deconstructive and historicist criticism. Talking about
						consciousness again would thus be like turning back the clock. And yet
						almost all cognitive scientists and philosophers of mind writing today agree
						that consciousness-talk and materialism are not mutually exclusive. Indeed,
						this is precisely the issue around which much of the current conversation
						circles: whether a non-reductive physicalism is possible, and what it would
						look like. The mind-body problem, that is to say, remains just that: a
						problem. One implication of this claim is that it may be impossible <title level="m">not</title> to talk about consciousness. Any position on the
						mind body-problem (which would include virtually any theory of how
						literature produces meaning, as Knapp and Michaels demonstrated a number of
						years ago in “Against Theory”) is also implicitly a theory of consciousness,
						even if a strictly negative one. There is value, therefore, in getting such
						hidden theories out into the open.</p>
<p rend="noCount">My essay examines two approaches to the question of
						consciousness that have lately caught the attention of Romanticists. The
						first approach is a neurological one. The strong version of this approach is
						that because the mind is identical to the brain, consciousness is an
						illusion (though perhaps an evolutionarily necessary one). This is sometimes
						referred to as “eliminative materialism,” and it is a popular position among
						neuroscientists (Francis Crick, Christophe Koch) and some philosophers
						(Daniel Dennett). Alan Richardson’s <title level="m">British Romanticism and
							the Science of Mind</title> (2001), which argues for what Richardson
						calls the “embodied mind,” is considerably influenced by eliminative
						materialism. I will critique Richardson on the grounds that his
						neurologically-derived model cannot ultimately find a place for
						representation: a problem for any discussion of literary meaning, and (a
						larger claim) for discussions of culture in general.</p>
<p rend="noCount">The second approach is emergence theory, which has a longer
						track record (stretching back to the nineteenth century) but is currently
						less popular among cognitive scientists and philosophers. Neither bees nor
						ants possess consciousness, and yet a bee-hive or an ant colony could be
						said to possess consciousness; in much the same way, emergence theory
						proposes that consciousness “emerges” from lower-level self-organizing and
						self- modifying systems. Some properties emerge from a physical substrate in
						a way that cannot be explained from the perspective of that substrate (eg.
						from the perspective of physics), nor are those properties reducible to the
						properties of their physical parts. Emergence has one decided advantage: the
						issue of phenomenal experience (“qualia”) is a problem for eliminative
						materialism (David Chalmers calls this the “hard problem”), but it is not a
						problem for emergence theory. Thus emergence seems a more promising route
						for discussions of cognitive science and literature, since it makes room for
						discussions of representation and of culture, as Alan Liu has recently
						demonstrated in his consideration of Romanticism and creative destruction. </p>
<p rend="noCount">Emergence theory faces a problem, however, that eliminative
						materialism avoids: causation. This includes both bottom-up causation (from
						physical property to mental property) and top-down causation (whether a
						mental property can change the organization of its own physical substrate).
						Confronting this problem, Samuel Alexander, the late nineteenth-century
						emergence theorist, hit upon a phrase that ought to interest any
						Romanticist. The mystery of causation, Alexander wrote, had simply to accept
						with “natural piety.” My paper ends, then, with a consideration of
						Wordsworth’s “My Heart Leaps Up” in the context of emergence theory. </p>

							<title level="a">The Ruin of Things</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">"I see around me here / Things which you cannot see: we die,
						my Friend, / Nor we alone, but that which each man loved / And prized in his
						peculiar nook of earth / Dies with him, or is changed." </p>
<p rend="noCount">Speaking to the narrator of <title level="m">The Ruined
							Cottage</title>, Armytage perceives what Adorno and Horkheimer call
						“disaster triumphant”: the invisible and intangible things of the destroyed
						environment, or things which in their utter lack of specificity and waste
						define the circulation of sentimental value that the poem has traditionally
						been thought to sustain. Part of that value depends precisely on this waste
						or decay that the poem proposes; after all, these things are not simply
						ghostly revenants but half-material entities on their way to death. Like
						Margaret, like the broken objects outside the cottage, and finally, like
						Armytage and the narrator, all things break down in the disaster that the
						poem paints, and their differences are rehydrated by its lines of sympathy,
						“in spite of things silently gone out of mind and things violently
						destroyed” (Preface). And yet, if Romanticism has often been read as
						synonymous with discourses of humanism, personhood, and community, how
						should we read Wordsworth’s insistence that we not look away from the
						disaster, from things in their states of destruction <title level="m">and
						</title>difference? And more specifically, what would it mean to think of
						persons as different things themselves? In this paper, I want to consider
						the non-pathological and transformative effects produced by disaster—that is
						to say, how apocalypticism in certain Romantic poems is denatured or
						flattened out to the point where “disaster triumphant” expresses new forms
						of non-triumphal, wasted life that evoke different ethical versions of
						social vulnerability. I will work toward a ruined cottage as the place where
						Wordsworth explores the hospitality of dwelling in the rubble of disaster;
						in other words, disaster as not the pessimistic obliteration of
						enlightenment promise, but rather as a kindly reimagination of sociality
						without a future. </p>
<p rend="noCount">The spectral quality of things unseen echoes the commodity
						form itself which, as David Simpson has argued, describes not simply
						things-in-themselves but things as they leave the world. Although Wordsworth
						appears to be striving for a language of “thingification” in his scenes of
						disaster, he tries to think through a different kind of object relations
						that is not reducible to the logic of the commodity. The kind of interest in
						disaster that a poem like <title level="m">The Ruined Cottage</title>
						appears to evoke is not simply a rehumanization of our relationship with
						things in the world, but rather an unworking or <title level="m">desoeuvrement</title> of our modes of being, troubling the kinds of
						economies which shuttle persons and things between durability and
						transience, gain and loss, wealth and waste. I trace how persons live
						through and are readily thingified in the disaster, and why the desire to
						treat persons <title level="m">as things</title> becomes a necessary
						component of Romantic modernity—to re circulate persons in an aesthetic
						economy that cannot bear to possess anything, that treats persons as <title level="m">res nullius</title>, and would have us literally waste life. </p>

<head>John Thelwall’s <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title>: The Lecturer as
               Journalist</head>

<p> Why did the sixty-two-year-old Thelwall embark on the expensive and exhausting
               project of almost single-handedly writing and marketing a monthly periodical under
               the title <title level="m">The Panoramic Miscellany</title>? The venture only
               survived for six months—January to June 1826—and if readers during the
               1820s evidently gave it little attention, Romanticists and print-culture scholars
               have paid virtually none at all. Robert Lamb and Corinna Wagner, who include the
               first-ever reprints from the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> in their
               recent <title level="m">Selected Political Writings of John Thelwall</title>, remark
               that “There was a huge difference between this periodical and [Thelwall’s] earlier
               ventures” (4: 199). However, a detailed look at the contents of the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> along with Thelwall’s editorial policy, his
               discursive tone, and his relationship with readers and contributors suggests that
               this last journalistic venture manifests the <emph>continuity</emph> of his
               commitments to political causes, public education, elocutionary training, and
               literary criticism. The <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> represents
               Thelwall’s attempt to adapt these long-standing commitments to the new media context
               of the 1820s. Reflecting an awareness of the rapid changes that had taken place in
               print culture since the time he began his journalistic activities in the late
               eighteenth century, this short-lived publication opens a window onto a late-Romantic
               era notable for its experiments with print and visual media. </p>
<p>Although there is scant documentation of any historical and biographical context
               surrounding the launch of the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title>,
               Thelwall’s overriding motivation for starting the journal is sufficiently clear from
               his editorial comments in its first two issues, if not from the title pages alone.
               The <title level="m">Panoramic</title>’s sub-title—“Monthly Magazine and Review
               of Literature, Science, Arts, Inventions and Occurrences”—references another
               periodical publication: the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> to which
               Thelwall had contributed since its founding by Richard Phillips and Joseph Johnson in
               1796. In late 1824, Phillips sold the <title level="j">Monthly</title> and the new
               owners hired Thelwall as editor until November 1825 (Carnall 162-63). At that point
               they fired him and re-oriented the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> with a
               new series that was launched in January 1826. Thelwall’s resentment over his abrupt
               dismissal overflows onto the pages of the independent periodical he started that same
               month: the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title>. Several of the articles in
               the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> feature bitter editorial headnotes or
               footnotes emphasizing that these articles should have appeared in “another
               publication”—i.e., in the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>—in
               order to fulfill commitments Thelwall had made when he was editor of the <title level="j">Monthly</title>.<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="1"> See, for
                  instance, Thelwall’s remarks on the medical article “Distortions of the Spine”
                     (<title level="m">PM</title> 50-54) and on his own extended review of “The
                  Poetry of Miss Landen [sic]” (<title level="m">PM</title> 74-82). Since the single
                  six-issue volume of the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> uses
                  consecutive page numbering throughout, references in the present essay are given
                  by the abbreviation <title level="m">PM</title> and page numbers only. </note>
</p>
<p>The straw that broke the camel’s back was evidently a long article ascribed to an
               anonymous naval officer, entitled “Hints on the Impressment of Seamen,” that Thelwall
               accepted for the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>. Its publication was
               interrupted after the first two installments when Thelwall lost control of the <title level="j">Monthly</title>; even worse, that magazine’s new owners went on to
               publish an unauthorized continuation of it, an action that Thelwall must have felt
               violated his agreement with the author. Thelwall seeks to set the record straight by
               publishing the “Impressment” treatise in its entirety in the first two issues of the
                  <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title>. His outraged headnote and
               postscript, conspicuously signed “J. Thelwall,” suggest that he considered it
               politically urgent to publish the “Impressment” article and that this was the primary
               motivation for his decision to launch his own magazine. Thelwall’s honour demands not
               only the fulfillment of his commitment to the contributor, but also the rebuttal of
               the <title level="m">Monthly Magazine</title>’s “disgraceful” and “perverted” forgery
               with the “authentic article,” so that the author will not have to go to the expense
               of “republish[ing] the whole, in another form” (<title level="m">PM</title>
                  297).<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="2"> Nevertheless, <title level="m">Hints
                     on the Impressment of Seamen, by a Commander of the Royal Navy</title>, did
                  appear in another form: as a two-shilling pamphlet published in 1827. </note> At
               the end of the first issue of the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> Thelwall
               actually reprints some of the acrimonious correspondence that resulted from a final
               meeting between his son, his solicitor, and the acting proprietor of the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> in December 1825. Thelwall’s repeated
               references to “duty,” “honour,” “responsibility,” and “fulfillment,” “<emph>my</emph> correspondents,” and “<emph>my</emph> contributors” (<title level="m">PM</title> 146) leave no doubt about his sense of injury and
               helplessness over the decisions taken at the <title level="j">Monthly
                  Magazine</title> and his self-justification in starting his own rival periodical
               with the same format and several of the same contributors. </p>
<p>The contents of Thelwall’s <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> correspond
               very closely to the regular contents of the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>
               as listed on its title page for 1825. These range from the current “Topic of the
               Month” to literature and the arts (“Philosophy of Contemporary Criticism,” “Poetry,”
               “Review of the New Music”), public education (“Proceedings of Learned Societies”),
               and routine departments (“List of Bankruptcies and Dividends,” “Report of the
               Weather,” “Domestic Occurrences,” etc.). Contributors who followed Thelwall to his new
               journalistic venture include Mary Russell Mitford, medical doctors James Field and H.
               Robertson, meteorologist James Tatem, and the authors of the five-part “Egyptian
               Zodiac” series and of “History of the Captivity of a Russian Officer among the
               Turks,” another piece that Thelwall had previously accepted for the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> (<title level="j">MM</title> 60 [1825]: 384). Thelwall’s
               continuing goodwill toward his “old friend” Sir Richard Phillips, the founder of the
                  <title level="j">Monthly</title>, is evident in the special notice the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> takes of Phillips’s new publication <title level="m">Golden Rules of Social Philosophy</title>, to which Thelwall devotes a generously
               balanced review in the February issue while confessing perplexity with some of
               Phillips’s odder ideas, such as his vegetarianism and his infamous refusal to believe
               in the force of gravity (<title level="m">PM</title> 235).</p>
<p>In accordance with the journalistic practice of the time, nearly all the articles and
               items in the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> are unsigned or signed
               with obvious pseudonyms. This makes Thelwall’s deviations from the usual practice all
               the more revealing. Clear exceptions are the numerous headnotes and footnotes signed
               “Editor” or (occasionally) “J. Thelwall,” and the lectures on elocution included in
               most issues, each of which is identified in the title as “Mr. Thelwall’s Lecture.”
               Some of the “Original Poetry” is signed by Thelwall himself, and some of the regular
               pseudonyms used in the poetry department (“Ausonia,” for instance) seem to belong to
               him as well. He may also have followed the practice he used when editing <title level="j">The Champion</title> a few years earlier, of including original and
               translated poetry that began as “school exercises of the pupils of his Institution
               for the Cure of Impediments” (Thelwall, <title level="m">Poetical Recreations</title>
               243). Other pieces likely written by Thelwall himself are a multi-part series on “The
               London University,” reports on public societies and educational institutions,
               articles on political economy, the three-part “Tour thro North Wales,” some of the
               regular features including the agricultural reports,
               and—significantly—the literary-critical articles. Foremost among his
               acknowledged contributions, however, are the leading articles that begin each issue,
               which are signed either with Thelwall’s name or with a coded symbol consisting of a
               triangle followed by three dots in the shape of a second triangle (Δ <graphic url="../images/triangle_character.bmp"/>). As
               elucidated in Thelwall’s lecture on “Elements of Prosody” in the May issue, these two
               signs represent the “<emph>Thesis</emph> and <emph>Arsis</emph> of human speech”
                  (<title level="m">PM</title> 636): a long/stressed syllable followed by a
               short/unstressed one. Rhythmically (as a trochaic foot) as well as phonetically
                  (<emph>TH</emph>esis + <emph>A</emph>rsis), they stand for “Thelwall.” After
               beginning to use this cipher as his signature for the leading article, Thelwall also
               signs some shorter items with it as well. Interestingly, too, most of the repeated
               pseudonyms under which other <title level="m">Panoramic</title> articles appear fit
               the same trochaic pattern: “Civis,” “Cosmo,” “Thermes.”</p>
<p> Apart from such clues, the only indicators as to what Thelwall did and didn’t write
               himself are his frequent editorial comments on individual articles and the “Notices
               to Correspondents” pages at the end of each issue, where he refers directly and (it
               appears) sincerely to articles contributed by other writers, although without naming
               any of these contributors. The rhetoric of editorial headnotes and footnotes
               sometimes implies that Thelwall is <emph>not</emph> the author of a given
               article—for instance, when a headnote obviously singles an article out for
               praise (presumably Thelwall would not introduce his own work to readers as
               “invaluable”), or, conversely, when he explicitly distances himself from the claims
               made in an article by adding a critical footnote. The running dialogue that he
               carries on with contributors on the pages of the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>
               is, in fact, a characteristic and revealing aspect of Thelwall’s editorial practice,
               evident also in the issues of the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> that came
               out under his direction. Thelwall regards his editorial role as a sustained
               conversation with other writers and readers. The dialogic tone of his editorial
               interventions suggests that he places the periodical miscellany on the same continuum
               with oral media of communication such as public lectures, elocutionary training, and
               the educational institutions and debating clubs whose activities receive so much
               coverage in the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>.</p>
<p>A few collaborators and contributors are identifiable, including John Timbs
               (1801-1875)—antiquary, journalist, editor, and Richard Phillips’s secretary
               during his last years with the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> (Gibbs 386).
               But it is hard to tell with which sections Timbs assisted Thelwall, since they had
               equally wide-ranging and miscellaneous interests (not to mention the same initials).
               Mary Russell Mitford contributed one short story to each of the first three issues of
               the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> under the signature “M.” James G. Tatem and
               the physician and medical lecturer James Field, respectively, continued to contribute
               meteorological and medical reports each month, as they had done for the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>. Nevertheless, not only does Thelwall seem to
               have produced an immense amount of copy for each 143-page issue of the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> single-handedly, but his contributions seem to have
               increased as the magazine neared the end of its six-month run. Until April, he
               increasingly (and perhaps with increasing defensiveness?) refers to the overwhelming
               amount of material he has received from contributors, yet in the last (June) issue,
               which is also eight pages shorter than the others, there is little that can be
               reliably ascribed to writers other than Thelwall. Short of both contributors and
               readers, the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> also suffered from the lack of a
               reliable technological infrastructure. Thelwall frequently apologizes to readers for
               errors in production: the hasty and disorganized printing of the first issue, a lost
               manuscript of music criticism, his inability to attend theatrical productions in
               person and the lack of a trusty reviewer to send in his place, multiple mix-ups at
               the printer’s. The inclusion of such references serves to give the editorial voice a
               certain conversational immediacy and even intimacy.</p>
<p> In the competitive periodical market of the 1820s, Thelwall’s policy on
               paying—or rather <emph>not</emph> paying—for contributions differentiates
               the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> from some of its major rivals. According to
               Mark Parker, during the 1820s payments to contributors per sixteen-page sheet were
               made “in a fairly tight range across the industry”; he cites per-sheet rates of
               twelve to sixteen guineas (12-13). The <title level="m">Panoramic</title> confirms
               this pay scale with a rather arch mention in a regional report from Edinburgh that
               “Mr. C[onstable] is said to have paid Mr. Jeffery [sic] 700 £ for editing every
               number of the Edinburgh Review, and Sir J. Mackintosh and Mr. Brougham have sometimes
               received 100 £. each, for articles; and the lowest recompense for any contribution
               received and published, was 16 guineas per sheet” (<title level="m">PM</title> 441).
               By contrast, Thelwall reacts with high-minded disdain to potential contributors who
               inquire how much his journal pays for contributions. “Poetry, in particular,” he
               huffs, “when it is such as <emph>we require</emph>, will generally be regarded by its
               authors as above <emph>pecuniary</emph> compensation; and as for Critics—so far
               from hiring <emph>anonymous</emph> criticism by the sheet, we will take care that the
               reputation of no literary work whatever shall, in our pages, be at the mercy of any
               censor whose honor we cannot depend upon” (<title level="m">PM</title> 298). Only
               “authors of already established reputation” or those whose samples have passed a
               careful vetting might qualify for remuneration from him. Thelwall’s policy runs
               counter to standard industry practices, from the accepted pay scale to the
               near-universal habit of anonymous reviewing. While he may be making a virtue of
               necessity, by maintaining that poetry and criticism alike transcend commercial
               transactions Thelwall also sustains the image of his journal as free conversational
               exchange and promotes his vision of literary reviewing as a kind of honourable
               patronage that singles out worthy authors for non-pecuniary rewards and
               recognition.</p>
<p>Like many other editors during the periodical-rich 1820s, Thelwall writes on the
               topic of periodical writing itself. His leading article in the inaugural issue of the
                  <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> bears a title that is a virtual
               thesis statement: “On the Connexion of Periodical Literature with the Moral and
               Intellectual Progress of Society” (<title level="m">PM</title> 1). This lengthy
               editorial echoes the main goals articulated in the editorial preface of the first
               issue of the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> published by Richard Phillips
               and edited by John Aikin in February 1796. Their magazine was to “open new sources of
               entertainment and instruction for their readers,” to propagate liberal principles, to
               provide a forum for the “lighter exertions of learned and ingenious writers” and to
               publish genuinely good poetry—none of which was then being offered by other
               “Periodical Miscellanies” (<title level="j">MM</title> 1 [1796]: iii-iv). Thelwall’s
               editorial statement of January 1826 re-affirms these goals by analyzing how
               periodicals like the <title level="j">Monthly</title> have revolutionized print
               culture over the intervening thirty years. His defence of periodical literature links
               the proliferation of magazines during the 1820s to the “rapid march of mind” and the
               notable increase in refinement, morality, intelligence, and taste, especially among
               the middle classes. By contrast, only one generation earlier, middle-class tradesmen
               had eschewed literature and book-learning while they deemed card-playing and drinking
               more useful and acceptable recreations, and the only “wretched flimsy and ill written
               sixpenny magazines” that were then available were read by young women (<title level="m">PM</title> 1). When periodicals like (Thelwall implies) the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> entered this unenlightened marketplace and
               addressed a large-scale, middle-class, predominantly male readership, they joined
               with the newly formed public societies for learning, mechanics’ institutes, and
               middle-class universities in a grand mission of public improvement that is, in 1826,
               still awaiting appropriate recognition: “Of the powerful influence of periodical
               literature in forwarding the progress of general intellect, and the necessity of its
               agency to the end proposed, there are few, perhaps, who, even yet, have formed a
               proper estimate” (<title level="m">PM</title> 4). Thelwall refutes the idea that the
               brief information offered in miscellanies is superficial and displaces more profound
               scientific publications. Instead, he claims, accessible popular knowledge and serious
               research reciprocally support one another: <quote>It is the business of the
                  periodical essayist to remove this veil of mystery from science, to translate its
                  revelations into familiar language, and dispense to those who have more of thirst,
                  than leisure, or opportunity for acquisition, so much as they have time to
                  receive, or are prepared to comprehend. Is this a task for superficial minds?
                     (<title level="m">PM</title> 5)</quote> It is already evident from these
               opening pages of the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> why the aging
               Thelwall felt he had to find a way to continue the original mission of the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>. The <title level="j">Monthly</title>’s aim to
               spread instructive and amusing information along with liberal principles has only
               gained in importance in the climate of heightened media awareness and “march of mind”
               that characterizes the 1820s, a climate that periodical literature itself has helped
               to form. Magazines, according to this mission statement, are as important an organ
               for contributing to the improvement of society as the public lecturing and
               elocutionary training with which the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> goes hand in
               hand.</p>
<p>Against the background of Thelwall’s attempt to sustain the <title level="j">Monthly
                  Magazine</title>’s original principles, however, the changes he does make stand
               out in greater relief. First of all, the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> expands
               and highlights its national and international scope. Whereas the 1825 <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title> represents itself simply as published in London
               by “Geo. B. Whittaker,” the title page of the <title level="m">Panoramic
                  Miscellany</title> lists a much wider geographical range of establishments where
               it can be obtained, not only in London but in Glasgow, Paris, Boulogne-sur-Mer, and
               “all booksellers in town and country.”<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="3"> Judith
                  Thompson (in private e-mail correspondence) has identified Thelwall’s primary contacts in these locations as friends
                  who hosted him in Glasgow in 1804; Maury Duval, the proprietor of the <emph>Dépôt
                     Bibliographique</emph>, whom he visited more than once in Paris; and his wife
                  Cecil’s sister in Boulogne-sur-Mer. My thanks also to Judith Thompson for
                  information about Cecil Thelwall’s likely knowledge of Italian. </note> According
               to its title page, too, the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> maintains a special
               commitment to “the Science and Literature of Italy.” Why? In the absence of further
               evidence that Thelwall became an Italophile later in his life or that he had a
               collaborator with special Italian interests, it looks very much like an attempt to
               make the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> popular with readers (even if Thelwall’s
               opening editorial eschews “the cheap expedient of ministering to the caprice of
               fashion” [<title level="m">PM</title> 3]). London in the mid-1820s saw a remarkable
               spike of interest in things Italian, documented for instance in rival publications
               such as Colburn’s <title level="j">New Monthly Magazine</title> and <title level="j">Knight’s Quarterly</title>. No doubt this interest was fuelled by the presence of
               a significant intellectual and artistic community of Italian expatriates exiled from
               Italy after 1820 due to the events of the early Risorgimento. The advertisement for
               Italian literature on the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>’s title page is amply
               borne out by the “Letters on Italian Literature” included in each of the six issues,
               which are advertised as “Translated from original communications.” It is likely that
               Thelwall—or his wife Cecil—is at least the translator of these essays
               even if they originate from an Italian correspondent, perhaps a contact in the
               expatriate community. Moreover, the “Original Poetry” section often contains
               translations of Italian verse and other contributions with the by-line “Ausonia”
               (i.e., “Italy”). One of “Ausonia”’s contributions to the March issue, a “Sonnet to
               L.E.L.” that follows up Thelwall’s review of Letitia Landon’s poetry that appeared in
               the January issue, makes it very likely that Ausonia is either John or Cecil
               Thelwall.</p>
<p> The <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> also features expanded links to
               European culture through partnerships with French periodicals. Among the places where
               the magazine can be obtained, the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>’s title page
               lists one foreign outlet: “the Bureau of the Revue Encyclopédique, Paris.” A
               consistent dialogue with the <title level="j">Revue Encyclopédique</title> is evident
               throughout the <title level="j">Panoramic</title>’s run. Most issues contain at least
               one article that is translated from the French journal. At the end of the April
               issue, Thelwall gratefully acknowledges a favourable notice of his <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> in the <title level="j">Revue
               Encyclopédique</title>, and reciprocates by calling the <title level="j">Revue</title> “the first literary journal of Europe” (<title level="m">PM</title>
               586). In the January issue, Thelwall mentions an intended agreement with another new
               French journal, the <title level="j">Athénée Britannique</title> (published in Paris
               and London), for “reciprocation of intelligence and communications” (<title level="m">PM</title> 130), although there is no further evidence of how active this
               exchange turned out to be. The first issue of the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>
               also received a favourable review in the London-based French-language periodical
                  <title level="j">Le Mercure de Londres</title>, as did Thelwall himself for being
               “l’un des hommes le plus recommandable que posséde [sic] l’Angleterre” (<title level="j">Mercure</title> 1, no. 5 [25 March 1826]: 73).</p>
<p> Favouring these Italian and French connections, the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> maintains other international interests, regularly reviewing
               literature from across Europe and featuring articles on Spanish history and culture,
               Danish superstitions, the climate of France, new developments in engineering and
               statistical surveys throughout the world, and regular attention to India and Burma
               (the latter no doubt because of the ongoing Anglo-Burmese War). Revealingly, though,
               the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> does not assume any knowledge of foreign
               languages on the part of its readers, but conscientiously provides English
               translations of every non-English text or phrase, however brief, that appears in its
               pages. This practice seems to reflect a dedication to accessibility and a target
               audience among male middle- and working-class readers who are not expected to have an
               education in either modern or classical languages.</p>
<p>These international exchanges are one aspect of a dialogic orientation in Thelwall’s
               journalism that is worth exploring further in the context of the 1820s media
               environment. In his study <title level="m">Literary Magazines and British
                  Romanticism</title>, Mark Parker convincingly identifies fundamentally different
               orientations in some of the decade’s leading periodicals. He demonstrates, for
               instance, that the <title level="j">London Magazine</title> manifests a “bias . . .
               toward representation” while <title level="j">Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</title>
               is biased “toward performance” (135). By comparison, the fundamental rhetorical bias
               of the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> seems best described as the
               pedagogical mode of <emph>lecture-discussion</emph>. When applied to Thelwall’s
               journalism, this means that he as editor persistently gestures toward conversational
               exchange with contributors, correspondents, and readers. Yet he maintains a
               controlling role in the conversation: his voice is that of the lecturer who initiates
               topics and frames the contributions of others by claiming the last word. Thelwall’s
               editorial stance thus differs from that of Phillips’s <title level="j">Monthly
                  Magazine</title>, which, as Jon Klancher writes, used the “‘original
               correspondence’ format” to “collect[ ] readers and writers as
                  <emph>interchangeable</emph> participants” (39, italics added). It differs also
               from contemporaneous experiments with group or coterie publication, such as <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title> or its London-based imitator, the short-lived <title level="j">Knight’s Quarterly</title>. The <title level="m">Panoramic
                  Miscellany</title> offers an alternative model of unequal dialogue—not among
               a coterie of editors, writers, and readers, but between a pedagogically-inclined
               editor and his reader-learners.</p>
<p>More than other magazines of the 1820s, the <title level="m">Panoramic
                  Miscellany</title> privileges the public lecture as a form of communication.
               Thelwall’s own lectures on elocution form the centerpiece of most of the issues.
               Several of the other articles in the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> are printed
               versions of lectures delivered in London or elsewhere, and the “Proceedings of
               learned societies” section contains brief eyewitness reports of further lectures.
               Some of Thelwall’s articles, particularly his continuing series on “The London
               University,” include remarks on the practice of lecturing itself (e.g., <title level="m">PM</title> 504-07). Thelwall is also in the habit of constructing his
               articles as responses to other people’s lectures or speeches. In the May and June
               issues, for instance, he prints long excerpts from “Mr. Jacob’s Report to the House
               of Commons, on the Trade in Foreign Corn” and develops his own counter-position in a
               passage-by-passage running commentary. Similarly, February’s leading article is a
               running commentary on a lecture recently delivered by Mr. Banks at the City and
               Western Institutions, and in March Thelwall follows the same practice with a lecture
               on geological phenomena that was delivered by Professor Brande at the Royal
               Institution. The editorials become dialogues between Thelwall and the lecturers, who
               are thereby put in the position of involuntary “contributors.” Thelwall’s frequent
               interventions as editor of articles by voluntary contributors to the <title level="m">Panoramic</title> work the same way. He carries on a dialogue with other writers
               in footnotes or endnotes to their articles, in editorial comments that are often
               rather patronizing. The conversational tone of Thelwall’s periodical writing is also
               evident in the responsive relationship between letters from contributors and the
               editor’s replies, and in the editor’s direct address to contributors on the “Notices
               to Correspondents” page at the end of each issue.</p>
<p>In the pages of the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>, Thelwall resorts to a variety
               of tactics for trying to provoke debate. He includes brief queries on etymological
               questions—asking about the origin of the terms “Grub Street” or “John Bull,”
               for instance—that solicit involvement from readers. These queries of a few
               lines in length also mark an increasing tendency after the first issue—once
               Thelwall presumably got some of his initial technical problems under control—to
               fill in blank space after a regular article with a tiny interrogative, humorous, or
               thought-provoking item, then begin the next feature article at the top of a new page.
               In the March issue, such interpolated questions become more philosophical: “What is
               eloquence?” (<title level="m">PM</title> 315), “What are metaphysics?” (<title level="m">PM</title> 374), “What is time?” (<title level="m">PM</title> 306). The
               last of these queries also marks the beginning of a new mini-series consisting of
               brief items with the by-line “From the Manuscript Sketches of a Correspondent.” It is
               tempting to identify the “Correspondent” responsible for these intriguing sketches as
               Thelwall himself, for they reflect his lifelong interests in language, acting and the
               theatre, pedantry, and imagination—although, when one such item promotes “a
               little opium” as an aid to imagination, Thelwall appends a disapproving editorial
               response in defence of sober genius (<title level="m">PM</title> 761).</p>
<p>Another variant on the lecture-discussion mode appears in Thelwall’s literary
               criticism and reviewing, and here the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title>
               sets itself apart from rival magazines. The individual book reviews in the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>’s long “Review of Literature” department are
               completely unsystematic and vary widely in length. They clearly reflect Thelwall’s
               own interests; for instance, reviews of fiction and poetry are likely to highlight
               linguistic and metrical aspects, and substantial column inches are devoted to books
               on language itself, such as dictionaries, grammars, and philological works. In
               contrast to the reviewing style that was nearly ubiquitous in periodicals from the
                  <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> to the <title level="j">European
                  Magazine</title>, where reviews included lengthy quotations from the primary work,
               Thelwall quotes minimally and instead offers his own evaluation. This can range from
               long, section-by-section commentary on books that particularly engage his interest to
               a brief overview paragraph of ones he considers worthy of notice but lacks time or
               linguistic abilities to review in detail (for instance, books in German). Also
               interesting is the gender perspective of Thelwall’s reviewing and literary criticism.
               Among the books he singles out for unusually lengthy treatment are publications by
               prominent women writers: Letitia Landon’s <title level="m">The Troubadour</title>
                  (<title level="m">PM</title> 74-82), Mary Shelley’s <title level="m">The Last
                  Man</title> (<title level="m">PM</title> 380-86), and Joanna Baillie’s <title level="m">The Martyr</title> (<title level="m">PM</title> 665-68). Elsewhere in
               the <title level="m">Panoramic</title>, too, Thelwall explicitly promotes his own
               reputation as a fair and well-inclined reviewer of women’s literature. In addition to
               his characteristic mode of biased dialogue with male contributors, lecturers, or
               treatise-writers, there is a more deliberately pedagogical mode of lecturing
                  <emph>to</emph> younger female writers, who are nevertheless treated with notable
               seriousness and respect.</p>
<p> But the most striking reflection on gender relations in the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title> is the short poem “To Maga” that appeared in the
               first issue, signed “J.T.” and evidently addressed to the <title level="j">Monthly
                  Magazine</title>. In an extended metaphor, Thelwall figures this magazine as a
               beloved woman that he longed to make his own even though she remained for thirty
               years “in other arms,” then was “resigned . . . to shame” and almost ruined (i.e.,
               when Phillips sold “Maga” in 1824), yet unexpectedly given over by “chance” to
               Thelwall’s loving care (when he assumed editorial responsibilities for the <title level="j">Monthly</title>). Ignoring Thelwall’s tireless efforts to restore
               “Maga,” however, her new owners tear her from his arms, and he laments that she will
               now end up completely degraded: <quote>
<lg>
<l>They’ll deck thee out in trim array,</l>
<l rendition="#indent3">More gaudy to the eye;</l>
<l>But steal the inward worth away</l>
<l rendition="#indent3">That did thy charms supply. (<title level="m">PM</title>
                        84)</l>
</lg>
</quote> Thelwall says farewell to the <title level="j">Monthly</title> as he
               turns to “another love . . . To whom I’ll father-lover prove”—i.e., the <title level="m">Panoramic Miscellany</title>. Here, in lyric form, Thelwall’s emotional
               commitment to the <title level="j">Monthly</title> and its original values meets his
               judgment on early nineteenth-century print culture: running after “trim” and “gaudy”
               publications, the periodical press of the 1820s risks abandoning the ethics of public
               education and diffusion of knowledge that motivated Thelwall’s own journalism since
               the 1790s.</p>
<p>The dedication “To Maga” remains odd, though, and not just because of the inherent
               strangeness of figuring a magazine as the object of erotic desire. Denominating the
                  <title level="j">Monthly</title> with the feminine-sounding name “Maga” allows the
               conceit to work (more or less). Yet “Maga” must have been familiar to Thelwall and
               everyone else as the nickname, not of the <title level="j">Monthly</title>, but of
               another publication entirely: <title level="j">Blackwood’s Edinburgh
               Magazine</title>. Throughout the 1820s, <emph>Blackwood’s</emph> best-known
               contributor “Christopher North” used the feminine associations of “Maga” to figure
               his magazine sometimes as a coquette, sometimes as a virtuous woman.<note resp="editors" place="foot" n="4"> An instance that precedes Thelwall’s “To Maga”
                  is the editor Christopher North’s “An Hour’s Tete-a-Tete” in <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title> 8 (February 1820): 78-105; another example appears in
                  “Notices to Correspondents,” <title level="j">Blackwood’s </title>28 (July 1830):

               </note> Why does Thelwall make use of an image and a name that would inevitably
               remind readers of a “trim,” “gaudy,” fashionable publication seemingly contrary to
               his own principles? Paradoxes like these in the <title level="m">Panoramic
                  Miscellany</title> suggest the challenges Thelwall faced in launching a
               publication that would fulfill his long-standing aims yet be viable in the 1820s
               marketplace.</p>
<p>For his new love, Thelwall chose a title that married the well-established
               eighteenth-century designation “Miscellany” with the new nineteenth-century adjective
               “Panoramic.” First recorded by the OED in 1813, “panoramic” did not gain its abstract
               meaning of “universal” until after Thelwall’s lifetime. In the minds of his readers
               in the 1820s, it might have conjured up recollections of another recently defunct
               publication, the <title level="j">Literary Panorama</title> (1806-1819), but also
               direct associations with panoramas and other very current visual media. Like
               virtually all literary-cultural magazines of its day, the <title level="m">Panoramic
                  Miscellany</title> includes reports about the new visual entertainments in London,
               particularly the Diorama (<title level="m">PM</title> 252, 396-97), the Cosmorama,
               and the Poecilorama—a “variously coloured,” supposedly time-travelling exhibit
               at the Egyptian Hall (<title level="m">PM</title> 397, 445). The link between these
               “-ramas” and the title of Thelwall’s magazine is made explicit in the April issue
               when a correspondent writes in as “John Bull” expressing appreciation for the
               Poecilorama, but ridiculing its pretentious Greek name. “John Bull” notes that
               Thelwall himself appears to share the “Greek mania” that led him to use the “scrap of
               every day Greek ‘Panoramic’” on his title page rather than calling his journal, in
               plain English, “Thelwall’s Monthly Magazine” (<title level="m">PM</title> 486). In a
               good-natured response, Thelwall concedes the point. But he consoles his
                  “<emph>bluff</emph> correspondent”—and puts in a brief marketing
               plug—by noting that anyone who prefers asking at his local bookseller’s for
               “Thelwall’s Monthly Magazine” will surely be put in possession of the publication he
               desires. Still, the reference in Thelwall’s title to the very current visual medium
               of the 1820s, the panorama, seems indicative of his engagement with another live
               experiential medium of the 1820s, the public lecture, which continues to stand at the
               centre of his commitment to rational communication, education, and public
               engagement.</p>

<head>Biopoetics, or Romanticism</head>
<byline>

</byline>
<p>In his last lecture of 1975-76, Michel Foucault focused on “power’s hold over life”
               (239), and in particular the emergence in the nineteenth century of sovereignty as a
               power over life, rather than death, sovereignty as “the right to make live and let
               die” (241). As Foucault explains in the <title level="m">History of
               Sexuality</title>, “The old power of death that symbolized sovereign power was now
               carefully supplanted by the administration of bodies and the calculated management of
               life” (262), two “techniques” that Foucault identifies not in philosophy but “in the
               form of concrete arrangements” (262). Foucault’s insight has opened up the epoch of
               biopower, providing the terms and frames though which everything from sexuality to
               human rights can be understood as occurring in the aftermath of this shift in the
               very significance of life itself.</p>
<p>British (and French) poets writing at more or less the same time as the planners and
               statisticians who Foucault considers, that is, from the late-eighteenth to
               mid-nineteenth centuries, might also be understood to register a new significance of
               life itself. As Denise Gigante most recently has argued in <title level="m">Life:
                  Organic Form and Romanticism</title>, a preoccupation with life—in her case,
               understood as organicism, vitality, or nature—binds the poets we typically call
               romantic. For Gigante, the romantics were writers (like the scientists who are their
               contemporaries) “committed to defining and representing the incalculable,
               uncontrollable—often capricious, always ebullient—power of vitality” (3). This is a
               power that the poets also sought to categorize, calculate, and manage, if not through
               new forms of record keeping and sanitation, then through new uses of older tropes and
               figures. In this sense, poetry can be understood as another of the “concrete
               arrangements” or “techniques” of power for the management of life, another site of
               the power over life, like vaccination or the variety of emergent forms of public
               health to which he alludes. This is true both in a thematic and a strategic sense:
               literature of the period takes the power over life as a theme, but it also takes life
               as its object. We would have to look no further than a novel like Mary Shelley’s 1818
                  <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> to find a clear example in which all of
               these senses of life and power emerge. There we find that race, the question of the
               human species, education, the threat to populations, and the emergence of new
               projects in biomedical engineering are construed as analogous to literature itself;
               and literature (formed as a novel, but figured as poetry) emerges as a kind of life.
               Indeed, Shelley famously refers to her literary fiction as a newly formed life, more
               or less substitutable with and even allegorized by the life-form whose existence the
               novel traces. Thus <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> could be read as a vivid
               example of the analogy between what Foucault calls <emph>biopower</emph>
               and literary power—or literature as a form of biopower. Yet, that what is at stake in
               this convergence is a monstrous formation whose full frontal force never can be
               grasped suggests, at least allegorically speaking, the sublime impact—on poetry and
               politics both—of this new power over life.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="1">For
                  further discussion of <title level="m">Frankenstein </title>and biopolitics, see
                  the chapter “Testimony and Trope in <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>” in my
                     <title level="m">Romanticism After Auschwitz</title>. While most examples of
                  lyric life are not concerned with the species, <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> is a notable exception, as it is precisely man as species
                  and its future that is at issue throughout the novel. Furthermore, other
                  iterations of biopolitics, notably that of Giorgio Agamben, are not focused on the
                  question of species (or human as species), but rather of the human and its
                  political possibility and impossibility. For a discussion of the difference
                  between a power <emph>of</emph> life and a power <emph>over</emph> life, see Roberto Esposito. </note>
</p>
<p>One way of understanding this convergence—the more or less simultaneous emergence of
               life as the medium of political <emph>and</emph> poetic power, the
               emergence of biopower <emph>and</emph> romantic poetry—is as an historical
               or terminological <emph>accident</emph>, rather than a series of effects
               with a shared cause. Indeed, the romantic preoccupation with sovereignty (as lyric
               subjectivity) and poetic power as a vital force sits uneasily with Foucault’s account
               of biopower, even as it shares its constitutive terms. The lyric subject, at least as
               it is conventionally characterized, is a resoundingly individual formation, whereas
               biopower, in Foucault’s account, is administrative and neither oriented towards nor
               executed by the individual. Moreover, recent critics of biopower, including Lauren
               Berlant and Eric Santner, also have noted the flawed tendency to correlate the
               variety of conceptions of sovereignty (personal, political, and theological), a
               tendency that the correlation between romanticism and biopolitics could even be said
               to repeat.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="2"> See Berlant, “Slow Death” and
                  Santner, <title level="m">The People’s Two Bodies</title>. For an account of
                  romanticism attuned to the rhetoric of species and at odds with conventional
                  characterizations, see Alastair Hunt, <title level="m">The Rhetoric of Romantic
                     Species</title>. </note>
</p>
<p>Yet, following Foucault, we might go further and ask about the conditions that allow
               life at this moment to emerge as an object (both aim and concern) of poetry and
               politics, of lyric subjectivity and political sovereignty? Put another way, we might
               ask whether this is strictly a nineteenth-century formation or rather, a
               late-twentieth-century one articulated in and through a return to the nineteenth
               century texts and contexts that have been called our contemporaries?<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="3"> See Cynthia Chase, Marc Redfield. </note> Does this new
               preoccupation with the power over life simply occur in the nineteenth century as an
               arbiter of modern poetry and politics or is it a retroactive formation framed by two
               competing theoretical gestures belonging to the 1970s and figured through a past that
               it recasts even as it is conditioned by it? Is this the modernity of the
               nineteenth-century or of the late-twentieth century? </p>
<p>It is the very shape of this temporal knot that has led me, elsewhere, to conceive of
               romanticism as a <title level="m">poetics of survival</title>, that is, as
               preoccupied with and producing a condition of living on, while at the same time
               figuring and instantiating life as beyond or in excess of the opposition between life
               and death. In this essay, I wish to develop my earlier account in a somewhat
               different direction by focusing on the concurrent socio-political and
               rhetorico-lyrical preoccupations with making live. Taking seriously the shifting
               conception of life as the object of politics and poetics in the nineteenth
               century—and the initial articulation of this shift in the 1970s, the years of
               Foucault’s “Society must be defended” lectures, the publication of the first volume
               of his <title level="m">The History of Sexuality</title> [1976], and of Paul de Man’s
               essays “Autobiography as De-Facement” and “Shelley Disfigured” [1979]—I will argue
               that there is a correspondence between biopolitics and romanticism that is captured
               in this shared preoccupation with life, and that it is a conception of poetry and
               politics that is uncontained by the nineteenth century.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="4">“Uncontained” is Carol Jacobs’ term, see her <title level="m">Uncontainable Romanticism</title>. This point can be read to
                  resonate with one of Agamben’s criticisms of Foucault, that what he identifies as
                  a modern emergence, in fact has an ancient origin. </note> I will also suggest
               that this conjunction becomes an occasion to recognize life as survival, and thus to
               consider something about life that the various demographers and managers who appear
               in Foucault’s texts (and in his only cursorily formulated and digressive account of
               biopower) may not be in a position to perceive or comprehend, but nevertheless
               continue to expose.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="5">See the lecture of 17 March
                  1976, where Foucault apologizes for “this long digression on biopower” (254).
               </note> In other words, far from exhausted by Foucault’s account of biopower and the
               theoretical accounts to which it has given rise, a lyric consideration of life, one
               formulated in and through romanticism trains us to see beyond the management of
               species and populations and to recognize the excesses that biopower and its
               institutions inherently fail to contain. In other words, while it might appear from
               my opening observation that modern poets are managers, belonging to the same category
               as statisticians and public health officials, and that lyric sovereignty, insofar as
               it is focused upon making live, is a mode of administration, several examples suggest
               instead the undoing of individual formations by the very gesture that appears to
               contain it. These lyric examples show that life is always on the side of nonpower,
               and that its containment fails to sustain the newly formulated opposition between
               life and death that is at the heart of the shift that Foucault so compellingly
                  describes.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="6">Foucault is of course aware of
                  this uncontainment, and his example of Franco’s death “and the symbolic values it
                  brings into play” in the lectures on 1975-76 offers one example. <title level="m">Society Must be Defended</title>, 248. </note>
</p>
<p>In what follows, I will turn from Paul de Man’s formative rhetorical account of the
               lyric to Barbara Johnson’s feminist revision of de Man in order to develop my own
               analysis of <emph>biopoetics</emph>. Johnson’s consideration of a subgenre
               of abortion lyric fosters a rethinking of the modern lyric and its rhetorical
               effects, identifying a shift in its organization from aiming to overcome the
               opposition between the living and the nonliving (in other words, “making live”) to
               imagining a relation between mother and child, whether dead or alive, as two
               potentialities. This example is a clear instance of the intersection of poetics and
               politics around the question of life, and one that, like <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, dramatizes the encounter between biopolitics and
               romanticism. Moreover, Johnson explicitly shows how lyric apostrophe can be
               understood not only as the trope of politics, but a trope that turns politics into
               biopolitics. From Johnson’s discussion of lyric animation and its political—or as I
               suggest—biopolitical—implications, I turn to a poem by John Clare that offers another
               way of imagining the lyric and its relation to biopolitics. Clare, a poet known as
               much for his lurid biography, his use of local idiom and eccentric grammar, and his
               opposition to the Enclosure Acts that divided his parish, spent a third of his life
               in a mental asylum. By focusing on questions of animation in the context of a lived
               fiction experienced as a pathology, a debilitating delusion that kept Clare from
               living among others, I propose to develop Johnson’s reading of lyric apostrophe into
               a theory that further emphasizes the lyric rhetoric at work in the politics of life
               and making live. </p>

<head>I. A Fetal Address</head>
<p>Despite having written extensively on romantic lifewriting and on Percy Shelley’s <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, Paul de Man seemed to have very little
               interest in the question of life itself. Indeed, life, like death, for de Man is a
               linguistic predicament, and those texts that seem most preoccupied with life (I am
               thinking here of “Autobiography as De-facement” and “Shelley Disfigured”), are not
               simply “about” death or even the undecidability between life and death (recall: “one
               moves, without compromise, from death <emph>or</emph> life to life <emph>and</emph> death [<title level="m">Rhetoric of Romanticism,</title>
               74]), but about figures and figural language. When in his essays of the late-1970s,
               later collected in <title level="m">The Rhetoric of Romanticism</title>, de Man
               apparently turns away from organicist accounts of language (that is, language as a
               vehicle of life), he does so in order to turn our attention to the ideology of
               rhetoric (or literature) as a restorative, indeed indissociably restorative and
               privative, operation. Autobiography (or lifewriting) operates through a figurative
               movement that “deprives and disfigures to the precise extent that it restores.” (And
               returning to the example I introduced above, Mary Shelley’s <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> recognizes this in all of the scenes where the encounter
               between Victor Frankenstein and his creature, involves a series of faintings and
               restorations.) Although de Man focuses on Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Essays upon
                  Epitaphs</title> and Percy Shelley’s “Triumph of Life,” privation, disfiguration,
               and restoration in his account are not matters of life and death, an assumption that
               would remain within an organicist paradigm, albeit a negative one, but rather matters
               of cognition, apparition, and image. It is sensation, and the relation between the
               visible and the knowable worlds, rather than life and death, that are at the core of
               de Man’s observations. </p>
<p>For all of these reasons, it might seem antithetical to turn to de Man in an effort
               to track the relation of literature to life and develop a theory of <emph>biopoetics</emph>, unless <emph>biopoetics</emph> is only another name
               for figure, just as it might be another name for romanticism itself. However, despite
               his own apparent allergy to questions of life and his indifference to biological
               processes or political analysis on a grand scale, de Man’s understanding of
               figuration has laid the groundwork for other accounts of lyric figures (apostrophe,
               prosopopoeia) that take place in a more explicit relation to the politics of life,
               namely those of Barbara Johnson. </p>
<p>In her 1986 essay “Apostrophe, Animation, and Abortion,” Johnson draws upon de Man’s
               account of figure to ask whether “the very essence of a political issue—an issue
               like, say, abortion—hinges on the structure of figure,” and she goes on to wonder if
               there is “any <emph>inherent</emph> connection between figurative language
               and questions of life and death, of who will wield and who will receive violence in a
               given human society?” (<title level="m">World of Difference </title>184). The key
               word here is “inherent.” For figurative language, insofar as it relies upon a
               seemingly infinite capacity for substitution, is driven by the establishment of
               connections where there are none. Figuration is in this sense a matter of the
               non-inherent, or the inherent as mere substitutability. So, to ask about ‘inherence,’
               to consider the possibility of an essential and permanent relation between
               “figurative language” and “questions of life and death,” or to ask whether figure is
               the “hinge” that bears the essence of politics, including the politics of life and
               death, as Johnson does, is to suggest that there can be no politics of life without
               this poetics. Johnson’s task is to understand and track the meaning and shape of this
               poetics. Turning to abortion, Johnson conjoins questions of figure or poetic address
               with what Penelope Deutscher has called “one of the major nodes of biopolitics” (55):
               abortion. Johnson seems to ask, although not in quite so many words, whether
               biopolitics is essentially <emph>biopoetics</emph>. And while she will go
               on to develop her initial consideration of the inherent relation of lyric figures and
               politics into a speculative consideration of motherhood (“there may be a deeper link
               between motherhood and apostrophe” [198]), the theoretical landscape is such that she
               is not yet in a position to reflect directly upon the relation of biopolitics and
               biopoetics. In the mid-80s, when Johnson’s essay is published, Foucault’s various
               discussions of “making live” in the nineteenth century remained overshadowed by his
               much more substantial considerations of governmentality, the body, and its
               discipline. Thus, while Johnson presciently evokes the question of the relation
               between biopolitics and poetics in her discussion of abortion and lyric, it remains a
               question that still bears asking directly—one insinuated but not exhausted by the
               example of abortion and poetry addressed to unborn fetuses. It is also the question,
               I want to suggest, of the lyric itself. In other words, the question for us, as it is
               to a certain extent for Johnson, is how important—how essential or <emph>inherent</emph>—is life for the discussion of literary rhetoric (or poetry), and is
               this matter of life, rather than a programmatic attachment, not only a matter of
               politics, but in fact the political nexus of literature itself? Put another way, the
               question for us is whether life is the poetic nexus of the political? For Johnson,
               insofar as politics is a matter of power and power a matter of violence, the essence
               of any political issue is the question of life and death, of <emph>the
                  power over life and death</emph>. And to suggest that politics “hinges on the
               structure of figure,” as she does here, is also to suggest that it hangs on a
               rhetorical device that <emph>makes</emph> “present, animate, and
               anthropomorphic,” a device that, recalling Foucault’s account of political power,
               makes live. This figure, apostrophe, has a particularly compelling presence in the
               late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries and an afterlife in some unlikely
               places. For example, as Johnson shows, it is at work in the case of abortion, where
               the question of viability may not be altogether new, but it does become newly visible
               and, thanks to new technologies for managing the ends of life—from pills to
               respirators—newly ubiquitous. Now, as anyone even minimally familiar with the
               rhetoric around abortion in the US knows, a central claim on one side of the debate
               is the assumption of fetal life as having an unproblematic relation to human,
               speaking life, indeed of fetal life as rights-bearing life or as personhood. Hence,
               as Catherine Mills recently has shown, the use of 4D sonograms in antiabortion
               materials has as its aim the production of the fetus as a face-bearing entity—and
               person or personage. Here, political and poetic rhetoric, the rhetoric of persuasion
               and the rhetoric of tropes and figures, enter in to a heightened relationship. </p>
<p>Johnson begins by showing how lyric apostrophes, as acts of animation that assume the
               difference between the living and the dead, turn out to undo the very distinctions
               upon which they seem to rely. Her initial examples, drawn from Baudelaire and Percy
               Bysshe Shelley, relay scenes in which a lyric subject addresses an inanimate object
               in order to endow it with the power that will retroactively animate the very subject
               responsible for the address in the first place. Johnson reads these poems in the
               romantic (and post-romantic) lyric tradition in which a (male) poet undertakes to
               obtain a voice from the outside together with poems (by women) in which “the question
               of animation and anthropomorphism is…given a new and disturbing twist,” poems that
               “textually place aborted children in the spot formerly occupied by all the dead,
               inanimate, or absent entities previously addressed by the lyric” (189). Like
               Foucault, Johnson seems to register a shift in modernity’s relation to sovereignty,
               showing that an emergent structure of animation in the nineteenth century remains at
               the core of political thinking in the late-twentieth-century; and, like Foucault,
               again, she is interested in re-reading and re-casting an earlier emergence (which we
               could in both cases call <emph>biopower</emph>) from the perspective of its
               violent future.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="7">Agamben suggests that Foucault
                  doesn’t do this sufficiently. Also, Penelope Deutscher persuasively considers the
                  reasons why Agamben never takes up the matter of abortion—in part the complexity
                  of analogizing abortion and the Holocaust, an analogy which is the
                  bread-and-butter of the anti-abortion movement and something one would not want to
                  touch. </note> It is in these poems that a new, specifically biomedical
               uncertainty about the nature and meaning of the living and the dead emerges. It is
               also here that Johnson explicitly registers a continuity—or analogy—between poetry
               (the rhetoric of animation) and biopolitics (abortion). </p>
<p>Johnson begins her exploration of another lyric scene with Gwendolyn Brooks’ “The
               Mother,” a poem that, in her account, traces the disappearance and appearance of the
               first person subject, rendering the lyric subject an object of the abortion itself
               (“Abortions never let <emph>you</emph> forget”); the addressee of aborted
               fetuses (“I have heard in the voices of the wind the voices of my dim killed
               children”); and finally the subject addressing them, albeit through a citation (“I
               have said, Sweets, if I sinned….”). Even as a subject, she remains uncertain about
               their status (“oh what should I say, how is the truth to be said?”) and thus her own.
               Indeed, Brooks’ poem reflects a particularly complex case where in actuality she did
               not want to bring the objects of her address to life even as this animation is what
               occurs when she continues to hear the voices that sound only through her. Thus, as
               Johnson notes, “the poem can no more distinguish between ‘I’ and ‘you’ than it can
               come up with a proper definition of life” (190). This ambivalence about life and
               death is fundamental to the structure of apostrophe, and in this sense it also
               reveals what is at stake in abortion itself. Whatever our politics or rhetoric, from
               the perspective of politics or rhetoric, it is not clear whether a life that is not
               viable (an embryonic life) can be considered a life at all, just as it is not always
               clear whether a life, even if not viable, is anything other than a life. From a
               biopolitical perspective, like the one that Agamben offers at the end of <title level="m">Homo Sacer</title>, the fetus also would emerge as one of those lives in
               which the political and the biological have entered into a domain of indistinction.
               For Agamben, this would be only a particularly vivid example of a quotidian
               situation. The same could be said for Johnson, insofar as this is the structure of
               lyric, a structure upon which “the essence of politics hinges.” Yet, for Johnson, who
               approaches the political scene through poetry and rhetoric, what is at stake is not
               only the indistinction between political life and biological life, but political life
               and poetic (or rhetorical) life. Poetry and rhetoric supplement the place of biology
               so that the question of species, populations, and measure, that is, the objects of
               social science become a question for literary theory and history.</p>
<p>My point here is not to suggest that Johnson <emph>only</emph> registers
               life or death as a fundamentally linguistic (and hence nonhuman) predicament, as de
               Man does, but to show that her essay raises some highly specific questions about the
               relation of poetry <emph>to</emph> life and death, indeed the power of
               poetry (or language) <emph>over</emph> life and death, when it registers
               the poetic and biological questions of life as thoroughly indissociable. It is in
               this sense that what Agamben refers to as a “zone of indistinction” comes to involve
               poetry and lyric subjectivity; for lyric (or poetic or rhetorical), biological, and
               political notions of life emerge as indistinguishable. While Johnson considers the
               ways that the lyric, as an exemplary form of language, can repeat and re-enact the
               violence it aims to overcome, she also challenges conventional accounts of lyric
               subjectivity as they relate to life itself. Johnson not only argues that debates
               about abortion can be seen as debates about apostrophe and the rhetoric of animation
               and address, but equally that lyric poetry can be seen as part of the abortion
               debates—or construed more generally—debates within the politics of life. She goes so
               far as to suggest (while attributing this suggestion to Brooks’ poem) that “arguments
               for and against abortion are structured through and through by the rhetorical limits
               and possibilities of something akin to apostrophe.” And further that: “The fact that
               apostrophe allows one to animate the inanimate, the dead, or the absent, implies that
               whenever a being is apostrophized, it is thereby automatically animated,
               anthropomorphized, ‘person-ified’. (By the same token, the rhetoric of calling makes
               it difficult to tell the difference between the animate and the inanimate, as anyone
               with a telephone answering machine can attest)” (191). </p>
<p>For Johnson, this “automatic animation” that occurs within a rhetoric of address
               raises questions about the relation between what Agamben has called life and
               form-of-life. Agamben describes his task as completing and correcting Foucault’s work
               on biopolitics. He insists upon the ancient origins and specifically modern
               tendencies of biopolitics by reminding us that initially two words, <foreign>bios</foreign> and <foreign>zoe</foreign>, were used to designate life, and
               focuses on what he calls “form-of-life,” a life in which it is never possible to
               isolate something such as naked life, by which he means “a life for which what is at
               stake is living itself, in which the single ways, acts, and processes of living are
               never simply <emph>facts</emph> but always and above all <emph>possibilities</emph> of life, always and above all power” (<title level="m">Means</title> 4). Here, Agamben understands a form of life as separate from
               automation, repetition, habit, or prescription, seeing it rather as possibility or
               potential, a relation to the indeterminate and unprogrammed. Agamben distinguishes
               between this “form-of-life,” a life of reflection, and what is translated
               alternatively as bare or naked life, although even bare or naked life is not simply a
               given, but an assumed category. Yet, when Johnson suggests that arguments about
               abortion (about biological or sacred life) are structured “through and through by
               something akin to apostrophe,” and when she suggests that apostrophe <emph>automatically</emph> animates, which is to say that it is a power over
               life without intentionality, deliberation, or control, she seems to recognize the
               separability or division within life not as something that could be gotten beyond or
               resolved, but as the very structure of life, just as it is so central to language
               fraught between performative and constative powers. The distinction essential to
               Agamben’s insight is not at all essential here. This is the parallel of de Man’s
               understanding of death as a linguistic predicament, for now <emph>life</emph> emerges as a linguistic predicament; and Johnson suggests that “it
               becomes impossible to tell whether language is what gives life or what kills” (192).
               Johnson accounts for language or the lyric subject as displacing sovereignty,
               operating as a power to give or take life itself, rather than a power to kill, as
               under the older, premodern model. Yet, it is not because of this impossibility of
               determining the nature of linguistic power that there is a debate about abortion.
               Rather, what occurs in the sphere of politics shares a structure with—indeed is—a
               linguistic predicament. Johnson reveals that biopolitics, understood as this power
               over life, is indissociable from lyrical language as a power over life. Thus,
               returning to my initial questions concerning the concurrent emergence of biopower and
               romanticism as two nineteenth-century scenes of power as making live, Johnson’s
               simultaneous reading of the romantic lyric and <emph>its</emph> legacies
               with biopower and <emph>its</emph> legacies offers a clear response.
               Johnson’s reading of lyric apostrophe suggests that the poetic and political
               preoccupation with life is not merely an historical accident nor an occasion where
               poetry reflects the politics or culture of the age, but rather that this convergence,
               through Johnson’s reading, reveals the lyrical structure of biopolitics: biopolitics
               as a politics of apostrophe. In this sense, the politics that Johnson identifies
               throughout her essay is an unmarked biopolitics, which is structured like the lyric. </p>
<p>But Johnson’s essay does not stop here, for it challenges us to consider what happens
               when this is the case, that is, when politics and poetry hinge upon apostrophe and
               when making live becomes the operative mode of poetry and politics both. Johnson not
               only perceives the conjunction of poetics and politics, but also exposes the
               implications of this conjunction on conventional accounts of subjectivity. It is not
               just that abortion poetry offers a particular case, and not only that debates about
               abortion “hinge on a structure akin to apostrophe,” but she goes further to show that
               lyric subjectivity as a variety of subjectivity more generally has hinged upon the
               assumption or production of a life akin to the one ended in an abortion <emph>or</emph> survived in birth. It is this survival that Johnson reminds
               us Baudelaire flaunts when he opens <title level="m">Les Fleurs du Mal</title> by
               representing himself as a failed abortion, as an originary survivor. Johnson’s
               insight, drawn from her reading of Baudelaire, is that something like fetal or
               embryonic life remains the life of the lyric subject—even in its most
               quintessentially sovereign form.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="8">This is a
                  prescient precursor to Agamben’s account of the indistinction between the two
                  figures of exception: the sovereign and so-called bare life. See <title level="m">Homo Sacer</title>. Also, it is worth noting that Johnson does not distinguish
                  between embryo and fetus, a distinction that is typically linked to gestational
                  age. In this analysis the distinction is not especially meaningful as what remains
                  at stake is viability or the indistinction between living and nonliving which is
                  at issue whether the being is more or less than eight weeks in utero. </note>
               Lyric apostrophe assumes and produces the subject as fetal life. This is true not
               only in poetry like Brooks’ that takes abortion as its theme, but as the reference to
               Baudelaire and more generally to romantic and postromantic lyric poets reveals,
               “fetality,” rather than sovereignty, is the position of the romantic lyric
                  subject.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="9">See Agamben on <foreign>infans</foreign> and infancy. </note> Thus, just as Agamben considers the paradox
               of political sovereignty as positioning the sovereign and the exile in the same
               position of exceptionality <foreign>vis-à-vis</foreign> the law, Johnson, reading Baudelaire and Shelley
               after Brooks and Adrienne Rich, articulates a paradox of lyric sovereignty (which is
               also political sovereignty) as positioning the fetus and the (male) subject in the
               same position of fetality <foreign>vis-à-vis</foreign> apostrophe. </p>
<p>Penelope Deutscher distinguishes this fetal life from the so-called bare life that
               Agamben associates with biopolitics. For Deutscher, the distinction is a temporal and
               categorical one: the fetus is a scene of contested life prior to loss or privation.
               As she writes: “A consideration of fetal life does not fit the series [Muselmanner,
               overcoma, etc.], as it usually is not situated at the threshold of depoliticization
               or dehumanization of previously politicized or humanized life. The fetus represents
               the zone of contested and intensified political stakes around the threshold between
               what some would consider ‘prelife’ and what is to be identified as nascent human
               life, meaningful human life, and/or rights-bearing life” (58). When Johnson reads
               Baudelaire and Brooks, she identifies poetic life as a zone of fundamentally
               contested viability. Yet the difference between Baudelaire and Brooks, on Johnson’s
               reading, is that whereas lyric life and subjectivity in Baudelaire are issued from
               the position of a failed abortion or fetal life, that of the child, for Brooks and
               Clifton and others it is the position of a mother, albeit one who is not a mother, a
               mother of aborted or miscarried children live only within the space of literature,
               and a mother whose position within that space is at once always assumed and almost
               always denied. </p>
<p>In concluding the essay, Johnson builds upon this understanding to conceive of lyric
               expression beyond that of the fetus/subject. Spawned by Brooks’ poem as well as other
               poems of the same subgenre by Rich, Anne Sexton, and Lucille Clifton, poems in which
               the subject is figured as a mother who is both addressed by and addresses herself to
               her dead offspring, Johnson suggests that the entire history of the lyric—of poetry
               or politics, insofar as it is bound up with calling, is the repetition of a primal
               apostrophe, the entrance into language and subjection through a demand placed upon
               the mother who is called upon to make the child live. These poems that remember the
               stakes of apostrophe—poems issued in the voices of mothers addressed by children who
               may never have lived—also reveal the structure of apostrophic animation. They suggest
               that the hidden structure of the lyric and its mode of animation resembles and
               depends upon a mother who is almost always unremarked. Johnson seems to suggest that
               were we to recast our prevailing accounts of subjectivity, were we to recognize the
               place of the lyric subject as one not of infinite substitution (“men have in a sense
               always had no choice but to substitute something for the literal process of birth”
               [198]), but rather of unsubstitutability, we might find a path outside that of
               childhood (or masculine subjectivity). This suggests that we might come to recognize
               that the relation of apostrophe to animation is a relation to motherhood itself.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="10">For another account of the centrality of the
                  mother to romantic subjectivity, see Cathy Caruth, “Past Recognition: Narrative
                  Origins in Wordsworth and Freud.” </note> The risk of unsubstitutability of the
               sort that Johnson describes is not simply the loss of lyric power and the shift from
               a dyadic conception of apostrophic animation (making live) to one that recognizes
               that the lyric subject figured is a fetus is indissociable from a maternal subject.
               It is also one that opens up a space for another subject position: that of the mother
               who does not “make live” or who makes live that which she also has let die, even if
               she may nor have killed.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="11">These formulations
                  evoke Agamben’s account of homo sacer as a life that can be killed but not
                  sacrificed. See Deutscher for a speculative discussion of Agamben’s avoidance of
                  abortion in the <foreign>Homo Sacer</foreign> volumes. </note>
</p>
<p>On Johnson’s reading apostrophe emerges as a maternal structure: if the lyric subject
               is conventionally figured as a sovereign, and if rhetorical reading exposes instead
               that it is variously a fetus, embryo, infant, or child, Johnson aims to break the
               fetus-sovereign dyad by recognizing that what has not or cannot be said is that lyric
               animation is akin to motherhood, that we ought to begin to see the lyric subject not
               as a man or a child (which is to say a fetus), but as (or wanting to be) a
                  mother.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="12">Of course, Wordsworth had a strong
                  sense of the lyric subject as child. </note> It is as if our failure to recognize
               the lyric subject as mother has left us with a structure of animation that cannot but
               leave the subject a child whose viability and power is in question.</p>
<p>Johnson exposes fetal life as the life of lyric subjectivity as we know it. Put
               otherwise, it is this life that she reminds us Baudelaire already recognizes as the
               life of lyric subjectivity when he refers to himself as an abortion manqué. Yet, the
               lyric subject is a fetus only because we do not see it (or him) as a mother. Rather
               than an originary split in life, we have an originary question of viability itself
               (and with it the particularly complex question of rights) at the heart of the
               subject. Rather than operating like other techniques of power over life, and rather
               than a symptom of romantic ideology, for Johnson the lyric is the structure of this
               scene of indissociable power and contestation. While Johnson sets out to revise this
               scene by focusing on the relation of apostrophe to motherhood, in what follows, I
               wish to expand our thinking of apostrophe and viability by considering a poem that
               couples the poetics of life with the history of madness, a poem written by a subject
               who, like Baudelaire, often was figured as a child, and yet whose own lyric
               productions recover not a mother, but an asylum.</p>

<head>II. Apostrophe’s Inmate</head>
<p>I opened with the observation that the romantic lyric emerges alongside biopower as
               two forms of a power over life. Reading Johnson, I also considered how politics might
               be seen to “hinge” on the structure of a poetic figure, and further that to recognize
               this structure is to see poetry as assuming a life at the threshold of viability, a
               situation that further conjoins poetry with biopolitics, at least in the version
               articulated by Giorgio Agamben. In this last section I want to consider how this
               conjunction of poetry and biopolitics also leads to a further development in our
               conception of poetry, and how the lyric has a particularly direct relation to the
               shift from sovereignty to biopower. For Johnson the presence of the lyric subject
               indicates the absence of the mother, an absence that Johnson’s account of the lyric
               undertakes to remedy. This recovery of the (theoretical) mother—the establishment a
               position where she can speak and be addressed and the “achieve[ment] of a full
               elaboration of any discursive position other than that of a child”—might go far in
               alleviating certain forms of personal and cultural pathology. But if we were to
               accomplish this would it be the end of the story? While, abortion—its poetry and
               politics - opens up one especially crucial case for thinking about the poetics of
               animation and politics of life, the various forms of social abandonment and
               questionable viability fostered by animating acts, whether in politics or poetry,
               reveal another.</p>
<p>On December 28, 1841, Clare became an inhabitant of the Northampton General Lunatic
               Asylum, one of the genre of institutions that Foucault identifies with the management
               and restoration of the population.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="13">See Joanna
                  Ball’s discussion of the asylum and its commitment to a “gentle” system of care
                  and Jonathan Bate’s description of the asylum’s “liberal regime” (469). </note>
               Clare wrote extensively while in the asylum, where he went largely unmonitored. While
               much of his poetry of this period (he was there until his death in 1864) has not been
               preserved, an undated apostrophic lyric addressed “To Mary” is one of the hundreds of
               poems that survive. “To Mary” conjoins apostrophe and “lunacy,” exposing an inherent
               failure to arbitrate between the living and the dead or the self and another, as both
               rhetorical effect and medical symptom. It is this disorder that the asylum is called
               upon to manage, but like the lyric, instead sustains.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="14">On the intake form at the lunatic asylum, Clare’s condition is understood
                  as associated with and preceded by “years addicted to poetical prosing” (qtd in
                  Bate, 466). </note> Thus, if the institutions of biopower are structured like
               apostrophe insofar as they are oriented towards animation or survival, it is
               precisely survival or “making live” that leads to haunting, confusion, and enduring
               symptoms of madness. </p>
<p>Clare, famous first for being a <emph>poor</emph> poet and later, a <emph>mad</emph> one, archives this radical privation in a poem that
               strangely, even perversely, registers the effects of making live. Like the abortion
               poems that Johnson reads, what we have here is not simply an example of a personal
               intervention or an encounter with the personal as political, but rather a poem that
               bears witness to the lyric and the asylum as two scenes of managing life that both
               house and sustain a form a madness or haunting. In fact, the relation in this case is
               even closer than first meets the eye, for this poem, like all of those that survive
               Clare’s twenty-three year internment, comes to us thanks to its transcription and
               preservation by the asylum’s steward, William Knight. There is no remaining
               manuscript, only a transcript composed in Knight’s hand. “To Mary” is therefore a
               poem whose survival is the effect of the very institution called upon to keep Clare
               alive <emph>and</emph> separate him from the living; it is a poem that
               registers not the work of “madness and civilization,” but of “madness and biopower,”
               and the apostrophic or biopoetic structure of both.</p>
<p>Whereas Johnson’s reading focuses on the relation between political, biological, and
               poetic life, revealing the limits of the romantic figuration of the lyric subject as
               man-child, in “To Mary,” we encounter romantic animation not from the perspective of
               the mother, but of the lover who (inextricably from his persistent love) is also an
               inmate. “To Mary” is addressed to a girl that Clare loved in childhood, but whose
               father prevented their marriage because of Clare’s low social standing and fate for
                  poverty.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="15">For a psychoanalytic and rare
                  theoretical account of Clare’s love and poetry, see Sigi Jöttkandt, <title level="m">First Love: A Phenomenology of the One</title>. Melbourne: Re-Press,
                  2010. Jöttkandt recalls that Clare believed he was confined in the asylum because
                  of his polygamy. </note> While Clare went on to marry and build a family with
               another woman, Patty Joyce, he remained irremediably attached to Mary, as is evident
               in the journal that he wrote during his escape from his first asylum, which concludes
               with a letter to Mary Clare whom he addresses as “My dear wife.”<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="16">See the “Journey out of Essex” included in <title level="m">John Clare by Himself</title>, 265. </note> In the journal, Clare explains that
               he is told of Mary’s death, but that he simply does not believe it, complaining that
               “neither could I get any information about her further then the old story of her
               being dead six years ago which might be taken from a bran new old newspaper” (264).
               Clare remains convinced that Mary is alive and often acknowledges that he has two
                  wives.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="17">See the “Asylum Observations” from
                  Northampton, where he writes: “God almighty bless Mary Joyce Clare and her family

                  and forever – Amen.” In <title level="m">John Clare by Himself</title>, 266.
               </note>
</p>
<p>As an apparently conventional love poem, one that assumes and reflects upon the
               communion of a living lover and his dead beloved, “To Mary” evokes tropes of
               remembrance and loss, presence and absence. As a stubborn account of survival—of life
               beyond life and death—it also indicates the poetry and the politics that produces and
               sustains a life perceived to be unfit for society. What we have here is neither a
               scene of the mourning—fulfilled or not—of a maternal poetics (in which we would have
               to include Victor Frankenstein), nor a strictly political exclusion that reveals the
               new politics of public health. Rather, we encounter an apostrophic poetics in which
               making live coincides with a denial of loss, but in which this denial, this insistent
               animation, becomes unmanageable and emerges as a form of lunacy. Here poetry and
               mental illness converge not only through the instruments of lyric, but also the
               instruments of biopower that resemble them. In other words, the symptom and the
               remedy (if not the cure) are both forms of apostrophe. </p>

<p>The poem opens with the chilling announcement—directed at its addressee—that while
               the subject sleeps and wakes with Mary, she is not there. The poem candidly
               acknowledges the failure of poetic address to solve the problem of absence or death
               (“and yet thou art not there”), and likewise, the failure of absence or death to
               exhaust direct address and the presence that it remarks and effects (“I sleep with
               thee and wake with thee”). Thus, Mary is at once too resilient and utterly absent. We
               could say that Mary’s presence is the effect of psychosis or delusion, <emph>this</emph> is why Clare is in the asylum, and not just the outcome of
               lyric surmise; and yet we would be hard pressed to rigorously distinguish on the
               basis of this poem, between madness and poetry. In fact this confusion comports with
               Roy Porter’s hesitations about diagnostic readings of Clare, and Porter’s suggestion
               that what we call madness in Clare might not be madness at all, just as it might
               suggest that there is a deeper link between madness and apostrophe than we have
               hitherto suspected.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="18">See the essay collected in
                     <title level="m">John Clare in Context</title>. </note> This becomes a poem of
               madness (rather than passion and allegory) because of its history, because of
               indicators outside of the poem rather than internal to it. Or, put another way, it is
               a poem that reveals the conventions of the lyric to be indistinguishable from those
               markers of mental disorder that are meaningful only outside of poetry, rather than
               within it. However, in a case like Clare’s when the lyric becomes a vehicle for
               autobiography, and indeed in any autobiographical or testimonial text that relies
               upon lyric figures for its narration, what is at stake is not only the non-opposition
               between the living and the dead, but the emergence of that non-opposition as a
               pathology. </p>
<p>In a second episode, Clare describes an embrace that only can remain imaginary, for
               he fills his arms not with a body, but with “common air,” suggesting that it is both
               quotidian and shared, the stuff of life that signals in this case the absence of the
               living. And in a line that resonates with Wordsworth’s “A Slumber did my spirit
               seal,” admits: “I think and speak of other things/To keep my mind at rest,”
               suggesting that Mary, like Wordsworth’s Lucy, is “a thing,” that is, that she is not
               animate, even as the entire poem is organized around managing the opposite statement.
               Thus, in a third episode Clare is the object of Mary’s gaze, but a gaze that, far
               from direct or reciprocal, occurs only when she is out of sight, which is to say, <emph>always</emph>. The first stanza also concludes with an infinite kiss,
               a gesture whose possibility relies upon its impossibility and the absence of its
               recipient (or otherwise a death that it would deliver). As an exercise in the
               temporal logic of presence and absence, the infinite relation here is presented as an
               impossible one, one that we might also call literary or poetic. In other words, the
               power over life described here occurs only in and through poetry (or delusion): this
               is a life indifferent to certificates of birth and death, statistics, or populations.
               And yet, it is the very condition archived here, the very condition of a virulent
               apostrophe, that leads to the convergence of poetry and politics as two scenes of
               animation, for it is this condition that shapes Clare’s supposed inability to live
               among others and his removal in the name not only of his own survival but theirs as
               well. He is unable or refuses to distinguish between the living and the dead or, put
               another way, he is unable to choose to reside among the living, and by failing to
               choose life, by staying with Mary (or by attaching himself to the dead poets, like
               Shakespeare or Byron, whose poems he will “continue”), Clare registers a poetry in
               which the lyric subject is absorbed by a loss in the dramas of animation. And yet,
               this is precisely what all lyric poems do when they marshal the powers of apostrophe.
               What Clare’s poem then reveals is another scene in the emergence of the poetics of
               animation and the politics of life: a conjunction not only between romanticism and
               madness, but romanticism and the asylum. </p>
<p>Returning to Clare’s poem, we can further specify its experience of apostrophe. If
               this poem assumes the presence of its addressee, it also breaks the analogy between
               life and presence, absence and death. Moreover, unlike Shelley or Brooks, Clare asks
               nothing of his addressee, he merely describes his relation to her. (The nature of
               this description nevertheless makes it seem a creepy demand.) In a move that seems
               almost to concede, finally, the absence that the act of address rejects, a move that
               also evokes some of the moments of strange concession that occur in Clare’s journals,
               the poem leaves its addressee in a position of utter non-responsiveness, or to recall
               the line I noted above, she becomes a <emph>thing</emph>, the matter of
               this address, rather than its addressee.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="19">For
                  example, in the Journey out of Essex, Clare’s account of his escape from the
                  asylum, he writes describes his entry into his village and a woman jumps out to
                  great him. He decides she’s drunk or mad, and writes: “But when I was told it was
                  my <hi rend="underline">second</hi> wife Patty I got in and was soon at
                  Northborough, but Mary was not there, neither could I get any information about
                  her further other than the old story of her being dead six years ago, which might
                  be taken from a bran new old newspaper printed a dozen years ago, but I took no
                  notice of the blarney having seen her myself about a twelvemonth ago alive and
                  well and as young as ever.” </note>
</p>
<p>In the poem, the solution is not to turn <emph>to</emph> the addressee.
               Recalling that other sense of apostrophe or trope as turning away, Clare turns <emph>away</emph> from her (“I think and speak of other things/To keep my
               mind at rest”), whether for his own sanity or out of fear of humiliation.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="20">In this sense, the poem can be understood not
                  only to use apostrophe, but also to theorize it. </note> Still, the permanent
               presence of the absent lover archived in the first stanza is repeated in the second
               stanza where it is the poet’s memory that remains fixated, even despite the effort to
               turn away. Here, the <emph>subject</emph> becomes the <emph>object</emph> of address, but it is not Mary who speaks or whose voice he hears.
               Rather he hears <emph>of</emph> her through the whispering wind. This is
               the convention of Clare’s contemporaries, Wordsworth and Shelley, but also a
               convention that, as Johnson shows, Brooks reworks by “textually placing aborted
               children in the spot formerly occupied by all the dead, inanimate, or absent entities
               previously addressed by the lyric” (189). Still, what occurs here also differs from
               the address in the other poems, for it is not the addressee who speaks—directly or
               indirectly—through or to the wind; it is not Mary’s voice that Clare hears. Rather,
               the wind speaks to him in its “own” voice <emph>of</emph> Mary (“The night
               wind whispers in my ear…”). This apostrophe does <emph>not</emph> raise
               significant questions about the power to marshal life or death (Shelley) or about the
               sovereignty of the lyric subject as poet or as mother (Brooks), but exposes the
               subject’s impotence and haunting, rather than its ultimate power. It may be that a
               weak or triangulated apostrophe, like this one, an apostrophe that breaks the dyadic
               subjectivism of the conventional lyric reveals another poetics of life. </p>
<p>Clare reports to Mary that he hears tales told of her. She at once inhabits the
               position of the second and third person, just as he inhabits the first and second
               persons (“All sighing on, and will not hush, / Some pleasant tales of thee”). The
               tales are also the return of what the subject attempts to repress or conceal,
               figuring yet another scene of ineffectivity. Much as he tries to say something else,
               the tale of Mary can be displaced, but not extinguished; he can voice it or hear it,
               but cannot abandon—or be abandoned by—it. Put another way, the third stanza seems to
               describe a scene that might be one of revelation—that might expose the ghostliness
               and disturbance of this relation, as if he finally were to learn the truth of her
               absence and the mistake of his assumption of her presence. However, what is revealed
               here is instead another form of haunting. Still related to Mary, it is not she, only
               stories of her; her life and voice are now displaced onto the nightscape. In a turn
               that already begins at the end of the second stanza (“But soft, the wind comes from
               the sky,/And whispers tales of Mary”), by the third stanza, the world has become
               animated once more in a speaking scene that occludes the beloved. Mary’s absence is
               replaced by the “whispering” and “sighing” of tales, what Sigi Jöttkandt calls
               Clare’s “mary-ing” of the world.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="21"> First Love
                  119.</note> While the poem initiates with a lyric address, by the end, the subject
               becomes the addressee, and the addressee, far from disappearing, has become an
               object. While this is the case in “Ode to the West Wind” and “The Mother,” here we
               are left to ask who is addressing the subject? In this case we have not a mirroring,
               a reciprocal animation, or even a crossing of lyric and maternal animation. Rather,
               when Clare thinks and speaks “of other things,” when he turns from his beloved to the
               landscape, he finds not that he has turned away, but the very resilience of this
               passionate attachment. Yet who is attached to whom and how do we decipher a scene in
               which hyperanimation has riven subject and object, person and place both? </p>
<p>It is this excessive animation that leaves Clare writing from the asylum, and it is
               this mode of apostrophe that, like Johnson’s account of apostrophe in abortion
               poetry, and for that matter, de Man’s account of death (and life) as a linguistic
               predicament leads us to rethink the relation of lyric to life, apostrophe to
               sovereignty, for it is anything but sovereignty that apostrophe in this instance
               seems to wield. Yet, the risk of this non-sovereignty is that it remains tied to new
               institutions in which the nourishment of life and violence against the living are
               conjoined. The lunatic asylum is just one of these examples. It is the asylum that
               protects Clare from society, preserves his poetry, transcribes and archives it, and
               yet that also keeps him from seeing his family for over twenty years (from his
               commitment until his death). If this poem bears witness to a poetics of life that
               breaks with the dyadic model, it also can be seen to proliferate it, for when Clare
               describes the lyric subject as the object of address he may already, proleptically be
               describing a structure of reception in which his own voice becomes a “whisper” and in
               which is own poem comes to us in a double form, borne by a writer who is ultimately
               not the poet, and another listener who may or may not be its addressee: William
               Knight.</p>
<p>Johnson’s reading of Brooks after Shelley and Baudelaire allows us to witness anew
               the lyric structure of sovereignty—and to see in the place of the lyric subject,
               perceived as sovereign (Mill) or as mute (de Man) before her, a subject whose very
               viability is in question. My reading of Clare proposes another iteration of lyric
               subjectivity as it relates to life. The poem seems to rely upon another dyad; no
               longer mother (living)/child (dead) nor poet (living)/breeze (nonliving); but rather
               a more familiar encounter between the lover and beloved. Yet here, the dyad, while
               utterly intense dissipates into a scene in which <emph>nothing</emph> and
               no one can be fully recovered. Here, uncertain viability is shared between the poet
               and addressee; just as the power of over life is shared between the poet, his
               steward, and the whispering breeze. This whispering also returns us to the question
               of life. It leads not only to poetic fame or posthumous life (as in the case of
               Shelley or Wordsworth), but also to what Joao Biehl has called “social abandonment”
               or actual incarceration, to a life lived in the asylum. Indeed, behind the relation
               of lover and beloved, here, there is the relation of inmate and asylum. The inmate
               who suffers from a confusion of voices, a loss of his actual loved ones, not only his
               fictional lover, and the disappearance of his manuscript. Yet, a typescript and a
               place in the archive replace the absent manuscript, a freedom of mobility and
               protection from worry and poverty substitute for the loss of family and obligation.
               If these substitutions are forms of “making live” they also bear the structure of an
               apostrophe, like the one in “To Mary,” that sustains, rather than remedies a malady. </p>
<p>What kind of power of or over life is the lyric? Thanks to de Man and Johnson, we
               have seen how this power can be alternatively, even simultaneously restorative and
               privative, how it can refigure or transfigure the subject exposing the question of
               her very viability. Yet with Clare we see how lyric sovereignty dissipates into
               voices everywhere, and how the question of poetic power intersects with that of
               biopower, with the rise of the Victorian asylum that became this poet’s place. In
               other words, developing Agamben’s account of the structure of <foreign>homo
                  sacer</foreign> into a poetic claim, we also see how sovereignty and abandonment share
               a rhetoric; how the lyric is one manifestation of this rhetoric; and how, at least in
               this case, independent of an originary fissure in the meaning of life we have instead
               the birth of biopoetics, not a literary biopolitics or a biopolitics of literature,
               but a lyric thinking life itself. </p>

<p>In 1999, Brett Cooke and Frederick Turner published a collection of essays entitled
                  <title level="m">Biopoetics: Evolutionary Explorations in the Arts</title>. In an
               introductory essay, “Biopoetics: The New Synthesis,” Cooke outlines the theory of
               sociobiology (or evolutionary psychology) upon which the essays collected in the
               volume rely, and suggests that the aim of biopoetics is to “seek artistic universals
               and features that reflect our common humanity” (5). In establishing the term <emph>biopoetics</emph>, he explains: “I propose that we add the prefix
               ‘bio’ to the Aristotelian root ‘poetics,’ a word which describes the science of at
               least one art—there is no English term for the study of <emph>all</emph>
               the arts. Derived from the Greek word for making, ‘poetic’ also refers to our impulse
               to create beauty. We then nominate the term ‘biopoetics’” (6). Here, biopoetics is a
               name for the evolutionary account of aesthetics. This <emph>biopoetics</emph>, while in no way evoking <emph>biopolitics</emph>, as
               elaborated by Foucault, Agamben, and others, nevertheless shares with these
               approaches a focus on new scenes of scientific method. For <emph>biopoetics</emph>, in this sense, it is a matter of using scientific method to
               understand the emergence of art as a living thing; for <emph>biopolitics</emph>, in the sense offered by Foucault, it is matter of recognizing
               how the sciences of demography and public health, among others, obtain a new power
               over life and the living. Yet, the example of another, critical biopoetics, which
               this essay has sought to isolate, begins to tell another story, one attuned to a
               rhetoric of figure and to the question of literature’s power over life. By taking
               seriously the relation of lyric animation to the politics of life, we discover the
               example, not only of a haunting that poetry fails to manage (Johnson, Brooks), but
               also a mode of subjectivity at the threshold of viability and survival. For Clare,
               this is manifest as delusion and madness, as the failure to distinguish between what
               is living and dead and the emergence of the poetic subject not merely as madman, but
               as psychiatric object. If biopoetics in this sense returns us to Foucault’s
               biopolitics, then, it does so by exposing a new humanistic method. This is the
               inverse of the biopoetics formulated by Turner and Cooke. For rather than dismissing
               literary criticism and theory—whether in the name of natural or social scientific
               method—it reaffirms literary criticism’s uncanny ability to say something about life. </p>
<p>When E.O. Wilson, on the jacket of Cooke and Turner’s <title level="m">Biopoetics</title>, writes that he can see the methods proposed there “taking
               over from deconstruction by 2010, and permanently,” he advocates a methodological
               turn away from the linguistic and other turns that have marked humanistic method
               since the 1970s. As 2010 draws toward a close, the prediction seems not to have borne
               out. It is time therefore that we begin to recognize another biopoetics. Not the
               biopoetics of evolutionary arts, but of the conjunction of rhetorical and
               biopolitical reading. This biopoetics sets out, as this essay set out, by admitting
               two scenes of making live, and it concludes by exposing the impossibility of a
               politics of life or a science of literature that would be free from poetics.</p>

<head>About this volume</head>
<p rend="noCount">This volume of <title level="j">Romantic Circles Praxis Series</title>
					includes an editor's introduction by <ref target="#KhalipAbout">Jacques Khalip and David Collings</ref>, essays by <ref target="#JuengelAbout">Scott J. Juengel</ref>, <ref target="#KeachAbout">William Keach</ref>, <ref target="#MortonAbout">Timothy Morton</ref>, and

<!-- Long volume abstract goes here -->
<p rend="noCount">
<title level="m">Romanticism and Disaster</title> considers and responds to the timely
					concept of devastated life by thinking about how the capacity to read,
					interpret, and absorb disaster necessitates significant changes in
					theory, ethics, and common life. What if the consequences or
					"experience" of a disaster were less about psychic survival than an
					unblinking desire to face down the disaster as a challenge to
					normative structures? The essays in this volume attend to the
					rhetorical, epistemological, political, and social effects of romantic
					critique, and reflect on how processes of destruction and
					reconstitution, ruination and survival, are part and parcel of
					romanticism’s grappling with a negativity that haunts its corners. Put
					in this way, "disaster" does not signal a referential event, but
					rather an undoing of certain apparently prior categories of dwelling,
					and forces us to contemplate living otherwise. In confronting the end
					of things, what are the conditions or possibilities of existence
					amidst catastrophe? What is a crisis, and what kinds of challenges
					does it occasion? What can be philosophically gained or lost by
					analyzing disaster in its multiple sites, contexts, and instances?</p>

<head>About the Design and Markup</head>
<p rend="noCount">This volume was TEI-encoded by Michael Quilligan, a site manager for Romantic Circles. Laura Mandell transformed the TEI files into HTML by using modified versions
						of the transforms provided by the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</ref>. TEI renders text archival quality for better preservation and future access.</p>
<p rend="noCount">The image associated with this issue includes elements from a photograph of Mount Tambora erupting. The original photograph can be found at the website <ref target="http://www.themanyfacesofspaces.com/MFS-StrangeButTrue-Places6.html#anchor_31">The Many Faces of Spaces</ref>.</p>
<p rend="noCount">The HTML pages do not use frames but rather make extensive use
					of stylesheets for layout and presentation. The site works best when
					viewed with Mozilla Firefox v. 3, Netscape 4.0, Internet Explorer 4.0, or
					higher, or a comparable browser; earlier browsers may not display everything
					properly.</p>

<div type="section">
<head>About the Romantic Circles Praxis
					Series</head>
<p rend="noCount">The <title level="j">Romantic Circles Praxis Series</title> is devoted to
					using computer technologies for the contemporary critical
					investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and
					theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of
					Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge,
					<title level="j">RCPS</title> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world
					where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a
					period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on
					the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the
					intellectual and theoretical discussions of today.
					<title level="j">RCPS</title> is committed to mapping out this terrain with
					the best and most exciting critical writing of
					contemporary Romanticist scholarship.</p>

<quote>“<foreign>Mieux vaut un désastre qu’un désêtre</foreign>”<lb/>
         Alain Badiou (230)</quote>
<quote>Disaster (<title level="m">OED</title>): Anything that befalls of ruinous or distressing nature; a sudden or great misfortune, mishap, or misadventure; a calamity.</quote>
<p>In an entry in her journals about her brother’s struggles with writing <title level="a">The Pedlar</title>, Dorothy Wordsworth notes: “Wm very ill, employed with the pedlar . . . Disaster pedlar” (96). The evocation here of grievous embodiment in a figure typically defined as one of the hallmarks of Wordsworth’s literary personae gives rise to several perspectives that bear on the persistence of calamity in romantic thought. Dorothy elucidates a figure of and for imminent disaster that seems proper to the act of reading itself: enigmatically foretelling a disaster that Wordsworth in his numerous revisions of the Pedlar narrative had sought to control and shape, her words have the effect of bearing witness to an event she cannot fully know or summon into clarity. Much like Benjamin’s angel who looks back at the debris of history while being drawn forward into a future tense inscribed by the unknowability of the past, the pedlar is hallucinated as the promise of an exemplary persona whose task is impossibly to ameliorate the ruination that emerges in the witnessing or reading of the poem. Yet Dorothy's comment points to the undoing of this scenario, for the pedlar's potentially angelic vocation is disarrayed as he becomes a disaster, a persona that incorporates and transmits the horror of what he sees. </p>
<p>Here, text produces a referentiality that seemingly lives beyond it while at the same time seeping outward as an event that is necessarily tied to linguistic deferral.</p>
<p>How and why does a text generate this “necessity” of catastrophe? In Paul de Man’s classic essay, <title level="a">Shelley Disfigured</title>, the poet emerges as the material precipitate of processes of fragmentation, erosion, and drowning in <title level="a">The Triumph of Life</title>, which ineluctably participate in a canonical monumentalization of the poem that cannot be freed from the critique of those processes themselves (de Man). At once on the page and away from the page, the “body” of Shelley is what is different from language <emph>and</emph> posited by linguistic cueing—a phantom excess or catastrophic materiality that is intrinsic to the reading of the poem. Similarly, Dorothy’s reading returns us to the scene of disaster as both the future and present of a condition of reading and interpretation. In this way, the pedlar might very well signal less something wicked this way coming than a conceptual dissonance that implicitly sustains the life-world of romanticism and which cannot be accounted for. </p>
<p>	This optic suggests that the emergence of the pedlar is partly in line with the form of traumatism Derrida defines as the fear of the yet-to-come, or the possibility of some greater catastrophe ever about to occur despite the sense that it has already taken place. This hope, in turn, is not easily distinguished from Derrida's treatment of the messianic orientation to the to-come, hinting that in his work, as well as in the romanticism it inherits, the promise of a certain futurity is always shadowed by its catastrophic counterpart in a pairing that ruins the very temporalities through which we might attempt to manage disaster and its aftermaths. Accordingly, in the pages that follow, we have sought to think about how romanticism endures or bears with (a term central to Rei Terada’s article) the difficulties of defining <emph>what</emph> constitutes a disaster and what kinds of changes it can provoke in social, political, epistemological, and ethical life. After all, if disaster etymologically suggests a disorientation of place in relation to the stars, this loss of footing is less about a saturation in despair than a recognition of how the attending disappointments, reaction-formations, and imperilling states of disastrous experience might signal a vital rethinking of the untapped powers that lie amidst the ruins. The pedlar can be at once a threat <emph>and</emph> an invitation to stare a bit longer at the valuable consequences that lie in reorganizing ourselves to a catastrophic reality that is not meant to be withstood but rather accepted as our ineluctable present. </p>
<p>The possibility of exploring these powers of acceptance is not entirely new to romanticism; indeed, for centuries British subjects had taken for granted the necessity of enduring catastrophic events - plague, famine, flood, drought - as an inherent part of human vulnerability. Yet as the institutions of modern governmentality begin to emerge, such events appear more negotiable than before; the narrator of Daniel Defoe's <title level="m">A Journal of a Plague Year</title> oscillates between reading the plague as a visitation of divine will and a medical condition whose spread could at least be partially prevented through better measures on the part of the London municipal authorities. Catastrophic events, it seems, are in part cosmically given and in part subject to human intervention. Although a similar ambivalence remained in force through the romantic era and well beyond, the increasing confidence of medical practitioners, the growth in population, the shift toward a more secular and humanistic ethos, and the impress of Enlightenment demands for better governance cast new doubt on the necessity of disaster, giving a different tone to the collective response to destructive events. What might have previously been spoken of as an intractable dimension of divine will was now read as a potentially negotiable aspect of human biology or public governance; the recurrence of such events thus pointed either to the need for further enlightenment and reform or to a fault endemic to the public order itself. The fierce political debates that emerged during the famine of the mid 1790s, for example, shortly before Wordsworth labored on <title level="m">The Ruined Cottage</title>, debates that often invoked notions of natural law (as in Edmund Burke's <title level="a">Thoughts and Details on Scarcity</title>) or of common right to subsistence from the land (as in John Thelwall's <title level="j">The Tribune</title>), demonstrate how far Britain had moved into a secular, political idiom. </p>
<p>Yet the adoption of such an idiom inspired others to extend it, to ponder the systematic recurrence of general distress, leading T. R. Malthus to argue in 1798 that the "checks to population" - war, famine, and plague - arise from population's endless pressure to exceed the limits of subsistence. In this view, disaster is a symptom of a certain disorder in the biological preconditions of human life as such, a disorder that he attempts to recuperate as a spur to human labor and ingenuity, in the mode of a secular theodicy, but which nevertheless speaks of a new possibility - that the domain over which medicine, governance, and political economy sought to exert their sway might be shaped by a constitutive contradiction, a non-negotiable incoherence that no administrative effort could finally extirpate, a fault in things that shatters even a secular theodicy. By the end of the eighteenth century, it became conceivable that rather than consisting of singular events, disaster was endemic to the human itself. As a result, while the apparently rational institutions of the modern state promised to remove certain domains - subsistence, reproduction, and public health - from the vagaries of divine will, the persistence of collective distress suggested that those domains were subject to equally intractable forces now rooted not in divine alterity but in natural law.</p>
<p>A similar development took place as students of "the history of the earth" gradually articulated the elements of modern geological knowledge: by the late eighteenth century, natural disaster and vast extinction, rather than being exceptional events, were conceived as taking place frequently across the immense reaches of earth's history. Indeed, as Scott Juengel suggests, Malthus may not entirely be a theorist of catastrophe due to his avoidance of the exception in favor of “a mathematical horizon and the inevitability of time and instinct.” This awareness confronted late-eighteenth century people with a systematic catastrophe even less tractable than demographic crisis, less amenable to governmental intervention. If on some level geological crises could be explained with reference to fundamental natural laws, on another they revealed a primal fault in the preconditions of human life, creating another obstacle to the formation of a secular theodicy. Enlightenment investigation, in short, ultimately exposed a fault in the anchoring terms of the secular order itself, in nature and the human. One might almost say that as a result, only at this point was disaster truly disastrous, for only now was it possible to face the prospect of enduring it without recourse and without appeal.</p>
<p>Yet even this notion of the non-negotiable disaster found its place within scenarios that in various ways attempted to confirm the ascendancy of governance or of a certain rationality. Malthus himself, for example, sought to learn the lessons of disaster and to modify the policies of the British state accordingly, encouraging it to revise its laws regarding the provision of aid to the poor (as it did in the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834). The implacable laws of nature, in his view, justified the state's adopting only apparently inhumane and draconian policies of its own. The sublation of disaster into public policy created what one might regard, <foreign>contra</foreign> Malthus, as a kind of disastrous state. But others in the period explored rather different strategies. In his analytic of the sublime, Kant suggested that the mind encountering any excessively vast or powerful aspect of nature could overleap that threat and identify with its own capacity to conceive of the infinite, effectively mapping out a strategy whereby the mind could assure itself of its dominance over even the most implacably hostile aspects of nature. Rather than attempting to provide a theological or governmental response to devastation, Kant in fact left empirical devastation in place, superseding it not by imagining any historically actual resolution but by creating a new category of solace, the mind's reassurance of its destination in a zone beyond any empirically available experience. In effect, he created a new secular theodicy, an identification with the mind's transcendence, whereby one could face with equanimity any actually devastating experience by keeping in mind that even it could not fundamentally alter one's supersensible origin and end. The cost of such a strategy, however, is that it located human dignity in a space so remote from actual suffering that it left the latter in place, largely unchallenged, cutting that solace off from the suffering body and embodied mind that needed it most. The attempt to overleap disaster by sublating it into governance or by resorting to the virtual category of the mind's transcendence both failed to dislodge disaster from its newly provocative and difficult position as the obstacle to secular theodicy or to a rationally redemptive historiography, for these strategies either gave disaster even more force or provided an exit strategy from a history where it continued to hold sway.</p>
<p>In the wake of these and other developments, Wordsworth's labor on <title level="m">The Ruined Cottage</title> takes on new weight, for a figure who at once bears and embodies the disaster takes the measure of an unyielding negativity without attempting to sublate it into a new mode of governance or a new philosophical category. Under the new conditions of secular knowledge and governance, the capacity to abide <emph>with</emph> and <emph>as</emph> disaster has new and surprising resonances. Although the pedlar does conclude his tale with a consoling meditation, those lines remain embedded in the context of the story of Margaret's suffering and point back to it, remaining vulnerable to a countervailing interpretation of her tale. Indeed, Wordsworth's very difficulty in composing this conclusion, or rather in deciding how to bridge the gap between the affective resonances of suffering and of consolation, led to the perpetual crisis of composing this poem, to William's illness, and eventually to Dorothy's designation of "Disaster pedlar." In effect, Dorothy's gesture of naming the pedlar in this way suggests that how to respond to a disastrous world is itself an ongoing compositional, affective, aesthetic disaster, one that admits of no resolution, that disables, even as it effects, the task of interpretation. In that case, however, the emergence of this figure exceeds its contexts, recasting the various discourses it evokes to undermine the explanatory virtues of historical location per se. This disabling element extends as well to our reading: the poem never makes clear what referential scenario we are to privilege as we comprehend it, on what ontological level we are to locate the disaster it addresses, nor how exactly to conceive of disaster itself. Placed within and against its manifold contexts, <title level="m">The Ruined Cottage</title> thus indicates that romanticism takes as its point of departure these very difficulties. Here and elsewhere, romanticism maps out what we might now recognize as a negative dialectics, one that refuses the stratagems of sublation as long as a certain catastrophic materiality remains in force, and a negative historicity, one that invokes yet refuses historical location. In its hesitations, impasses, and foreclosures, this poem outlines an aesthetics not of failure but of rigorous resistance to a false redemption, indeed to theodicy itself, one that ultimately hopes not to evade what it sees in disaster but to dwell with it, bear with it, and thus to find in this very abiding its own mode of impossible consolation.</p>
<p>Our reading of the disastrous pedlar thus suggests that if romanticism has often been defined as a being-in-the-world that coincides with liberal processes of secularization, increased progress, and amelioration, then it would appear that reading romanticism through its capacity to dwell with disaster attends to the ways in which optimistic revelation is split or <emph>displaced</emph> (an etymological improvisation on <foreign>désastre</foreign>—“from the stars”) by the “traumatic kernel,” as Žižek would put it (<title level="m">For They Know Not</title> 102), which influences the romantic projects that continue to make a claim on our contemporary thinking. It is the task of this special issue to approach the problem of reading the romantic varieties of disaster and to engage a host of attending issues. What are the social, historical, and political conditions or possibilities of living amidst devastation? How does one recognize such devastation in the first place, and what are the criteria through which it is posited? What is a crisis, and what kinds of temporal changes does it occasion? What can be philosophically gained or lost by analyzing disaster in its numerous sites, contexts, and instances? Anecdotally, the idea for this issue emerged out of our felt experience of the topicality of disaster in our own post-9/11 “dark times”; and yet, to quickly say that “disaster” is the <foreign>zeitgeist</foreign> of our age evokes an amnesiac, anxious belief (as Timothy Morton argues in his essay) that a holistic world <emph>was</emph> at some point possible and has been recently rent asunder. The nostalgic leitmotif here seems to avoid the more critical intervention made by many romantic texts that disaster has already phenomenally occurred within our social, political, and cultural structures and that perpetually attempting to sift the real from the imagined disasters fails to plumb the depths of what we assume “befalls” us. It also turns away from providing challenging responses and intellectual reorientations to catastrophic events. “A failure to act, and act now, will turn crisis into a catastrophe and guarantee a longer recession,” said Barack Obama on February 4, 2009, “a less robust recovery, and a more uncertain future . . . . That's why I feel such a sense of urgency about the Economic Recovery and Reinvestment Plan." The urgency of the request is underwritten by the sense that impending dissolution is the likely terminus that can be avoided by skirting inaction and passivity—failures to “act now,” in other words, are what turn crisis into catastrophe, but what is missing from Obama’s measurement is the more jarring sense that the crisis has always already been here, and that guarantees for normative restoration and reconstitution are themselves consequences of an inability to develop modes of thought and agency that desist from the “catastrophic imperative” (Hoens et al.) that structures us already.</p>
<p>We have purposely left “disaster” open as a complex term in order not to narrow it to any one approach, standard, or form of evaluation. Disaster might very well be interchangeable with other terms such as “catastrophe,” “cataclysm,” “ruin,” “destruction,” or “trauma.” Indeed, trauma studies in particular has had a generative effect on romantic scholarship, especially attempts to think through the relationships between affect and historical consciousness. As critics such as Jerome Christensen and Mary Favret, David L. Clark, and Marc Redfield have taught us, much of what we call romanticism emerged under the stormclouds of eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century warfare - a scene of violence that exceeds any Malthusian calculus of population loss in warfare, famine, or plague, that points to a more fundamental disorientation. According to Favret, the “everyday” life of the romantic literature was itself constituted by a sensitivity to battles far away but always experientially at hand, “a literature saturated by the awareness, conscious or unconscious, of a world lost to war . . . the pained effort to bind what is present and familiar with another reality, absent and destructive” (Favret 158, 159). Favret’s <title level="m">War At a Distance</title> is one powerful response to the sense of unknowable crises that romantic writers shouldered, and we take her scholarship as an impetus for exploring in the following pages <emph>what</emph> forms of change on the Enlightenment landscapes (both hospitable and inhospitable) can be described as disastrous and for what reasons. For Favret, trauma becomes the operative model through which to read how historical knowledge is encrypted within literary form as “unclaimed experience” (to cite Cathy Caruth’s influential book). Like melancholy or paranoia, trauma has become the model par excellence of a romantic historicism embedded by a knowing that it cannot fully grasp. (See Pfau, <title level="m">Romantic Moods</title>.) In this way, traumatic experience is by definition acquired involuntarily by <emph>not</emph> confronting it.</p>
<p>But what if the consequences or “experience” of a disaster were less about psychic survival than an unblinking desire to face down the disaster as a challenge to normative structures? As Terada notes, what if the propulsion to overcome disasters overleaps the healing effort and precisely misses their larger point: “Transition, and specifically one’s own change in it, is the main thing that it is necessary to ‘endure.’” Our employment of “disaster” partially signals Badiou’s differentiation (in our epigraph) of the <foreign>désastre</foreign> from the <foreign>des être</foreign>, a differentiation, that is, between a (dis)orientation towards the truth-event and a destructive non-being that nullifies the capacity to respond to the event in the first place. This power to nullify may be registered in part by gestures that, in attempting to respond, encounter the impossibility of doing so; producing figures of potential survival, they discover that such figures instead enable the ruins themselves to survive, personifying how <foreign>ê tre</foreign> has become, and has always been, the face of a more pervasive <foreign>des ê tre</foreign>, a desolation that endures through us even as we endure it. To fully face this radical fault in being, then, may require passing beyond the thought of trauma to conceive of a state that is not interrupted by crisis and does not seek to recover from it - a state that renounces even the redemptive narrative encrypted in the very notion of trauma.</p>
<p>If this is so, we might start to think of romanticism and disaster as indelibly linked by virtue of the fact that the conceptual mobility of the latter term has often spelled for critics of all stripes (deconstructive, historicist, formalist) a catachrestic movement of critical ruination that defines a theory of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment modernity already damaged at its very core. In this way, to think of romanticism disastrously is to begin to question the successes of “modernity.” As Thomas Pfau has shown, romantic modernity is often conceived as a “cosmic miscarriage” (<title level="a">Philosophy of Shipwreck</title> 951) symptomatic of the bureaucratized and professionalized disciplinary conceptions of knowledge through which we have ourselves become at once its bearers and critics. Like Wordsworth’s pedlar who signals for Dorothy a ruin at both the psychic and textual levels, emphases on voluntaristic models of agency are often undercut by an inoperative negativity that they fail to fully erase because their structure is already determined by what Blanchot has called a <foreign>désoeuvrement</foreign> at the heart of their labors. Himself a theorist of disaster, Blanchot will insist that this seemingly untraceable, unapprehendable negation is already there in the constructed surfaces of the world—an impossibility of writing that nevertheless conditions writing always to respond to that excess or non-identity which cannot be represented, felt, or recognized in spite of the fact that we already are inhabitants of disasters that have already occurred: “The disaster ruins everything, all the while leaving everything intact. It does not touch anyone in particular…It is in this way that I am threatened; it is in this way that the disaster threatens in me that which is exterior to me—an other than I who passively become other” (1). </p>
<p>As William Keach argues, to attend to the rhetorical, epistemological, political, and social effects of romantic critique is to consider how processes of destruction and reconstitution, ruination and survival, are part and parcel of romanticism’s grappling with this inoperative negativity, or what Tilottama Rajan has called "an unusable negativity" (<title level="a">Mary Shelley's <title level="m">Matilda</title>
</title> 44), a negativity that haunts it at every turn. Put in this way, for us "disaster" does not signal a referential event, despite the historical sequence from which it arose, but rather a condition to which that sequence leads, an undoing of certain apparently prior categories: subjectivity, community, “world.” That undoing continues to resonate today in our own registering of contemporary devastation. In a review essay on New Orleans and Hurricane Katrina, Lloyd Pratt has perspicaciously asked, was “the fate overtaking New Orleans an exceptional or an exemplary one? Was this gruesome spectacle of life stripped bare something in excess of the everyday, or did it in fact recapitulate the new shape of American society?” (251). What is at stake in Pratt’s questions is how to positively bear and process, under the most intolerable of circumstances, the magnitude of a disaster that exceeds nominal definitions and whose effects challenge the reparative desires of all social, cultural, political, and psychic structures. Neither example nor exception, “Katrina” refers to an incapacity that inscribes its own name, an incapacity to posit anything identifiably part of our past or present sense of what a disaster might be, and how to respond to it. If anything, “Katrina” signals an event, in Badiou’s sense: the irruption of an utterly new occurrence within a situation to which we have no prior knowledge or anticipation. The disastrous event, then, is neither eschatological nor transcendental: it is a movement of thought that calls upon us to reflect and act upon that which we cannot know but ultimately <emph>must</emph> bear. </p>
<p>Insofar as disaster is not a referential event but an undoing of certain categories, it ultimately undermines any attempt to explain it as a dimension of a familiar history or to interpret it within the terms of any received historiography. To be sure, as we have argued above, the thought of disaster <emph>as</emph> this undoing emerges within a certain history, but precisely as a turn upon the discourses it inherits from that history, a turn that ultimately suggests that disaster floats free of any determining moment, or more radically lays bare a certain nontemporal negativity at the heart of modern historicity itself. In that case, the continuing resonances of romanticism's reflections on disaster in the wake of 9/11 and Katrina, as we have suggested above, suggests that what romanticism records is in some sense still contemporary with our own experience, that the sequence of periods and historical transformations coincide with an inoperable negativity that renders each era a further iteration of an unassimilable event. This strange temporality of disaster links romanticism as well with the condition that arises within the debris of Hiroshima and Auschwitz, an affiliation that has been registered variously by Frances Ferguson, Geoffrey Hartman, and Sara Guyer - an affiliation, however, that does not privilege romanticism as the first mode of writing to broach these themes nor post-Holocaust discourse as their most knowing treatment.</p>
<p>But as we suggested a moment ago, even this disabling of familiar modes of historical and chronological mapping arises from an anterior ruining of evidence, of the citation of example or exception. An excellent example of such a ruining emerges already in "Mont Blanc," where Shelley meditates on the relationship between ruin, instruction, and exemplarity in a passage we will quote at length, if only to reread in a new key:

            (49-75)</quote>
         “Is this the scene / Where the old Earthquake-demon taught her young / Ruin? Were these their toys?” Mont Blanc here is posited as an example, but the question of <emph>what</emph> it taught already destroys the possibility of registering the place of that pedagogy in the first place because the contextual “scene” of that instruction has already been forgotten. Teaching ruin is already a process of ruination from which there is no objective outside: the disastrous pedagogy of the mountain suffers from an illusion of exceptionality and a failure of example: “Or did a sea / Of fire envelop once this silent snow? / None can reply—all seems eternal now." This erasure of exemplarity also undoes the respondent's confidence in himself as an example of a responsive subject, whether rendered as his individuality or the coordinates of his orientation to this scene: his spirit vanishes before a force that blows from a space he cannot locate, causing him to blend with a destructiveness that would annihilate him were he to attempt to survive intact. Furthermore, it frays even the privileged categories we might expect to underlie any mere example, for the "bare" world that appears with the erasure of human details is itself "scarred" and "riven," as if being itself sustains an infinite wound. In such passages, romanticism registers a baffled awareness that it cannot teach the lessons of such an encounter, cannot use disaster to found another positive discursive regime, cannot even formulate a new hauntology of <emph>des ê tre</emph>, but can only evoke it through texts that explore the terrain of their own defeat.</p>
<p>The four essays in this special issue all concentrate, in different ways, on disastrous conceptualizations of a romantic modernity whose innovative aptitudes are belied by a felt struggle to come to terms with a ruin that refuses to be overcome, a struggle in which the possibility of survival devolves into delayed reaction, resignation, defeat, and critical endurance. Scott Juengel's essay, <title level="a">Mary Wollstonecraft's Perpetual Disaster</title>, reads those moments in the <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</title> (1796) in which Wollstonecraft cribs from that quintessential Enlightenment genre, the conjectural history, to imagine future disasters and grieve for losses yet to come. Taking his cue from William Godwin's comment that her prejudices suffered a "vehement concussion" from the events of the French Revolution, Juengel argues that these moments of disastrous affect register a traumatic apprehension she cannot otherwise articulate - not even in her <title level="m">Historical and Moral View of the Origins and Progress of the French Revolution</title> (1794). Devastated by a wounding realization of revolutionary hope, Wollstonecraft is "[h]aunted by what was to have been the future," and weaves "the time of revolutionary politics with what we might call 'species time,' resulting in forms of untimeliness that figure as disaster without end." Her sense of this disaster, so threatening to the value of individual lives, is attuned to the discovery of a planetary "deep time" that took place in the decades before and after the 1790s and to the prospect, articulated two years later by Malthus, of an ongoing "disaster of sensation and feeling that paradoxically moves the species toward life rather than death." Moreover, such a speculative leap into the future is defended in Kant's <title level="a">Conjectures on the Beginning of Human History</title> and finds its parallel in his writing on perpetual peace, where he imagines a world free of war — or devastated by a peace that transpires after a war without remainder. Even her apparent turn in the opposite direction, when she imagines that the sparsely populated landscape of Sweden speaks of human origins, may indicate her melancholic reflections on the "possibility of renewal" within the imagined ruins of the future. Yet all these untimely reflections may enable her to avoid confronting the disasters of the present, such as the consequences of the fire that destroyed large portions of Copenhagen just before her arrival there; the thought of disaster, she suggests, would relieve her from the task of treading on "live ashes," on ills not yet reduced to scenes in fancy. Ultimately, Juengel argues, these movements of disastrous thought may all speak of what Reinhardt Koselleck describes as the radical temporalization of revolutionary time, a temporalization to which Wollstonecraft ultimately responds with a generous passivity, with a more-than-Kantian hospitality to disaster itself. Juengel's searching essay provokes us to suggest that if Wollstonecraft exemplifies a traumatic untimeliness characteristic of our modernity, her willingness to remain hospitable to disaster may exemplify with equal force an ethics for the ruins.</p>
<p>In his contribution to this collection, William Keach explores a similarly dense affiliation of statements made roughly two decades later, at another moment of great affective intensity. His essay, <title level="a">The Ruins of Empire and the Contradictions of Restoration: Barbauld, Byron, Hemans</title>, explores how Regency ruin culture developed at once as the apogee and the ambivalently repressive (and repressed) symptom of British imperialism, articulating the nuances of “Britain’s role in determining the trajectory of the Napoleonic imperial project at moments unstably situated between triumph and catastrophe, commercial and military pre-eminence and social crisis.” Working through Walter Benjamin's comments on ruination in <title level="m">The Arcades Project</title>, Keach marks out how the difference between a “canonical” and “critical” ruin culture depends on gestures of delayed fascination tempered by an “awakening” that throws the ruin into sudden critical knowledge. For Keach, the ruin is indelibly coupled to restoration, thus producing a double movement of destruction and reconstruction that not only operates separately, but is intrinsic to the ideology of the ruin. As fragment, the ruin figures as a remainder of other cultures newly “acquired” and transmuted into the mournful excesses that haunt their reinstallment in pre- and post-Waterloo Britain. Even more, it either constitutes a celebratory surplus that hints at renovation or offers itself as unyielding matter—the debris of political and social violence. Thus ruins “presuppose survival and materialize it; restoration seeks to sustain the survival of ruins, but in doing so imperfectly arrests and undoes both ruin and survival.” In Byron’s <title level="m">Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</title>, ruin emerges as cultural property that harkens to the catastrophes of European warfare, but it is also a feature of Harold himself who figures for a perverse internalization and enactment of ruination. The diverse rhetorical plays and critiques Byron mounts against Regency life display a powerful critical project: “Byron turns our attention towards the revered monuments of ancient empire not to debunk their affective force <emph>in the present</emph> but to redirect that force towards an awakened sense of how they may be read as commentaries <emph>on the present</emph>.” Similarly, Barbauld’s <title level="m">Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</title>, the spoils of British imperialism are evoked as traces of a ceaseless wartime, and rather than gesture proleptically at a future to come that is inscribed by past greatness, Barbauld imagines a waning future that institutionalizes ruins <emph>as</emph> anachronistic remnants, thus shortcircuiting the forward propulsion of post-Waterloo political life. By contrast, in Felicia Hemans’s <title level="m">The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy</title> — a poem Byron read and admired — the British seizure of Italian artifacts is conceived to be part of a dubiously optimistic political agenda, where the ruin is both “confirmed” and “confined” by Hemans’s narrative linking of destruction, survival, and restoration. As Keach charts the repressed historical materiality that haunts the poem, he notes that “for political and ethical as well as aesthetic reasons, Rome needs to remain in ruins; any prospect of a phoenix-like rise from its ashes would compromise its distinctive value <emph>as</emph> ruin—and also threaten Britain’s ascendancy as Europe’s new imperial champion of restoration.” </p>
<p>What follows in the wake of thinking oppositely about ruin, survival, and restoration? How can one think with, rather than against, disaster? Timothy Morton’s <title level="a">Romantic Disaster Ecology: Blake, Shelley, Wordsworth</title> explicitly reflects on romantic models of (ecological) knowing that take disaster as a part of their framework and the consequences of these structural choices. If mainstream ecological thinking is disaster prone in its visions of apocalyptic meltdowns and universal heat-deaths, then, according to Morton, ecology is construed as the perfect consequence (rather than antithesis) of global capitalism which depends upon futural projections of destruction that produce an unworkable state of exception. The critical difference lies precisely in how and why one wants to think through disaster: the traumatic possibility of something yet-to-come postpones a consideration of how our life-worlds are already shaped by catastrophe. In fact, disaster ecology potentially absents the world in favor of expectations of destruction that obviate the real effects of ecological damage that already define us. In the process, they also reify the “environment” as a preserved artifact that is distinctly separate from our own lives. “[I]s there another way to think, without disaster, a non-disastrous thinking, that isn't just postponement?” Turning to Blake, Wordsworth, and Shelley, Morton describes three approaches that variously posit and critically re-imagine <emph>what</emph> ecological thought beyond disaster might be. Indeed, Wordsworth emerges as enabling poetic forms of listening that emerge in tandem with the evocation of catastrophe, and in this sense, Morton suggests that the aesthetic contributes to subjective, epistemological, and social formation in a way that exposes our ecological relationality <emph>through</emph> the disasters that supposedly interrupt thinking, but nevertheless inscribe our sociality through and through.</p>
<p>The difficult prospect of thinking disaster in a mode that is not postponement, that takes the measure of something already taking place, raises questions that were of central and abiding interest to Hegel. In her essay, <title level="a">Hegel's Bearings</title>, Rei Terada ponders Hegel's style of "tarrying with the negative," particularly with the narrowing of political possibility in German territories both under Napoleonic liberalization and after Waterloo. In correspondence with his friend Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer, who states his wish to persist in fighting a losing cause even - or especially - if he is the "last man" to do so, as if to find sustenance in his inability to bear his dark times. Hegel bears up in another manner, seeking a middle way that "<emph>allows</emph> nothing to get too bad and nothing too good." Rather than trusting himself to a truly open history, Terada argues, Hegel protects the civic life of the middle class, but in doing so he also carries through on a philosophy in which "another middle, the middle of transition, always rules the world." Drawing on a description of a dream Hegel sends to his friend, in which "a certain realist calculation and foresight is implicit," his critique of "the mirror reifications of empiricism and idealism" in the <title level="m">Logic</title>, and his account in the <title level="m">Encyclopedia</title> of how the subject, reading every negativity that comes from outside as actually from inside, can become "a being capable of containing and enduring its own contradiction," Terada shows how Hegel becomes a "privileged figure of the new dispensation," someone capable of enduring "the horizonless condition of an antipolitical society that extends from the late Napoleonic era to our own." By identifying the transitional movement of his philosophy with reality itself, Hegel as a result assimilates the grayness of his times into his own thought. For Hegel, disaster is "being unable to shake one's presentation of a situation as unbearable," yet by proposing that the subject might absorb any eventuality into its mode of endless transition, he constructs a model of pathological health, a subject for which <emph>nothing</emph> would ultimately be a disaster. This impasse, Terada suggests, "persists to the present day." </p>
<p>Is it possible that by further reflection we might work our way past this and other impasses to a new possibility? Or is a certain impotence of thought inherent to dwelling in the ruins, much as, for Shelley, disaster erases any lesson we might learn from it? Does the undoing of certain categories (community, world) erase the prospect of a politics for the ruins, or does a critical reading of the ruin - and a hospitality to disaster itself - offer us a glimpse of another mode of collective engagement? Does the attempt to render disaster into discourse reproduce it, making us, like the pedlar, instances of what we would describe? Or might our reflections at least delineate the contours of our untimeliness, opening up the prospect of thinking otherwise? The persistence of these questions challenges our thoughts and expectations as well as our states of belonging, whether it be our age or another. This intense, unblinking openness inspires our contributors, for whom romanticism is at least partially the most pressing instance of multiple confrontations with what Adorno and Horkheimer referred to as the “disaster triumphant” of modernity in the <title level="m">Dialectic of Enlightenment</title> (3), but with the difference that post-eighteenth-century thought is not merely to be defined by a violent attenuation of its commitments, but rather by a brooding, infinitely complex, and aggressive critical aliveness to the ways in which the un-thought of our common life is perpetually shadowed by its failures. That failure, however, spells out occasions to think about what it means to get by, as it were, or live on amidst the mere ruin of things—to perceive, hold on, and not look away—to have faith in the reminder that the disaster has a right or a value in and of itself, and one <emph>must</emph> dwell in it rather than leave it behind.</p>

<p>Our world appears to be on the brink of disaster, an appearance that is itself disastrous. The disaster of disaster is that disaster is everywhere, all the time: while on the one hand it appears obvious that disaster should be the exception that proves the rule of a generally non-disastrous world, in actuality no non-disastrous moment arrives. Like a deer in the headlights, thinking is paralyzed by disaster. Whether this is strictly a function of modernity, beginning with the Romantic period, or whether it is a function of disaster as such remains to be seen. But what Naomi Klein accurately, but not thoroughly, calls “the shock doctrine” is the capitalist norm: the state of exception is capitalist reality. For Klein, capitalists fleece the rest of us when they need a whip-round. For Marxism, this is the normal state of affairs, the deep structure of capitalism as such, which must keep on accumulating more money in order to exist. And perhaps it is also the reality of actually existing socialism: to avert the imminent disaster in capitalism, a socialist emergency must be declared. </p>
<p>It is possible, argue Žižek and Badiou, that ecology is simply the latest version of capitalist disaster ideology at work.
            <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">See for example Žižek, <title level="m">Tragedy</title>; <ref target="http://www.lacan.com/zizecology1.htm">http://www.lacan.com/zizecology1.htm</ref>; <ref target="http://www.lacan.com/Žižekecologyvideo.html">http://www.lacan.com/Žižekecologyvideo.html</ref>.</note>
            For instance, to ward off what is still seen (weirdly) as an imminent disaster of global warming, it is entirely likely that a green bubble based on derivatives of the existing carbon trading market will eventually eclipse the recent implosion of global capital. (This is weird because science keeps telling us that the disastrous climate change has already occurred and that we are now living in its aftermath.) Nevertheless, truly to think what I call <emph>the ecological thought</emph> (and I believe that there is a thinking that is truthful here) is to recalibrate what we mean by disaster, such that ecological thinking and practice must entail dropping the imminence of disaster, with its resulting states of exception. This thinking would be non-disastrous both in content and in form. </p>
<p>Take plutonium for instance: a disaster that has already occurred, and one that will continue for at least 24 100 years. Just how many of those years do we think will be capitalist? Do we seriously imagine that the end of the world is more likely than the end of capitalism? Or consider global warming, the cause of the Sixth Mass Extinction Event (there have been five since the beginning of life on Earth). This is not a disaster waiting to happen. Atmospheric CO<hi rend="sub">2</hi> levels are now well above the safety ceiling of 350 parts per million (ppm). Since Neolithic times, humans have lived under about 275ppm. Current levels are around 387ppm and climbing by about 2ppm annually (350.org). Percy Shelley was already talking about pollution in 1813: “the putrid atmosphere of crowded cities; the exhalations of chemical processes” (Note 17 to <title level="m">Queen Mab</title>, 1.406–23 (411)). Or take petroleum: the product of whatever disaster wiped out the dinosaurs (Žižek, <title level="m">Defense</title>, 441–442). Thinking of past disasters causes thinking to leak out around the threat of imminent disaster, like water seeping through a badly constructed dam. In the language of fighter pilots, disaster “cones down” our attention to focus on a singularity that is strictly unthinkable. </p>
<p>We can visualize a time before and a time after disaster, in which disaster remains as a fundamental category of our visualization. What about thinking beyond disaster, or is thinking forever caught in disaster's shadow? Art imagines post-apocalyptic worlds: Romanticism in particular is full of them, from Byron's <title level="a">Darkness</title> to <title level="m">The Last Man</title>. Is poetry, as Allen Grossman puts it, “the postponement of the end of the world,” and how Romantic is this postponement (Grossman and Halliday 336)? Or is there another way to think, without disaster, a non-disastrous thinking, that isn't just postponement? And is there any Romantic literature that can help us think this way? In this essay, I shall consider three writers who adopt three quite different positions concerning disaster. Percy Shelley, argues the essay, is fundamentally disaster-prone: despite his proclaimed anti-capitalism, and indeed his objective usefulness to progressive and socialist thinking, his poetry even anticipates some of the more recent moves of global capital. I shall argue that Shelley did, to his credit, eventually figure out (at least on the level of artistic form) that his poetic language was trapped in disaster mode. William Blake satirizes the subject position from which disaster becomes visible, in his special mode of ideology critique—part of his larger project of trying to change the attitudes that come bundled with ideas such as disaster. William Wordsworth emerges as a genuine poet of non-disaster, or post-disaster: his poetry is perhaps the only one of the three still capable of performing something like thinking while caught in disaster's headlights. </p>

<head>The Disaster of Disaster</head>
<p>Strictly speaking, ecology is a discourse of non-disaster. Disaster is literally an unfortunate star (<emph>dis</emph> plus <emph>astron</emph>), an astrological misfortune. This accident is a portent of things to come on Earth: 
         <quote>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="#indent2">Stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, </l>
<l rend="#indent2">Disasters in the sun; and the moist star, </l>
<l rend="#indent2">Upon whose influence Neptunes empire stands, </l>
<l rend="#indent2">Was sick almost to dooms-day with eclipse.</l>
</lg>
               (<title level="m">Hamlet</title> 1.1.118)
         </quote>         
         In order to have disasters such as this, one needs an integrated world in which certain astral phenomena are interpreted according to a stable key. The stars spatter the edges of this world, illuminating it with their obscure but significant tracery, patterned in recognizable constellations that are given rules for conjunction and disjunction. Ecology is the collapse of astrology, and not simply because it belongs to a “secular” era. Ecology abolishes the star-studded dome of the world insofar as ecological science and ecological awareness force upon humans the collapse of any significant background or horizon against which human activity can be placed and measured (Heidegger 39–122; Morton, <title level="m">Ecology</title> 94–101). Astrology turns the stars into significant documents, legible texts. Ecological disasters are precisely not caused by the action of a beyond, for in ecology, there is no beyond, no elsewhere, no “yonder,” however remote. Life forms are made from their environments, including sunshine and chemicals from exploding stars. There is no way rigidly to separate the biosphere and the non-biosphere. If the Earth had no magnetic field, for instance, life forms would be sizzled by solar winds: one good sign of extra-terrestrial life is planets with magnetic fields. As if life, once it gets going, includes all that goes around it and before it: terrestrial oxygen and iron are bi-products of bacterial metabolism, and hills are made of crushed shells and bones.</p>
<p>In the technical literature of disaster management, an ecological disaster is precisely an event for which “inside” resources do not suffice to provide a remedy—help from “outside” must be brought in (European Environmental Agency, “disaster”).
            <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The International Disaster Database defines a disaster such that at least one of the following occur: ten or more people are reported killed; one hundred people are reported affected; a state of emergency is declared; a call for international assistance is made.</note>
            This rather elegantly encapsulates the problem—there remains no “inside,” or everything is “inside” in the sense that there is no longer a beyond, since the beyond is only legible on the horizon of a here and now. </p>
<p>We can only conclude, then, that “ecological disaster” is an oxymoron. To what purpose? Paul Virilio predicted a long while ago that environmental threats would allow the state to stage rehearsals for military and industrial displays of power (Virilio). This is not congruent with ecological reality. The trouble with ecological awareness is that it is drastically non-teleological. Life science has demonstrated that life as such has no fixed, rigid origin: this is the lesson of the ironically titled <title level="m">The Origin of Species</title>, in which Darwin successfully undermines every possible biological distinction (species versus species, species versus variant, variant versus monstrosity, and so on) (Darwin, <title level="m">Origin</title>, 34, 94, 100, 109, 131, 133, 141). The rhetoric of disaster is the tropology of an absolute end, a sudden misfortune. How sudden is the half-life of plutonium: what is the span of that disaster? Does it have peaks and troughs? When did the disaster called global warming begin? Is it at all possible to say with a straight face that on a certain date at a certain time, a threshold will have been crossed that guarantees the arrival of apocalyptic catastrophe? </p>
<p>There is a rhetoric of catastrophe in which the narrator overleaps apocalypse altogether. It is as if one could watch a video of one's own funeral. Of course, literature enables us to fantasize this all the time: the act of narrating in the first person is just this kind of doubling. But the totality of global ecological disaster, of which one consequence might be human extinction (as in Mary Shelley's <title level="m">The Last Man</title>), means that there is strictly no one around in the future to watch any videos whatsoever. The ghostly presence of ourselves, spectators to a future in which we do not strictly exist, can only be vicarious at best and is often sadistic. Elegies for deaths that have not yet occurred, they mourn for the still living in a way that only repeats the dreaded dualism of subject and object that many environmentalists see as public enemy number one. For the subject who is reading the elegy is different from the subject whose death is being witnessed, even if they have the same name, and are to some extent the same person. Radically different: separated by an ontological firewall, indeed, such that ecological elegy is a form of the Cretan liar paradox (“I am lying”).
            <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">For further discussion see Morton, <title level="a">Dark Ecology.</title>
</note>
            Byron's <title level="a">Darkness</title> manages this uncanny doubling by staging disaster as a dream. Shelley's <title level="m">The Last Man</title> imagines a further future in which some people come across the story. Nevertheless, in both cases, part of the pleasure of works such as these is that one can't help thinking for a moment that one is voyeuristically privy to a future in which one does not exist. </p>
<p>The ideology and the rhetoric of ecological disaster, then, have nothing to do with actual ecology. They are “environmentalist” in the same sense as some ideas about gender are sexist. That is, they set up the environment as a metaphysical construct on a pedestal, torn down, built up, worshipped, admired as an aesthetic object, and so on. Aesthetic images of the environment are predicated on disaster: we are shown we want to avert it; we are compelled to imagine it vividly. This seems like a truism: recordings of whale sounds and Douglas Adams's book <title level="m">Last Chance to See</title> would not have appeared if human-caused extinction were not on the cards (<ref target="#WC">see Works Cited</ref>). It is always unfortunate when reality coincides with fantasy. The trouble is not so much the quite legitimate wish to preserve species from dying out through human misuse. The problem is in the attitude engendered in the disaster narratives we keep telling ourselves. For at least one of these attitudes happens to provide some strong cement for the maintenance of an oppressive status quo. </p>
<p>If we are going to think ecology beyond capitalism, we shall need to think beyond disaster and beyond disaster speak. It would be preferable to refer to ecological difficulty as a “drag,” in both performative and work-related senses. Ecological difficulty will beset us for the long run, perhaps forever (whatever that means). And ecology is profoundly a view that accommodates display, performance, sheer aesthetic illusion (for example in Darwin's theory of sexual selection), and so on (Darwin, <title level="m">Descent</title>). Take the evolutionary notion of “satisficing.” A rabbit is not really a rabbit. It is not that a rabbit by any other name would act as nose-twitchy. All the way down, there is no rabbit, no rabbit flavored DNA. And all the way up: rabbits act like rabbits, and thus pass on their genome. This is called “satisficing,” a form of performativity (Dawkins 156). If a life form does its thing without dying, its descendant can keep whatever it does. The fact that homosexuals exist across a vast array of sexually reproducing life forms, for instance, indicates that evolution has no problem with them. In fact, heterosexual behavior floats on top of a vast ocean of cloning, transgender switching, homosexuality and intersexuality (Roughgarden). A genome could not care less if its vehicle acts like someone else's idea of a rabbit. This includes having mutations that not all rabbits might have. There is no essence called race, or gender, or species—or environment. Thus there is no fixed gender against which “deviations” are measured as disastrous. </p>
<p>Ultimately, thinking ecology beyond disaster means thinking ecology without nature; and even thinking ecology without environmentalism. Looked at one way, evolution is a long history of disasters, such as extinction: which is to say, since disaster is everywhere, it is of no cosmic significance. Ecological awareness demands that we care for ourselves and nonhumans on time and space scales far in excess of the usual parameters, even if the parameters are based on modified forms of self interest that include greater numbers under the umbrella of “kith and kin” (Parfit, 355–357, 361, 371–377; Morton, <title level="a">Hyperobjects</title>). It just does not make sense to try and find self-interest-based reasons to care for a “hyperobject” such as plutonium 239, which has a half-life of 24 100 years: what a drag. The kind of excitement demanded by disaster tropology will not serve us well. We need something like Wordsworth with his adverse reaction to the “gross and violent stimulants” of his literary age (Wordsworth, <title level="a">Preface,</title> 746).</p>

<head>Percy Shelley</head>
<p>Are there archaeological remnants of oxymoronic “disaster ecology” in the British Romantic period? And do these remains contain anything like a critique? Percy Shelley is forever thinking of planetary and solar disaster. He favors the global over the local in a way that would scandalize the typical Romantic ecocritic. For this very reason his writing seems apt for an era of global warming. The poetry performs aesthetically what ecological damage and global positioning technology perform in the real, swallowing horizons and worlds (Morton, <title level="a">Shelley's Green Desert</title>). This disorientation is indeed disastrous, a symptom of a general collapse of local reference points. </p>
<p>A few disastrous stars appear as such in Shelley's poetry.
            <note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">A brief search of ABELL confirms this. </note>
             Of the rather few astrological (rather than astronomical) ones, most are favorable.
            <note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">There is too little space to discuss <title level="a">A Vision of the Sea</title> with its “watery plain, / Where the death-darting sun cast no shadow at noon” (46–47); or <title level="a">Homer's Hymn to the Sun.</title>
</note>
             Yet there are disasters closer to home, having to do with the Sun and Moon, taken as figures for the brute ideological force of geocentric common sense—the cosmology of despotic theism. These fluctuate somewhere between the pathetic fallacy and an earlier, classicist tropology of nature echoing human weal and woe, as when in elegy the mountains resound with echoes of loss. In <title level="m">Hellas</title> Hassan describes the sky as if it were the Muslim flag: 
         <quote>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="#indent2">Look, Hassan, on yon crescent moon emblazoned</l>
<l rend="#indent2">Upon that shattered flag of fiery cloud, </l>
<l rend="#indent2">Which leads the rear of the departing day, </l>
<l rend="#indent2">Wan emblem of an empire fading now. </l>
<l rend="#indent2">See! how it trembles in the blood-red air </l>
<l rend="#indent2">And like a mighty lamp whose oil is spent </l>
<l rend="#indent2">Shrinks on the horizon's edge while from above</l>
<l rend="#indent2">One star with insolent and victorious light</l>
<l rend="#indent2">Hovers above its fall, and with keen beams</l>
<l rend="#indent2">Like arrows through a fainting antelope </l>
<l rend="#indent2">Strikes its weak form to death. (337–347)</l>
</lg>
</quote>
            It's standard Shelleyan procedure to work emblematically, to depict revolution according to the operations of celestial mechanisms. In a massive expansion of the classical messenger speech (much of <title level="m">Hellas</title> works this way), the workings of history are played out as astronomical portents. Hassan curses Greece using the hyperbolic language of disaster: “Famine and Pestilence / And Panic” (439–440) will ensue wherever “dews fall, or the angry sun look down / With poisoned light” (438–439). Naturally, this language is framed by the encompassing vision of Enlightenment, of stars beyond sun and moon threatening the heliocentric world of a corrupt God and the dark theodicy of “The tempest of the Omnipotence of God / Which sweeps all things to their appointed doom” (449–450).</p>
<p>The classical tropology of the globe was already out of date: some more up to date poetry turned to what I've called the poetics of spice, the capitalist advertising language that weaves together Earth's far flung corners via trade routes and precious commodities (Morton, <title level="m">Spice</title> 39–108). Shelley was well aware of this new menu of poetic devices, and used them frequently and knowingly in allusions to Milton, one of their first great exponents. The poetics of spice is significantly not a poetics of disaster but of continued and undisturbed flow: a fantasy of luxury that airbrushed the ongoing disaster of slavery and colonialism out of the global picture, rather like an Archer Daniels Midland <title level="a">Supermarket to the World</title> advert today. Although knowing this may upset the environmentalist apple cart, the first stirrings of global awareness came from the heart of commercial capitalist fantasy, not from within opposition to capitalism. </p>
<p>Shelley, however, needed to think and imagine how it had all gone so wrong. He was deeply aware of how the poetics of spice was tainted by commerce, and often uses it perhaps rather too forcefully to make this very point. Unable to theorize fully how disaster is intrinsic to capitalism (he writes it off as a rapacious, excessive farcical repetition of aristocratic power), Shelley resorted to language that talks about the disturbing of a fundamental balance. In this he shares much with contemporary anti-capitalist writing such as Naomi Klein's. Yet Shelley is perhaps unique for the deadly seriousness with which he articulates the imbalance. This becomes a matter of scientific and philosophical positing, not just rhetorical play. For Shelley, Earth was a perpetual disaster, in the precise astrological sense: a mishap in a planetary body. Earth's axis is bent. This terrestrial disaster was caused by human injustice, including the eating of animal flesh. In the utopian future, the Earth's axis is righted and the planet orbits “straight up” around the sun. Ironically, Shelley's evidence for the disaster, and its solution, is a snapshot of what later became known as continental drift and climate change. Note 10 on two lines of his early poem <title level="m">Queen Mab</title> (6.45–46) establish this:

<quote>The north polar star, to which the axis of the earth, in its present state of obliquity, points. It is exceedingly probable, from many considerations, that this obliquity will gradually diminish, until the equator coincides with the ecliptic: the nights and days will then become equal on the earth throughout the year, and probably the seasons also. There is no great extravagance in presuming that the progress of the perpendicularity of the poles may be as rapid as the progress of intellect; or that there should be a perfect identity between the moral and physical improvement of the human species. It is certain that wisdom is not compatible with disease, and that, in the present state of the climates of the earth, health, in the true and comprehensive sense of the word, is out of the reach of civilized man. Astronomy teaches us that the earth is now in its progress, and that the poles are every year becoming more and more perpendicular to the ecliptic. The strong evidence afforded by the history of mythology, and geological researches, that some event of this nature has taken place already, affords a strong presumption that this progress is not merely an oscillation, as has been surmised by some late astronomers. Bones of animals peculiar to the torrid zone have been found in the north of Siberia, and on the banks of the river Ohio. Plants have been found in the fossil state in the interior of Germany, which demand the present climate of Hindostan for their production. The researches of M. Bailly establish the existence of a people who inhabited a tract in Tartary 49º north latitude, of greater antiquity than either the Indians, the Chinese, or the Chaldeans, from whom these nations derive their sciences and theology. We find, from the testimony of ancient writers, that Britain, Germany, and France were much colder than at present, and that their great rivers were annually frozen over. Astronomy teaches us also that since this period the obliquity of the earth's position has been considerably diminished. (<title level="m">Poems</title>, 1.373–374)
         </quote>
     Extraordinarily, then, borrowing from the ideas of Laplace and Cabanis, Shelley holds that a more just human society will literally rebalance Earth's axis. Shelley thus produced countless images we now associate with the photograph <title level="a">Earthrise,</title> the image of a fragile blue Earth from the Moon popularized by Al Gore. Shelley wants desperately to achieve a point of view that is big enough in time and space to account for disaster: as Archimedes' epigraph to <title level="m">Queen Mab</title> puts it, “Give me somewhere to stand and I will move the Earth.” And he means it. He literally means that Earth's axis can be corrected through progressive cultural and political praxis. The trouble is Shelley finds it almost impossible to imagine transformation without disaster: the fortunate disaster of the moving of Earth itself is sure to be tremendous, shuddering life forms, not a peaceful working out of some inner logic. Transitions from disaster to peace resound with the grinding of rhetorical gears. Thus in <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title> everyone fights everyone else until someone yells for it to stop; immediately following the carnage, the people stage a pacifist, vegetarian festival (Morton, <title level="m">Shelley</title> 110–116). This implies that everyone has within them the capacity to hear the compassion and reason within the yelling, and the capacity to turn on a dime to act on these impulses. Yet these capacities are precisely not there: why else would Earth's axis be so kinked? Shelley wants transitions that are precisely un-kinky, but what he gives us is, on the figurative level at least, maximal kink. </p>
<p>Earth-righting justice includes proto-feminism, atheism, democracy, some form of non-capitalist economy, and vegetarianism. The sound minds in sound bodies who will enjoy this future state will live in harmony with their world, conceived not as a patchwork of localities, but as a genuine globality, as Book 9 of <title level="m">Queen Mab</title> makes clear: “Oh Happy Earth! Reality of Heaven!” (9.1). Shelley's somewhat future-primitive imagery imagines the future state as a blissful global village in which nonhumans “sport around” human habitations, in a rewriting of Isaiah 11 that strikes us now as rather New Agey (<title level="m">The Daemon of the World</title>, 444). For instance, the following passage strikingly situates the future humans on a republican lawn, level and smooth like the metaphorical level playing field:
         <quote>

<l rend="#indent2">			That comes to lick his feet.</l>
</lg>
            (<title level="m">Queen Mab</title>, 8.77–87)</quote>
The fusion of Biblical millenarianism and utterly sincere Enlightenment nonviolence and reason produces the almost psychedelic image of the baby feeding the “green and golden basilisk” with its friendly tongue (8.86). It is one of Shelley's many vivid synecdochic sketches for a peaceful world whose every corner looks like this. This is a world without disaster, whose disasters are all past. The happy future people can look up to the sky and know that everything has been set right—not by some <foreign>deus ex machina</foreign>, to be sure, but by their own hands and brains. The world has a center—the human habitation, represented minimally by the “mother's door” (8.84), around which spreads the rest of Earth's inhabitants in what appear to be concentric circles derived from Pope's <title level="m">Essay on Man</title> (3.27, 49–52). Vegetarianism serves as a hook (in Lacanian, a “point de caption”) that links individual impulses to social welfare, and human society to nature, seeming to ground the future in something we can practice right now (3.147–67). </p>
<p>Yet while in Pope there is a reactionary knowingness that disaster continues, Shelley truly wants to image a time without disaster, figured as a time of no meat eating (not even for the lions) that we can achieve by not eating meat, among other things. For Shelley, the Garden of Eden is a future state. Human being is and has been a disaster, beginning with the Promethean (technological, that is) disaster of cooking animal food. Thus at the end of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> the Earth herself is finally able to articulate how disastrous violence is transfigured: </p>

<l rend="#indent2">Sport like tame beasts, none knew how gentle they could be! </l>
</lg>
         (4.400–405)
         </quote>
<p>The trouble is, how do we get to the future Eden? As argued just above, this would require the very state of mind (the nonviolent, non-disastrous one) that Shelley reckons is unavailable to us in our disastrous present. All right then, try vegetarianism in the mean time. But here the problem repeats itself: in order to become vegetarian, one must be nonviolent (Morton, <title level="m">Shelley</title> 126–169). Vegetarianism also presupposes the mindset it claims to generate. This recursion is evidence of ideology at work. Shelley is in a bind because he cannot think past disaster. How do you convince the unconscious (Demogorgon), which has no sense of time, to behave differently—to imagine things differently? Shelley's progressive political view wants this difference to be possible, but his poetics creates enormous difficulties.</p>
<p>What ecological thinking, emerging during his lifetime, opens up, Shelley includes in his work. Yet with another hand, Shelley domesticates the disastrous vision, turning disaster into a singularity through which human history will pass, as the rather grisly introduction to Book 8 shows: “Time! … Render up thy half-devoured babes” (8.3–5). It is hard not to think that at some level, the remarkably anti-capitalist and prescient Shelley is stuck in a capitalist ideological mode, rather like the Enlightenment <foreign>philosophes</foreign> he so admired and whom Marx later criticized for being as fetishistic, in their way, as the “primitive” believers they undermine. </p>
<p>Shelley appears trapped in the tropology of disaster, like an insect beating itself against a glass window. Since what appears to be required is a dramatic inner transformation that includes transcending prejudices of all kinds, how is it possible to think the moment of change? Shelley obsesses over how to transition from the time of disaster to the time of no disaster. It is only perhaps at the very end, with <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, that he opts for the judo-like approach of staying with the moment of disaster, inventing a poetics of disaster appropriate to this staying. Yet it isn't quite right to call this incomplete text a judo move. It's more as if Shelley was at last content to see the implications of his poetic imagination through to some conclusions that might be uncomfortable for the kinds of progressive box into which he fitted his politics. For <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> is incomplete both as literary text, and in terms of thinking through and beyond the political and philosophical ramifications of disaster. </p>
<p>The strange beginning of Shelley's <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, elucidated in Paul De Man's essay “Shelley Disfigured,” is a poetics of disaster, literally a dis-astron, since the sun's weirdly sudden rising is the basis for De Man's deconstructive essay. Talk about a “disaster in the sun” as Horatio puts it:

</lg>
</quote>
         
         Here is the “good disaster” of an Enlightenment sunrise, and the gears don't grind—but what acceleration! It is as if Shelley had overheard Wordsworth's paean to the French Revolution, “Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive” (11.4), and teased out the queasy horror—not of executing aristos, but the horror within bliss as such, its automatic, orgasmic otherness. De Man's reading traces the intense play of light in Shelley's poem, as blinding as it is revealing (De Man). This intensity is in part a reflex of what he calls the “brusque” artificiality of the poem's guiding linguistic act, positing. The inversion of the figure and the figured (“Swift as a spirit…the Sun” (1–2)) is one of Shelley's typical uses of what old rhetorical manuals call <foreign>obscurum per obscures</foreign>, describing something in terms of something less clear (Morton, <title level="a">Shelley, Nature and Culture</title>). This device spells disaster, separating the figurative from the signified levels while making the signified moot: poetry achieves escape velocity from pointing to things outside of language, exploding beautifully in successful failure, like fireworks. The first four lines dispense with measurably slow empirical dawns and the depth of poetic tradition about the sun in a stroke (a sunstroke?): “The impossible position is precisely the figure, the trope, metaphor as a violent—and not as a dark—light, a deadly Apollo”—disaster (De Man 117–118). Light starts to become nuclear radiation. It is as if it's beginning to dawn on Shelley that disaster is intrinsic to his poetics. </p>
<p>The disruptive, fluid freefall of this poem's <foreign>terza rima</foreign> enacts disaster at a textural level: you can feel it in the disorienting interweaving of negation upon negation. Finally, Shelley appears content to court disaster. The vertiginous way in which visions and dreams appear caught within one another in a non-teleological parody of medieval allegory leaves the narrator trapped within the glass of disaster, against which we saw Shelley's earlier work to be beating itself. For to discover oneself in a dream, only to find that the exit from the dream is another dream, puts in peril the neatly teleological story of disaster transcended or averted. When everything is a disaster, it is not that nothing is a disaster: rather, we enter a world of risk assessment without an exit, and find ourselves unable to shake the monkey of too much consciousness off our backs (Beck).</p>
<p>Perhaps, then, there is some truth in the idea that <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> is deliberately unfinished—at least this intuition is congruent with some of the conclusions the poem forces upon us. I prefer, however, to think of this poem as radically impossible to finish by Shelley at the time of his death. Where do you go once you've figured out that the future (and the future of your poem) leads you into another ream of disaster? In this sense the unresolved poetic problem is also an unresolved philosophical and political problem. Shelley's palpable boredom with old solutions, however, should not lure us into concluding that he had given up on revolution. Quite the opposite: the unhappiness with fake endings is a reflex of a continued revolutionary project.</p>

<head>William Blake</head>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious Blake “disaster poem” is his Song of Experience, <title level="a">The Tyger.</title> The tiger itself is “burning” (1) like an asteroid fallen to Earth, “In the forests of the night” (2). It's thus no surprise that stars appear at a crucial moment:
            <quote>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="#indent2">When the stars threw down their spears </l>
<l rend="#indent2">And watered heaven with their tears</l>
<l rend="#indent2">Did he smile his work to see</l>
<l rend="#indent2">Did he who made the lamb make thee?</l>
</lg>
</quote>
          
         At the climax of the poem, Blake is satirizing the attitude that sees the tiger as a terrifying product of a terrifying God, akin to Hegel's beautiful soul, whose own gaze is the evil that it sees in the world at large (Hegel 383–409). The beautiful soul, for whom the world is evil, is a type of environmentalist ideology, which makes <title level="a">The Tyger</title> even more apt for our purposes (Morton, <title level="m">Ecology</title> 109–123). The narrator's description of the stars throwing down their spears arrives at the climax of a series of industrial and infernal images of the tiger's physical construction. The description serves as a kind of establishing shot that puts the artificer's handiwork in perspective, a wide-angle lens on the Universe. The narrator wishes to convey the cosmic dismay felt at the arrival of the tiger. </p>
<p>The personified stars do not portend evil in this case as true astral “disasters” would—they witness it. Their reaction of horrified pity is in accord with the narrator's objectifying, materialistic gaze—they are the evil they see. Evil thus already haunts the Universe, in the form of an unconscious subjectivity that sees certain phenomena as material embodiments of evil, as if from a great distance. If the stars are angelic titans (Lucifer being the chief among them), then God is the exception, the one that creates an evil universe, much to their dismay. Yet evil has already manifested in the form of an evil gaze. </p>
<p>Blake comes close to articulating a theory of disaster that is highly relevant to this essay's proposal that we think beyond disaster. This is unsurprising, since his work is ideology critique through and through, and since the materialism and capitalism that spawn disaster, and disaster thinking, were operational by the time he was writing. Like Hegel, Blake had figured out that ideas come bundled with unconscious attitudes, and he was determined to expose them. The portrayal of the tiger as terrifying misses the uncanny familiarity of the tiger, hinted at in the cuddly toy illumination that accompanies the poem. This missing of the mark resembles the way in which sublime Nature, objectified as wilderness, is set up to loom around, beyond and behind human activity like a distant mountain range. The reified sublimity passes too quickly over the distressing intimacy and “lameness” (to use an appropriate modern adjective) of human and nonhuman interaction. </p>

<head>William Wordsworth</head>
<p>The most ambiguous disaster ecology is found, unsurprisingly, in that master of ambiguity and anticlimax, William Wordsworth. The “dream of the Arab” episode, a spot of time that occurs in the fifth book of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, is strictly about an apocalyptic flood; and about poetry as the medium, the telephone, down which this telos is heard. Wordsworth's image within the dream of the book as telephonic shell is remarkably phonocentric: intriguingly spiraled and opaque, silent and mysterious, you don't even read it with your eyes, you have to put it to your ear: 
            <quote>
<lg type="stanza">

</quote>
                    
         Wordsworth has been said to open an imaginary space in which film technology becomes significant, in his liquid long form poems. Here he appears to do something similar to the telephone. What you hear when you hold it to your ear, like a pre-recorded message from the future, is the sound of the end of the world: who recorded it, this <foreign>phonos</foreign> of the <foreign>telos</foreign>? This sound, heard in the present moment of the beach as a hugely amplified ambient whisper like the sound of soft swirling waters in a seashell turned up high, is profoundly environmental in form as well as in content. The disturbingly evocative voice without a body is a floating sound coming from nowhere: in the term invented by Pierre Schaeffer, the pioneer of musique concrète, it is “acousmatic”—an automated sound that appears to come from no identifiable source (Morton, <title level="m">Ecology</title> 41–43).</p>
<p>This sound is a “blast,” sound as disaster, somewhere between an explosion and a fanfare on a brass instrument. Like a hi-fi speaker whose volume is dangerously high, the shell might cause pain: a message delivery system so potent that one becomes vividly aware of what Jakobson called the “contact,” the material medium of communication as such (Jakobson). The alarm-like blast wavers disturbingly between speech and noise and music (“harmony”): it is “loud” and “prophetic,” made of “articulate” sounds. Yet the sound is in a language the dreamer does not recognize—thus a language from a beyond, over the horizon, outside, reinforcing the notion that disaster is the outside impinging on an inside; a language that is doubly foreign, yet also a “tongue,” as if the narrator had a tongue in his ear. In the both–and logic of a dream (Freud asserts that the unconscious knows no negation), beautifully modeled in Wordsworth's description of simultaneous unintelligibility and intelligibility, the sound is both noise and meaning, recognized as such even though the words cannot be understood. Three possibilities are superimposed: the sound is inarticulate noise; the sound is articulate, meaningful yet not understood; the sound is meaningful and understood. </p>
<p>The telephonic shell is itself an alien technology, and the narrator's account of the Don Quixote-like Arab impressing him with shiny gadgets is reminiscent of first contact narratives. Yet the scene is inverted, as if modern technology (this is after all a highly ambiguous account of books and reading) arrived from another world onto English shores. With its shiny, iPhone-like nacre, the shell impresses, and the narrator perhaps appears to undergo the assumed embarrassment of the indigenous person who does not know what to do with the objects presented to him. Then space and time collapse in apocalyptic fashion, and suddenly the end of the world is “at hand.” One cannot help finding in this passage something that is indeed prophetic about the distance collapsing technologies of the last two centuries. It is particularly strange, this effect, considering that the entire passage is in the context of a meditation on the already existing technology of books. With their world-ending promises of instant presence, modern communication media do indeed resemble material symptoms of a disturbing new metaphysics. Many times ecological criticism has labeled technology as such disastrous, precisely insofar as it is the end of the world as a bounded place of distances and opacities and hidden corners—worlds need horizons, and global warming reduces these horizons to mere abstraction and false immediacy. </p>
<p>The immersive sound of the seashore, the quietness here amplified so as to threaten overwhelming (literally, over-whelming) noise, is heard throughout modern new age and environmental music as the sounds of a disaster-stricken planet: disappearing lifeworlds recorded for elegiac evocative pleasure. The innocent seeming hush of an environmental soundscape is thus a threat of imminent destruction: as if the recoding said, “I could be your last chance to hear a world such as this.” In these fragmentary voices of “real world” ambience, global capital and imperial power are audible both in their phantasmagorical energy and penetrating scientific gaze. Such fragile sonic worlds are objects of sadistic pleasure and Schadenfreude, as well as the more obvious marketing of the “oceanic feeling” that constitutes a core of the long history of consumerism (Morton, <title level="m">Ecology</title> 111–112). “World” is strictly a function of modernity, like the idea of the Middle Ages. </p>
<p>Like Magritte's <title level="m">
<foreign>La condition humaine</foreign>
</title>, a painting of a painting of a landscape placed within the landscape it has painted, such that the actual landscape overlaps with it, Wordsworth's narrator hears apocalyptic ambience on the seashore itself. This coincidence of fantasy and reality takes place within a dream whose dreamer is himself situated on a seashore. The dreamer awakens: the ocean is the same; disaster has been framed by the drag of the real. It's a typically Wordsworthian anticlimax, a “spot of time,” a record of weakness, failure and collapse. Wordsworth is enabling thinking to carry on around and through disaster. </p>
<p>As failure, it's the exact opposite of Freud's record of the dream of the burning boy, in which the boy signals that the dreamer must wake up and smell the real smoke. Perhaps the role of the dream in Wordsworth's poem is more like Lacan's reinterpretation of Freud: Lacan argues that to spare himself the anxiety of the murderous erotic fantasy, the dreamer awakens to the drag of the actual fire (Lacan 57–60, 68–70). The real disaster would be remaining within the dream and giving vent to one's violent fantasies. This is indeed salutary in an ecological sense. Environmentalism is perhaps nothing but the desire that one's dream—that one inhabits a meaningful and immersive “lifeworld” surrounded by familiar but not uncanny nonhumans—remain undisturbed. The persistence of this dream inhibits directly intervening in the realm of “life on Earth” for the sake of life forms. In this sense, as counter-intuitive as it sounds, environmentalism is hostile to ecology. </p>

<dateline>March 4, 2013</dateline>
<p>Once upon a time (or so the story goes) only six male poets made up the field of British Romanticism, but in the mid-1980s, born out of the body of Anglo-American feminist scholarship, poststructuralism, and French psychoanalytical criticism, there emerged a counter narrative of literary production and achievement in the period. Anne Mellor was at the forefront of a group of scholars intent upon the recovery and critical engagement of Romantic women writers either neglected (Mary Wollstonecraft and Mary Shelley), misplaced (Jane Austen) or simply forgotten (Anna Barbauld, Charlotte Smith, Felicia Hemans, Letitia Landon, and myriad others). </p>
<p>In the interview that follows, Mellor recounts her determined commitment to rethinking Romanticism through the lens of gender. Already the author of several books and articles on canonical male figures, including <title level="m">Blake’s Human Form Divine</title> (1974) and <title level="m">English Romantic Irony</title> (1980), the second stage of Mellor’s career began in 1988 with Routledge’s dual publication of <title level="m">Mary Shelley: Her Life, Her Fiction, Her Monsters</title> and <title level="m">Romanticism and Feminism. </title>The first volume set about reconsidering the literary output of Mary Shelley and was central in recovering her as a powerful author in her own right, rather than as William Godwin’s daughter or Percy Bysshe Shelley’s wife. <title level="m">Romanticism and Feminism</title> introduced readers to Mellor’s concept of masculine and feminine romanticism in a collection of essays on both male and female Romantic authors penned by influential critics including Stuart Curran, Alan Richardson, and Susan Wolfson. </p>
<p>With the publication of <title level="m">Romanticism and Gender </title>(1993) and <title level="m">Mothers of the </title>
<title level="m">Nation: women’s political writing in England, 1780-1830</title> (2000), Mellor offered scholars of the period critical analysis of texts long neglected (most notably perhaps Charlotte Smith’s novels and Letitia Landon’s poetry), even as she posed questions meant to urge readers towards further engagement with thorny critical questions: What difference <title level="m">does</title> gender make? What constituted a woman’s authority in the period, as author and social activist? Why shouldn’t we reclaim Hannah More as well as Mary Wollstonecraft?</p>
<p>I first met Anne Mellor in 1986 as a graduate student at UCLA. It was impossible not to be caught up in her enthusiasm and she quickly swept away my preconceptions of the Romantic period. Although I had entered graduate school intent upon studying Virginia Woolf and Modernism, Anne’s lively seminars and vibrant commitment to this radically new concept of Romanticism changed my direction, as it would many others. </p>
<p>The interview that follows took place about a year ago on a very sunny March afternoon in the living room of Anne’s Los Angeles home, which has also been the meeting place of the UCLA Romantic Study Group. We ranged widely over many topics, from Anne’s education and career to her thoughts about the current state of Romanticism, particularly in regards to feminist literary criticism and the ongoing recovery of women writers. Throughout our conversation Anne generously acknowledged her own teachers, even as she frequently brought recent work of her own students into the discussion. Although joyfully anticipating retirement, her continuing enthusiasm about classroom engagement was evident and she was deep into planning her first Jane Austen course. As I write this introduction several months later, Anne has taught her first Austen course, been honored by peers at NASSR, MLA and the Clark Library, and is more set then ever on a busy retirement. And yet, as the interview reveals, she retains her commitment to further developing our still relatively new narrative of Romanticism. In the audio clips attached to the transcription, Anne’s intellectual curiosity resonates, as her voice continues to prompt the reader to return to the texts, the archives, and the critical concerns of Feminist Romanticism. In Anne’s case “retirement” can only be considered a misnomer; her prodigious scholarly publication ensures that her voice will continue to change stories of Romanticism for all of us.</p>

<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> Do you feel that your work comes out of the classroom or do you see it more of as an organic process between research and teaching? </p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Interesting, whether it is organic. I mean, if you go right back to the beginning it came out of passions. You know, that I loved art history as much as I liked literature so I was looking around for something—a dissertation topic that would allow me to do visual culture as well as verbal culture. And that’s what led me to Blake, that and the fact that I had taken a fabulous graduate course when I was an undergraduate at Brown with S. Foster Damon, who was the great man who brought Blake into the canon. And then I was an undergraduate philosophy major, as well as English major, and so I had always been interested in philosophical questions, so that took me to the next project on Romantic Irony, which was really about a philosophical system, [and] what happens if you think of the universe as not having any order, as being profoundly chaotic.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: I was looking at <hi rendition="#italic">Romantic Irony </hi>and I noticed that even there, your interest in visual culture is highlighted by the inclusion of a print at the opening <hi rendition="#italic">[<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: Yes, right, right!]</hi> and you actually talk about the significance of that image . . <hi rendition="#italic">. </hi>
</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: Yes, it is that great Thomas Bewick, little landscape, little man riding horseback through the landscape, and then his thumb print over it. Right, so, it exists but it doesn’t exist, and it exists as an authorial creation but it’s also a de-creation because he is erasing it. Yes, I was so happy [<hi rendition="#italic">Laughing</hi>] when I found that little image, because it summed it all up.</p>
<p rend="noCount">And then it was—well, by then I was teaching at Stanford—it was the early 1980s. All through the Vietnam War I had been very caught up in anti-war efforts at Stanford and actually led the faculty move to get rid of ROTC on the Stanford campus, which they brought back last year [by the way]. And so time passes. [Anyway] out of that—out of all those liberation movements, you know, civil rights and the woman’s movement, and so on—in 1980 I made a professional oath, a political and personal oath to only work on women, because I hadn’t done much work on women, no one had in Romanticism. So that is when I started looking around for who were the under discussed and undervalued women in the period. Jane Austen of course, but there had been work on Austen. She wasn’t actually regarded as a Romantic but nonetheless there had been good solid scholarly work on her. </p>
<p rend="noCount">[So] I looked around and the next [author] was Mary Shelley and no one had actually spent much serious time thinking about <hi rendition="#italic">Frankenstein</hi> because they had been dismissing it as a children’s book or science fiction, and therefore outside of the canon of Romanticism. And all the time I was in graduate school, I don’t think that I ever read anything by Mary Shelley except her notes on Percy Shelley’s poems. [<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: <hi rendition="#italic">I’m quite sure that when I was an undergraduate I read absolutely nothing by any woman writer of the period</hi>]. </p>
<p rend="noCount">Right. And the notion that <hi rendition="#italic">Frankenstein</hi> [was ignored] in all of these courses on Romantic poetry as mythmaking [is amazing]; [and] I was teaching them myself . None of [us] thought about <hi rendition="#italic">Frankenstein</hi> as the greatest enduring myth from the Romantic period. It is the only one that is really still with us every day.</p>

<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AME:</hi> I got interested in feminist science fiction back in the early 80s when it was modeling all sorts of alternative utopian possibilities for gender relations, [and] for sex identity. And it really got me thinking about what sex-based characteristics are really located in biology and which ones are social constructions. And that was when I was very much caught up with feminist theory and founded the Feminist Studies program at Stanford University. I had a reading group where we were—Nan Kahane was in it, I remember, and Shelley Rosaldo—where we were really actively interrogating all sorts of classical assumptions about sex differences. And I was reading Wollstonecraft at the same time –I was working on Mary Shelley but obviously reading a lot of Wollstonecraft in preparation for that—and Wollstonecraft herself is constantly interrogating the differences and the fact that there are really no significant differences between males and females. In fact I used Wollstonecraft in that article on Ursula LeGuin because I was really thinking about how you represent political utopias—sexual-gender utopias.</p>
<p rend="noCount">So, Ursula LeGuin’s <hi rendition="#italic">The Left Hand of Darkness</hi>: what fascinated me was that a person goes into a kenning house—a mating house—and becomes male or female depending on the person they happen to be sitting next to. One time you can be male, one time you can be female. And I thought that was really revelatory of the fact that we play different roles in relationships.  Nothing is fixed [or] static through one’s whole lifetime. So that really helped me to then later think through the issues that I wanted to raise in <hi rendition="#italic">Romanticism and Gender</hi> and also <hi rendition="#italic">Romanticism and Feminism.</hi>
</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> . . . and really to think of it as a “gendering,” so the ability of Keats to occupy the position of feminine romanticism.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: Right, that femininity is a social construction, it’s not based on biology and the same with masculinity and that they change over time, and of course different cultures have different concepts of what is masculine and feminine. Now, of course, even at the level of biological sexuality, we now know about intersex in a way we didn’t years ago. So, all along, I’ve been thinking these are not things that are fixed in time or the body, although the body enacts them, performs them, as Judith Butler has taught us.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> The other thing that I read from early on, was an article from 1989 “The Politics of Literary Study” and I was fascinated to learn that—<hi rendition="#italic">[<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Now you’ll have to remind me about what that one was about.]</hi>—well what you said was that your next book would be called “The Two Romanticisms,” and so that got me thinking: Did you mean <hi rendition="#italic">Romanticism and Feminism</hi> or <hi rendition="#italic">Romanticism and Gender?</hi> but also what was at stake in changing your title . . . </p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: Well, the two Romanticisms were going to be masculine romanticism and feminine romanticism—it was <hi rendition="#italic">Romanticism and Gender</hi>. Because how I was thinking through it—I mean—what I was struck by, of course, coming back to the whole canon of romanticism from a feminist perspective was a) the absence of women writers most strikingly and b) the absence of any discussion about what difference sex [and] sexual identity—the fact that these were all male writers—made to their writing. </p>
<p rend="noCount">So, the project of <hi rendition="#italic">Romanticism and Gender</hi> was really twofold. It was to unpack what difference gender made to the writing of male Romantic writers, how they tended to promote—in very subtle ways—a masculinization of the universe. I mean, most tellingly perhaps in Wordsworth’s <hi rendition="#italic">Prelude</hi>. In the final book of the <hi rendition="#italic">Prelude</hi>, where nature has been female all the way along and been something that resists the male poet, and then suddenly becomes the brother of the male poet, the moment at which he, in effect, whatever word you want to use, colonizes, cannibalizes or at least authorizes himself to speak <hi rendition="#italic">for</hi> Nature.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> Incorporates . . .?</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Yes, although at the very end of the book, Nature returns as the female—something that cannot be entirely incorporated comfortably. But I was interested in exploring <hi rendition="#italic">that</hi>, the whole ideology of masculinity, which not only represented nature as female and appropriate-able, but also took the heroic masculine quest narrative as central. Privileged the individual encountering the sublime, something eternal, infinite, outside himself and his own relationship to it. Privileged the imagination as that which could, in a sense,  create a world unto itself. Privileged political revolutions as acts of individuals overthrowing any kind of oppression, restraint. </p>
<p rend="noCount">And then when I started reading the women writers of the period realized that these were not their values at all. And that’s when I started thinking about the existence of a second—a feminine romanticism—one that was much more based on the individual in relation to other individuals, on families, on communities. Not political revolution, because it caused too much damage to families and children and mothers, but gradual evolution. And a notion of nature as—because nature was female—someone—a mother—but also someone with whom one collaborated, cooperated, rather than fought against or tried to take over. An ethic of care as opposed to an ethic of justice, and a whole different way of seeing the world.</p>
<p rend="noCount">Now one could argue, and I did subsequently argue, that feminine romanticism actually was very similar to eighteenth-century enlightenment values, the privileging of reason over the imagination, and of course led directly, almost seamlessly into what we think of as Victorian literary culture. Hannah More being central to this project. So feminine romanticism doesn’t stand out uniquely from what went before or what comes after.</p>

<p rend="noCount">But I now realize that the reason I fell in love with those poems was because I fell in love with my teacher of those poems, D.J. Hughes, and those were his two favorite poems. He taught them with so much energy and enthusiasm and insight that I just became fascinated by Percy Shelley’s—way before the moment we had the language for it—deconstructive concept of language: how language creates the universe and creates its own next sentence: the infinite deferral of language. So, that’s what made me into a philosophy major. I got into thinking about all sorts of epistemological and ontological issues through Percy Shelley.  So I actually owe my career to Percy Shelley.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: And I wonder too, from my perspective of you, [that] you are a political idealist in a lot of ways, <hi rendition="#italic">[<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Oh yeah.]</hi> and that’s clear from reading what you’ve written over the years. There is an aspect of [Shelley’s] <hi rendition="#italic">Prometheus Unbound</hi> in your writing—it is so utopian—the difference is that you aren’t content with a retreat to the cave in the end.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> No, and I’m also not content with the unborn soul and the return to the originary chaos of Act IV of <hi rendition="#italic">Prometheus Unbound</hi>. I want to see actual social improvement on the ground in the world in which we actually live, not withdrawing into a cave either. And also, the more I worked on Mary Shelley, the more critical I became of Percy Shelley’s concept of gender and sexual relations, as well as of his personal biographical behavior to his wife and children.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: How were you taught <hi rendition="#italic">Epipsychidion</hi>? You taught me the poem.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>:  I was passing on the way I had been taught. D. J. Hughes was a poet himself [and] completely identified with Percy Shelley, so he read it as a great celebration of the power of metaphor. He has a wonderful article on coherence and collapse in “Epipsychidion” and so it was always how a metaphor generates another metaphor. Metaphor is never adequate unto itself.  It really led me to the whole concept of Romantic Irony, which I got through Frederick Schlegel as well, but when I started thinking about it in relation to <hi rendition="#italic">Epipsychidion</hi>, that there is no stability in language finally but it is just the poet who creates the world, but then also undercuts it by creating another metaphor. So, that was the way I was originally reading <hi rendition="#italic">Epipsychidion</hi> and <hi rendition="#italic">Prometheus Unbound</hi> and finally Romantic Irony as such. </p>
<p rend="noCount">Going back to <hi rendition="#italic">Epipsychidion</hi>, its that sister-spouse incest metaphor that <hi rendition="#italic">now</hi> fascinates me because I think one of the things that’s going on there, is, if you think about incest as a primary Romantic trope, and think of it as the trope that is the dark underbelly of the overt political utopian thinking. When you have a celebration of hierarchy and patriarchy then the dark underside of that, of course, is father/daughter incest and Mary Shelley explores that and Percy Shelley explores that in <hi rendition="#italic">The Cenci</hi>.</p>
<p rend="noCount">But if you move to democracy as your alternative to patriarchy [and] to monarchy then the dark underside becomes—if everyone is created equal, if brothers and sisters are equal, we’re having liberty, equality, fraternity—then the dark underside becomes brother-sister incest; that the brother can only love Mary, the woman who is just like him. This is Manfred [too], the narcissist projection of the self as the one who completes the self. And this is also Percy Shelley in the essay on love: the prototype finding its antitype. And this is where <hi rendition="#italic">Epipsychidion</hi> ends, [with the] sister-spouse. So finally, all of those metaphorical accumulations come back to this narcissistic projection of the primary self. </p>

<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> So here we are in Anne’s living room, and I just wanted to open by saying how happy I am to be here, where I’ve had so many wonderful experiences with the UCLA Romantic Study Group. I thought that we would start with you talking a little bit about that group, how it came into being, how long you’ve been doing it, and which were the most notable talks you remember.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Oh interesting. It started when I first came to UCLA, which would be 1985 or 1986. And actually I had been down here—my husband had been teaching here for 10 years before that—and I had come down and there had been a single such meeting (I think that it was at Reg Foakes’s house) and when I came back I expected this to be an ongoing thing, and no, it had dropped out, nobody had done it since. And so, I decided, <hi rendition="#italic">oh</hi>, it was so great, let’s start it again. It has actually gone on now since 1986. We meet three times a year, in this living room; you were here many times. It is mainly for faculty and graduate students at all the related institutions, so people come from Santa Barbara, Irvine, Caltech, Pepperdine, and USC, of course. It is usually around 20 or 25 people. Someone comes and gives a talk and then there is wine and cheese and discussion before and after. Graduate students really like it because they get to meet the faculty at other institutions, and the graduate students at other institutions get to meet other graduate students, since there aren’t that many at other institutions.</p>
<p rend="noCount">So, best talks over the years, there have been so many good ones . . . </p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> I remember that one that Alan Liu gave about installation art in England and Wordsworth.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Andy Goldsworthy’s work, yeah. <hi rendition="#italic">[<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: Yes! I loved that talk.]</hi> I mean there have been so many good ones, I don’t think that I could possibly choose.  Jonathan Sachs just gave a really good one on different modes of time in Romantic writing. I remember Nancy Armstrong gave one when she was out here, it was really good.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> I think that you’re right. [The Romantic Study Group] gave me the opportunity as a grad student to meet faculty. I remember that I met Kevin Gilmartin here years ago for the first time. In fact, it was through him that I met Orrin Wang, who came up with the idea for this interview.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Kevin has given several talks here; the last one was on his work on Hazlitt. He also did one on conservative print culture, and way back when, on radical print culture. Meg Russett—I mean there are certain local faculty whose careers the group has actually tracked—Meg just did one on teaching Romanticism in Turkey, which was fascinating, [it was] on the defamiliarization of texts in a foreign language that I’m hoping that she’ll publish. Julie Carlson has given several talks . . .</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> Giving talks here has always helped me develop material into something that I wanted to take further. We’re doing a group at UGA now. <hi rendition="#italic">[<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: Oh good!]</hi> Chloe Wigston Smith started the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>- and 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>-Century Colloquium in British Literature. Paul Hunter just gave a great talk on poetry and Paula Feldman is coming to talk on the Mary Tighe biography. Chloe asked me to help co-direct it and I did so in part because of my memories of the UCLA Romantic Study Group. It is a great thing.</p>
<p rend="noCount">So who is going to keep it going after you retire? <hi rendition="#italic">[<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: It’s a question. It’s a question.]</hi> You could [still] do it Anne…</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: Well, I said that I would continue to volunteer the space. I was just talking to my colleague Saree Makdisi to see about carrying it on, and asked him to help me locate speakers, since I won’t be traveling as much to conferences. Because we can’t pay anybody, it’s really people doing it out of the generosity of their hearts. So we really have to rely on people coming through Los Angeles anyway, typically to the Huntington. [Additional banter on the Huntington excised from transcript]</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi>  I thought that we could turn to some of your recent work. The whole notion of you retiring or semi-retiring seems unbelievable to me and most other people.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Well, it will sort of be a phased retirement. I am now scheduled to retire at the end of this year, June 2013, but I’ll go on teaching half-time after that for at least three years and more if the department needs me.</p>
<!-- <p rend="noCount">
             <hi rend="bold">[1. Audio Clip could begin here: Mellor One 5:10]</hi>  
             </p> -->
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> Do you feel that your work comes out of the classroom or do you see it more of as an organic process between research and teaching? </p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Interesting, whether it is organic. I mean, if you go right back to the beginning it came out of passions. You know, that I loved art history as much as I liked literature so I was looking around for something—a dissertation topic that would allow me to do visual culture as well as verbal culture. And that’s what led me to Blake, that and the fact that I had taken a fabulous graduate course when I was an undergraduate at Brown with S. Foster Damon, who was the great man who brought Blake into the canon. And then I was an undergraduate philosophy major, as well as English major, and so I had always been interested in philosophical questions, so that took me to the next project on Romantic Irony, which was really about a philosophical system, [and] what happens if you think of the universe as not having any order, as being profoundly chaotic.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: I was looking at <hi rendition="#italic">Romantic Irony </hi>and I noticed that even there, your interest in visual culture is highlighted by the inclusion of a print at the opening <hi rendition="#italic">[<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: Yes, right, right!]</hi> and you actually talk about the significance of that image . . <hi rendition="#italic">. </hi>
</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: Yes, it is that great Thomas Bewick, little landscape, little man riding horseback through the landscape, and then his thumb print over it. Right, so, it exists but it doesn’t exist, and it exists as an authorial creation but it’s also a de-creation because he is erasing it. Yes, I was so happy [<hi rendition="#italic">Laughing</hi>] when I found that little image, because it summed it all up.</p>
<p rend="noCount">And then it was—well, by then I was teaching at Stanford—it was the early 1980s. All through the Vietnam War I had been very caught up in anti-war efforts at Stanford and actually led the faculty move to get rid of ROTC on the Stanford campus, which they brought back last year [by the way]. And so time passes. [Anyway] out of that—out of all those liberation movements, you know, civil rights and the woman’s movement, and so on—in 1980 I made a professional oath, a political and personal oath to only work on women, because I hadn’t done much work on women, no one had in Romanticism. So that is when I started looking around for who were the under discussed and undervalued women in the period. Jane Austen of course, but there had been work on Austen. She wasn’t actually regarded as a Romantic but nonetheless there had been good solid scholarly work on her. </p>
<p rend="noCount">[So] I looked around and the next [author] was Mary Shelley and no one had actually spent much serious time thinking about <hi rendition="#italic">Frankenstein</hi> because they had been dismissing it as a children’s book or science fiction, and therefore outside of the canon of Romanticism. And all the time I was in graduate school, I don’t think that I ever read anything by Mary Shelley except her notes on Percy Shelley’s poems. [<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: <hi rendition="#italic">I’m quite sure that when I was an undergraduate I read absolutely nothing by any woman writer of the period</hi>]. </p>
<p rend="noCount">Right. And the notion that <hi rendition="#italic">Frankenstein</hi> [was ignored] in all of these courses on Romantic poetry as mythmaking [is amazing]; [and] I was teaching them myself . None of [us] thought about <hi rendition="#italic">Frankenstein</hi> as the greatest enduring myth from the Romantic period. It is the only one that is really still with us every day.</p>
<!-- <p rend="noCount">
             <hi rend="bold">[Audio Clip could end here: Mellor One 8:37]</hi>  
             </p> -->
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: I just taught <hi rendition="#italic">Frankenstein </hi>in a novel course, and my students couldn’t believe how deeply embedded their ideas about <hi rendition="#italic">Frankenstein </hi>were. It is the one text that you come to in the Romantic period—maybe the other one is  “I wandered lonely as a cloud”—where the students have really strong opinions <hi rendition="#italic">[<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: Without ever having read the text.]</hi> Exactly. And in both cases, they have such a different sense of it once they finish reading. They are very interesting works to teach because you see the students’ perceptions changing as you talk about them.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Yes, well just having the narrator and having the Creature speak—because they have all seen the [James] Whale movie where he never speaks and all the parodies of that, and just hearing the story from his point of view is an entirely different experience. And there is now the fabulous—<hi rendition="#italic">have you seen it?</hi>—[Danny Boyle’s] National Theatre production of <hi rendition="#italic">Frankenstein. </hi>It is absolutely brilliant. It was in London in the National Theatre and then it was one of their high-definition in movie theater telecasts, and I think that it will come back that way. </p>
<p rend="noCount">Benedict [Cumberbatch] playing the creature is just unforgettable. And you have to see it. It is just . . . It starts off from a big red bubble and then the Creature emerges from that covered in blood like a newborn baby but full-size of course.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> Do you see the effect of literary criticism on that production?</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Oh yeah, first of all that it is insisting on the Creature as the protagonist, and not Victor Frankenstein. And it clearly makes the issue of parenting and the failure of parenting central to the play.  So Victor Frankenstein comes in, takes one look at this newborn baby, and says “Damn” and runs out again, and you don’t see him again until the second act. [<hi rendition="#italic">Laughing]</hi>
</p>

I said that I was a philosophy major—they <hi rendition="#italic">really</hi> wanted me to go to graduate school in philosophy, the philosophers did at Brown—and it was a very strong philosophy department. But I realized talking to them that everything was at this level of abstraction and that they had eliminated all of the concrete, messy details that I really was interested in. If I’d not done a Ph.D. in literature it would have been in Art History. I just found so much pleasure in looking at works of  art and still do. In fact, the last piece that I was working on—this one I haven’t published yet because it is getting harder and harder to publish anything with visual images because of copyright—but it is on Turner as a Romantic Ironist and re-reading all of his images of Venice. </p>

And I’m going to read her—this is <hi rendition="#italic">me</hi>, this is <hi rendition="#italic">my</hi> Jane Austen—through Wollstonecraft. Implicitly arguing that—well, explicitly arguing but the documentation just isn’t there—that Jane Austen read Wollstonecraft, absorbed her deeply, and thought through all of Wollstonecraft’s major issues in her novels. And I’m coming to this conclusion—partially because I’ve worked so much on Wollstonecraft—[because] I just keep hearing quotations [<hi rendition="#italic">in Austen’s novels</hi>], never with quotation marks but the words are word for word from <hi rendition="#italic">Vindication of the Rights of Woman </hi>and scholars have just ignored all this because there’s no evidence in her letters or anywhere else.

<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> The way I’m reading it—[and] I agree [that] you can read Fanny Price as an evangelical Christian heroine, or a patriot, or [as] Saree Makdisi wants to read her as a self-regulated heroine who promotes this heteronormative self-regulation—[but] I’m reading her through two texts really.

Elizabeth Bennett is the feisty, Jacobin liberated heroine up to a point, although she feels enormous amounts of gratitude to Darcy always. But she is being inserted finally into an existing structure, she’s not going to change the running of Pemberley. Anne Elliot is going to create a new model of household management, not one that exists, although the model is Sophia Croft and Admiral Croft.

<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AME:</hi> I got interested in feminist science fiction back in the early 80s when it was modeling all sorts of alternative utopian possibilities for gender relations, [and] for sex identity. And it really got me thinking about what sex-based characteristics are really located in biology and which ones are social constructions. And that was when I was very much caught up with feminist theory and founded the Feminist Studies program at Stanford University. I had a reading group where we were—Nan Kahane was in it, I remember, and Shelley Rosaldo—where we were really actively interrogating all sorts of classical assumptions about sex differences. And I was reading Wollstonecraft at the same time –I was working on Mary Shelley but obviously reading a lot of Wollstonecraft in preparation for that—and Wollstonecraft herself is constantly interrogating the differences and the fact that there are really no significant differences between males and females. In fact I used Wollstonecraft in that article on Ursula LeGuin because I was really thinking about how you represent political utopias—sexual-gender utopias.</p>
<p rend="noCount">So, Ursula LeGuin’s <hi rendition="#italic">The Left Hand of Darkness</hi>: what fascinated me was that a person goes into a kenning house—a mating house—and becomes male or female depending on the person they happen to be sitting next to. One time you can be male, one time you can be female. And I thought that was really revelatory of the fact that we play different roles in relationships.  Nothing is fixed [or] static through one’s whole lifetime. So that really helped me to then later think through the issues that I wanted to raise in <hi rendition="#italic">Romanticism and Gender</hi> and also <hi rendition="#italic">Romanticism and Feminism.</hi>
</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> . . . and really to think of it as a “gendering,” so the ability of Keats to occupy the position of feminine romanticism.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: Right, that femininity is a social construction, it’s not based on biology and the same with masculinity and that they change over time, and of course different cultures have different concepts of what is masculine and feminine. Now, of course, even at the level of biological sexuality, we now know about intersex in a way we didn’t years ago. So, all along, I’ve been thinking these are not things that are fixed in time or the body, although the body enacts them, performs them, as Judith Butler has taught us.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> The other thing that I read from early on, was an article from 1989 “The Politics of Literary Study” and I was fascinated to learn that—<hi rendition="#italic">[<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Now you’ll have to remind me about what that one was about.]</hi>—well what you said was that your next book would be called “The Two Romanticisms,” and so that got me thinking: Did you mean <hi rendition="#italic">Romanticism and Feminism</hi> or <hi rendition="#italic">Romanticism and Gender?</hi> but also what was at stake in changing your title . . . </p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: Well, the two Romanticisms were going to be masculine romanticism and feminine romanticism—it was <hi rendition="#italic">Romanticism and Gender</hi>. Because how I was thinking through it—I mean—what I was struck by, of course, coming back to the whole canon of romanticism from a feminist perspective was a) the absence of women writers most strikingly and b) the absence of any discussion about what difference sex [and] sexual identity—the fact that these were all male writers—made to their writing. </p>
<p rend="noCount">So, the project of <hi rendition="#italic">Romanticism and Gender</hi> was really twofold. It was to unpack what difference gender made to the writing of male Romantic writers, how they tended to promote—in very subtle ways—a masculinization of the universe. I mean, most tellingly perhaps in Wordsworth’s <hi rendition="#italic">Prelude</hi>. In the final book of the <hi rendition="#italic">Prelude</hi>, where nature has been female all the way along and been something that resists the male poet, and then suddenly becomes the brother of the male poet, the moment at which he, in effect, whatever word you want to use, colonizes, cannibalizes or at least authorizes himself to speak <hi rendition="#italic">for</hi> Nature.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> Incorporates . . .?</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Yes, although at the very end of the book, Nature returns as the female—something that cannot be entirely incorporated comfortably. But I was interested in exploring <hi rendition="#italic">that</hi>, the whole ideology of masculinity, which not only represented nature as female and appropriate-able, but also took the heroic masculine quest narrative as central. Privileged the individual encountering the sublime, something eternal, infinite, outside himself and his own relationship to it. Privileged the imagination as that which could, in a sense,  create a world unto itself. Privileged political revolutions as acts of individuals overthrowing any kind of oppression, restraint. </p>
<p rend="noCount">And then when I started reading the women writers of the period realized that these were not their values at all. And that’s when I started thinking about the existence of a second—a feminine romanticism—one that was much more based on the individual in relation to other individuals, on families, on communities. Not political revolution, because it caused too much damage to families and children and mothers, but gradual evolution. And a notion of nature as—because nature was female—someone—a mother—but also someone with whom one collaborated, cooperated, rather than fought against or tried to take over. An ethic of care as opposed to an ethic of justice, and a whole different way of seeing the world.</p>
<p rend="noCount">Now one could argue, and I did subsequently argue, that feminine romanticism actually was very similar to eighteenth-century enlightenment values, the privileging of reason over the imagination, and of course led directly, almost seamlessly into what we think of as Victorian literary culture. Hannah More being central to this project. So feminine romanticism doesn’t stand out uniquely from what went before or what comes after.</p>

<p rend="noCount">But I now realize that the reason I fell in love with those poems was because I fell in love with my teacher of those poems, D.J. Hughes, and those were his two favorite poems. He taught them with so much energy and enthusiasm and insight that I just became fascinated by Percy Shelley’s—way before the moment we had the language for it—deconstructive concept of language: how language creates the universe and creates its own next sentence: the infinite deferral of language. So, that’s what made me into a philosophy major. I got into thinking about all sorts of epistemological and ontological issues through Percy Shelley.  So I actually owe my career to Percy Shelley.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: And I wonder too, from my perspective of you, [that] you are a political idealist in a lot of ways, <hi rendition="#italic">[<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Oh yeah.]</hi> and that’s clear from reading what you’ve written over the years. There is an aspect of [Shelley’s] <hi rendition="#italic">Prometheus Unbound</hi> in your writing—it is so utopian—the difference is that you aren’t content with a retreat to the cave in the end.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> No, and I’m also not content with the unborn soul and the return to the originary chaos of Act IV of <hi rendition="#italic">Prometheus Unbound</hi>. I want to see actual social improvement on the ground in the world in which we actually live, not withdrawing into a cave either. And also, the more I worked on Mary Shelley, the more critical I became of Percy Shelley’s concept of gender and sexual relations, as well as of his personal biographical behavior to his wife and children.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: How were you taught <hi rendition="#italic">Epipsychidion</hi>? You taught me the poem.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>:  I was passing on the way I had been taught. D. J. Hughes was a poet himself [and] completely identified with Percy Shelley, so he read it as a great celebration of the power of metaphor. He has a wonderful article on coherence and collapse in “Epipsychidion” and so it was always how a metaphor generates another metaphor. Metaphor is never adequate unto itself.  It really led me to the whole concept of Romantic Irony, which I got through Frederick Schlegel as well, but when I started thinking about it in relation to <hi rendition="#italic">Epipsychidion</hi>, that there is no stability in language finally but it is just the poet who creates the world, but then also undercuts it by creating another metaphor. So, that was the way I was originally reading <hi rendition="#italic">Epipsychidion</hi> and <hi rendition="#italic">Prometheus Unbound</hi> and finally Romantic Irony as such. </p>
<p rend="noCount">Going back to <hi rendition="#italic">Epipsychidion</hi>, its that sister-spouse incest metaphor that <hi rendition="#italic">now</hi> fascinates me because I think one of the things that’s going on there, is, if you think about incest as a primary Romantic trope, and think of it as the trope that is the dark underbelly of the overt political utopian thinking. When you have a celebration of hierarchy and patriarchy then the dark underside of that, of course, is father/daughter incest and Mary Shelley explores that and Percy Shelley explores that in <hi rendition="#italic">The Cenci</hi>.</p>
<p rend="noCount">But if you move to democracy as your alternative to patriarchy [and] to monarchy then the dark underside becomes—if everyone is created equal, if brothers and sisters are equal, we’re having liberty, equality, fraternity—then the dark underside becomes brother-sister incest; that the brother can only love Mary, the woman who is just like him. This is Manfred [too], the narcissist projection of the self as the one who completes the self. And this is also Percy Shelley in the essay on love: the prototype finding its antitype. And this is where <hi rendition="#italic">Epipsychidion</hi> ends, [with the] sister-spouse. So finally, all of those metaphorical accumulations come back to this narcissistic projection of the primary self. </p>

<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> Who is the object of desire for the feminine romantic writer?</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: Well, one of the things that always strikes you when you read a lot of women’s writing in this period, is how many of the protagonists—well, first of all, the authors are either unhappily married or never married—the protagonists are all in courtship novels. And then you have to look at exactly what kind of men they end up married to but often the marriages seem, at least from a modern feminist perspective, as somewhat ….</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> . . . unsatisfying?</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: <hi rendition="#italic">[Laughs]</hi> Well, not egalitarian anyway, not quite companionate marriages that we hope for now. So I keep going back to that wonderful Wollstonecraft image in <hi rendition="#italic">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</hi> where the ideal woman is finally the widow, with her children, who has gotten rid of the husband and carried on quite successfully without him. </p>
<p rend="noCount">The object of desire is always the idealized partner, the male who is going to be the perfect partner who is going to consult you, and respect you, and give you equal authority in the household, but even beyond the household. The novels are all sort of moving towards that but never quite confident that they’ve gotten there, so they never quite represent those marriages in any kind of long term way.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: And the novels that do represent marriage tend to represent failed marriages or marriages of confusion or . . .</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: . . . or abusive marriages one way or another.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: It seems that Gaskell’s <hi rendition="#italic">North and South</hi> has an attractive hero in a way that is so rare to find. But that is a novel that ends again without the marriage being represented</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Right, and all the Jane Austen ones where you don’t get the marriage represented. [Additional banter on Austen excised from transcript]</p>

<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Let me say one more thing about what women desire. It depends on the genre of course, if you go to the Gothic novel, you know, they are actually desiring the mad, bad dangerous to know man. And there is this whole issue of female sexual desire. 
            <hi rend="bold">[RE: . . . </hi>[desire] for the father?<hi rend="bold">]</hi>
            Yes, female sexual desire getting mapped onto existing hierarchical relations. Or, and I’m really thinking now about <hi rendition="#italic">Zofloya</hi>, getting mapped onto the totally inaccessible exotic other, whether he is Moor or Satan, as the novel finally wants you to think. I actually think he is the Moor, and then just because she is trying to impose a good conventional Christian ending, making it acceptable to her readers, so she turns him into Satan. But she is really desiring the racial other, the cultural other, the one that is really not available.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> I just taught <hi rendition="#italic">The Italian</hi> and what struck me there were the scenes of yearning for something else that isn’t contained by any of the figures in the text. All of those scenes of the sublime! Whatever is outside the window is really what is desired and it is nebulous.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Right, Vivaldi certainly doesn’t live up to it, or Valencourt.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> I think Godolphin is an interesting object of desire in Charlotte Smith’s <hi rendition="#italic">Emmeline</hi>, where we have a double hero. The unattractive hero fortunately dies midway through and then we have Godolphin associated with the sublime landscape, and his own kind of solitude, which seems a [better] possibility.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> What these women writers realize, starting with Wollstonecraft, and all the way through, it that there is a real crisis of masculinity in the Romantic era. On the one hand, you have the libertine rake, leftover from the eighteenth century, and the aristocratic Byronic figure, who is attractive but totally unsatisfying as husband material. Then you have the man of sensibility, who is weeping all of the time, ineffective and impotent in lots of ways, and so that’s not going to work, and they are really trying to imagine something else . . . </p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: . . . or the tyrant . . . and they often morph into each other over the course of a three-volume novel . . .</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> They are really trying to define a new type of man. What Wollstonecraft defines as the modest man, the middle-class bourgeois professional, robust, benevolent figure, but they come across as kind of stick figures because [the writers] don’t have a lot of experience of such people. I’m thinking of Maria Edgworth’s <hi rendition="#italic">Belinda.</hi> Mr. Percival is clearly the ideal man, but there aren’t a lot of him around and her heroine doesn’t get one. She gets a reformed rake in a way. Clarence Hervey, nice guy, but not very responsible or reliable and prone to make terrible mistakes. Mr. Knightley is sort of in that category, but he is a little too overbearing, and he lectures and hectors [Emma]. Wentworth is clearly Jane Austen’s attempt to define that new professional self-made man, but he also is capable of pride and jealousy and vindictiveness.</p>

<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: So Austen’s attempt to mediate between that man of sensibility and the rake [since] Wentworth is so associated with potential rakishness and piracy.</p>

<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: Let’s conclude by thinking about where you see the field going. Where do you see the most promising work in the field of women writers? One thing that struck me was just how important the work in critical theory was during the 1990s when I was at UCLA with you. <hi rendition="#italic">Romanticism and Gender</hi> comes out of Anglo-American and French feminism, but also deconstruction and post-structuralism. Do you think we have a period like that now? Do you see one coming? Where is the promising work?</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> I don’t know. I’ve been a little frustrated actually. I had thought by now there would be more systematic work on the women writers, the single-author, really in-depth researched projects ongoing and appearing and not as many have come along. We’ve gotten some good biographies of Hannah More, like Anne Stott’s biography of Hannah More.  A lot of work on Mary Robinson because you can market that to a more commercial audience. But there are so many women writers in the period that don’t have this work. We don’t even have a really good single-author book detailing the entire career of Maria Edgeworth. Which is really amazing, if you think about it, since she was right up there with Jane Austen then, and even now widely read but not widely studied. Partly because she has been confined to Irish Studies and read from a particularly negative view.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> [She is there in] histories of education . . .</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> …with her children’s writing. But not the major novels, for the most part. So, I think there is an enormous amount of work still to be done. Joanna Baillie? We don’t have a really good overview of her entire career. There is a biography now but not [enough] critical work. Catherine Burroughs’s book is excellent but it only goes so far. Women playwrights, women poets. We don’t have a really good book yet on Felicia Hemans, I mean an overview book. We have good editions of her poems, of <hi rendition="#italic">The Siege of Valencia, </hi>but not a biography. Charlotte Smith! We still need a really good interpretive study [of her work].</p>
<!--  <p rend="noCount">
            <hi rend="bold">[Audio Clip could end here: Mellor Two 29:45 ]</hi>
            </p>  -->
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> Why do you think that is? Is there a bias against writing about a domestic life? Biographies of male authors focus on the career. Is it because we would end up having to write about the domestic? [<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Well, you’d write about the domestic, but you’d also write about their career . . .] Is the biography of a woman different from that of a man?</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Well, I think that has been the assumption, except that we have biographies of Queen Catherine of Russia and Cleopatra. The interest in women writers has been in the exceptional women and the political leaders of one kind or another. I don’t know…</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> I’m grappling with this in the Opie biography. She is always part of the public landscape but her biography also has to take into account her care for her father, and care of her aunt. There is a lot of quotidian management of other people that is outside of her writing life, always part of that life, but perceived as being separate from her writing life.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Well, I think that means that when you do a biography of a woman, you have to take very seriously Nancy Chodorow’s argument in <hi rendition="#italic">The Reproduction of Women</hi> that women have a relational self rather than an autonomous self, and that is the theoretical interest of such biographies, that they actually map how relationships actually are created and sustained and finally end over a lifetime, and make the argument that it is human relationships that matter rather than individual acts.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> I’ve found that the recent work in sociability studies has really assisted me in thinking about this.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Yes, yes, and I think that is a really interesting move, both in Romantic writing but elsewhere, to think about writers as embedded in larger communities. And I think that will go on; a lot of the race theory and postcolonial theory insists on the priority of the community and how writers serve it.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> [Do you see] Transnational Romanticism [as part of that theoretical trend]?</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> Yes, though that seems to be more a product of an interest in book history. It has really been about the circulation of texts across the Atlantic or ideas as embodied in texts. And there is a lot of new work being done on publishing firms and publishing practices. And that actually will be very important to studies of women writers. Because how did their books get published? And did they hold copyrights? Did they publish on commission? How much did they actually earn from their writing? What sort of trends were they responding to? What literary fashions were they responding to? We have a lot more evidence now, ever since William St. Clair’s <hi rendition="#italic">The Reading Nation</hi>, as to how to think through a lot of those issues. So I think that is a field that is going to go on.</p>
<p rend="noCount">I just hope that feminist theory, per se, doesn’t get shunted aside as old-fashioned. You know, oh we have done all that already, because I don’t think that we have.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: And that’s a pretty dangerous precedent as any feminist knows, then you just end up recreating . . . </p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: . . . male hierarchies. And unfortunately, I think that is what is happening in a lot of women’s studies departments. Ours just changed its name from Women’s Studies to Gender Studies, and you understand why that is happening because it is an inclusive move, but it then focuses as much attention on gay males as on females, and heightens discussions of intersex, which moves away from that huge category of women.</p>
<p rend="noCount">.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: Which seems to be of political importance right now, given the recent return in rhetoric at least to a fifties ideal.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: . . . of domesticity and of … oh god, do we need to go into Rick Santorum? </p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: That would be so wrong. We certainly don’t want to end there.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: No, but the threat is there.</p>
<!--  <p rend="noCount">
            <hi rend="bold">[Audio Clip could begin here: Mellor Two 34:29]</hi>
            </p>  -->
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: [<hi rendition="#italic">Sighing and rubbing her hands together]. </hi>Work to be done: editions, biographies, single author studies of women writers certainly. </p>
<p rend="noCount">But a lot more work to be done in Romanticism particularly around religion. Because one of the things I’ve come recently to appreciate is how strongly different religious alliances impacted on women writers, more so than on male writers. Again, it is a sense of being involved in a community. But if you start out in the Unitarian community, as Anna Barbauld, Lucy Aikin, and Amelia Opie did, you end up in a very different place than when you start out say in Scotch Presbyterianism, which had an enormous impact—and we haven’t really understood this—on Joanna Baillie, on Elizabeth Hamilton, Susan Ferrier, partially because Scotch Presbyterianism was quite egalitarian. There were female presbyters in the eighteenth century. A very different sort of way of modeling human relationships and sex relationships comes out of the Church of England, [which is] a much more hierarchical and oppressive model to follow. So we need to think through that—and missionary work in relation to religion. So that is a big area that I think people will spend more time on in the future.</p>
<p rend="noCount">Science. Women and Science. Women’s active engagement and knowledge of science. The way scientific metaphors impact on all of Romantic writing. There is a lot more work to be done on that. I actually have a graduate student right now, Fusan Wang, who is doing really interesting work on inoculation and vaccination and how that . . . </p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: . . . which has a fascinating relationship to gender in England . . . </p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: Well, because it starts with Mary Wortley Montagu and smallpox vaccination and then goes to Thomas Jenner. But once it gets to Thomas Jenner and cowpox being the vaccination for smallpox, you get this human/animal divide. A binary being broken down and all the complex and anxious responses to that notion of introducing the animal into—<hi rendition="#italic">an animal poison</hi>—into the human system is really an interesting problematic for the period.</p>
<!-- <p rend="noCount">
            <hi rend="bold">[Audio Clip could end here: Mellor Two 37:00]</hi>
            </p>  -->
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: And it opens up potential ways of thinking about Romantic representations of nature and animal life more generally. Which makes me think of John Clare, a fascinating addition to the Romantic canon . . . </p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: . . . just for that obsession with nature . . .</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: So what do you see yourself doing post-retirement?</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: When I retire, can I stop writing books? Could I stop writing at all?</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: Can you, Anne Mellor? Actually, I have that question. Can you? That would be a question for you. I guess the question is <hi rendition="#italic">will</hi> you stop? </p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: I think I will. [<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: <hi rendition="#italic">Will you stop writing articles?</hi>] Well, I’m committed to write at least two more, so I guess I’ll write those. And then I don’t know. I really don’t know. I’ve always wanted to paint, so I think about retirement as a time when I could maybe dismantle my study and turn it into a studio. Probably not. Probably I would I hire a room somewhere else to paint in.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> Well, you have great light right here.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: I have great light but I don’t think I can fill up the living room with easels and paint.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> Maybe a painting studio outside…</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM:</hi> A painting studio outside, maybe. I don’t know, my husband thinks this is total fantasyland, and it may be. I’ll go on teaching for sure. I don’t know. The writing part is less interesting, partially because of the lag time. You know, you write something, and by the time it gets in print, and by the time someone actually responds to it, it is a long way away. So for me, the interim has always been teaching the material and then going to conferences, but my conference going energy is declining. So I don’t know. I’ll fade away into the sunset here on the west coast.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE:</hi> Well, it is a nice place to fade into the sunset. I predict that it will be harder for you to give up writing than you think it will.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: We’ll see, we’ll see.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>. Maybe it will be a different kind of writing.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: Maybe, maybe. Saree Makdisi was just asking me if I would write a memoir. And I said no, this interview plus what will appear in NASSR around the seminar on romanticism and gender. And whatever happens at the Clark [conference in Anne's honor in October, 2012] although I don’t have to speak, I just have to attend.</p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">RE</hi>: It will be the twentieth anniversary of the appearance of <hi rendition="#italic">Romanticism and Gender, </hi>won’t it? 1993? </p>
<p rend="noCount">
<hi rend="bold">AM</hi>: It will! I hadn’t connected that.</p>

<div type="abstract">
<p rend="noCount">In this essay, Campbell traces the peculiar re-circulations of Thomas Pennant's 1770s antiquarian description of an archaic Scottish proto-guillotine.  These re-circulations culminated in a late-Romantic fantasy that Pennant's antiquarian labors had brought the modern, French guillotine to life.  But even in the 1790s moment of the French Revolution, as the fashionable periodical <title level="j">The Bon Ton Magazine</title> makes most remarkably clear, Pennant's prose was mediating the British encounter with the French guillotine in extraordinary ways.  As an encapsulation of the antiquarian enterprise, the episode illuminates how the antiquarian fragment (liberated from an originary context) always threatened to belong to new times in uncontrollable ways, and so generated an illicit kind of temporal belonging more familiarly ascribed to fashion's recursive cycles.  Campbell turns from the re-circulations of Pennant to the fiction of Walter Scott, where a prominent and simultaneous address of antiquarian fragments and fashionable dress aimed to mitigate precisely the kind of dangers on view in Pennant's unwitting resurrection of the guillotine.  Scott's Waverley Novels finally bind fashions and antiquities to their respective times of origin, but the novels nevertheless remain in the shadow of Pennant's old guillotine.</p>

<p>In this essay I trace a Romantic-era alignment between the procedures of fashion culture and the methods of a noteworthy antiquary.  I center this discussion around an extraordinary micro-episode in print in 1793 (at the verge of the Reign of Terror), when the <title level="j">Bon Ton Magazine, or Microscope of Fashion and Folly</title> radically repurposed Thomas Pennant's 1772 prose description of an ancient British implement of capital punishment.  By transposing Pennant's antiquarian account into the eventful present moment, the <title level="j">Bon Ton Magazine</title> transformed this commentary into a fully adequate dispatch on the ultra-modern guillotine—the signature emblem of the ostensibly unprecedented violence of the French Revolution.  This remarkable event in print, I argue, suggests how fashion's characteristic recyclings of past artifacts for present purposes (and fashion's consequent liberations of the objects of its desire from their original contexts) also disclosed destabilizing qualities of the antiquarian enterprise itself.  For if in some ways the rise of fashion was adding new danger to antiquarian practice (by putting antiquarian findings to fashion's own purposes), in other ways fashion only exposed dangers that were always inherent in the ways antiquarians managed their objects.  While Barrett Kalter calls our attention to the pronounced, contemporaneous sense that the "past was not so much retrieved as manufactured in the present, and therefore artificial," in this essay I emphasize the complexity that an object like the guillotine represents for such an ethos, as the sort of retrieval that is much more evidently a dangerous repetition than the kind of conspicuous artifice that could be readily distinguished from the past in its authenticity (12).</p>
<p>I begin with a retrospective view that will ultimately set the stage for Pennant's reemergence in the <title level="j">Bon Ton Magazine</title> in 1793—namely the more distant scrutiny, <foreign>circa</foreign> 1840, of the consequences of Pennant's recovery of these British proto-guillotines. At the later moment both the <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title> and <title level="j">The Court and Lady's Magazine</title> broach a causal link between Pennant's antiquarian labors and the arrival of the guillotine in revolutionary France, with the implication that Pennant's recirculation of the archaic in some sense elicits Dr. Guillotin's infamous engine.  These later accounts are striking in their own right; but I further insist, in ways these accounts do not countenance, on the specific revelations of Pennant's adoption within print fashion at the original moment of revolution.  The strongest implication of the <title level="j">Bon Ton Magazine</title>'s appropriation of Pennant's description, and of the mode of exuberant deformation that prevails in the magazine even amidst the extremity of regicide, is that such bald commingling of ancient and modern is rather more characteristic of the age than deviant, more central than marginal, due to an increasingly general susceptibility to fashion's ways of knowing.  In essence what happens to Pennant's prose description in print (via fashion) manifests the structure or form of what actually happened in the world with the instrument.  Just as the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title> silently set Pennant's somewhat dusty prose at the unfolding, world-historical scene of regicide, so revolutionary France quietly recast his object-artifacts as distinctively novel emanations of modernity.</p>
<p> I proceed from this particular episode toward an account of its larger stakes by suggesting how a renewed, fashion-driven appreciation for antiquarianism's dangerous liberations deeply shapes Walter Scott's iconic redefinition of the figure of the antiquary in his novel of that title.  Here, in a novel where the threat of imminent invasion by French Revolutionary forces (that is, history so-called) never quite materializes, the present itself also never quite obtains as an ontologically distinct location.  Rather, in <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> old dress fashions stubbornly persist in ways that point us to the essential ground of Scott's revision of Pennant and his ilk.  But while the comic mode of <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> works to stabilize the relics of the past alongside recently obsolete fashions, and persons—so that all these categories speak their time of origin or impressionability with the same, steady persistence—I will also consider how the shadows of Pennant's instruments of execution continue to haunt the long series of Waverley Novels to come.</p>

<head>I. "The novelty of the invention"</head>
<p>	In a review essay published in the <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title> in December 1843, and subsequently revised and published in its own right as <title level="m">The History of the Guillotine</title> (1853), John Wilson Croker consolidated a recent flurry of interest in the guillotine's origins with a diagnosis of the peculiar kind of historiographical problem the French Revolution posed.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn2" n="2"> The prose of the <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title> essay and the "revised" <title level="m">History of the Guillotine</title> is often identical. In the interest of consistency, I will cite from the latter throughout this essay.
                  </note> The "effects of [the] protracted system of Terror" that prevailed, Croker pronounces, have not "yet passed away," for this system "poisoned in its passage the very sources of history."  These corrupted historical sources, moreover, continued to impose even on the posterity of Croker's subsequent day, which therefore labored under precisely the "same delusions" the system had "imposed on its contemporaries" (1). Most noteworthy are these sources' unspoken elisions.  "It is the fashion," for instance, "to call the <title level="j">Moniteur</title> the best history of the Revolution, and its pages are universally appealed to as indisputable authority," yet the newspaper startlingly omits mention of the regicide of Louis XVI in the issue that appears on the day following the execution (2).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">
<title level="j">Le Moniteur Universel</title> was the leading newspaper of the time in France and sometime official journal of the government.
               </note> In this context, Croker observes, the question of the early history of the guillotine is a representatively "strange obscurity," for "Little or nothing was to be found" in the "leading journals of the time" "as to when and where this formidable engine made its first appearance, by what law it was sanctioned, and who were the earliest of that innumerable series of victims who perished by it" (4).</p>
<p>Croker's assertion of the inadequacy of official history in this moment has self-conscious historiographical critique in mind.  In calling attention to the discursive obscurity around the guillotine, he moves beyond a generalized horror over the Revolution's excesses to paint the broader moment as in need of the special skills of the antiquarian.  It is especially "strange," Croker notes, that "persons calling themselves <emph>historians</emph>—whose attention might have been excited, not merely by the novelty of the machine, but by the moral and legal questions which led to the invention, and by the terrible, the gigantic consequences which followed its adoption—take little or no notice of it" (4). Croker's subjects, it seems, are those the historian has overlooked.  And in the example he posits of one particularly revealing narrative of the regicide itself, it is an incapacity to attend to the remarkable machine with sufficient, material precision that elides the essential historical spirit of the event.  As Croker reports with frustration, this historian's inadequate "words, 'the descending axe terminated his existence' [...]—there having been no preceding allusion to any machine—would have equally described that of Charles I [in England in 1649]" (6).  For Croker, the "poisoned" sources of ordinary historiography remake the epoch into the opaque sort of terrain that had always necessitated antiquarians' outsized dependence upon what might be learned from objects and artifacts, and from these objects' reinsertion in historical narrative that was otherwise inadequate.  </p>
<p>Insecure about its own distance from the French Revolutionary moment, Croker's history admits of an uneasy mixture of national pride and anxiety in unveiling the English and Scottish antecedents of the machine that defined the Revolution's excesses.  He enfolds the <title level="m">Report on the Mode of Decollation</title> that "M. Louis" offered to the Legislative Assembly in France as part of the process of devising the French machine. Louis, Croker notes, points directly to an English precedent for the instrument while making no mention of the soon infamous Dr. Guillotin himself.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn4" n="4"> Anthony Louis reported in his capacity as Secretary of the Royal Academy of Surgery in France.  Louis's <title level="m">Report on the Mode of Decollation</title> explains how, given the difficult and precise task of cleanly severing the vertebral column and the imperfect skill of human executioners, "there is no certainty but in an invariable mechanism, of which the force and effect can be regulated and directed.  <emph>This is the mode adopted in England</emph>" (Croker 30, emphasis in original).
               </note>
<quote>Poor Guillotin paid dearly for the foolish vanity of affecting to be an inventor, when he was only a plagiary; and it seems very strange how so general an opinion should have prevailed as to the <emph>novelty</emph> of the invention, when we find M. Louis, in the very first distinct description of the machine, representing it as one <emph>already known in England</emph>—indeed, his expressions seem to imply [a misconception] that it was then actually and habitually in use amongst us [....]  If M. Louis had inquired a little farther, he would have found not only that the implement was not in general use in England, but had not been used for near 150 years in the small district [of Halifax] where it belonged. (34)  </quote>
                     
         This revelation, both of the machine's liability to "plagiarism" and of Louis's failure to register the English machine's present obsolescence—or, to distinguish properly between <emph>knowledge</emph> of the machine in England and ongoing <emph>use</emph> thereof (in the way a robust past-present distinction would require)—then prompts Croker's extended recapitulation of Pennant's own detailed description of the earlier British instruments of execution. For Croker, the instability of the distinction between knowledge and use is precisely what is at issue with regard to Pennant's account, for Croker emphasizes how, at the dawn of the French Revolution, the ancient British machines had been "recalled to public attention" in Pennant's "then so recent work" (39).</p>
<p>As part of his second tour of Scotland, published as <title level="m">A Tour in Scotland and Voyage to the Hebrides; 1772</title> (1774-1776), Pennant's account focuses upon the so-called Maiden, the machine that he had observed closely in Edinburgh, and its direct ancestor the Halifax Gibbet, which had supposedly served as the centerpiece of an idiosyncratic local jurisdiction centered upon the thief-ridden forest of Hardwick in Yorkshire.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn5" n="5"> Pennant's <title level="m">A Tour in Scotland and Voyage to the Hebrides; 1772</title> was published in two volumes in 1774-1776 and then in a new edition in 1776 that combined <title level="m">A Tour in Scotland</title> with the previously published account of his first tour of Scotland, <title level="m">A Tour of Scotland in 1769</title> [1771].</note>  During his tour, Pennant first observes the still extant stone platform that had been the site of Halifax's executions (the machine itself is long gone); he then recounts his direct encounter with a machine "of the same kind" in Edinburgh.  The Scottish Maiden, he writes, 
         <quote>is in the form of a painter's easel, and about ten feet high: at four feet from the bottom is a cross bar, on which the felon lays his head, which is kept down by another placed above.  In the inner edges of the frame are grooves; in these is placed a sharp axe, with a vast weight of lead, supported at the very summit with a peg; to that peg is fastened a cord, which the executioner cutting, the axe falls, and does the affair effectually, without suffering the unhappy criminal to undergo a repetition of strokes, as has been the case in the common method.  I must add, that if the sufferer is condemned for stealing a horse, or a cow, the string is tied to the beast, which on being whipped, pulls out the peg, and becomes the executioner. (700) </quote>
                     
                     The direct link between the machines is the sixteenth-century Scottish Regent James Douglas, Earl of Morton, the tragic figure who "took a model of [the Gibbet] as he passed through Halifax"; introduced it to Scotland; and then "at length suffered by it himself" (700).  Notably, the narrative of Pennant's <title level="m">Tour</title> concluded with this description of Halifax and its distinctive "machine of death," and so the tour's very sequence grants the episode a kind of formal privilege and prominence.  At the same time, the precise content of Pennant's description of the Edinburgh machine, as I will show, is all the more significant because it was so often repeated.  Croker and others like him directly interpolated the descriptive passage again and again within their own accounts of the French guillotine.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn6" n="6"> In addition to the examples I discuss in the present essay, Pennant's prose also migrates into the <title level="m">Newgate Calendar</title>, where it becomes the main substance of an appendix entitled <title level="a">The Maiden, or Scottish Guillotine</title> in the 1826 edition.  The Maiden is more briefly mentioned in the 1795 version of the <title level="m">Newgate Calendar</title> published by William Jackson, where much of the information in Pennant's description seems to be incorporated into an <title level="a">Account of John Hamilton, Esq.</title>
</note>
</p>
<p>Croker himself concedes in the end that Dr. Guillotin himself, "foolish" as he was, "probably knew nothing" about the English precedents; and Croker dutifully outlines a wider series of Continental precedents to the guillotine beyond the British examples Pennant had named (34).  The summary lesson of all these precedents, however, remains the oddity of the guillotine's genuine air of novelty in France: "We conclude from all this that this mode of execution was common on the Continent in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; and yet had passed into such entire desuetude and oblivion as to have appeared as a perfect novelty when produced by Dr. Guillotin" (46). Striking here, though not explicitly articulated by Croker, is the extraordinary symmetry of Pennant's recently "recall[ing] the machine to public attention" and the quality of "perfect novelty" the machine nevertheless embodied, as if there is a latent correspondence between "perfect novelty" and at least one mode of antiquarian recovery. The "oblivion" of living or popular memory, in other words, seems precisely the avenue through which the archaic form resurrected by antiquarian enterprise can conduce to the "appearance" of novelty (which in Croker's ambiguous phrasing might equally point to false appearances or to a genuinely sudden, impactful coming into being).</p>
<p>Within the <title level="j">Court and Lady's Magazine</title> for May 1840, an essay nearly contemporaneous with Croker's likewise brought the British prehistory of the guillotine to life while making a more unapologetic case for a direct line of influence between the Halifax Gibbet, the Scottish Maiden, and the later guillotine.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"> The <title level="j">Court and Lady's Magazine</title> is a descendant of the prominent Romantic-era fashion periodical <title level="j">La Belle Assemblée</title>.</note>
<title level="a">The Maiden and the Guillotine</title> dramatically underscores the scandal of this tale of origins: "Sceptical, as the reader may probably be upon the accuracy of this fact, it is nevertheless quite true! –the Guillotine is a machine of English invention, the use of which (singularly enough) was well known during the reign of Queen Elizabeth [...]" (429). Moreover, "The machine invented by Halifax law, was not [...] destined to remain within the limits of a narrow provincial district, but, at a later day to cross the sea and reach Paris by the somewhat circuitous route of Scotland" (431).  The <title level="j">Court and Lady's</title> account, which closely resembles Croker's four years later, evinces a similar reliance upon Pennant's antiquarian descriptions (again quoted at length) but dwells more intently upon the specific power of Pennant's reanimation of the old machine: 
                     <quote>When Pennant visited Edinburgh, the Halifax machine had [...] entirely disappeared from the public eye.  The sole trace of its existence in that city was a model of large dimensions, preserved in one of the halls of the ancient parliament house.  <emph>This model had become nothing more than a mere object of curiosity—a vestige of antiquity, in the eyes of a new generation</emph>; and as the national pride was not interested in its preservation, it fell subsequently into private hands, and is now, we believe, to be seen in the Museum of the Society of Scottish Antiquaries. <emph>Pennant was evidently able to examine it in its minutest detail, and he comprehended all its mechanism with peculiar sagacity</emph>, as will be seen by the description which we have previously given in his words. (433, my emphasis)</quote>
                     
                     In the intricate comprehension of "mechanism" that marks Pennant's description, we are to understand, one can observe the kind of antiquarian operation that restores the object of the past to the living "public eye" and also shapes its future course.</p>
<p>For my purposes here, I am more committed to the force of this fantasy of Pennant's authorship of the guillotine than to its objective historical accuracy, but I do wish to emphasize the particular qualities of Pennant's modes of observation that seemed to lend themselves to such speculation.  At the original moment of the <title level="m">Tour of Scotland</title>, Pennant's first readers already identified the qualities that made his writing especially expropriable. Samuel Johnson, for instance, observed in praise that Pennant was "the best traveller I ever read; he observes more <emph>things</emph> than anyone else does" (Boswell 3:56, my emphasis). For the <title level="j">London Magazine</title> in the same moment, Pennant "communicat[ed] to the world, the knowledge of their country in its present state" alongside "ancient customs and manners, and various antiquities, scarcely known before" (<title level="a">Impartial Review,</title> 337).  The latter assessment makes clear how Pennant's proliferating "things" are set loose in the world as part of a motley assortment of present knowledge, ancient customs, and "various" antiquities, the last of which do not properly belong to those "customs and manners" with which we might expect to align them.  James Boswell detected in Pennant a similarly paratactic habit of collection, but Boswell also understood this habit to be a serious detriment: Pennant "traversed a wide extent of country in such haste, that he could put together only <emph>curt, frittered fragments of his own</emph>" (3:56). Pennant is a "writer, who at best treats merely of superficial objects, and shews no philosophical investigation of character and manners," and who likewise borrows far too much from the real understanding of those local experts who assisted him (3:56).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn8" n="8">See also Charles W.J. Withers's introduction to <title level="m">A Tour in Scotland</title> (Pennant 1998). </note>  From the start, something about the mode of Pennant's attention <emph>generates</emph> fragments, or objects "superficial[ly]" denuded of cultural context, and—perhaps in consequence—has the power to transform objects like the Maiden from mere "curiosities" into things with a life of their own.  Such new life depends not so much upon a reanimating context, or the "character and manners" of a place (in Boswell's terms), as upon the intrinsic "mechanism" of the objects that (in the <title level="j">Court and Lady's Magazine</title>'s terms) Pennant sagaciously discerned.</p>

<p>From the distant perspective of the <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title> and the <title level="j">Court and Lady's Magazine,</title> Pennant's consequences for the French Revolution seemed at once evident in retrospect and diffusely unavailable to the original moment, which had labored under the delusion of the guillotine's novelty.  But the striking case of the <title level="j">Bon Ton Magazine</title> episode turns this perspective on its head. Here, the pages of fashion quite readily register the peculiarly mobile quality of Pennant's object descriptions in real time, with their own kind of distance.  Admittedly, the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title> seems in many ways an unlikely candidate for the kind of perceptiveness I am describing.  In Paul-Gabriel Boucé's summation, the magazine is the most prominent of a set of periodicals ("predecessors to <title level="j">Playboy</title>") that "thrive[d] on the sexual content" of trials for criminal conversation and on the "obscene prints" they produced to accompany such tales (Wagner 132). In more pornographic moments, the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title> shuttles between graphic tales of lesbianism (and "the art of <emph>tribade</emph>") and voyeuristic sadism, as in the "old debilitated Croesus, of Broad-street" who arranges with the mistresses of two boarding schools to observe unseen as girls are "flogged upon their bare posteriors" (April 1792: 56-57). But the remarkable quality of the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>'s exceptionally abandoned pages is that even those moments that would seem like genuine irruptions of the precipitous events of revolution finally bear out fashion's resiliently prurient and promiscuous capacity to traffic in such events on its own terms.  </p>
<p>The <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>'s strange modulations of the rush of history via its own peculiar priorities and procedures is nowhere more evident than in a seemingly straightforward dispatch on the execution of Louis XVI in the issue for January 1793. As the <title level="a">Epitome of the Times</title> for the issue reports in a brief, fashion-saturated shorthand, the French monarch "pulled off his stock, coat and waistcoat, and, with his neck and breast bare, ascended the scaffold with intrepidity, and undaunted fortitude; (it was only 20 minutes after ten o'clock) he wore a clean shirt and stock, white waistcoat, black Florentine silk breeches, black silk stockings, and his shoes were tied with black silk strings" (444). Notably, the outsized proportion of dress description in the abbreviated <title level="a">Epitome</title> functions as a hook for the next month's issue of the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>, where this passage plays a diminished role amidst a more extended narrative of the execution (but presumably continues to serve as a primary anchor of readers' attention).  At the same time, the passage is lifted directly from the <title level="j">Lady's Magazine</title>, the leading fashion publication of the moment that was interpellating respectable female consumers rather antithetical to the libertine, male audience of the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>. Commenting on the original context of just this passage in the <title level="j">Lady's Magazine</title>, Mary Poovey notes the absence of comparable attention to dress in the contemporaneous account of the execution in the <title level="m">Gentleman's Magazine</title>; this gaze for Poovey thus instances women's relegation to a private sphere of "polite conversation" and "sensual" concern rather than rational political judgment (16-18).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn9" n="9"> Deidre Lynch has more recently rectified Poovey's neglect of the "utopian, and feminist" potential of the scene of fashionable consumption as a "counter public" or proto-public. But the more fundamental deformation of the king's execution via fashion in the <title level="j">Bon Ton Magazine</title>, in its libertine, masculine address, speaks of a more unruly and asocial side of fashion (213, 215).</note>  But if the dress served readers of the <title level="j">Lady's Magazine</title> as supplemental information that might at least invite a gendered mode of attention to the larger circumstances, the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>'s disproportionate attention to dress at the very moment of regicide gleefully disrupts such a project, by making of the fashionable objects this history precipitated the most salient content of the execution.  </p>
<p>As the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title> understood, the "state" of dress, especially in the cycles meted by the royal birthday, was fundamental to imagining the monarchy and its sovereign expression of the social life of the moment.  A prototypical issue of the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title> for June 1791, for instance, relayed reports on the celebration of George III's birthday earlier in the same month.  The King "appeared in a <emph>chocolate</emph> coloured silk tabby coat, richly spangled all over with silver spangles, and embroidered on the seams; the waistcoat was of white silk, ornamented in the same manner [...]"; the Queen appeared "in a train of white and silver, with a petticoat of the same, richly embroidered" together with brilliant jewels and "ornaments of silver and foils"; and the Princess "Was in a rich silver silk body and train, a petticoat richly embroidered with silver spangles and pink convolves, with a loose drapery of green and silver in folds on the corners of the hoop, which had a new and beautiful effect" (141-143).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn10" n="10">In this issue the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>'s dress description also indicates how fashion-seeking puts special pressure on questions of representativeness, especially as the focus moves  from the singular costumes of the royal family to the larger crowd: "The gentlemen's dresses were generally of dark tea green, and chocolate coloured silk, or dark stripes, with white silk waistcoats, spangled, embroidered, or tamboured"; and  "The ladies mostly wore white crape petticoats, spangled, and spotted with white foil, corn flowers, and other fancy flowers [...];"The ladies' bodies and trains were chiefly of crape or striped gauze, trimmed with silver fringe [...] The fashionable colour for ribbons was decidedly purple; a great many lilacs were also displayed [...] The caps were principally trimmed with rich blond lace [...].  The caps in general were rather low and broad; they were mostly of white or coloured crape, suitable to the dresses, ornamented with artificial flowers [...].  The hair was almost universally dressed in curls."  The language of trend-spotting, and its promise to convey what is "generally," "mostly," "chiefly," "decidedly," or "principally" characteristic amidst a wider set of possibilities, bears a clear resemblance to sifting for more properly historical signs of the times (141-143).
                  </note> Against this backdrop, the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>'s plagiarized account of Louis XVI's wardrobe takes on a distinctly perverse valence. Even the ostensibly straight reporting on Louis XVI's execution, in other words, makes the scene a grotesque rehearsal of the ubiquitous print fashion scene of the royal ball and of its characteristic mode of description: the "white waistcoat" of Louis XVI is a macabre reflection of George III at the birthday celebration (in his own "white silk" waistcoat).  Likewise, a subsequent report in the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title> for September 1792, on the new fashions of the gentlemen of France, sardonically pointed to garments "<emph>spotted</emph> with a mixture, called the blood of their countrymen—<foreign>Sans Culottes</foreign>" (285, my emphasis). The satire most directly puns on the account of the ladies' petticoats in 1791 (and others garments like theirs) which are "spotted with white foil."<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn11" n="11">See my previous note.</note>  But if the satire in part rebukes the revolution, it just as surely makes of the blood-spotted shirts of Frenchmen a grotesque kind of fashion in a way that destabilizes any secure stance of judgment on the bloodshed.  </p>
<p>My concern, then, is not with the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>'s abiding plagiarism as such but rather with its fashion-informed mode of appropriation, whereby the objects and events that come within its purview are powerfully recontextualized or remade. This mode is once again borne out in the magazine's adoption of Pennant's guillotine description. The aforementioned issue of the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title> for February 1793 (which expands the initial passages on Louis XVI's dress into a fuller narrative, the <title level="a">Authentic Particulars of the Last Moments of Louis XVI</title>), also turns its attention to the guillotine itself, as an object worthy of visual and verbal attention in its own right. Added to the narrative of the king's execution is a footnote, which promises "a description of the machine by which the king suffered and which takes its name of Guillotine from that of the person who brought it into use."  The footnote further references a plate included with the magazine and then repeats Pennant's familiar prose ("It is in the form of a painter's easel, and about ten feet high [...]," etc.)—but does so with acknowledgement neither of Pennant himself, nor of the different machine Pennant was actually describing, so that his prose becomes a kind of fabricated on-the-spot reporting.</p>
<p>In being organized around objects or sites rather than by sustained narrative, antiquarian writing always potentially conduced to this kind of circulation.  The <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>'s interpolation of Pennant in the 1790s is not unique; and the immediate inspiration for the invocation is likely Richard Twiss's travel narrative, <title level="m">A Trip to Paris, in July and August, 1792</title> (1793).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn12" n="12">In addition to <title level="m">A Trip to Paris</title>, Richard Twiss's travel writings include his <title level="m">Travels Through Portugal and Spain in 1772 and 1773</title> (1775) and his noteworthy <title level="j">Tour in Ireland in 1775</title> (1776).
                  </note> Amidst Twiss's wider survey of British and Continental precedents to the guillotine and engravings thereof (in concrete anticipation of Croker's much later essay), Pennant's description characteristically comes to the fore.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn13" n="13">Twiss's account is also the occasion for a small ripple of related commentary in the <title level="j">Gentleman's Quarterly</title>.  After the magazine reviews Twiss's <title level="m">Trip to Paris</title> in the issue for December 1792, two correspondents supply further context on the guillotine's antecedents in March 1793 and January 1794; and the March 1793 letter also includes an illustration of the Scottish Maiden.  (See also the advertisement for Twiss's opportunistic exhibition in London, <title level="m">Execution of the King of France now exhibiting at No. 28, Hay-market. La Guillotine; or The beheading machine, from Paris, by which the late King of France suffered</title> [1793].)</note>  In a chapter entitled <title level="a">Execution of Two Criminals, with a Beheading Machine</title> Twiss reports on the execution's immediate aftermath, which affords him the opportunity to see the guillotine: 
         <quote>I did not see the execution, because, as the hour is never specified, I might have waited for many hours in a crowd, from which there is no extricating one's self.  I was there immediately after, and saw the machine, which was just going to be taken away.  I went into a coffee-house and made a drawing, which is here engraven.  It is called <foreign>la Guillotine</foreign>, from the name of the person who first brought it into use in Paris [...].  In English it is termed a maiden. (32) </quote>

Twiss's account conveys some of the nuance of the moment by initially equating the British and French machines (i.e., in Scotland the seemingly same machine "is termed" a maiden) but then subsequently, in a footnote, detailing Pennant's "long account of <emph>such a machine</emph>," in a phrase that will not quite admit equivalence (32, my emphasis).  In the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>, then, the shift from this analogizing language ("such a machine") to the direct application of Pennant's description to the guillotine itself is all the more striking because the provenance of Pennant's description (its original applicability to an object of antiquity) is available—and therefore deliberately effaced.  </p>
<p>The rupture that results in the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title> from the failure of this borrowed description to accord fully with the accompanying illustration, entitled the <title level="a">Form of the Machine on which Louis XVI suffered Death,</title> partly seems of a piece with the dizzying mix of aesthetics, politics, sovereignty, sex, and costume therein.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn14" n="14">In a further destabilization of any sense of urgency related to the regicide, for instance, this initial account of the death of Louis XVI appeared alongside the unperturbedly salacious account of the <title level="a">Trial of Mrs. Wilmot,</title> including an illustration entitled <title level="m">The Kissing Scene</title> (in which the male adulterer bends to perform cunnilingus on Mrs. Wilmot, who has lifted her dress to facilitate the act).</note>

Yet if the illustration evinces an aestheticizing distance from the enormity of the event that echoes the unperturbed scrutiny of details of dress in the prior issue, the image also suggests how such distant scrutiny was being sustained from the start by the distance built into Pennant's prose description.  The diagrammatic qualities of the image, particularly evident in the more schematic window to the lower left, suggest functional attributes of the blade and stock but also lend them an air of geometric regularity that pushes our sense of the machine's "Form" toward a perversely aesthetic appreciation, one that is further sustained by the architectural regularity of the perfectly centered guillotine's rectilinear form.  Likewise, the jarring qualities of the king's floating head (which the perspective has visually separated from his body even before the blade falls) and of the clashing diagonals of background scene (which echo the machine's form in non-representational ways that compete with the scene's narrative meaning) offer the scene as a visual conundrum as much as an obvious occasion for sentiment.  Far from signaling the exceptionality of regicide, the unreal qualities of this image are fully consonant with a more overt, visual conjuring of aesthetic dissonance in the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title> in 1792 (and again in 1795), an illustration entitled <title level="a">Critical Observations Upon Beauty</title>.

<p>In this context, the contingent qualities of Pennant's own mediation of the object come to the fore—most especially the conspicuously aesthetic qualities of his description, which were to some extent elicited by intrinsic qualities of the Maiden but that were also enhanced by Pennant's particular practice of antiquarianism.  The image Croker included in his history makes clear that such associations would in some sense have been unavoidable.

            But the Maiden's unmistakable appearance in the "form of an easel" also made its shape suddenly compatible with both an emerging appreciation of the picturesque (before the letter) and with contemporaneous reenvisionings of governance as art.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn15" n="15">Like many critics, Stephen Copley numbers Pennant among those "unsympathetic to the claims of the Picturesque," but such a firm distinction (especially prior to the publication of Gilpin's <title level="m">Observations</title> in 1782) seems dismissive of the complexity of the enterprise of Pennant's second tour, all the more when the illustrations and manifold antique ruins are considered (42).
               </note> Pennant's second tour of Scotland was a noteworthy departure from his first tour in benefiting from the talents of Moses Griffiths, Pennant's "servant and an 'able artist' who produced the many sketches later published as engravings" (Pennant xvi). The odd way in which Griffiths's visual-aesthetic appropriations of Scotland aligned with the "easel" shape of the antique guillotine suggests an added element of the Maiden's interest for Pennant as well as the peculiar "framing" of history the device of the Maiden might conjure as a result.  At the same time, as Eric Slauter has shown with particular reference to the early American context, governments of the age were increasingly seen to be aesthetic projects, "works of art," meant to be materialized, in turn, in artful form.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn16" n="16">As Slauter emphasizes, "Political thought not only coincided with aesthetic theory, sharing a few crucial terms like 'distinterestedness,' the self-negating stance of tasteful spectators before an art object and the proper posture of enlightened representatives in the face of party zeal: in the eighteenth century, political thought and aesthetic theory were mutually constitutive" (98).</note>  The Maiden itself, on this view, seems both like an instantiation of an antique mode of governance and a means or technique by which to make governance aesthetically meaningful. In all these senses, it is not only Pennant himself but a shifting aesthetic context that irresistibly draws the Maiden into new prominence on the basis of this peculiar form.</p>

<head>III.  Scott's Maidens</head>
<p>I now turn from the story I have reprised so far, in which Pennant's resurrection of the antique Scottish Maiden played a role in the emergence of the French guillotine, to what I will suggest is Walter Scott's extended (and perhaps counter-aestheticizing) response to this story. I begin by registering the remarkable ways in which Pennant's encounter with the Maiden anticipated the form or structure of Scott's <title level="m">Waverley</title> itself. Most concretely, perhaps, Croker emphasizes how "Near thirty years prior to Pennant's publication, the execution of the Scotch lords for the Rebellion of 1745 by the axe and block seems to have recalled the obsolete <emph>Maiden</emph> to notice" (38).  Croker points specifically to the <title level="j">London Magazine</title> for April 1747, which mentions a (seemingly abandoned)  plan to execute Simon Lord Fraser of Lovat by means of "an Engine [...] like that called <emph>the Maiden</emph>" (153), and which contains illustrations both of Fraser's execution by axe and block and of the Maiden itself, "as anciently used in Scotland for beheading traitors" (187).  In this way, the living local memory and material preservation that enabled Pennant to scrutinize the Maiden in 1772 were extended effects of the Jacobite rising of 1745-1746 that became the subject of Scott's novel.  </p>
<p>In another sense, Pennant's counterintuitive account of the Maiden upheld it as an ambiguous icon of progress; it was not a surviving token of archaic brutality but a relatively recent improvisation in response to the growing pains of commercial proto-modernity. Pennant reports the conjecture (which he describes as "very probable") that the Halifax Gibbet arose at a moment when the woolen manufactures—now thriving in Pennant's day—first "began to gain strength."  The spectacle of justice the Gibbet created was intended to moderate the "lawless set" who inhabited the "wild country around," and whose Highlander-like "depredations on the cloth-tenters might [otherwise have] soon stifle[d] the efforts of infant industry" (Pennant 699). Such a prehistory of textile production bears an inevitable relevance to the dress-driven art of Scott and the taste he created; and indeed in its 1840 account, the <title level="j">Court and Lady's Magazine</title> cannot resist translating Pennant's sparer fable of commercialization into a more enticingly concrete image of primitive retail exhibition and its temptations: Halifax's "hilly environs were daily seen speckled with pieces of cloth of all colours, suspended from tenters' poles.  This display of valuable stuffs was unfortunately beheld by other eyes than those of the honest chapmen of the cloth-market" (430).  As such a scene might suggest, and as the <title level="j">Court and Lady's Magazine</title> put it explicitly, the Maiden was itself a kind of prolepsis for the English commercial ingenuity of the eighteenth century.  That is, the guillotine's early arrival in Halifax "proceeded from the same mechanical genius, which, in our own days, has given birth to the wonder-working <emph>Spinning Jennies</emph>" (429).</p>
<p>	The actual history of the Maiden also converges with the fictional landscape Scott created in quite direct ways.  <title level="m">The Heart of Mid-Lothian</title> (1818), for instance, is Scott's most extensive meditation on the problem of state execution under the broad dispensation of public interest (and in this case, without proof of crime). The unfortunate Effie Deans, whose newborn child is missing, stands to lose her life for the crime of infanticide; for the law deems her constructively guilty by virtue of her previous silence about her pregnancy. Effie's sister Jeanie ultimately saves her by obtaining a pardon in a royal audience facilitated by the Duke of Argyle. In part Argyle's assistance is consistent with his status in the novel as Scott's great hero of moderation in the period (as an accommodating Presbyterian who "Soar[ed] above the petty distinctions of faction" and softened the tensions between Scotland and England [344]). But Jeanie's solicitation of his aid also directly invokes the memory of the Duke's "unfortunate" grandfather and great-grandfather (350).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn17" n="17">Jeannie Deans presents the Duke of Argyll with a letter from his own grandfather (bestowed on the grandfather of Jeannie's betrothed in gratitude for loyal service in trying times) that enjoined his friends and family in the future to come to the assistance of the bearer (and his family and friends) in times of need.  In the same moment she is remarkably described as dressed "in the style of Scottish <emph>maidens</emph> of her own class" (Scott, <title level="m">Midlothian</title>, 350, my emphasis). </note> Never directly mentioned but always lurking is the fate these Argyle ancestors met on the Maiden itself, in 1685 and 1661, respectively.  The present Duke's valorization of modernity, then, as well as his heightened sympathy for Jeanie, bear the special weight of the memory of the Maiden's operation.  And if <title level="m">The Heart of Mid-Lothian</title> itself is perhaps Scott's most eloquent intimation of the Maiden's legacy, the machine's fateful operation is similarly implicated in works like <title level="m">A Legend of Montrose</title> (1819), which features Argyle's aforementioned great-grandfather, and both <title level="m">The Abbot</title> (1820) and <title level="m">The Monastery</title> (1820), where James Douglas, Earl of Morton (who had carried the Maiden from Halifax to Edinburgh in the first place and ironically met his end upon it) prominently features as a character.</p>
<p>There is further evidence of the Author of <title level="m">Waverley</title>'s quiet intimacy with the Maiden's shadow—and of a secondary mediation of the French guillotine through Scottish history by way of Scott's oeuvre—not only in Croker's general proximity to Scott through their mutual work for the <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title>, but also in the particular pages of Croker's <title level="m">History of the Guillotine</title>.  Croker's history directly cites Scott's <title level="m">Tales of a Grandfather</title> (as collected in Scott's <title level="m">Complete Prose Works</title> in 1836) as the source for his most gleaming anecdote on the ancient victims of the Maiden: the moment when the doomed Earl of Argyle in 1685 had "pressed his lips on the block," and "declar[ed] [...] that it was the sweetest <emph>maiden</emph> he had ever kissed" (39).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn18" n="18">Notably Scott undertook the <title level="m">Tales of a Grandfather</title> in order to improve upon Croker's own <title level="m">Stories Selected from the History of England</title> (1822), which Scott found overly condescending to child readers.</note>  At this moment in the <title level="m">Tales of a Grandfather</title>, Scott himself had likewise interrupted his recounting of the execution of Argyle to cite Pennant's description of the Maiden in a lengthy footnote ("in the form of a painter's easel," and so on, once again) and to identify it explicitly as "an instrument resembling the Guillotine of modern France" (280-281).  If Pennant had unwittingly circulated the guillotine within actual history in the 1790s, Scott was likely at the root of the late re-appreciation of the British origins of the instrument by way of Pennant's work, as reflected in both Croker's history and <title level="j">The Court and Lady's Magazine</title> in the years to come.  </p>
<p>In Scott's carefully chosen wording, the nature of the relation between the Maiden that Pennant described and the French guillotine is "resemblance," which subtly but tellingly consigns each machine to its own moment.  In a way that emphasizes how Scott's construction of this relationship (as resemblance) was not inevitable, the <title level="j">Court and Lady's Magazine</title> figuratively construed the same relationship as one of direct, material continuity. Having traced the Maiden's route from Halifax to Edinburgh to Paris, the <title level="j">Court and Lady's</title> pauses to "behold [in the guillotine] the rotten and disjointed members of the Halifax <emph>Maiden</emph> collected together again after so long a desuetude—the old fragments cramped and repieced, and after complete restoration of all parts and a fresh coat of paint, given forth to the world as a <emph>discovery</emph> made by French philosophy!" (433). The insistent troping of the guillotine as an archaic object lurking only just beneath the thinnest of restorative veneers reads like an especially fearful accounting of the logic of fashion that treated the past as a reservoir of forms—and so indeed reconstituted old models as new by infusing them with all the allure of novelty and presence.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn19" n="19">Perhaps reflecting Pennant's distinctive qualities, these "disjointed members" and "old fragments" from Halifax are not so unlike the "curt, frittered fragments" that Boswell had accused Pennant of producing in print, to be passed off as new in the <title level="j">Bon Ton</title>.  </note> Scott's opposing insistence on (mere) resemblance, finally, is part and parcel of his fictions' larger project to insist that the true time of origin of historical objects will out—that artifacts and styles alike may often resemble but never quite recur.  </p>
<p>In foregrounding the work Scott did to assign archaic or obsolete objects more fixedly to their times of provenance—and in emphasizing that he did so with the peculiar aid of fashion—the remainder of my essay means to intervene in recent debates about the status of the residual in the Romantic moment, when the ominousness of the category seemed far more menacing a problem than it had for Pennant himself. I especially have in mind what Ina Ferris, in the best recent consideration of the problem, calls "the time of the remnant." Ferris rightly draws our attention to a series of persons and objects in Scott whose remnancy "generates a curiously insubstantial existence in the present"; and she describes a special, Romantic genre of the remnant tale, which "retains at its core an experience of disconnection from present energies" (475).  In turning to <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> in light of my preceding discussion of the troublingly unbounded objects harvested by the antiquarian enterprise, I want to fill out the range of possibilities for remnancy in Scott by considering the ways in which remnancy might best be thought as a normative, rather than an exceptional, state.  That is to say, in part, that the "experience of disconnection from present energies" that Ferris describes is as frequently and as characteristically conjured by Scott's manifold presentations of outdated dress as it is in the more evidently historical disconnections Ferris foregrounds. </p>
<p>In the broadest terms, Scott's antiquary haunts the supposed distinctness of the temporal present with a reminder that attachment to the moment at hand might not be so different from the antiquary's ostensibly aberrant attachment to a favored moment from the past.  Ferris herself underscores the distinctness of <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>, as a text that "enfolds all manner of remnants in a generous model of community," in what she sees as a contrast to less harmonious Waverley Novels (475).  But that otherwise useful formulation of "community" obscures how much the <emph>present</emph>, in any strong sense, is displaced by that very different, and not so obviously temporal, conception of unity.  If Scott's fiction is instrumental in creating a sense of "connect[ion] to the energy of historical process" (in Ferris's terms), Scott is equally a theorist of enduring provenances (for persons and for objects), of determinations by former moments that are much more compelling than the weak sort of synchronic coincidence that tends to characterize any given "now" (476).  "Historical context" on this view may be nothing more than the weak collective product of the idiosyncratic temporal attachments of persons (to many times)—and thus a space wherein historical affiliations rather than determinations may come to the fore.</p>
<p>Ferris's account of remnancy is emblematic of how, in contrast to the way I want to think about Scott, recent secondary work on the antiquarian enterprise has tended to bifurcate the historical specimen between the categories of the "fragment" (which persists as an isolated or residual entity fully cut off from the present) and the "forgery," literal or otherwise (which despite a pretense to pastness finally belongs, in one way or another, fully to the present).  But at the literary epicenter of the figure of the antiquary, Scott himself is precisely interested to <emph>stage</emph> this fragment/forgery division.  As a character, Jonathan Oldbuck at least rhetorically presumes a hard and fast division between past and present, classical antiquity and modern times.  But Oldbuck's refraction in the person of his sister Griselda points to the fuller complexity the novel has in mind from the start.  During the young hero Lovel's initial encounter with her at the threshold of Oldbuck's estate of Monkbarns, Griselda first appears (in the novel's setting of 1794) as the living embodiment of 1770: "The elderly lady rustled in silks and satins, and bore upon her head a structure resembling the fashion in the ladies' memorandum-book for the year 1770—a superb piece of architecture—not much less than a modern Gothic castle, of which the curls might represent the turrets, the black pins the <foreign>chevaux de frize</foreign>, and the lappets the banners"; likewise, "An antique flowered silk gown graced the extraordinary person to whom belonged this unparalleled <foreign>tête</foreign>," along with "triple blond ruffles" at the elbows, "gloves of a bright vermillion color," and "a short silk cloak, thrown in easy negligence over her shoulders"; and when Lovel pays his respects he is "answered by the prolonged curtsey of 1760" (57-58).  As an antique <emph>person</emph> who takes on the qualities of styles prevailing in the various days of her own making, Griselda's way of adhering to time more closely resembles the lives of objects than the fates of the written texts or dematerialized spaces of historical encounter (e.g., just-discernible traces of Roman-era earthworks in the landscape) that Oldbuck tends to privilege. And if Griselda's seemingly eccentric perpetuation of the past sets the tone for the novel, it finally appears not so much in contrast as in parallel to "the fashion of the day" that adorns Oldbuck's niece, Maria (58); to the "old-fashioned barbering" of Jacob Caxon upon the three wigs still being worn in the parish (48); and to the "ornaments in the taste of a former and distant period" that furnish the foreboding Glenallan House (273).  Griselda's dress is the template for the novel's proliferation and preservation of times other than antiquity and the present.</p>
<p>  In the last instance, through the French invasion that famously never comes, <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> spoofs the very possibility that presentness could emerge in a strong sense. In retrospect, the novel's most genuine moment of urgency is the clockwork tide best observed via the Fairport Almanack's catalogue of the sea's repetitive motion. (An unusually high tide threatens to sweep the unsuspecting Sir Arthur Wardour and his daughter, Isabella, out to sea.) <note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn20" n="20">On this scene and its larger relevance, see Richard Maxwell, who suggests that Oldbuck knows "the rules of time and its periodic inundations" (452).                  
               </note> Crucially, the merely calendrical succession of the tides directly displaces the aspiration to cohesive, cultural presentness embodied within the fashionable women's "pocket almanack" of Oldbuck's niece, which would have carried precisely such information as the "dress of the year," in prose description and in visual illustration of the latest styles. Struck with the urgency of the moment, Oldbuck flings this pocket almanac aside to consult the other volume so denominated.  ("An almanack! an almanack! [...] not that bauble!" he cries [69].)  Maria's ostensibly current pocket book, like her attachment to the "fashion of the day" (58) (as registered within the almanac as well as on her person), has no more essential connection to the urgent situation at hand than does the "ladies memorandum book for the year 1770" (57) that continues to guide Griselda's headdress style. </p>
<p>Scott, whom literary history largely continues to see as the architect of historical presentness, is in a different way a projector of the present's impossibility. In the many times of Monkbarns, Scott recasts the antiquarian idea as the negative image of modernity's naïve faith in a unified present (or moment, or episteme, or crisis) different in kind from the past.  Scott's antiquarian counter-vision animates historical specimens but refuses either to relegate or conscript them—and so refuses to concede the ontological privilege of a present that, like all other moments, can finally bear on human existence only insofar as it is called, or loved, or loathed into being by its custodians.  A longer perspective on the antiquarian enterprise, then, begins to suggest how modern historical fiction is built against a backdrop of fashion's rival relation to the cultural archive.  And as a deep response to Pennant's mobile guillotines, Scott's historical fiction takes shape, in part, through a complex refusal to allow fashions to be present again.

<head>About this Volume</head>
<p rend="noCount">This volume of <title level="j">Romantic Circles Praxis Series</title> includes an editor's introduction by <ref target="#KelleyAbout">Theresa M. Kelley</ref> and <ref target="#CasidAbout">Jill H. Casid</ref>, with essays by <ref target="#ThomasAbout">Sophie Thomas</ref>, <ref target="#WoodAbout">Marcus Wood</ref>, <ref target="#RareyAbout">Matthew Francis Rarey</ref>, <ref target="#KrizAbout">Kay Dian Kriz</ref>, and <ref target="#TraverseAbout">Lucy Kamiko Hawkinson Traverse</ref>.</p>
<!-- Long volume abstract goes here -->
<p rend="noCount">This volume is dedicated to both excavating the Romantic genealogies of visuality and charting directions for the ways in which the study of Romantic visual culture may redraw the geographic, temporal, and disciplinary bounds of Romanticism, bringing diverse, and in some instances new, objects and their ethical, political, and aesthetic stakes into view. The essays investigate three broad inquiries: 1) technologies of vision and objectivity’s slippages; 2) the indigenous or transplanted fruits of visuality’s New World Genealogies and 3) the role of proto-photography, panopticism, and slavery in the spectral formation of Romantic visuality. Emphasizing the ways we interpret visuality in romantic culture, the volume invites reconsideration of media, practices, and discourses that would seem to belong to earlier and later periods—from the artifacts and modes of viewing attached to curiosity and to technologies and ways of imaging and imagining that have become aligned with photography and the digital. </p>

<head>About the Design and Markup</head>
<p rend="noCount">This volume was designed at the University of Maryland by David Rettenmaier, Site Manager at <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title>. The main banner image on the table of contents uses as its background <title level="m">Section of the Rotunda, Leicester Square, in which is Exhibited the Panorama</title>, 1801 (aquatint) by Robert Mitchell (fl. 1782-1835). Private Collection/ The Bridgeman Art Library. It is reproduced in full in <ref target="praxis.visualities.2014.thomas.html">Sophie Thomas' essay</ref>. The initial transformation from WORD Doc to TEI P5 was made using the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/#">OxGarage</ref> tool, with further TEI markup modifications according to RC house style applied by David Rettenmaier. TEI renders text in archival quality for better preservation and future access. Laura Mandell developed the modified versions of the XSLT transforms provided by the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</ref> that were used to convert the TEI files into HTML. </p>

<head>About the <title level="s">Romantic Circles Praxis
					Series</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">The <title level="j">Romantic Circles Praxis Series</title> is devoted to
					using computer technologies for the contemporary critical
					investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and
					theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of
					Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge,
					<title level="j">RCPS</title> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world
					where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a
					period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on
					the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the
					intellectual and theoretical discussions of today.
					<title level="j">RCPS</title> is committed to mapping out this terrain with
					the best and most exciting critical writing of
					contemporary Romanticist scholarship.</p>

<hi rend="bold">Lucy Kimiko Hawkinson Traverse<anchor xml:id="TraverseAbout"/>
</hi> is a Fellow at the Institute for Research in the
				      Humanities and a PhD Candidate in the Department of Art History at the
				      University of Wisconsin-Madison.  She is a broad modernist interested in the
				      transatlantic visual culture of the long nineteenth century, the history and
				      theory of photography, the gendering and imaging of psychosomatic
				      eccentricity, and visual experiences of the urban.  Her dissertation,
				      “Ectoplasmic Modernities: Materialization Photography at the Turn of the
				      Century,” explores the transatlantic interest in psychical research at the
				      fin de siècle, arguing that the “ectoplasmic” forces us to rethink
				      modernism’s visual and conceptual relationship to the occult, and
				      photography’s relationship to the history of science. This project has been
				      supported by Chancellor’s Fellowships and a CLIR/Mellon Fellowship for
				      Dissertation Research in Original Sources.  Work from her dissertation
				      research will appear in the forthcoming anthology <title level="m">Photography in Doubt</title>
				      (Routledge, 2015).</p>

<div type="abstract">
<p rend="noCount">When Shelley published <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> in 1810, its Gothic conventions had already become a target
                    of satire in the wake of anti-Jacobin polemics against the revolutionary zeal
                    expressed in the “Pamphlet Wars” (1790-91). Although Shelley was entering an
                    ideological battle that had apparently already been won by reactionary anti-Jacobin
                    forces, conservative paranoia provided a target-rich environment for a transgressive
                    aesthetic that played upon fears of persecution, conspiracy, and libertinism.
                    Shelley exploits this opportunity by positioning <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>
                    not as a satire of the Gothic (as several prominent Shelley scholars have suggested)
                    nor a mouthpiece (in the character of <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>) for his
                    own subversive philosophical commitments, but as a diagnostic study of anti-Jacobin
                    paranoiac fantasy, expressed through one of their favorite targets of derision—the
                    gothic novel.</p>

<p>
<title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> (1810) was Shelley’s first significant
                    publication and reflects his early enthusiasm for the Gothic and sensationalist
                    literature of the period. Both in theme and style, <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> is indebted to several of Shelley’s favorite Gothic
                    novels, particularly Ann Radcliffe’s <title level="m">The Italian</title>
                    (1797), Matthew G. Lewis’s <title level="m">The Monk</title> (1796), and
                    Charlotte Dacre’s <title level="m">Zofloya</title> (1806). A cursory reading of
                    the novel reveals many obligatory Gothic trappings—an ominous castle, a gloomy
                    cave, a demon-like seductress (Matilda), a hero-victim entrapped by
                    circumstances beyond his control (Verezzi), a spectral villain bent on revenge
                    (Zastrozzi), and shadowy figures of established authority—all saturated with the
                    requisite dose of brooding atmospherics and sublime scenery that often reflect
                    the characters’ “distempered” emotional states. Although <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> lacks the historical scope, descriptive detail, and
                    narrative polish of Shelley’s models, the novel develops an elaborate
                    pursuit-escape narrative trajectory that is both tightly structured and unfolds
                    at an energetic pace, incorporating aspects of Gothic romance, sentimentalist
                    fiction, and the philosophical novel. (For readers unfamiliar with <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>, see the footnote for a brief synopsis of the
                        novel.)<note place="foot" resp="editors"> As the novel opens we find the
                        “wretched” Verezzi, the ostensible protagonist, “[t]orn from the society of
                        all he held dear on earth, the victim of secret enemies, and exiled from
                        happiness . . .” (61). Verezzi has been abducted in his sleep and then
                        brought to a cave and chained to a rock by the “sublime” and “malevolent”
                        Zastrozzi, for reasons we are as yet unaware. When a “scintillating flame”
                        of lightning destroys the cavern, Verezzi is able to escape, but is further
                        pursued by Zastrozzi and his co-conspirator Matilda, whose sexual passion
                        for Verezzi threatens to separate him from his fiancée Julia, whom we meet
                        in the flesh only much later in the novel. In collaboration with the “wily”
                        Matilda, Zastrozzi sets out to murder Julia and recapture Verezzi so that
                        Matilda can continue her seduction and win his heart (although, unknown to
                        Matilda, Zastrozzi’s murderous intent extends ultimately to Verezzi). <p rend="noCount"> When Zastrozzi fails to kill Julia, Matilda falsely
                            informs Verezzi that Julia is dead and continues, though unsuccessfully,
                            to seduce Verezzi and erase the memory of Julia from his distempered
                            mind. To that end, Zastrozzi devises a plan in which he feigns an
                            attempt to murder Verezzi, at which point Matilda rushes in and shields
                            him, sustaining only minor injuries. Believing Julia to be dead and
                            Matilda to have been his saviour, Verezzi, in a “Lethean torpor” at last
                            professes his love to Matilda and consents to marriage. Soon after,
                            Zastrozzi arranges a meeting in which Julia confronts Verezzi and
                            Matilda. Dumbfounded at the sight of Julia and overcome with guilt,
                            Verezzi commits suicide by stabbing himself in the chest. Matilda then
                            plucks the blood-stained dagger from Verezzi's corpse, and in a frenzy
                            of rage stabs the innocent Julia “with exulting pleasure, again and
                            again,” burying “the dagger to the hilt in her body, even after all
                            remains of life were annihilated” (143). </p>
<p rend="noCount"> The
                            guilty parties are eventually discovered and brought before the
                            authorities, where Zastrozzi confesses that he is actually Verezzi’s
                            illegitimate half-brother and has sought vengeance against Verezzi on
                            behalf of his disgraced mother (possibly a prostitute) who was abandoned
                            by their father, whom he had murdered before the events of the novel
                            take place. At the conclusion of the novel, Zastrozzi and Matilda are
                            sentenced to execution by the Council of Ten for their murderous
                            conspiracy. Although Matilda finally repents and reconciles herself with
                            the Catholic Church, Zastrozzi unrepentantly and defiantly continues to
                            express his “atheism” and disdain for institutional morality, even at
                            the expense of his own life: “Even whilst writhing under the agony of
                            almost insupportable torture his nerves were stretched, Zastrozzi’s
                            firmness failed him not; but, upon his soul-illumined countenance,
                            played a smile of most disdainful scorn; and, with a wild, convulsive
                            laugh of exulting revenge—he died” (156). Vengeance and transgressive
                            sexual desires are punished, illegitimate threats to class structure and
                            established authority are eliminated, and the equilibrium of the status
                            quo is restored.</p>

<p>Although <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> concludes with a traditional moral
                    resolution that would placate a genteel readership, the few contemporary reviews
                    of <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> were unflattering, if not vitriolic, and
                    no doubt contributed to Shelley’s lifelong acrimony towards critical responses
                    to his work in the press. The critical atmosphere of the early nineteenth
                    century towards the glut of sensationalist fiction of the period is well
                    exemplified in this passage from the following “Prospectus” that was submitted
                    in support of the <title level="j">New London Review; or Monthly Report of
                        Authors and Books</title> (1799): “Though no arrogance will be indulged in
                    this publication, whatever disturbs the public harmony, insults legal authority,
                    outrages the best regards of the heart, invalidates the radical obligations of
                    morality, attacks the vital springs of established functions of piety, or in any
                    respect clashes with the sacred forms of decency, however witty, elegant, and
                    well written, can be noticed only in terms of severe and unequivocal
                    reprehension” (qtd. in Grenby 177). </p>
<p> In the spirit of such regulative moral criticism, the <title level="j">Critical
                        Review</title>, for example, offered these trenchant observations on
                    Shelley’s “shameless and disgusting volume”: “Zastrozzi is one of the most
                    savage and improbable demons that ever issued from a diseased brain . . . a more
                    discordant, disgusting, and despicable performance has not, we are persuaded,
                    issued from the press for some time.” The review concludes, in language used to
                    describe Shelley by future reviewers of his controversial poetry, that “We know
                    not when we have felt so much indignation as in the perusal of this execrable
                    production. The author of it cannot be too severely reprobated. Not all his
                        ‘<emph>scintillated eyes</emph>,’ his ‘<emph>battling emotions</emph>,’ his
                        ‘<emph>frigorific torpidity</emph> of despair,’ nor his ‘<emph>Lethean
                        torpor</emph>,’ with the rest of his nonsensical and stupid jargon, ought to
                    save him from infamy, and his volume from the flames” (329-31). <title level="j">The Gentleman’s Magazine</title> was less dismissive in this pithy, though
                    naive, account: “. . . by placing the scene on the Continent, the Author has
                    availed himself of characters and vices which, however useful in narratives of
                    this description, thank God, are not to be found in this country” (258). Mary
                    Shelley herself, along with Shelley’s early biographers, encapsulates a critical
                    perspective that would dominate Shelley studies well into the twentieth century:
                    “He was a lover of the wonderful and wild in literature, but had not fostered
                    these tastes at their genuine sources—the romances and chivalry of the middle
                    ages—but in the perusal of such German works as were current in those days.
                    Under the influence of these he, at the age of fifteen, wrote two short prose
                    romances of slender merit. The sentiments and language were exaggerated, the
                    composition imitative and poor” (I, 101-2).</p>
<p> Although less vitriolic than the <title level="j">Critical Review</title>, many
                    Shelley scholars begin discussing Shelley’s Gothic novels and early poetry (if
                    they are discussed at all) by offering what amounts to an apology. Shelley’s
                    Gothic sensibility is thought to be an embarrassment at worst or a transitional
                    phase at best. Kenneth Neill Cameron, for example, writes that Shelley, during
                    his “votary of Romance“ period, “was genuinely interested in the mysterious and
                    the occult . . . and in his novels he was, from time to time, carried away by
                    his subject . . . but he wrote largely with his tongue in his own
                    cheek—delighting, at times, in parodying his own style—aware, as he was writing
                    the novels, of their inherent ridiculousness, but interested in a quick,
                    schoolboy fame”, and “if Shelley’s gothic novels are bad, his horror poetry
                    written in the same period is worse” (28,33). For Cameron, it is not until
                    Shelley reads Godwin (“his master”) and assumes his “social duties” that his
                    work rises to the level of serious critical attention. A. J. Hartley (following
                    Frederick Jones), argues that Shelley’s “‘taste for romances’ definitely ended
                    in November, 1810, when he ordered a copy of [Godwin’s <title level="m">Political Justice</title>] from Stockdale” (v). David Seed reads <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> as a “crude and largely unconscious exploration
                    of sexual fear” and finds the character of Zastrozzi to be “banal and a
                    stereotype” (5). Eustace Chesser, in his Freudian reading of <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> (and perhaps channeling Peacock), claims that Shelley
                    “was not a rebel without a cause—he had too many causes. He was an introvert
                    with no strong sense of reality. . . . His all too short life was a continuous
                    refusal to accept responsibility. He never completely grew up. His vision was
                    centred upon the world as he would like it to be, not on the world as it is”
                    (12). More forgiving is Frederick Frank, who reads <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> as “a dark fable of identity” (ix) that “combine[s] an
                    expert knowledge of the elaborate technology of the Gothic romance and its
                    mandatory apparatus with the future poet’s desire to arrive at a Gothic
                    aesthetic through which beauty and horror could be expressed simultaneously”
                    (ix). Frank concludes, however, that <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> is
                    “basically a solipsistic excursion” (x). </p>
<p> These interpretive approaches minimize the significance of Shelley’s early
                    Gothic works in two ways: first, they treat Shelley’s Gothic sensibility as an
                    undisciplined exercise of formal mimicry in a tarnished genre that bears little
                    relevance to his mature work; and second, they treat the Gothic as a foreign
                    element that is superseded by the transcendent idealism of Shelley’s later
                    poetry. Each of these approaches drain Shelley’s Gothic of its concrete
                    historical particularity and disavow the antagonisms around which his early work
                    circulates. The young Shelley’s construction of a post-Enlightenment Gothic
                    subject produces an impasse that is not easily recuperated within the context of
                    his later works, which may productively be read as reaction-formations against
                    the consequences that such a Gothic subject precipitates. </p>
<p> The most recent studies of Shelley’s Gothic novels, though still few, have been
                    informed by the growing interest in the complex relations between the Gothic and
                    Romanticism, and by the emergence of Gothic studies as a legitimate discipline
                    of scholarly inquiry.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See, for example,

</note> As the
                    essays in this volume argue, readers of Shelley’s early Gothic works must lift
                    the painted veil of two centuries of largely dismissive criticism and revisit
                    these works with fresh eyes and an appreciation for the ways in which Shelley
                    delimits the residual “Gothic complex” of symbols in the service of articulating
                    an emergent Romantic revolutionary consciousness. In one his early essays on
                    Shelley’s Gothic novels, Jerrold Hogle shows how <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> anticipates Shelley’s mature poetry and metaphysical
                    writings, noting that <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> is “about the higher
                    unity of the self prohibiting its arrival with antitheses of its own making.
                    Every sequence circles back on the mind’s dark chamber where the soul chooses to
                    diffuse and battle itself and thus envelop the chamber in gloom” (85). And in
                        <title level="m">Romantic Narrative</title>, Tilottama Rajan’s post-Lacanian
                    analysis of <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> reveals the “madness” at the core
                    of Shelley’s exploration of psychosis and perversion, an “irruption of the Real
                    into the Symbolic” that is “staged in the laboratory of a mental theater” (64).
                    While I agree with Hogle and Rajan that Shelley’s early Gothic works stage the
                    antagonistic, intersubjective dynamics of self and Other(s), I argue that 
                    <title level="m">Zastrozzi’s</title> significance is deepened even further by
                    considering the literary-political-historical context in which it was written.
                        <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> not only establishes the “Gothic complex”
                    that Hogle so well describes, but the novel also reflects that complex of
                    symbols and images back into itself to illuminate the late eighteenth-century
                    reactionary fantasies that generate it and against which Shelley would fashion a
                    revised “republicanism” in his subsequent poetry. </p>
<p> As Stephen Behrendt has argued, Shelley often exploits conventional forms to
                    transmit radical ideas,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Stephen Behrendt’s
                        “Introduction” to his edition of <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> and
                            <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title> (pp. 9-53). Cf. also Steven Jones’s
                            <title level="m">Shelley’s Satire</title>.</note> so it is not
                    surprising that Shelley would choose the Gothic as a vehicle through which to
                    surreptitiously express his interests. Indeed, one is tempted to read
                    Zastrozzi’s various philosophical exhortations (which Hannah More would have
                    characterized as “speculative infidelity”) in the context of Shelley’s own
                    iconoclastic positions at the time. For example, in series of letters to Hogg
                    between 1810 and 1811 Shelley writes, in language that could have been spoken by
                    Zastrozzi himself: “Oh! I burn with impatience for the moment of Xtianity's
                    dissolution, it has injured me; I swear on the altar of perjured love to revenge
                    myself on the hated cause of the effect which <emph>even now</emph> I can
                    scarcely help deploring. . . . I swear that never will I forgive Christianity!
                    it is the only point on which I allow myself to encourage revenge. . . . Oh how
                    I wish I <emph>were</emph> the Antichrist, that it were <emph>mine</emph> to
                    crush the Demon, to hurl him to his native Hell never to rise again—I expect to
                    gratify some of this insatiable feeling in Poetry” (27–35). In an extended
                    philosophical discussion with Matilda, Zastrozzi expresses the same antipathy to
                    religious orthodoxy: “Am I not convinced of the non-existence of a Deity? am I
                    not convinced that death will but render this soul more free, more unfettered?
                    Why need I then shudder at death? why need any one, whose mind has risen above
                    the shackles of prejudice, the errors of a false and injurious superstition”
                    (153).</p>
<p> Throughout the novel, Zastrozzi argues in favor of a number of often
                    contradictory Enlightenment philosophical motifs, from the utilitarian calculus
                    of pleasures and pains to Godwinian perfectibilitarianism to mechanistic
                    determinism to, ultimately, a self-pitying strain of nihilistic fatalism:
                    “whatever procures pleasure is right”; man “was created for no other purpose but
                    to obtain happiness”; “rather than suppose that by its own innate and
                    energetical exertions, this soul must endure for ever, that no fortuitous
                    occurrences, no incidental events, can affect its happiness; but by daring
                    boldly, by striving to verge from the beaten path, whilst yet trammeled in the
                    chains of mortality, it will gain superior advantages in a future state”; “fate
                    wills us to die: and I intend to meet death, to encounter annihilation with
                    tranquility.” Yet despite his avowed atheism, Zastrozzi’s elaborate scheme for
                    revenge against Verezzi depends upon the existence of a Christian heaven and
                    hell and the immortality of the soul. Reflecting upon the murder of his father,
                    Zastrozzi laments: “But I destroyed his <emph>body</emph> alone . . . time has
                    taught me better: his son’s <emph>soul</emph> is hell-doomed to all eternity: he
                    destroyed himself; but my machinations, though unseen, effected his destruction”
                    (155). </p>
<p> John Whatley argues that Zastrozzi is “a well-spoken and committed Atheist”
                    (203) and that Shelley’s “representatives of atheism and revolution are yet
                    ‘villains’ who through conspiracy, deceit, and violence forward social
                    disruption, but they are equally fascinating in their power to satirize and
                    undercut Church morality and to allow the fulfillment of desire” (209). A closer
                    reading, however, reveals Zastrozzi to be an equal-opportunity sophist, more
                    Hobbesian or Machiavellian than Godwinian, who appropriates into a bricolage of
                    contradictory positions whatever discourse suits his purposes. He may be
                    “well-spoken,” but he is hardly “committed” to any particular cause other than
                    revenge. And neither he nor Matilda successfully “undercut Church morality.”
                    Matilda ultimately reconciles herself to the Church and Zastrozzi is executed by
                    the Inquisition, whose absolute authority is never in doubt and remains fully
                    intact at the conclusion of the novel. On the one hand we can point to the
                    hypocritical self-interest of Matilda’s religious awakening and Zastrozzi’s
                    Satanic-like resistance against absolute authority, but on the other hand we
                    have to ask if such supposed insights are really all that subversive? From a
                    progressive standpoint, is Shelley asking us to identify with murderers who are,
                    despite their transgressive and liberating ambitions, consumed by
                    self-gratification? Is Shelley championing a Bataillean “expenditure” beyond the
                    pleasure principle that ultimately seeks to sustain prohibitions for the purpose
                    of producing the desire to transgress them? We should perhaps be inclined to
                    take Shelley at his word when he admonishes one reader of the novel against
                    confusing his own radicalism with that of his characters: “If he takes me for
                    any one whose character I have drawn in <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> he is
                    mistaken quite” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 11).</p>
<p> Such is the interpretive crux of <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>, caught in
                    the balance between the reactionary and revolutionary impulses of the Gothic
                    aesthetic. Revolutionary desire is always in danger of falling into what Peter
                    Starr calls a “logic of specular doubling” or “structural repetition” that
                    mirrors the oppressive mechanisms of power it seeks to displace. Starr explains,
                    “If one undertakes direct, political action . . . then the logics of specular
                    doubling and structural repetition apply. But if one refuses such action, then
                    one’s revolt will at best be hopelessly marginal, at worst a reinforcement of
                    institutionalized power” (8). For Shelley, the most vivid example of such a
                    scenario would have been the degeneration of republicanism into terror during
                    the French Revolution, where, according to Starr, revolutionaries became
                    “trapped in a dualistic, paranoid world where rivalry springs from the
                    narcissistic illusion of one’s own subjective unity” (9). In the figure of
                    Zastrozzi, Shelley demonstrates his budding appreciation for the complexities
                    and dangers of revolutionary change and the ways in which desire is inextricably
                    bound to even the most abstract of political commitments.</p>
<p> But if Shelley’s aim is simply to diagnose the failings of Enlightenment
                    revolutionary discourse by drawing attention to the destructive desires that
                    underwrite its universalizing drive, then we might expect Shelley to adopt a
                    narrative strategy similar to that employed by Charlotte Dacre in <title level="m">Zofloya</title>. The narrator of <title level="m">Zofloya</title>
                    informs us early on that to understand the transgressive desires of Victoria we
                    must elucidate, in the spirit of Enlightenment curiosity and utilitarian ethics,
                    the “causes” of her destructive behavior: “The historian who would wish his
                    lessons to sink deep into the heart, thereby essaying to render mankind virtuous
                    and more happy, must not content himself with simply detailing a series of
                    events—he must ascertain causes, and follow progressively their effects; he must
                    draw deductions from incidents as they arise, and ever revert to the actuating
                    principle” (3). Throughout the course of the novel, however, the narrator’s
                    attempts to account for Victoria’s increasingly complex desires and motivations
                    seem inadequate, almost to the point of comic absurdity. The failure to reduce
                    Victoria’s subjectivity to a network of causal determinations (for example,
                    negligent parenting), suggests that Dacre’s narration works ironically as a
                    critique of Enlightenment itself, particularly the more dogmatic strains of
                    French mechanistic materialism (La Mettrie’s <title level="m">L’Homme
                        Machine</title> and Holbach’s <title level="m">Systême de la Nature</title>,
                    for example) that reduce human relationships to a scientific model of strict
                    necessity. Shelley’s investment in materialism, however, was strengthening
                    during the period of <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>’s composition, so he
                    was, perhaps, disinclined to adopt Dacre’s ironic stance toward Enlightenment
                    critical gestures.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
<title level="m">Queen Mab</title> (1813) has been thought to mark the
                        culmination of Shelley’s strict materialism, from which he would not awaken
                        from his own dogmatic slumber until the <title level="m">Alastor</title>
                        volume of 1816. Adriana Cracuin has pointed out that in spite of <title level="m">Zofloya</title>’s transgressive content, Dacre herself was
                        politically conservative. So it stands to reason that she would have been
                        more inclined to critique Enlightenment doctrine than Shelley, who never
                        abandoned the revolutionary principles of the Enlightenment.</note>
                    Shelley’s narrator, too, adds a layer of ironic subtext, but from a different
                    ideological perspective. The narrator often pauses to comment upon characters
                    and events from a position of the “Church morality” that Whatley identifies,
                    which signals the narrator’s complicity with conservative ideology and, by
                    extension, with Verezzi. Zastrozzi is admonished for his “sophistry,” and his
                    inability to “contemplate the wonderful operations, the mysterious ways of
                    Providence” (102); and when Matilda prays for God’s forgiveness, the narrator
                    happily reports that “mercy, by the All-benevolent of heaven, is never refused
                    to those humbly, yet trusting in his goodness, ask it” (150). But again, this
                    does not necessarily undercut church morality because, given the exaggerated
                    evil and narcissism of Matilda and Zastrozzi, the disapprobation towards them
                    would be wholly justifiable. </p>
<p> I argue that Shelley deftly subverts conventional ideology while at the same
                    time satisfying its moral prescriptions by splitting the diegetic reality from
                    its subversive subtext, revealing an intersubjective dynamic that complicates
                    any reading of the novel that either reduces the characters to static Gothic
                    stereotypes or that resolves the narrative action within a determinate nexus of
                    cause and effect. Because the narrative is doubly refracted through a
                    conservative lens (the narrator and Verezzi), we must resist the impulse to
                    valorize the characters of Verezzi and Julia at the expense of Matilda and
                    Zastrozzi, who are actually the far more interesting and complicated characters
                    in the novel (and like Milton’s Satan, more “ethical”). The temptation to
                    identify with Verezzi and Julia persists nonetheless, particularly when we
                    consider the similarity between the situation in which Verezzi finds himself at
                    the beginning of the novel and that of Prometheus in <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title>: “Verezzi was chained to a piece of rock which remained
                    immovable. The violence of the storm was past, but the hail descended rapidly,
                    each stone of which wounded his naked limbs. Every flash of lighting, although
                    now distant, dazzled his eyes, unaccustomed as they had been to the least ray of
                    light” (64). Several critics have commented upon the similarity here between
                    Verezzi and Prometheus,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See David
                        Halliburton’s “Shelley’s ‘Gothic’ Novels” (K-SJ 36 [1967]: 39); John V.

                        “Foreword” to his edition of Shelley’s novels (viii).</note> but the
                    resemblance is a lure that will prove to be superficial and misleading over the
                    course of the novel and distorts any interpretation of Shelley’s early work
                    through the retroactive gaze of his later treatment of similar themes. </p>
<p> Reading Verezzi as a precursor to the “champion of mankind” strains credulity.
                    As much as we might empathize with his suffering, Verezzi is a passive “hero”
                    who represents unreflecting, reactionary aristocratic privilege, one of the
                    primary targets of Shelley’s subversive critique. Furthermore, Verezzi occupies
                    a space that is traditionally populated by female protagonists in Gothic novels:
                    in <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>, it is the <emph>male,</emph> rather than
                    a young, virtuous female, who is pursued, confined, and tormented by a sublime
                    figure of phallic power—two if we count Matilda and her predatory sexuality.
                    Throughout the course of the novel, Verezzi is coded as feminine, and the only
                    feature which signifies his masculinity is his choice of love objects. The
                    attitude towards gender and power expressed in the novel is ambiguous, subject
                    to continual destabilization as Matilda and Verezzi negotiate their gendered
                    positions in relation to one another, finally reaching a provisional, though
                    compromised, equilibrium within a common fantasy space. </p>
<p>
<title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>’s explicit representations of subversion are
                    a <emph>semblance</emph> designed to alert us to a far more subversive strategy
                    at work in the novel, one that is more historically informed than has been
                    previously recognized and that interrogates the intellectual context in which it
                    was written. By the time Shelley published <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> in
                    1810, the popularity of the Gothic genre was in decline and its conventions had
                    already become a target of satire and parody in the wake of the anti-Jacobin
                    backlash against the revolutionary zeal expressed in the “Pamphlet Wars” of
                    1790-91. As M. O. Grenby argues in <title level="m">The Anti-Jacobin
                        Novel</title>, “The ‘Revolution debate,’ the ‘war of ideas,’ withered away,
                    not because every champion of radical doctrine had been utterly converted by the
                    logic of the conservatives, but because few of them . . . could be found who
                    wished to defy a near unanimous and highly militant anti-Jacobinism to put
                    forward what had suddenly become dangerously unorthodox opinions” (5). The young
                    Shelley was not one to shy away from such opinions, but he was also sly enough
                    to understand that progressive principles had been perverted into monstrous
                    caricatures. </p>
<p> The ambiguous status of the Gothic’s transgressive revolutionary potential, on
                    the one hand, and its reactionary, ameliorative impulse, on the other,
                    participates in a larger aesthetic context in which the master signifiers of the
                    Revolutionary era were points of bitter contention between those, like Edmund
                    Burke, who framed the established authority of the <foreign>ancien
                        régime</foreign> in sublime terms and the republicanism of Revolution as
                    monstrous; and those, like Paine, Wollstonecraft, Godwin, and other
                    Enlightenment progressives, who framed the Revolution in sublime terms and the
                        <foreign>ancien régime</foreign> as monstrous. Burkean aesthetic categories
                    of the sublime and beautiful reflect the predominant eighteenth-century
                    hierarchy: sublime qualities of nobility, reason, and awe are associated with
                    men; and beautiful qualities such as passion, friendship, and elegance are
                    associated with women. For Burke, the feudal political structure of the
                        <foreign>ancien régime</foreign>, both in England and France, represents a
                    sublime political structure that inspires awe, admiration, and respect for a
                    powerful patriarchal authority founded on centuries of political,
                    ecclesiastical, and social tradition. The following passage from Burke’s <title level="m">Reflections on the Revolution in France</title> is typical: “We
                    fear God; we look up with awe to kings, with affection to parliaments, with duty
                    to magistrates, with reverence to priests, and with respect to nobility. Why?
                    Because when such ideas are brought before our minds, it is natural to be so
                    affected; because all other feelings are false and spurious, and tend to corrupt
                    our minds, to vitiate our primary morals, and make us unfit for rational
                    liberty” (76). The hegemonic struggle between Jacobin and anti-Jacobin factions
                    to define and control the meaning of master signifiers such as “freedom,”
                    “nature,” “progress,” “necessity,” “good,” “evil,” “masculine,” “feminine,”
                    etc., finds its aesthetic counterpart in the Gothic literature (“sickening
                    trash,” as one <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title> critic put it) produced
                    during the apex of its popularity in the 1790s and early 1800s. </p>
<p> The anti-Jacobin fiction of the period emphasizes the dangers to British social
                    stability when challenged by the “new philosophy” of Enlightenment progressives.
                    Clara Reeve writes, for instance, in her preface to <title level="m">Memoirs of
                        Sir Roger de Clarendon</title> (1793): “The new philosophy of the present
                    day avows a levelling principle, and declares that a state of anarchy is more
                    beautiful than that of order and regularity. There is nothing more likely to
                    convince mankind of the errors of these men, than to set before them examples of
                    good government, and warnings of the mischievous consequences of their own
                    principles” (xvi-xvii). Anne Thomas, in <title level="m">Adolphus de
                        Biron</title> (1795?) writes: “I must, however, acknowledge that we have
                    some restless Spirits amongst us, who by their seditious Writings have
                    contributed no a little to the Work of Destruction . . . I thank Heaven the
                    number of such Miscreants is but small, when compared to the Spirit of the whole
                    Nation” (Grenby 104). And Robert Dallas writes, in <title level="m">Percival, or
                        Nature Vindicated. A Novel</title> (1801): “Men who born to fortune are
                    appointed by Providence to the administration of a certain portion of the
                    interests of the world: they are the helmsmen of happiness; and if they desert
                    the wheel, is there any wonder that the even course should be lost?” (I, 238). </p>
<p> Two poems in particular from <title level="j">The Anti-Jacobin Review</title>
                    (1799) effectively condense the perceived threats and vaguely generalized fear
                    of revolutionary change into a coherent image of monstrosity against which the
                    anti-Jacobin imaginary could organize its desire. “Ode to Jacobinism,”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
<title level="m">Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin</title>, pp. 94-96.</note>
                    ostensibly written by “An English Jacobin,” opens with an invocation to the
                    “Daughter of Hell, insatiate power, / Destroyer of the human race, / Whose iron
                    scourge and madd’ning hour / Exalt the bad, the good debase” (1-4). Under the
                    guidance of this “Daughter of Hell,” the Jacobin sympathizer seeks to satisfy
                    “Revenge” (25) and usher forth, from behind a “sophist veil” (41), “Fire,
                    rapine, sword, and chains, and ghastly Poverty” (40) and to “taint the mind,
                    corrupt the heart” (44). The Jacobin’s ultimate motive is to “Teach us to hate
                    and revile; / Our glorious Charter’s faults to scan, / Time-sanction’d Truths
                    despise, and preach Thy Rights of Man” (48). And in “Ode to a Jacobin,”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
<emph>ibid</emph>., pp. 211-13.</note> a more satirical piece, the
                    “Unchristian Jacobin” (1) is represented as an atheist who rationalizes the
                    violence of the Terror, forgoing “Mercy” (18), “Pity” (19), and “humanity” (28)
                    to profess a “love of executions” (41) that makes one “fit for Revolutions”
                    (42). The poem concludes by admonishing the Jacobin for thinking “All
                    Constitutions bad, but those bran new” (48). Anti-Jacobin fiction and criticism
                    was so successful that after only thirty-six issues the <title level="j">Anti-Jacobin Review</title> disbanded in 1798, declaring that “the SPELL of
                        <emph>Jacobin invulnerability</emph> is now broken.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Jonathan Wordsworth’s “Introduction” to <title level="m">Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin</title> for more details about the history
                        of the periodical and its contributors.</note> Conservative discourse had
                    successfully linked progressive philosophies with violence, establishing the
                        <emph>image</emph> of a <emph>necessary</emph> connection in place of a
                    complex constellation of contingent historical determinations. It had also
                    appropriated the rhetoric of Enlightenment to “naturalize” the socio-economic
                    hierarchy and its attendant privileges. </p>
<p> Although Shelley was entering an ideological battle that had apparently already
                    been won by reactionary forces, conservative paranoia provided a target-rich
                    environment for a transgressive aesthetic that played upon fears of persecution,
                    conspiracy, and libertinism.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> An important
                        source, for Shelley, of anti-Jacobin conspiracy fantasy associated with the
                        Revolution was Abbé Barruel’s <title level="m">Memoirs Illustrating the
                            History of Jacobinism</title> (1797). Shelley read the work out loud to
                        Mary on 9 October 1814, a day before Mary herself read <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> (see <title level="m">Journal,</title> p. 19). See
                        also Robert Miles’ essay in this volume on Shelley’s conspiratorial
                        imagination.</note> Shelley exploits this opportunity by positioning <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> not as a satire of the Gothic itself, but as a
                    diagnostic study of anti-Jacobin paranoiac fantasy, delivered through one of
                    their favorite targets of derision—the Gothic novel. From the perspective of the
                    anti-Jacobin imaginary, nothing could be seen as more threatening to the
                    normative hetero-patriarchal circuit of regulated desire—as exemplified by
                    Verezzi and Julia—than the sexually aggressive Matilda and the violently
                    atheistic Zastrozzi, two exceptions against which the stability of traditional
                    British social hierarchy were grounded. If Matilda and Verezzi’s father signify
                    the moral corruption of the élite, then Zastrozzi, in the form of an obscene
                    surplus, signifies the illegitimate product of such corruption. And Verezzi,
                    although unknowingly, contributes to that corruption himself when he finally
                    submits to Matilda’s seduction and forsakes his love for Julia. </p>
<p> When we consider Zastrozzi’s bricolage of contradictory Enlightenment rhetoric,
                    his murderous desire for revenge, and his illegitimacy (which signifies a
                    generalized threat to primogeniture and social hierarchy), from Verezzi’s
                    perspective Zastrozzi embodies the paranoiac image of the Jacobin monster. And
                    Matilda, whose excessive sexual degeneracy reads like a case study from
                    Bienville’s <title level="m">Nymphomania</title> (1775), embodies the paranoiac
                    image of a fully pathological subject whose actions are determined solely by
                    contingent self-interest. Matilda, like her namesake in Lewis’ <title level="m">The Monk</title> and like Victoria in Dacre’s <title level="m">Zofloya</title>, is described by the narrator (whose complicity with the
                    anti-Jacobin imaginary should not be overlooked) in similarly demonic
                    terms—“wily,” “perfidious,” “syren,” “ferocious,” “frantic,” “delirious,”
                    “horror-tranced,” and “wretched.” And, as Alenka Zupancic observes, “what is a
                    demon if not a fully pathological subject?”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        See Alenka Zupancic’s <title level="m">Ethics of the Real</title> for a full
                        discussion on the relation between Lacanian and Kantian ethics.</note>
                    Because Matilda and Zastrozzi are images drawn from reactionary paranoiac
                    fantasy, interpretations that identify Shelley’s own radicalism with either
                    character would actually <emph>legitimize</emph> the anti-Jacobin linkage of
                    violence to sexual liberation and progressive philosophy. This is why, from a
                    progressive standpoint, the explicit acts of transgression in the novel
                    constitute a semblance of revolutionary subversion designed to satirize
                    anti-Jacobin fears. </p>
<p> As a “romance” of the anti-Jacobin political unconscious, <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> reveals how paranoiac images of the Other are generated
                    by antagonisms inherent to the dominant ideology itself. In <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>, the <foreign>jouissance</foreign> of the feminine Other
                    (Matilda) is figured as a nymphomaniac, and the <foreign>jouissance</foreign> of
                    the masculine Other (Zastrozzi) is figured as a bloodthirsty revolutionary. The
                    paranoiac image of the Other, therefore, condenses a constellation of indistinct
                    fears, threats, and desires, and functions as a defense against the breakdown of
                    phallic structures of power that depend upon the stability of binary oppositions
                    and upon the regulation of the metonymic movement of desire along the chain of
                    signifiers. Although Shelley represents Matilda and Zastrozzi as images drawn
                    from anti-Jacobin paranoiac fantasy, those images do not remain static
                    throughout the course of the novel, nor are they simply caricatures of
                    conventional Gothic villains. The only static characters are Verezzi and Julia.
                    Verezzi is a MacKenzian man of feeling who finds himself thrust from the
                    pleasures of sentimentality into a Gothic nightmare of violent sensibility and
                    conspiratorial danger. He remains transfixed by Zastrozzi’s impenetrable gaze,
                    paralyzed by fear: “. . . Verezzi stood bewildered, and unable to arrange the
                    confusion of ideas which floated in his brain, and assailed his terror-struck
                    imagination. He knew not what to believe—what phantom it could be that, in the
                    shape of Zastrozzi, blasted his straining eye-balls— . . .” (90). Although we,
                    as readers, eventually learn Zastrozzi’s identity and his reasons for pursuing
                    Verezzi, Verezzi himself never does. Thus there is no meaningful interaction
                    between the two; they exist for each other only as image-objects. So if we claim
                    that <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> poses a thought experiment in which the
                    subject of aristocratic privilege encounters in reality the monsters he has
                    created in paranoiac fantasy, might we not also argue that Zastrozzi sees
                    Verezzi only as an image of the aristocratic oppression that has denied him
                    entrance into the socio-symbolic order? </p>
<p> The conservative ideology of the narrator makes it difficult to sustain such a
                    reversal, but the implication is there and points to how revolutionary and
                    reactionary discourses engage each other only through the conflict between
                    fantasmic materializations of their own lack. We can further unpack these
                    relations in Lacanian terms. Verezzi misrecognizes Zastrozzi, mistaking him as a
                    phallic signifier rather than as a signifier of the barred Other. According to
                    Lacan, the phallus is an object that materializes the lack in the
                        <emph>symbolic</emph> order, gives it a fascinating, powerful presence;
                    whereas the signifier of the barred Other is an object that signifies this lack
                    itself. Thus Lacan can claim that the phallic object is a signifier without a
                    signified. Zastrozzi, as a fantasmic condensation of anti-Jacobin fear, doesn’t
                    exist. He signifies the lack in the <foreign>ancien régime</foreign> social
                    hierarchy itself, the reminder (as a remainder) that society does not exist as a
                    harmonious totality. As Zizek explains, the phallus is at once a sign of power,
                    but also signifies lack: “The phallic signifier is, so to speak, an index of its
                    own impossibility . . . . This logic of the phallic inversion sets in when the
                    demonstration of power starts to function as a confirmation of a fundamental
                    impotence” (<title level="m">Sublime</title> 157). Only at the conclusion of the
                    novel, after Verezzi has already committed suicide, do we as readers learn what
                    lies behind Zastrozzi’s display of phallic power: in reality he is Verezzi’s
                    illegitimate half-brother, an impotent figure in the context of the predominant
                    social hierarchy. </p>
<p> Zastrozzi, however, sustains his phallic presence, even after being tried and
                    sentenced to death by the Inquisition: “He looked around him. His manner awed
                    the tumultuous multitude; and, in uninterrupted silence, the spectators gazed
                    upon the unappalled Zastrozzi, who, towering as a demi-god, stood in the midst”
                    (154). Why, after learning of his identity, of his illegitimate birth, and of
                    his past murders, do the spectators and council still confer upon Zastrozzi the
                    image of sublime phallic authority? Part of the answer lies, no doubt, in the
                    mesmerizing theatricality of Zastrozzi’s performance. He both fascinates and
                    frightens those who are caught within his gaze. As a paranoiac image of the
                    Jacobin monster, we see how such sublime images are cultural productions that
                    serve a necessary role in the anti-Jacobin imaginary. To demystify the paranoiac
                    image would be to lose the very object against which a reactionary ideology
                    defines itself. The spectators, therefore, are invested in their “willing
                    suspension of disbelief” (to appropriate Coleridge’s phrase) and are not
                    inclined to give up their investment in the sublime image of the Other. For
                    Shelley, who seeks to re-mobilize the founding principles of Republican
                    ideology, Zastrozzi functions as a “surface appearance” “draped over the
                    irrational” fears of reactionary ideology.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See

</p>
<p> Matilda too is figured as a phallic object, which, not surprisingly, creates
                    difficulties in her attempts to seduce Verezzi. Matilda occupies an especially
                    dangerous position for Verezzi because she represents the possibility, in
                    fantasy, of the full realization of the sexual relationship. She is beautiful,
                    sexually uninhibited, culturally sophisticated, and presumably a woman of social
                    standing, like his fiancée Julia. From a distance she engenders an alluring
                    fascination, but approached too closely she becomes the monstrous Thing that
                    threatens to annihilate his genteel subjectivity. To seduce Verezzi, Matilda
                    must masquerade as his object-cause of desire, what Lacan calls the
                        <foreign>objet petit a</foreign>. Matilda must <emph>desublimate</emph>
                    herself from a phallic object of terrifying <foreign>jouissance</foreign> into a
                    compelling image of socially sanctioned desire. </p>
<p> According to Lacan's sexuation formulas, the masculine subject identifies with
                    the female as the <foreign>objet petit a</foreign>; that is, she must occupy the
                    place of the object-cause of desire in his fantasy scenario, she must “fit his
                    formula” (Zizek, <title level="m">Plague</title> 8). As Emily Apter points out,
                    “There is no absolute femininity beneath the veil, only a set of ontologically
                    tenuous codes that normatively induct the feminine subject into the social
                    practice of ‘being’ woman through mimesis and parroting” (243). There is no
                    mystery concerning Matilda’s desire: “I adore you to madness—I love you to
                    distraction. If you have one spark of compassion, let me not sue in vain—reject
                    not one who feels it impossible to overcome the fatal, resistless passion which
                    consumes her” (83). Verezzi’s response to Matilda is one of “cold esteem,” but
                    in the following passage we get a glimpse of how Matilda will indeed figure
                    herself as the object of his desire: <quote> He could not love Matilda; and
                        though he never had seen her but in the most amiable light, he found it
                        impossible to feel any sentiment towards her, save cold esteem. Never had he
                        beheld those dark shades in her character, which if developed could excite
                        nothing but horror and detestation . . . as such he pitied her: but still
                        could he not help observing a comparison between her and Julia, whose
                        feminine delicacy shrunk from the slightest suspicion, even of indecorum.
                        Her fragile form, her mild heavenly countenance, was contrasted with all the
                        partiality of love, to the scintillating eye, the commanding countenance,
                        the bold expressive gaze, of Matilda. (84)</quote> To successfully seduce
                    Verezzi, Matilda must appeal to the narcissistic component of his sexual
                    economy. Verezzi resists Matilda for much of the novel, but as she begins to
                    understand how to incite his desire, Verezzi’s image of her softens: ““Emotions
                    of pity, of compassion, for one whose only fault he supposed to be love for him,
                    conquered V’s softened soul” (86). And a bit later: <quote> Still did he feel
                        his soul irresistibly softened towards Matilda—her love for him flattered
                        his vanity; and though he could not feel reciprocal affection towards her,
                        yet her kindness in rescuing him from his former degraded situation, her
                        altered manner towards him, and her unremitting endeavours to please, to
                        humour him in every thing, called for his warmest, his sincerest gratitude.
                        (88-89)</quote> Matilda’s “altered manner,” which “she knew well how to
                    assume,” coupled with the beauty of her “symmetrical form,” finally begins to
                    work: “By affecting to coincide with him in every thing—by feigning to possess
                    that congeniality of sentiment and union of idea, which he thought so necessary
                    to the existence of love, she doubted not soon to accomplish her purpose” (115).
                    Matilda does indeed “accomplish her purpose,” but only after she has managed to
                    substitute herself in the place formerly occupied by Julia, whom Verezzi now
                    believes to have been murdered by Zastrozzi: “Oh Matilda! dearest, angelic
                    Matilda! . . . I am even now unconscious what blinded me—what kept me from
                    acknowledging my adoration of thee!—adoration never to be changed by
                    circumstances—never effaced by time” (129). Matilda has successfully broken
                    Verezzi’s melancholic fixation on the lost object of his desire and entered his
                    fantasy frame as the <foreign>object-cause</foreign> of his “unconscious”
                    desire. </p>
<p> Throughout the course of the novel, Zastrozzi and Matilda undergo a metamorphic
                    shift from powerful, phallic objects of paranoiac fantasy to impotent subjects
                    that reveal a fundamental split subjectivity beneath the fascinating spectacle.
                    Shelley’s antagonists, Matilda and Zastrozzi, express a subjectivity that is far
                    more complex than his protagonists, Verezzi and Julia. The actions of Matilda
                    and Zastrozzi can be productively read in terms of Kant’s distinction between
                    “radical” and “diabolical” evil, which he discusses in <title level="m">Religion
                        within the Limits of Reason Alone. </title>Radical evil is an ethical
                    position in which one’s actions are determined solely by pathological motives.
                    The pathological subject <emph>chooses</emph> self-interest and gratification at
                    the expense of the other. Diabolical evil characterizes a position in which the
                    subject adopts the pursuit of evil itself as a moral maxim (i.e., a categorical
                    imperative in the form of Milton’s Satanic “Evil be thou my good.”), even at the
                    expense of one’s own pathological interests, or even one’s life.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Zupancic’s <title level="m">Ethics of the
                            Real</title> and Joan Copjec, ed., <title level="m">Radical
                        Evil</title>.</note>
</p>
<p> Matilda clearly is a candidate for radical evil, and Zastrozzi for diabolical
                    evil. Matilda violently pursues her passions until her self-interest is at
                    stake. After Matilda kills Julia, she suddenly begins to reflect upon the
                    eternal consequences: “The guilty Matilda shrunk at death—she let fall the
                    upraised dagger—her soul had caught a glimpse of the misery which awaits the
                    wicked hereafter, and, in spite of her contempt of religion—spite of her, till
                    now, too firm dependence on the doctrines of atheism, she trembled at futurity;
                    and a voice from within, which whispers “thou shalt never die!” spoke daggers to
                    Matilda’s soul” (143). Zastrozzi, however, suffers no such spiritual crisis, and
                    pursues his maxim of revenge, even at the expense of his own life. He informs
                    the Council: “ ‘. . . I know my doom; and, instead of horror, experience some
                    degree of satisfaction at the arrival of death, since all I have to do on earth
                    is completed.’ . . . Even whilst writhing under the agony of almost
                    unsupportable torture his nerves were stretched, Zastrozzi’s firmness failed him
                    not; but, upon his soul-illumined countenance, played a smile of most disdainful
                    scorn; and, with a wild, convulsive laugh of exulting revenge—he died”
                    (156).</p>
<p> The demonic subjects of radical and diabolical evil are, thus, consistent with
                    the paranoiac image of the transgressive Other. But as Kant argues, although
                    absolute freedom is impossible and we cannot purify ourselves completely from
                    our pathological determinations (we are after all trapped in finite, material
                    bodies) we can exercise our freedom by choosing the <emph>way</emph> in which we
                    are determined. What distinguishes Shelley’s Gothic (and here we can see the
                    emergence of a Romantic Gothicism), is the self-reflexivity and psychological
                    dissonance that his Gothic antagonists experience. These moments are not
                    explored in depth in the novel—the narrator is too anxious to propel Matilda and
                    Zastrozzi into their next heinous deed—but they appear nonetheless and
                    constitute a kind of textual unconscious that compels us to peer beyond the
                    paranoiac image and consider Matilda and Zastrozzi as subjects rather than
                    simply as objects of paranoiac fantasy. There are several moments when Matilda
                    pauses to reflect upon her actions, and in these moments we recognize her as a
                    split subject: “I almost shudder . . . at the sea of wickedness on which I am
                    about to embark! But still, Verezzi—ah! for him would I even lose my hopes of
                    eternal happiness. In the sweet idea of calling him mine, no scrupulous
                    delicacy, no mistaken superstitious idea, shall prevent me from deserving him by
                    daring acts— . . .” (79). A moment later she exclaims: “Oh, madness! Madness!” .
                    . . “is it for this that I have plunged into the dark abyss of crime?—is it for
                    this that I have despised the delicacy of my sex, and, braving consequences,
                    have offered my love to one who despises me—who shuns me, as does the barbarous
                    Verezzi?” (82). And this iconic image, in which Matilda sits perched like a
                    gargoyle overlooking a sublime display of nature’s destructive energy, captures
                    perfectly Matilda’s status as both fantasmic object and split subject: “Matilda
                    sat upon a fragment of jutting granite, and contemplated the storm which raged
                    around her. The portentous calm, which at intervals occurred amid the
                    reverberating thunder, portentous of a more violent tempest, resembled the
                    serenity which spread itself over Matilda’s mind—a serenity only to be succeeded
                    by a fiercer paroxysm of passion” (119).</p>
<p> Even Zastrozzi has moments, though few, of conscientious reflection that suggest
                    a moral capacity for guilt: “Zastrozzi sat for some time immersed in
                    heart-rending contemplations; but though conscience for awhile reflected his
                    past life in images of horror, again was his heart steeled by fiercest vengeance
                    . . . “ (75); and “. . . he thought of his past life, and his awakened
                    conscience reflected images of horror. But again revenge drowned the voice of
                    virtue—again passion obscured the light of reason, and his steeled soul
                    persisted in its scheme” (68). This guilt-inducing “voice of virtue” that
                    reflects “images of horror” speaks <emph>through</emph> and <emph>for</emph>
                    Matilda and Zastrozzi. As Mladen Dolar explains, “. . . the surplus of the
                    superego over the Law is precisely the surplus of the voice; the superego has a
                    voice, the Law is stuck with the letter” (14). The specular doubling, fears of
                    persecution, and encounters with the <foreign>jouissance</foreign> of the Other
                    that drive the action of Shelley’s <title level="m">Zaztrozzi</title>, <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, and <title level="m">The Wandering
                    Jew</title>, are early attempts to explore and understand the psychological
                    dissonances associated with a failed encounter with the Other (as language,
                    culture, ideology) and others (individual egos, including the subject’s own). </p>
<p> Finally, I want to draw attention to Shelley’s most effective strategy for
                    representing the subjectivization of the paranoiac image. Critics who interpret
                    the images and actions of Matilda and Zastrozzi only in terms of Verezzi’s state
                    of mind, as images drawn from the unconscious of his own psychological
                    processes, miss the radical intersubjectivity at work among all of the
                    characters. And those, like Whatley, who suggest that Matilda and Zastrozzi are
                    the only characters who are allowed to “fulfill their desire,” we must ask the
                    question: whose desire? In Lacanian terms, the “subject’s desire is always the
                    desire of the Other.” That is, desire can be <emph>for</emph> the Other,
                    determined <emph>by </emph>the Other, or a desire <emph>for the Other’s
                        desire</emph>—the “Other” being either the “big Other” itself (the symbolic

                    subjectivity is precipitated) or other individual others with whom one
                    interacts. The most terrifying or uncanny moments in Shelley’s Gothic occur when
                    characters discover (or we as readers discover despite the characters’ limited
                    knowledge of their own self-experience) that their desire is not their own, that
                    their free-will is an illusion and that their actions are determined by the
                    desires of the Other as they are internalized in the formations of the ego,
                    ego-ideal and superego. </p>
<p>
<title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> stages the process through which the desire of
                    the Other is internalized, transferred, expressed, and subverted. For example,
                    we can briefly restate the action of the novel in the following terms: Zastrozzi
                    assumes for himself the desire of his mother, which sets in motion his merciless
                    schemes to destroy Verezzi. Split between the “desire of the m(O)ther” and the
                    “name of the father,” Zastrozzi occupies a perverse position as the
                    object-instrument of his disgraced mother’s desire for retribution: “‘Never
                    shall I forgot her last commands.—My son,’ said she, ‘my Pietrino, revenge my
                    wrongs—revenge them on the perjured Verezzi—revenge them on his progeny for
                    ever’” (155). Matilda, in her union with Verezzi, assumes as her own the desire
                    of Julia, and Matilda’s desire does not reach its object until she murders
                    Julia. Matilda’s stated desire actually masks her real desire, which is to
                    destroy her sexual and social rival: “. . . Julia must die, and expiate the
                    crime of daring to rival me, with her hated blood” (79). “‘Julia, the hated,
                    accursed Julia’s image, is the phantom which scares my otherwise certain
                    confidence of eternal delight: could she but be hurled to destruction— . . .’”
                    (131). Matilda’s phallic, destructive intensity, so well-veiled to Verezzi,
                    finally reaches its apex when Matilda murders Julia in a “ferocious” confluence
                    of desire and <foreign>jouissance</foreign>: <quote>
<p rend="noCount"> “Nerved anew by this futile attempt to escape her
                            vengeance, the ferocious Matilda seized Julia’s floating hair, and
                            holding her back with fiend-like strength, stabbed her in a thousand
                            places; and, with exulting pleasure, again and again buried the dagger
                            to the hilt in her body, even after all remains of life were
                            annihilated.</p>
<p rend="noCount"> At last the passions of Matilda, exhausted by their own
                            violence, sank into a deadly calm: she threw the dagger violently from
                            her, and contemplated the terrific scene before her with a sullen gaze.
                            (143) </p>
</quote> In this moment, Shelley’s subjectivized paranoiac image reverts back to
                    its original, horrifying presence, which ultimately realizes the desire of both
                    the narrator and reader as reactionary others. Reactionary desire is satisfied,
                    even though Shelley had frustrated that desire by subjectivizing the paranoiac
                    images of Zastrozzi and Matilda. They reassume their status as Jacobin monsters,
                    thus confirming the obscene enjoyment that underlies the reactionary ethical
                    stance. And by committing suicide, Verezzi, ironically, assumes as his own the
                    desire of Zastrozzi. Thus, the actions of these “others” can only be understood
                    within the larger context of the “big Other” (the patriarchal symbolic), from
                    which both Zastrozzi and Matilda are excluded—Zastrozzi, as the illegitimate
                    offspring of Verezzi’s father, and Matilda, whose sexual passion for Verezzi
                    threatens the stability of the fully regulated sexual relationship, as
                    exemplified by Verezzi and Julia. <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> draws
                    attention to the inter-subjective relations that actually drive and sustain the
                    paranoiac fantasy, but Shelley is also careful to maintain the tension between
                    the demystification of the fantasy and its reduction to an explanatory network
                    of causal relations, which would empty the Gothic of its uncanny effects and
                    reduce it to a species of the philosophical novel. </p>
<p> Verezzi’s traumatic encounters with Zastrozzi and Matilda exemplify not only the
                    rigidity of Burkean aesthetic categories, but also the limitations of a moral
                    psychology derived from either Smithian sympathetic identification or a
                    Benthamian utilitarian calculus of pleasures and pains. As a consequence of the
                    attempt to establish a subjective position free from the artificial and
                    corrupted determinations of culture, tradition, and ecclesiastical authority,
                    the Enlightenment <foreign>philosophes</foreign> were faced with the difficult
                    problem of formulating an ethics grounded in “natural disposition” and confirmed
                    by presumably universal affects such as pleasure and pain. An ethics derived
                    from sympathetic identification with the other, however, suffers from the
                    problem of what to do if identification with the other is
                        <emph>impossible</emph>.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In this curious
                        passage from <title level="m">The Theory of Moral Sentiments</title>, Adam
                        Smith appears to justify a carefully regulated form of revenge against an
                        implacable other. Here, respect for the other extends only so far as it is
                        reflected through a narcissistic gaze founded on similarity: <quote> A
                            person becomes contemptible who tamely sits still and submits to
                            insults, without attempting either to repel or to revenge them. We
                            cannot enter into his indifference and insensibility: we call his
                            behaviour mean‑spiritedness, and are as really provoked by it as by the
                            insolence of his adversary. Even the mob are enraged to see any man
                            submit patiently to affronts and ill usage. They desire to see this
                            insolence resented, and resented by the person who suffers from it. They
                            cry to him with fury to defend, or to revenge himself. If his
                            indignation rouses at last, they heartily applaud and sympathize with
                            it. It enlivens their own indignation against his enemy, whom they
                            rejoice to see him attack in turn, and are as really gratified by his
                            revenge, provided it is not immoderate, as if the injury had been done
                            to themselves. (45)</quote>
</note> In other words, an ethics of
                    sympathy, when pushed to its limits results in a narcissistic reflection of
                    one’s own values and we sympathize with those whose values fundamentally reflect
                    our own. In Verezzi’s unbearable encounters with the inscrutable gaze of
                    Zastrozzi and the threatening sexuality of Matilda, Shelley’s Gothic compels us
                    to consider a crucial question that would preoccupy him throughout his career:
                    how does one respond when sympathetic identification with the Other is
                    impossible, when the inscrutable desire of the Other presses too close and
                    threatens the consistency of one’s subjectivity? </p>
<p> If the Enlightenment critical procedure is to demystify the image of the Other
                    (nature, sexual difference, power, etc.) by bringing it under the determinations
                    of the symbolic, then the Gothic strategy would be to reveal how this determined
                    image is non-identical with itself.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                        paradigmatic example of the non-identity between the image and its concept
                        is the creature from Mary Shelley’s <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>,
                        who materializes the unaccountable gaps that haunt any totalizing concept of
                        the Enlightenment subject.</note> The demystification of Gothic effects, as
                    exemplified in Radcliffe for example, may indeed reveal the illusions produced
                    through epistemological error, but the price to be paid for this demystification
                    is a further mystification of the network of intersubjective relations that
                    point to another register of the Gothic, the “real” of desire, i.e. the
                    impenetrable desire of the Other and its irreducible excess, the engine which
                    drives paranoiac fantasies of conspiracy and persecution, the implications of
                    which were not lost on David Hume who, in <title level="m">A Treatise of Human
                        Nature</title>, writes:<quote> For what is more capricious than human
                        actions? What more inconstant than the desires of man? And what creature
                        departs more widely, not only from right reason, but from his own character
                        and disposition? An hour, a moment is sufficient to make him change from one
                        extreme to another, and overturn what cost the greatest pain and labour to
                        establish. Necessity is regular and certain. Human conduct is irregular and
                        uncertain. (184)</quote> While the Gothic—in its figurative and narrative
                    extravagance—may at first appear to be an unsuitable aesthetic mode through
                    which to ground concrete ideological critique, Shelley deftly subverts the
                    diegetic reality of the narrative in favor of a reality that explores the
                    socio-psychological dynamic that creates the dialectical tension between
                    transgressive revolutionary action and paranoiac conservative reaction.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Or, in Lacanian terms, between “reality,” as it
                        is supported through fantasy, and the “real,” which resists
                        symbolization.</note> And perhaps most fundamentally, Shelley raises the
                    following question: To what extent are those who are excluded from or
                    marginalized within the dominant ideology still subject to its norms and
                    prohibitions?</p>
<p> In his <title level="m">Memoirs of Shelley</title>, Thomas Love Peacock cites
                        <title level="m">The Cenci</title> as one of the few times Shelley
                    “descended into the arena of reality” (73), but it is in his early Gothic novels
                    that Shelley first grounds abstract philosophical, social, sexual, and ethical
                    antagonisms within the concrete register of intersubjective relations. The
                    “ineffectual Angel” strain of criticism—the result of a complicated cultural
                    machine starting with Mary Shelley, Hogg, and Hunt and later solidified by
                    Peacock and Arnold<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For an excellent overview
                        of the evolution of Shelley’s critical reception, see Donald H. Reiman and
                        Neil Fraistat, “Shelley’s Reputation before 1960,” in <title level="m">Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</title> (<title level="m">SPP</title>), pp.
                        539-49.</note>—has long since been displaced by the post-structuralist
                    Shelley who deconstructs the concrete representations of diegetic reality to
                    reveal the abstract structures of language and ideology which produce the
                    subjective effect of reality. The antagonisms generated between the concrete
                    particularity of self-experience and the abstract categories through which it is
                    mediated drives much of the productive tension in Shelley’s mature work and
                    sustains its enduring Gothic sensibility. Although similar, I do not equate the
                    post-structuralist subject with the Gothic subject, nor the post-structuralist
                    Shelley with the Gothic Shelley. The difference between the two hinges on the
                    status of the “object,” or rather, the persistence of the object; i.e, the
                    remainder of the real that resists symbolization and therefore cannot be reduced
                    to or recuperated within the socio-symbolic field—another example of the
                    non-identity of a concept with itself. These antagonisms of non-identity will
                    continue to haunt the post-Enlightenment revolutionary agency that Shelley
                    articulates in later works such as <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound,</title>
                    a touchstone text that exemplifies Shelley’s attempt to transcend the
                    antagonisms he explored in his early Gothic novels and poetry and to comprehend
                    the psychopathology of power itself.</p>

               The persistent use of Gothic motifs by Shelley from his early Gothic novels
               (1810-11) all the way to <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> (1822) has
               only been partly explained up until now.  This essay argues that Shelley develops,
               across his career in ways especially visible in <title level="m">The
                  Triumph</title>, a "Gothic complex" of connected features that look all the way back
               to how the "Gothic Story" began in Horace Walpole's <title level="m">The Castle of
                  Otranto</title> (1764).  By developing these features as he does, Shelley is
               able to reveal with great power the underlying conflicts at his (and our) time
               between retrograde belief-systems that people still accept as dominant and true, on
               the one hand, and, on the other, progressive re-castings of those old shapes that
               can make them point to revolutionary ideologies that can change the world as his
               characters and readers perceive it.

<head>The “Gothic Complex” in Shelley: From <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> to <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>
</head>

<p>Ever since John Murphy in 1975 traced the persistence of “Gothic” figurations from
               P.B. Shelley’s earliest works through <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, we
               have come to see, as Stephen Behrendt has said in his edition of Shelley’s <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> (1810) and <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title> (1811),
               “unmistakable foreshadowings” in those adolescent “romances” of his major
               achievements between 1818 and 1822 (Shelley 2002b, 12). A vital question remains,
               however: what is really <emph>most</emph> fundamentally <emph>Gothic</emph> — and
               what is most fundamentally symbolized because of that Gothicism — in what continues
               from those early efforts all the way to the unfinished <title level="m">Triumph of
                  Life</title>? Even the best explanations since Murphy of what lasts from this
               poet’s youthful recastings of Ann Radcliffe, “Monk” Lewis, and Charlotte Dacre do not
               ultimately answer this question, though I think they have taken us part of the way.
               Behrendt himself rightly shows that, once Shelley gets past direct imitations of
               Lewis or Dacre (as in his poem on “The Wandering Jew”), his early romances point, as
               the Gothic always has, to a “world in which traditional beliefs and values have
               eroded” but also one where the pull of those past ideologies remains (Shelley 2002b,
               20). The result in <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> and <title level="m">St.
                  Irvyne</title>, Behrendt concludes, is “an unwillingness to fully ‘resolve’ the
               myriad contradictions” in the Gothic rendering of their major characters, who thus
               become precursors of the powerful complexity in the Beatrice of Shelley’s Gothic play
                  <title level="m">The Cenci</title> (1819; Shelley 2002b, 30-31). John Whatley
               essentially agrees by pointing out how these early novels “critique . . . religious
               symbolism through [the] progressive philosophy” expressed by the most villainous
               characters as they echo Enlightenment thinkers important to Shelley, albeit within
               the frame of a traditional Gothic moralizing (Whatley 1999, 202). The consequence is
               a “struggle between opposing views” acted out through conflicts between different
               kinds of signifiers, so much so that “Zastrozzi” and the “Matilda” he serves or
               “Wolfstein” as he is tempted towards selling his soul by the Rosicrucian “Ginotti” in
                  <title level="m">St. Irvine </title>“hover in a curious, irresolvable middle state
               between [the older] motivated symbol and [the newer] atheist sign” (Whatley 1999, 205
               and 217). </p>
<p>But is what Behrendt and Whatley reveal spawned by Shelley’s own struggles among
               attitudes as they fill the by-now extreme conventionality of the Gothic figures he
               adapts, or are such irresolutions (as these critics intimate, but only sketchily)
               bound up with the symbolic possibilities endemic to Gothic conventions? Peter Finch
               has neatly sidestepped this question by seeing the intercalated plots of <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, the Wolfstein story in a German-Gothic mode
               reminiscent of Lewis and the Eliose story in a sentimental mode that recalls
               Rousseau’s <title level="m">La Nouvelle Heloise</title>, as simply manifesting a
               “contesting pull of narratives” that Shelley will work to critique and then recombine
               in his later writing (Finch 36). Yet this argument begs the question of how much
               both sets of conventions are bound up together, not just in the works of Ann
               Radcliffe, but in the deliberate launching of the post-medieval Gothic in Horace
               Walpole’s <title level="m">The Castle of Otranto</title> of 1764-65. The most
               provocative approach to Shelley’s Gothicism, though, has been offered by Tilottama
               Rajan. For her <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> and <title level="m">St.
                  Irvyne</title> put in “question the cultural stereotypes in which they remain
               caught” because of their Gothic predecessors, so much so that they both “write” and
               “withdraw a transgressive narrative” at the same time (Rajan 243). That is because
               they emphasize the “floating” nature of long-overused signifiers, including their
               Gothicized character-types, and use them, especially the Ginotti of the Wolfstein
               plot also called “Nempere” in the Eloise plot, to suggest a “semantic excess” of
               inconsistent references to incompatible texts, from the very old to the current, that
               exposes “the overdetermination of social and psychic texts in which” Shelley’s early
               Gothic form of “narrative has its genesis” (Rajan 243, 245, 246). Nevertheless, the
               question remains: are these semi-transgressions almost entirely Shelley’s, given how
               emptied-out the Gothic seemed by 1810-11, or are they really creative extensions of
               what the post-Walpolean Gothic most basically does in the conflicting tendencies
               endemic to its symbolic constitution?</p>
<p>I want to argue for the second of these alternatives. Shelley, I believe, especially
               in the best work of his final year as it builds on the most Gothic features of his
               early fictions, exploits the symbolic possibilities, including the contradictions,
               most basic to the Gothic as a mixed and self-questioning mode. He does so to such an
               extent that it is those very dynamics that often make his final writings what they
               are, and it is the very nature of the Gothic as he first explored it that sets the
               stage for those late “triumphs” as they deal with the conflicting systems of belief
               that he kept attempting to bridge throughout his writing. Indeed, I think that
               Shelley develops a “Gothic complex” of interacting symbolic processes, based on
               elements he experiments with as early as <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> and the
               poems preceding it, that is carried out quite thoroughly as late as <title level="m">The Triumph of Life </title>and consequently fulfills the potentials for
               suggestion most inherent in the Gothic features of his earliest work, ones that end
               up driving Shelley as much as he employs and transmogrifies them. </p>
<p>Although Whatley has more recently seen such a dynamic (as I do too) in the movement
               of the “Shape all Light” recounted by Shelley’s re-creation of Rousseau (Whatley
               2003, 80-89), this Gothic complex is manifested most fully in <title level="m">The
                  Triumph of Life</title>, as I read it (Shelley 2002a, 483-500), when its Narrator
               describes the victims of “Life’s” captivation of them by emphasizing how much their
               methods of self-definition sadly resemble the symbolic rendering of Life itself in
               its all-conquering chariot. That parallel is most visible in the passages from <title level="m">The Triumph </title>I now cite here from the Narrator’s dream-vision,
               particularly when the “shadow” overarching each walker reappears in the “dusky hood”
               of Life’s shapeless “Shape”: <quote>

</quote> In addition, the importance of this whole pattern is underscored by the
               replaying of it later in the dream-<emph>within</emph>-the-main-dream recalled by the
               shade of Rousseau as he remembers his own first envisioning of the same parade. There
               he sees its profusion of “dim forms” as proceeding, on the one hand, from the
               draining of substance from the body that each shadow recalls and, on the other, from
               the “creative [or is it de-creative?] ray” of Life’s central “car” that really
               carries no solid or coherent occupant: <quote>

</quote> I find that Shelley’s “Gothic complex” is never more active than at these
               moments and that these manifestations collectively bring forth the cruxes of his
               earlier Gothicism, their deepest symbolic roots in the Walpolean Gothic, and the
               kinds of meanings that can best be located in this kind of fiction-making, which is
               indeed both highly regressive and radically progressive at the same time.</p>
<p> To begin with, the “shadows” of themselves projected by, yet finally controlling,
               Life’s prisoners are indeed allusions to the material simulacra given off by objects
               and people in Book IV of Lucretius’s <title level="m">De rerum natura</title> (ca. 55
               BC), also a critique of imperial Rome (Turner 281-82). But they recall just as much
               what Terry Castle has so perceptively seen in Radcliffe’s Gothic of the mid-1790s:
               the tendency in her (as well as Shelley’s) Lockean sense of perception to
               “spectralize” whatever impressions it receives, given that all perceptions are not
               objects but traces on the <foreign>tabula rasa</foreign> of our sensorium. This
               vision of “all things existing only as perceived,” an axiom used in both Shelley’s
               essay “On Life” (1819) and his <title level="m">Defence of Poetry</title> (1821;
               Shelley 2002a, 506 and 533), results in a Radcliffean world-view, as Castle puts it,
               based on an “absorbing faith in the fantastic” whereby every ghost-like trace — each
               overlaid by a mental interpretation of it formed out of “ideas” developed from
               memories of other such traces — turns every other person or object or landscape into
               a phantom, including externalizations interpreted (as so many are) to be mirrors of
               the self (Castle 246). Such an empirical-but-also-Gothic understanding, Shelley
               comes to see under Radcliffe’s influence among others, produces “a kind of thinking
               dominated by nostalgic mental images” whereby “phatasmic objects” seem “even more
               real at times than the material world” (Castle 247). As a result, the perceivers of
               such phantasms as self-images, for example the slaves of Life in Shelley’s <title level="m">Triumph</title>, submit their thinking to spectral figures of themselves
               based on a past that is taken to be more real and permanent than it really is or was.
               Their self-images thus become in their eyes fixed definitions of their “selves” to
               which they believe they must submit, even though those “dim forms” are actually
               ghosts of what is dead (made explicit by the skeletal “old anatomies” in <title level="m">The Triumph</title>). Indeed, that extension of spectralization, as
               Rousseau’s dream presents it, means that such self-images can operate like
               “vampire-bats,” less a figure from Radcliffe and more of a nod to the gradual
               Gothicizing of the vampire-figure in the eighteen-teens by Byron and Coleridge, then
               Mary Shelley, then John Polodori’s <title level="m">The Vamypre</title> (1819; see
               Hogle 2004). Shelley’s 1822 bloodsuckers, each being a version of thought’s empire
               over itself, psychologically drain the life out of every perceiver who believes
               himself subject to them as permanent points of reference and so keeps obeying his
               former sense of his own nature. In that way, they enact the Death-in-Life that
               captivates those who have accepted the control of a master construct (“Life”) also
               “de-form[ed]” vampirically by its own “dusky hood,” the “shadow of a tomb” or “old
               anatomy” to which It, itself an antiquated perception of existence, keeps submitting
               over and over.</p>
<p>After all, this Gothic retrospection also harkens back to Walpole’s <title level="m">Otranto, </title>beyond its own echoes of Locke, to the way the three different
               ghosts there are far more shades of shades than they are specters of bodies. As I
               have noted on other occasions (as in Hogle 2012), one <title level="m">Otranto
               </title>specter is an enlarged fragment of an effigy over a grave (almost
                  <emph>literally</emph> the “shadow of a tomb”), another is an image that walks out
               of a full-length portrait, and the third, the ghost of the Hermit of Joppa who
               intones warnings from the mouth of his fleshless skull (anticipating Shelley’s “old
               anatomies”), is a blatant re-presentation of a <foreign>dance macabre</foreign>
               skeleton from medieval painting. All of these are thoroughly floating signifiers,
               “shadows of shadows” in Rousseau’s words from Shelley’s <title level="m">Triumph</title>, not surprising, it turns out, for a Protestant author (Horace
               Walpole) whose equally famous letters celebrate his own antiquarianism as a playing
               with old icons that “cannot disappoint” because there is no longer any “reason to
               quarrel with their emptiness” (Walpole 1937-83, 10: 192). In the Preface to his first
               edition of <title level="m">Otranto</title>, we should remember, where he pretends to
               be the translator of a post-Reformation manuscript that once kept alive a Catholicism
               that for him <emph>should</emph> be fading, Walpole sets up all the Catholic specters
               and machinery in his tale to be viewed as symbols “exploded now even from romances”
               and thus emptied of their old grounds of belief even as they continue to play those
               out for audiences of a later time (Walpole 1996, 6). Consequently, readers of what
               Walpole himself labeled the first new kind of “Gothic Story” in his Second Edition of
                  <title level="m">Otranto</title> (1996, 3) face tormented characters, often
               debating within themselves, whose beliefs make them subject to “phantoms” that are
               actually “dim forms,” yet forms which they take to be indicators of unchangeable
               reference-points in the past haunting them by drawing them back towards those
               supposed grounds, however outdated. Walpole’s own critique of the medieval Gothic
               materials in his neo-Gothic, we find, right along with his and Radliffe’s Lockean
               sense of perception, is clearly among the fundamental pretexts for Shelley’s critique
               of the way so many of us enslave ourselves to a fixed sense of life by accepting old
               symbolic orders, especially in the ways we mirror ourselves to ourselves in what are
               really the “base broods” (or symbolic constructs) of “old anatomies.”</p>
<p>At the same time, though, the Gothic, even for Walpole, is not that simple, so
               neither is Shelley’s “Gothic complex” in <title level="m">The Triumph </title>and
               elsewhere. As much as Walpolean Gothic figures can be exposed as “floating
               signifiers” separable from their older grounds and thus able to signify newer ones,
               there is an insistent antiquity in them, much as there is in Shelley’s reenactment of
               Dantean and Petrarchan dream-visions and terza-rima verse-forms along with echoes of
               the eighteenth-century Gothic in his new <title level="m">Trionf</title>. Such a
               paradox at the very core of the Gothic indicates (in David Punter’s words), yes, a
               “fear of the violence of the past and its power over the present,” hence <title level="m">The Triumph</title>’s vision of Life as echoing ancient Rome’s paradings
               of its captives, but also a “longing for many of the qualities” and secure grounds of
               belief “which that past possessed” or at least seemed to in retrospect (Punter 418).
               As Karl Marx has shown, the rise of new ideologies and modes of production struggles
               against the still-powerful draw of older beliefs and systems of exchange, and the
               Gothic is the most flagrant symbolic manifestation of that cultural contestation in
               the history of English fiction-making. The pull of “ancient romance” elements,
               “exploded” as they are, is just as strong in the neo-Gothic as the pull of the more
               “modern” ones akin to the rising middle-class novel, according to Walpole’s
               definition of “Gothic Story” in his Preface to <title level="m">Otranto</title>’s
               Second Edition (Walpole 1996, 9-11). That looking-backwards-and-forwards
               simultaneously, like the “Janus-faced Shadow” that actually drives Life’s chariot for
               Shelley, coincides with Walpole’s preference, which he expressed in the 1750s, for
               keeping at least a “shadow of monarchy” on an otherwise “empty chair of state,” like
               the “ghost of Banquo” in Shakespeare’s <title level="m">Macbeth</title> (Walpole
               1847, 377), rather than facing the uncertainties of total revolution that eventually
               made England (and even Shelley) fearful of the violence in France. It is for these
               reasons that E.J. Clery has so correctly viewed the first “Gothic Story” as setting a
               pattern by both articulating and disguising a profound “contradiction” in the culture
               of Walpole’s time, in his case “between the traditional claims of [aristocratic]
               landed property and the new claims for the [bourgeois] private family” (Clery 77).
               With its Janus-faced symbols, style, and focus on characters so internally
               conflicted, the Gothic has consequently become in the post-Renaissance West <emph>the
               </emph>fictive place where the deepest and thus most feared irresolutions in the
               culture between ideologies and world-views are sequestered and distanced, as the fear
               of death and dissolution are in Edmund Burke’s terror-based “Sublime” also basic to
               the Gothic tradition, yet where those unresolved quandaries are hyperbolically
               reenacted and played out in the guise of concurrently retrograde and experimental
               fiction able to be conservative and progressive all at once.</p>
<p>Shelley’s continuation of the Gothic in his <title level="m">Triumph</title>,
               therefore, is willingly pulled towards the kind of enslavements to patterns of sin
               allegorized by Petrarch and Dante, yet it remains determined to show that their very
               Catholic patterns of God-centered allegory are based on the projections of mere
               thoughts into externalized “shadows” that have come to be interpreted as absolute
               truths and thus as tyrannizing sources of “fear” enforcing submission – all of which
               is a use of allegorical figures to attack the premises of old allegory itself,
               without leaving them behind altogether, alongside resurrections of Walpolean and
               Burkean “old anatomies” to show how such emptied-out figures can still have the
               psychological force they do. Ultimately Shelley realizes in his rendering of <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> that he, his poem, and his audience cannot
               entirely escape from the systems of belief he wants to explode in it, one reason for
               the persistence of the construction of Life that drives this poem’s throngs while
               Life itself turns out to be no more than a “Shape” continuously being un-shaped and
               re-shaped again. Even the shade of Rousseau, in serving as a Virgilian truth-teller
               to Shelley’s Dantean Narrator, is unable to overcome a lingering contradiction of
               ideologies in his own beliefs only somewhat revised from those of the author of whom
               he is a sympathetic critique. As much as he blames himself for striving to arrest and
               confine the movement of the “Shape all light” in his
               dream-within-the-Narrator’s-dream, even as it keeps transfiguring itself from state
               to state, “forever sought, forever lost” (l. 431), that Shape is itself a
               retrospective Beatricean as well as a revolutionary “Asia” or “Witch of Atlas” figure
               from Shelley’s earlier poetry. Rousseau in Shelley’s <title level="m">Triumph</title>
               thus remains undecided as to how much his own submission to “Life” is his willful
               fault in the face of her transference across traces of perception <emph>or</emph> how
               much that failing results from the necessary influence of the environment in which he
               was placed while he lived: “if the spark with which heaven lit my spirit / Earth had
               with purer nutriment supplied,” he wonders in a passage <emph>not</emph> cited above
               that echoes the Wordsworth “Immortality” Ode about which Shelley was always
               conflicted, would “Corruption . . . not now thus much inherit / Of what was once
               Rousseau” and now both is and is not him simultaneously (ll. 201-04)? The struggle
               Shelley famously had with William Godwin’s view of Necessity within his early “Gothic
               sensibility” (as Donald Reiman called it in 1981) – how much is behavior determined
               by choice or by environment? — is manifestly unresolved in his final unfinished
               poem, and we now see it is the persistence of the Gothic in that very <title level="m">Triumph</title> that most conceals and reveals that irresolution, and
               many other quandaries of Shelley’s era, even as he was about to set sail into the
               Gulf of Spezia. </p>
<p>In any case, speaking of echoes, this whole Gothic process conjoined with others is,
               in its “complex” of disparate yet interconnected elements, remarkably, if not
               completely, similar to what we often see in <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> and
                  <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, published 11-12 years earlier. Consider this
               passage taken from <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>, a moment so typical of the
               overwrought characterizations in this tale’s constant echoing of <title level="m">The
                  Monk</title> and <title level="m">Zofloya</title> that it could have come from
               almost any chapter, though is here excerpted from near the end: <quote>
<p rend="noCount"> For a time Matilda stood immovable. At last she looked on
                     Verezzi; she gazed downwards [since he had cast himself at her feet] upon his
                     majestic and youthful figure; she looked upon his soul-illumined countenance,
                     and tenfold love assailed her softened soul. She raised him – in an oblivious
                     delirium of sudden fondness she clasped him to her bosom and, in wild and
                     hurried expressions, asserted her right to his love.</p>
<p rend="noCount">Her breast palpitated with fierce emotions; she pressed her
                     burning lips to his; most fervent, most voluptuous sensations of ecstacy
                     reveled through her bosom.</p>
<p rend="noCount">Verezzi caught the infection; in an instant of oblivion, every
                     fidelity which he had sworn to another, like a baseless cloud, dissolved away;
                     a Lethean torpor crept over his senses; he forgot Julia, or remembered her only
                     as an uncertain vision, which floated before his fancy more as an ideal being
                     of another world, which he might thereafter adore there, than as an enchanting
                     and congenial female, to whom his oaths of eternal fidelity had been given.
                     (Shelley 2002b, 139) </p>
</quote> While it does repeat the spectralized images
               of other beings projected and then obsessed upon by the characters of both Lewis and
               Dacre, with Radcliffe hovering in the background, this moment has the confused
               Verezzi, not knowing he is Zastrozzi’s hated half-brother, envision his long-time
               projection of the remembered “Julia” as separating from her now “uncertain” form in
               the past and receding behind the Matilda who has relentlessly pursued him, yet
               explicitly <emph>without</emph> Julia disappearing as his ultimate ideal.
                  <emph>This</emph> complex recalls the ending of Walpole’s <title level="m">Otranto</title> where Theodore, finally revealed as the Castle’s true heir,
               accepts marriage to the Isabella once pursued by the usurping Manfred but keeps
               thinking of the dead “Matilda” (here the daughter of Manfred) whom he loved devotedly
               before she died, as Verezzi thinks Julia has at this point in <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>. Shelley’s early Gothic thereby replays the figural pattern of
                  <title level="m">Otranto</title>’s final sentence, in which Theodore decides “he
               could know no happiness but in the society of one [Isabella] with whom he could
               forever indulge the melancholy that had taken possession of his soul” because of
               Matilda’s irreversible absence and yet her constant looming in a remembered past that
               remains an absolute point of reference (Walpole 1996, 115), like the primal crimes
               revealed as the causes of all the specters of specters in the first neo-“Gothic
               Story.” </p>
<p>The quintessentially Janus-faced nature of Walpole’s prototypical Gothic figure has
               undeniably been transferred from <title level="m">The Castle of Otranto </title>to
                  <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>, even to <emph>its</emph> ending where the
               title character who rejects all religious traditions also confesses the root of his
               vengeance to be the dying words of his mother (Shelley 2002b, 155). To much the same
               extent, we can now see, too, the floating signifier of Julia’s image for Verezzi,
               reinforced by Matilda’s obsession with his surface “countenance” since the start of
               Shelley’s novel, Gothically anticipates the “shadows of shadows” in the same author’s
               late <title level="m">Triumph</title> as they drift from their past referents while
               being held fixedly by their projector-observers to those very receding grounds, dead
               though they already are or, like Verezzi and Julia, are about to be. Shelley could
               not have conceived of what is really the “moment of truth” in <title level="m">The
                  Triumph</title>, the choice between accepting the drift of signifiers towards
               future redefinitions and the re-anchoring of them to dead “anatomies” from the past,
               unless there had been the tug-of-war in the Walpolean Gothic figure that he had
               thoroughly played with in his more youthful writings. He also would not have had as
               apt a symbolic mode for half-concealing and half- revealing <title level="m">The
                  Triumph of Life</title>’s hesitations between free-willed choice and the pressure
               of one’s historical conditions if he had not worked with and continued to employ a
               Gothic mode <emph>designed by its nature</emph> to be a repository for unresolved
               conflicts among contending beliefs. In the <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> passage
               above, we have to admit, the text hesitates, just as <title level="m">The Triumph
               </title>will, between condemning the characters for their essentially selfish choices
               and suggesting that such choices are already made for them. After all, the same
               characters keep making the same errors again and again within the pervasive
               atmosphere of their Gothic environment. These are stances toward which they are
               driven, like the victims of Shelley’s “Life,” by what Godwin invokes in the original
               main title of his quite Gothic <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> (1794): the
               necessary consequences of “Things As They Are.” </p>
<p>Now we can see the fully Gothic basis of what previous interpreters have begun to
               find in Shelley’s early romances, as well as the essentials of the “Gothic complex”
               that are transferred almost intact from Walpole through the Gothic of the 1790s to
               the early Shelley and to <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>. Myriad
               contradictions of character cannot be resolved in <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>
               and <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, as Behrendt has said, because their very
               construction is rooted in the Gothic’s <emph>at least</emph> two-directional tug of
               war between older and newer conceptions of human psychology as well as waning and
               developing economies. The equally “irresolvable middle state between the motivated
               symbol and the atheist sign” found by Whatley in Shelley’s Gothic novels stems from
               their Walpolean mix of retrogression and rebellion that makes characters and images
               both potentially floating signifiers and entities attractively anchored in past
               realities, causes, and beliefs even when those are truly dead and gone. Finch’s sense
               of the conflict between the tragically fated Gothic and the assumptions of
               sentimentalism in the plots of <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, meanwhile,
               actually stems from that novel’s acceptance of a Gothic mode that has, since its
               beginnings and <emph>not</emph> just in Radcliffe, internally combined freely-chosen
               states of feeling with fated hauntings from older assumptions, as in the ending of
                  <title level="m">Otranto</title> where Theodore willfully accepts a woman because
               she can help him indulge his “melancholy” over his lost true love but also because he
               cannot help himself as the destined resolver of an age-old usurpation guided, perhaps
               from heaven, towards a marriage that reunites the two families with the most
               sanctioned claims to the castle of Otranto. The quite similar depiction of unresolved
               tensions between external and internal causalities in <title level="m">Zastrozzi,</title>
<title level="m">St. Irvine,</title> and <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>
               is made possible, after all, by the Walpolean Gothic providing unique verbal means
               specifically for configuring ideological conflicts and their nagging irresolution.
               Finally, too, what we have learned from Professor Rajan’s 1990s take on Shelley’s use
               of Gothic (apart from what she has added in this very collection) depends entirely on
               the Gothic itself being inherently a mode dominated by the uprooted, though also
               backward-looking, signifier that can refer in its incessant mobility to many
               different texts and ideologies of its own and former times – and thereby to the
               conflicting ideologies in its many pre-texts that always (in Rajan’s words)
               “overdetermine” it and make its symbols refer to a “semantic excess” of
               “indeterminate” cultural debates. This dynamic is part of the disunified “essence” of
               the Gothic in which, as Rajan has said, “reality has been replaced by hyperreality,
               and mimesis by the simulacrum” (Rajan 243). I contend that Shelley’s critiques of
               his own culture from <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> to <title level="m">The
                  Triumph of Life </title>employ the Gothic as powerfully as they do precisely by
               bringing forward these deep tensions at the core of it. This is the “Gothic complex”
               he develops across his career so as to help his audiences realize the crossroads of
               choices they face, unless they chose to ignore them, between the most retrospective
               and destructive and the most progressive and liberating options for the ways we can
               construct Life for ourselves then, now, and in the future. </p>

<p>Given the growing interest in the relationship between “Romantic” and “Gothic”
                    writing, surprisingly little attention has been given to Percy Bysshe Shelley,
                    for whom, more than any other major Romantic, the Gothic arguably provided the
                    most powerful and lasting influence. Although Shelley claimed, in a letter to
                    William Godwin, that by 1812 he was no longer a “votary of Romance,” the Gothic
                    aesthetic saturates his early poetry and casts a gloomy shadow over even the
                    most idealistic moments in his mature work. As a budding Gothic novelist himself
                    during his teenage years, Shelley appears to have grown impatient with the
                    narrative constraints of prose fiction, choosing instead to invest his creative
                    energies in poetry while still exploring the aesthetic possibilities and
                    contradictions associated with the Gothic aesthetic. His reading habits and
                    poetic interests suggest that what he had given up was not an interest in the
                    Gothic itself but in the stock conventions of the “Old Gothic” of Walpole and
                    Radcliffe that had since become the object of satire in the early-nineteenth
                    century. According to Mary Shelley’s Journal, both Mary and Percy continued to
                    read a number of Gothic texts, which included William Beckford’s <title level="m">Vathek</title>; Charles Brockden Brown’s <title level="m">Weiland</title>, <title level="m">Ormond</title>, <title level="m">Edgar
                        Huntley</title>, and <title level="m">Arthur Merwyn</title>; Charlotte
                    Dacre’s <title level="m">Zafloya</title>; Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb
                        Williams </title>and <title level="m">St. Leon</title>; Caroline Lamb’s
                        <title level="m">Glenarvon</title>; Charles Maturin’s <title level="m">Fatal
                        Revenge; or the Family of Montorio</title> and <title level="m">J</title>.
                        <title level="m">Bertram</title>; Thomas Love Peacock’s <title level="m">Nightmare Abbey </title>(in which Shelley is playfully satirized in the
                    character of Scythrop); John Polidori’s <title level="m">The Vampyre</title>;
                    along with all of Matthew Lewis’s and Ann Radcliffe’s works. Shelley also
                    enjoyed the Gothic productions of Germany, which included Goethe’s <title level="m">Faust</title>; Frederick Schiller’s <title level="m">The Robbers
                    </title>and <title level="m">The Ghost Seer</title>; and the aptly titled <title level="m">Phantasmagoriana</title>, a French translation of supernatural
                    stories that was translated into English in 1812 as <title level="m">Tales of
                        the Dead</title>. </p>
<p> The contributors to this volume aim to explore the ways in which Shelley
                    “delimits” the Gothic, opening the symbolic potentiality of an aesthetic that is
                    always caught between its reactionary and revolutionary, reifying and
                    transformative impulses. Shelley’s early poetry and prose, including his two
                    published Gothic novels—<title level="m">Zastrozzi, a Romance </title>(1810)
                    and <title level="m">St. Irvyne; or, The Rosicrucian</title> (1811)—and his
                    first book-length poem, <title level="m">The Wandering Jew; or The Victim of the
                        Eternal Avenger</title> (1809/10), have received scant critical attention,
                    often relegated to appendices or a “Juvenilia” section in editions of Shelley’s
                    works. The essays in this volume, however, call for an analysis that approaches
                    these works with the same theoretical rigor that his mature poetry receives and,
                    thus, to fill a gap in Shelley scholarship by establishing new readings and
                    identifying avenues for future research. We all argue, in different ways, that
                    recognizing Shelley’s Gothic sensibility is fundamental to fully appreciate his
                    struggle to mediate the Gothic antagonisms that persist in his poetry throughout
                    his career. Each essay in the volume interrogates the distinction between what
                    can be called the <title level="m">Shelleyan</title> subject of Romanticism and
                    the <title level="m">Shelleyesque</title> subject of Gothicism. Where the
                    Shelleyan gaze finds synthesis, desire, pleasure, beauty, benevolence, and
                    being; the Shelleyesque gaze finds antagonism, drive, <foreign>jouissance</foreign>, monstrosity, perversion, and lack. We resist the
                    temptation to literalize this split or to apply a rigid definition to either his
                    Gothic or Romantic works, terms that should be used provisionally. As Michael
                    Gamer reminds us in his <title level="m">Romanticism and the Gothic, </title>“at
                    the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth century . . . neither
                    ‘gothic’ nor ‘romantic’ had yet taken their modern meanings” and that the Gothic
                    is rather “a discursive site crossing the genres” (2-3). As the essays in this
                    volume demonstrate, the tension between <emph>Shelleyesque</emph>-Gothic and <emph>Shelleyean</emph>-Romantic
                    aesthetic modes operate dialectically, if not antagonistically, across the
                    entirety of Shelley’s writing. </p>
<p> Rather than an undisciplined juvenile phase of Shelley’s development (as many
                    critics have argued), the <emph>Shelleyesque</emph> haunts the
                        <emph>Shelleyan</emph> in unsettling and provocative ways. The
                    Gothic, for Shelley, thus provides an aesthetic foil against which his most
                    idealistic moments are generated. Shelley’s Gothic provides a baseline account,
                    so to speak, of his earliest attempts to articulate a mode of subjectivity that
                    recognizes rather than sublimates the political, sexual, psychological, and
                    aesthetic antagonisms produced within the social field where the combinatory
                    dynamics between subject, self, object, and other are expressed. Shelley’s
                    Gothic indexes a site of failure when imagination stutters or when the
                    aspirations of the Romantic ego are confronted with the void of subjective
                    destitution. But the Gothic also opens up the possibility of symbolic
                    transgression and transfiguration, exploiting the aesthetic machinery of the
                    Gothic tradition while radically undercutting the expectations associated with
                    that tradition. </p>
<p> Jerrold Hogle’s essay outlines the contours of what he calls the “Gothic
                    Complex” in Shelley’s works. This complex of “interacting symbolic processes,”
                    which Hogle argues can be found from <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title>’s
                    Walpolean borrowings all the way through to <title level="m">The Triumph
                        Life</title>, serve as a “repository for unresolved conflicts among
                    contending beliefs.” Focusing on the “Shape all light” from the <title level="m">Triumph</title>, Hogle shows how this Janus-faced figure exemplifies
                    Shelley’s preoccupation with Gothic imagery that is “continuously being
                    un-shaped and re-shaped again” as Shelley himself shapes and is re-shaped by the
                    symbolic processes he employs. Ultimately, for Hogle, Shelley, the poem, and its
                    audience “cannot escape from the systems of belief” Shelley wishes to dismantle. </p>
<p> Tilottama Rajan takes up Professor Hogle’s “Gothic Complex” and refigures it as
                    a “Gothic Matrix.” Rajan asks whether the Gothic complex “serves as a transition
                    out of a particular historical moment, or whether it represents a permanent
                    kernel of error at the heart of all idealism.” Rajan argues that the “flattened
                    out” Gothic complex that Shelley inherited becomes a matrix “interimbricated
                    with Romanticism itself, as an anamorphic distortion that traverses texts that
                    do <emph>not</emph> formally belong to the genre.” Rajan analyzes the fluidity
                    and creative potential of this matrix by drawing on Hegel’s distinction between
                    the “symbolic” and “romantic.” For Hegel, the symbolic mode registers the
                    insufficiency of the idea to its content, whereas the romantic mode registers
                    the insufficiency of the content to its idea. The Gothic, as the symbolic
                    disfigurement of the Romantic idea, is thus a “shelter for the potentiality of
                    superstition and perversion,” which Rajan sees exemplified in the dual figure of
                    Ginotti/Nempere in Shelley’s second Gothic novel, <title level="m">St. Irvyne;
                        or, The Rosicrucian</title>. </p>
<p> Robert Miles’s essay on <title level="m">The Cenci</title> reflects upon the
                    theoretical approaches of Hogle and Rajan and notes that “Gothic and Romantic
                    are indispensible terms for delineating a whole that is larger than either.”
                    Miles argues that the Gothic complex, or “symbolic constitution,” produces an
                    intractable deadlock in <title level="m">The Cenci</title> as: “the dead hand of
                    the past; the baleful influence of Gothic institutions that live on in the
                    present; the very notion of a vicious circle; a moral antinomy that prods the
                    reader into analytical action; conspiracy; a belief in the totalizing power of
                    tyranny; the strenuous difficulty of regaining historical agency; the delusive
                    glamour of the sublime; and, finally, and certainly not least, critique of
                    Burke.” Miles reads Shelley’s Introduction to the drama against itself, pointing
                    out that “to explore one’s own dark heart,” as Shelley instructs, “one would in
                    casuistical fashion need to name and identify all possible motivations for a
                    particular desire. The act of bringing them to light is also the act of bringing
                    them to horrific life.” For Miles, the difficult ethical demands of <title level="m">The Cenci</title> reveal a Shelley who is “uncompromising about
                    our inability to emancipate ourselves into free agency while drawing upon inner
                    resources.”</p>
<p> From Christopher Bundock’s historiographic perspective, “the Gothic offers
                    Romantic and modern culture a space in which to explore but also contain—through
                    predictable, formulaic gambits—the institutional dismemberment and
                    re-articulation often glossed as secularization.” Through a wide-ranging
                    analysis that focuses on <title level="m">The Wandering Jew</title> and <title level="m">Adonais</title>, Bundock explores the tensions between the <title level="m">Shelleyesque</title> and the <title level="m">Shelleyean</title>
                    in relation to the persistence of the “matter” of history and of the act of
                    historicization itself. For Bundock, “unnatural, physical reanimation offers
                    form to historical counter-narratives, a way for what is excluded from official
                    accounts to confront history’s aesthetic ideology.” The figure of the Wandering
                    Jew, excluded from Christian history, “collapses progressive history by bearing
                    trauma materially out of the past and into the future.” Similarly, in <title level="m">Adonais</title> Shelley places Keats—his death and body—in a
                    “material vision of history” that exceeds transcendence and eludes mediation,
                    where “elegiac mourning is recast and re-understood as melancholy monstrosity.” </p>
<p> My own essay on <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> resonates with Hogle’s and
                    Rajan’s theorization of the regressive and progressive tendencies of Gothic
                    iconography for Shelley. My reading of Shelley’s first significant publication
                    places the work in the literary-historical context of the anti-Jacobin backlash
                    against the scandalous transgressions of the Gothic and the threatening
                    progressivism of republican philosophical positions. Shelley enters the fray
                    late in the game and positions <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> not as an
                    exercise of generic mimicry, but as an ambitious satire of the “Jacobin
                    monster.” In the character of Zastrozzi, Shelley condenses anti-Jacobin fears
                    and shows how such figures exert their control over the reactionary mind,
                    generating a plague of fantasies for the ostensible “hero” of the novel,
                    Verezzi. At the same time, Shelley also “subjectivizes” the paranoiac image of
                    the other and reveals the impotence of the individual behind the sublime mask.
                    Thus Shelley’s early use of the Gothic is a critical, though perhaps blunt,
                    instrument in the demystification of ideology. But <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> also introduces obstacles that haunt any totalizing
                    concept of the Enlightenment subject and/or Romantic ego. Zastrozzi, whether as
                    sublime figure of the anti-Jacobin paranoiac imaginary or impotent subject, is
                    still an implacable other bent on revenge, resistant to the ethics of
                    sympathetic identification, guilt, or shame. </p>
<p> In later works such as <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title>, <title level="m">The Cenci</title>, <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>,
                    and <title level="m">Hellas</title>, Shelley confronts similar tyrannical
                    figures that echo back to Zastrozzi and the Gothic antagonism he presents to
                    emergent Romantic consciousness. Whether or not Shelley is successful in
                    mediating or transcending those antagonisms depends in large part on whether we,
                    as readers and critics of Shelley, consider his Gothic aesthetic to be limiting
                    or delimiting. It is our hope in this volume to spur further critical
                    investigations into the vexed relationship between Romanticism and the Gothic,
                    being fully aware that, as Shelley put it in <title level="m">Queen Mab</title>,
                    “much yet remains unscanned.” </p>

<div type="abstract">
<p rend="noCount">This paper begins with the Gothic, exemplified in Shelley’s early Gothic novels
            <title level="m">Zastrozzi</title> and <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, as
            an overdetermined and unprocessed moment that interrupts aesthetic ideology, and
            that is problematically entwined with the Romantic in ways that help to illuminate
            the deconstructive role that the Gothic has come to play in Romantic Studies. More
            particularly, I approach this interimbrication through Hegel’s distinction between
            “Symbolic” and Romantic art in his <title level="m">Aesthetics</title>, which
            distinguishes three modes based on art’s (in)ability fully to configure the “Idea.”
            In Symbolic art the “Idea” is still "indeterminate"; it achieves “adequate
            embodiment” in Classicism; but in the Romantic, form and content are again
            separated, because of an inadequacy in external forms that repeats and reverses the
            problems of the Symbolic. Curiously placing Classical beauty and unity in the middle
            of his dialectic, as an abandoned synthesis, Hegel oscillates between two forms of
            inadequacy that are both similar and different. For the Romantic beautiful soul
            withdraws from existing discourses, while the imagination of the Symbolic artist is
            deformed by what it cannot form. But the Romanticist thereby risks a bad infinity,
            while the Symbolic artist works on content in the here and now, even at the cost of
            trapping his work in what Hegel calls a “bad and untrue determinacy.” Given Hegel’s
            association of the Symbolic with the fantastic and monstrous but also the sublime
            (which I read here through ðiñek), we can use his category to think through
            Shelley’s use of the Gothic as a mode whose very disfigurations—and sometimes its
            conscious badness—form part of a creative negativity. The Gothic, as a stalled and
            blocked form, has been seen as a “complex.” But this makes it a vanishing mediator
            in the transition from residual to emergent societal modes. I suggest, instead, that
            it is a “matrix” for an irresolvable contention and ferment in the work of culture:
            one to which Shelley comes back again and again. In conclusion, I touch briefly on
            three of these Shelleyan returns. In <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>
            Demogorgon’s clumsy overthrow of Jove is merely a parenthesis. Concessive clause.
            More complex is <title level="m">Alastor</title>, as Shelley’s autonarration of his
            unsettled relation to a poetry he conceives Romantically but Gothically dis-figures.
            Finally, in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> the Shape in the Car seems
            to punish the Idealism of the Shape all Light. But their inter-folding reconfigures
            the relation of Gothic and Romantic, as Shelley can no longer immunize “the
            splendour of unfaded beauty” against “the secrets of anatomy and corruption,” nor
            protect literature from a cultural and political debasement that, by “eat[ing] out
            the poetry” from history, actually releases a disastrous creativity.</p>

<head>The Gothic Matrix: Shelley Between the Symbolic and Romantic<note place="foot" resp="editors">This paper is based on a paper given in a session on “Shelley and
                  the Gothic” organized by Neil Fraistat at the 2011 MLA in Los Angeles. A
                  significantly different and expanded version of the same paper appeared under
                  the title “The Work of the Negative: Symbolic, Gothic and Romantic in Shelley and
                  Hegel” in <title level="j">Studies in Romanticism</title>, 52: 1 (2013), 3-32. The
                  author wishes to thank the Canada Research Chairs Programme for research support
                  that has made the writing of this paper possible.</note>

               (1811) the alchemist Ginotti is about to initiate Wolfstein into the secrets of life.
               Wolfstein is the hero of the main plot, while Ginotti is the obscure figure, the
               unstable compound, who sanctions Wolfstein’s poisoning of the bandit Cavigni to
               obtain the lovely Megalena. In the main story Ginotti functions as the Dark
               Interpreter of the increasingly dissolute Wolfstein, until the plot disposes of both
               in its Faustian “Conclusion.” The novel is also intersected by a Radcliffean subplot
               focused on Eloise, who turns out to be Wolfstein’s sister, even though she seems to
               be French while he is Bohemian. Eloise is seduced by the casuistical Nempere, rescued
               by another libertine, and marries Fitzeustace, a Peacockian parody of the Shelleyan
               Poet. This Romantic subplot fantastically escapes the Gothic main plot, by which it
               is nevertheless enveloped as Nempere turns out to be Ginotti. The result is that
               Nempere, though terminated in the subplot, is still alive in the main plot,thus
               casting doubt on whether the text has indeed disposed of the matrix figure whose
               metamorphic alias he is. And do we want to dispose of this matrix towards which the
               more obscure and elusive figure of Ginotti gestures? Or does the novel’s titular
               remembering of Godwin’s <title level="m">St. Leon</title> (1799), where alchemy is
               also a metonymy for schemes of sociopolitical improvement, make Ginotti a shorthand
               figure for a still undigested future transformation of “the potable waters that flow
               from death through life” (<title level="m">Defence</title> 533)? <note xml:id="ftn1" place="foot" resp="editors" n="1">References to <title level="m">A Defence of

</p>
<p> Indeed this unprocessed dimension of the characters and “figures” that “rise on the
               bubble” of Gothic experimentation only to be cast off (<title level="m">Triumph</title> 248-50), is evident in the hasty algebra with which <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title> ends: <quote>Ginotti is Nempere. Eloise is the sister
                  of Wolfstein. Let then the memory of these victims to hell and malice live in the
                  remembrance of those who can pity the wanderings of error; let remorse and
                  repentance expiate the offences which arise from the delusion of the passions, and
                  let endless life be sought from Him who alone can give an eternity of happiness.
                  (252)</quote> With these pious clichés Shelley throws away a project with which he
               has grown impatient. But three chapters earlier, when Ginotti promises Wolfstein the
               elixir of life, he endows this juvenile literary performance with an unexpected
               metaphysical depth. As a prelude to this promise which is never fulfilled, Ginotti
               launches into his biographia literaria.He tells how by the age of seventeen he had
               delved into the secrets of “natural philosophy” and “metaphysical calculations,”
               convincing himself of “the non-existence of a First Cause” (236-7). This
               epistemological transgression, or <foreign>acte gratuit</foreign> as André Gide might
               call it, had led him to experiment with poison, killing a youth who had offended him.
               Thereupon, having tasted death, he became despairingly nihilistic yet avid for
               eternal life. Contemplating suicide, he found himself on the edge of a gulf, facing a
               “form of most exact and superior symmetry.” The passage is worth quoting at length:
                  <quote>The phantasm advanced towards me; it seemed then, to my imagination, that
                  his figure was borne on the sweet strain of music which filled the circumambient
                  air. In a voice which was fascination itself, the being addressed me, saying,
                  `Wilt thou come with me? Wilt thou be mine?’ ... “No, no,” I unhesitatingly cried,
                  with a feeling which no language can either explain or describe. No sooner had I
                  uttered these words, than methought a sensation of deadly horror chilled my
                  sickening frame ... the beautiful being vanished; clouds, as of chaos, rolled
                  around, and from their dark masses flashed incesant meteors. ... My neck was
                  grasped firmly and, turning round in an agony of horror, I beheld a form more
                  hideous than the imagination of man is capable of portraying, whose proportions,
                  gigantic and deformed, were seemingly blackened by the inerasible traces of the
                  thunderbolts of God; yet in its hideous and detestable countenance, though
                  seemingly far different, I thought I could recognize that of the lovely vision.

<p>This passage from Shelley’s early novel strikingly anticipates
               Rousseau’s symbolic autobiography in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>,
               where Rousseau too is offered the elixir of life: “a chrystal glass/ Mantling with
               bright Nepenthe” (358-9). In Rousseau’s dream-vision, the Shape all light, the
               aestheticization of a revolutionary idealism that Ginotti pursues in more Sadeian and
               Nietzschean ways, becomes the deformed shape in the Car, returning us to the Gothic
               scene that opens the character “Shelley’s” dream-vision of history.<note xml:id="ftn2" place="foot" resp="editors" n="2">I use “Shelley” in quotation marks
                  to refer to the first-person speaker of the poem, the character Shelley, as

                  the same kind of analytic operation that deconstruction is. My use of the term
                  thus tries to restore some of the generative potential of a mutilation of figures
                  whose affect suggests the struggle or “restless fermentation” that Hegel sees in
                  the Symbolic.</note> it never quite ceases to be present in the “severe excess” of
               the enlightenment that follows: “The ghost of a forgotten form of sleep” (<title level="m">Triumph of Life</title> 424-8). While in both cases we seem to proceed
               sequentially from illusion to disillusion, both texts are better described as folding
               the Gothic and Romantic into each other. In <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>, that
               is, the romance of Eloise and Fitzeustace, which itself exists only by repressing a
               traumatic Gothic kernel, is enveloped within a larger narrative of Faustian depravity
               that conceals a core of idealism disclosed and defaced in Ginotti’s vision. Likewise
               in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, “Shelley’s” dream-vision is infolded
               with Rousseau’s in a pattern of blindness and insight that confuses misprision and
               enlightenment: while Rousseau awakens from his encounter with the Shape all light to
               the nightmare of history, “Shelley” <emph>dreams</emph> this nightmare which folds
               inwards and backwards to a core of idealism at the heart of darkness.</p>
<p> In connecting the passage from <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>
<note xml:id="ftn4" place="foot" resp="editors" n="4">For a more extensive discussion
                  of Shelley’s Gothic novels themselves, see Rajan, <title level="m">Romantic
                     Narrative</title> (46-74).</note> to Shelley’s last poem, I want therefore to
               suggest that it entwines the Gothic and Romantic in a way that is emblematic of the
               role Gothic has come to play in Romantic Studies. For in the past several years the
               Gothic has arguably replaced the greater Romantic lyric as a generic synecdoche for
               the field, though without the metacritical recognition that M.H. Abrams gave the
               Greater Romantic lyric. Or put differently, the Gothic has assumed the task of
               deconstructing what has variously been called “aesthetic ideology” or “Romantic
               ideology” (McGann; Redfield 24-7), in particular because it makes manifest, almost
               schematically, what Godwin calls the “Gothic and unintelligible burden of past
               institutions” (II.101). The prominence of the Gothic also marks a shift from
               so-called “High” Romanticism to the popular that might superficially seem to be part
               of “cultural studies.” Yet unlike cultural studies, if the Gothic deconstructs
               Romantic ideology, it does so on the ground of literature, by exposing Romanticism to
               its own in(di)gestion of the work of the negative, rather than by demystifying it
               from the outside as a social or economic phenomenon. Thus in Shelley’s major poems
               (as also in Blake’s <title level="m">Europe</title> and <title level="m">(First) Book
                  of Urizen</title>) the Romantic is never free of the constraint of the Gothic. An
               example from Shelley’s most ethereal text is the unprocessed melodrama of
               Demogorgon’s victory over Jove. But equally, for Shelley at least, the Gothic is
               never free of the Romantic, which is to say that he allows us to grasp a
               transformative potential in the violence and perversity of the Gothic that is less
               evident in more popular uses of the genre.</p>
<p> We can approach this linkage of Romantic and Gothic through Hegel’s distinction
               between Romantic and Symbolic art: modes he opposes while conceding their profound
               connection. Hegel’s triad of Symbolic, Classical and Romantic art in his lectures on
                  <title level="m">Aesthetics</title> is particularly useful because on the one
               hand, though the post-Walpolean Gothic may not fall chronologically within the
               Oriental phase that Hegel delimits as Symbolic, Hegel’s association of the Symbolic
               with the monstrous and fantastic applies equally to the Gothic (I. 76). On the other
               hand, the Symbolic is a broader category than the Gothic, including as it does the
               sublime, which we might conventionally expect to find in the Romantic phase. As such,
               the category of the Symbolic helps to open up the Gothic philosophically beyond the
               sensationalism to which the sheer mass production of the genre at the time reduces
               it. Indeed there is a certain consistency between Hegel’s unconventional placement of
               the sublime in the Symbolic phase and my own use of the Symbolic to think through the
               (pre)Romantic genre of the Gothic. For both anachronisms register the generative
               potential of a mode whose disfigurations form part of a creative negativity.</p>
<p> Hegel theorizes three modes based on art’s ability to fully configure the “Idea,” a
               term derived from Kant, but which is curiously unreferred in Hegel, as it is not the
               idea “of” anything and is thus a form of desire. For Kant in the <title level="m">Critique of Judgment</title> “aesthetic ideas” are forms that have not quite
               found their content, while “rational ideas” are concepts (such as freedom) that have
               not achieved material form (192, 218). Thus already for Kant a certain inadequacy
               seems to be at the heart of the “Idea.” As a desire for the Idea rather than any
               specific idea, Hegel’s Idea is not unlike what Shelley defends as “poetry,” which
               often turns out to be a creativity that exceeds generic and historical containment
                  (<title level="m">Defence</title> 518). In Hegel’s sequence, which historicizes
               Kant’s analyses of the beautiful and sublime, the Symbolic, Classical and Romantic
               involve different relations between "inwardness" and its "externalization," “theme”
               and execution,” or the Idea and its "embodiment" (I.75, 79, 96, 422).<note xml:id="ftn5" place="foot" resp="editors" n="5">In Kant’s terms from the <title level="m">Third Critique</title> the Classical is beautiful, whereas the
                  Symbolic and Romantic are different versions of the sublime. It should be noted
                  that Hegel does not use the term “Symbolic” in the way it was used by
                  contemporaries such as Goethe, Schelling, Coleridge and others (nor in the way it
                  is used by Lacan, for whom the “symbolic order” is really an order of signs). For
                  Hegel’s contemporaries the symbol is the unification of the particular and
                  universal, whereas allegory is their separation; in effect, the symbol is a form
                  of the beautiful. For Hegel the Symbolic is one form taken by the separation of
                  particular and universal. Indeed Hegel’s inversion of the usual meaning of the
                  term is part of a complex critique—engaged with the work of Goethe and Friedrich
                  Creuzer—of the idea of art as <foreign>Darstellung</foreign> or the presencing of
                  the Idea. For elaboration of this point see Rajan, “Towards a Cultural Idealism”
                  (62-5), which also discusses the relation between Symbolic and Romantic in
                  Hegel.</note> In the Symbolic phase, which is pre-art, pre-mature, art fails to
               achieve identity with itself because of a deficiency in self-consciousness that is
               reflected in the Idea still being "indeterminate." This problem is overcome in the
               Classical, as art becomes "the adequate embodiment of the Idea" (I.76-7). But in the
               Romantic, form and content are again separated, this time because of a deficiency in
               matter that repeats and reverses the problems of the Symbolic. For while the Idea in
               the Symbolic fails to embody itself because of its own deficiency, in the Romantic
               phase the Idea is fully developed, but “can no longer find its adequate reality” in
               the “shapes” available to it in its culture (I.442). Thus the Romantic “reverts, even
               if in a higher way, to that difference and opposition of the two sides which in
               symbolic art remained unconquered” (I.79). </p>
<p> The “critical history of Poetry” in which Shelley finds the “defence” of his Idea
               “betrayed” (528) likewise contains both Romantic and Symbolic versions of this
               inadequacy. Thus on the one hand poetry is constrained by “distorted notions” that
               result in even poets such as Dante and Milton walking “through eternity” “enveloped”
               in the “mask and mantle of prejudice” (526). On the other hand poetry is also figured
               in the quintessentially Romantic images of a “fading coal” (531) or a “lightning
               which has yet found no conductor” (528). On one level the <title level="m">Defence</title> presses towards a Romantic <foreign>telos</foreign> that disavows
               the Symbolic matrix of the history in which it finds itself embedded. Yet the very
               contradiction between the images of the fading coal and the lightning, in the first
               of which the idea is fully developed while in the second it is yet to come, marks the
               tenuousness of the Romantic category. </p>
<p> Act IV of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, or the scene where Asia grasps
               Panthea’s dreams by reading her “written soul” in her eyes (II.i.110) are examples of
               a Romanticism that presses beyond mediation. By contrast, the Symbolic is associated
               with the monstrous or fantastic, and disfigures its too hasty hypostasis of the Idea
               through what Hegel calls a “bad and untrue determinacy” (<title level="m">Aesthetics</title> I.76): a description we can extend to the Gothic. Thus in
                  <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title> Nempere de-forms rather than embodies Ginotti
               . For his part, Ginotti is himself the inchoate materialization of a juvenile and
               indeterminate Idea. Like Demogorgon, who is nothing if not Symbolic, this Idea has
               neither “form nor outline” (<title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> II.iv.6). It
               is an unstable compound in which the Nietzschean “death of God” in the materialism of
               the <foreign>philosophes</foreign> makes possible social and thought experiments
               whose association with libertinism and perversion figures their underlying
               ideological contradictions. </p>
<p> Ginotti is a “figure” that materializes at the threshold between fear and desire.
               Opposing “figure” to “discourse” Lyotard describes three levels of figuration that
               are more and more removed from any kind of clear formulation: the image-figure, which
               is visible but already blurred; the form-figure, which can be “perceived” but not
               “seen” and is a schema that underlies the visible; and finally the matrix figure,
               which is neither “visible” nor “readable,” and which is “difference itself” (277-8).
               Ginotti is this form-figure or schema that gestures towards the matrix described by
               Lyotard, which Wolfstein and Nempere, as stereotyped image-figures, disfigure through
               their “bad and untrue definiteness” (<title level="m">Aesthetics</title> I.74). Yet
               if the Gothic is “bad” literature, Shelley’s explicit association of the genre in
                  <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title> with the <foreign>philosophes</foreign>
               (236-7), gives its distortions a Symbolic potential: one that Hegel recognizes when
               he describes how in the crudity of the Symbolic, “the Idea . . . persists
                  <emph>sublime</emph> above all this multiplicity of shapes which do not correspond
               with it” (<title level="m">Aesthetics</title> 77).</p>
<p> Returning to Hegel, what is notable in his dialectic is the place of the Classical,
               as a synthesis oddly displaced to the middle. For the Classical, as the "unity of the
               artist's subjective activity with his work,” “achieves what true art is in its
               essential nature” (I.427, 431). Yet Hegel is dissatisfied with this completion, as
               the Classical is superseded by the Romantic, which reverts to the difference of Idea
               and shape in the Symbolic, as if it is really inadequacy which is the essence of art.
               We sense Hegel’s disappointment with the Classical when he says that the Classical
               artist adequately embodies the Idea only because he receives his content “cut and
               dried” from “national faith and myth,” leaving him free to work on the formal and
               rhetorical shaping of this content (I.439). By contrast, form and content in the
               Symbolic have a more integral relationship: Symbolic art senses "the inadequacy of
               its . . . shapes” and yet can do nothing but distort these shapes, thus "positing
               it[self] as the inherently deficient, something to be superseded" (I.318-19). Yet the
               Symbolic, as a mode in which the "Idea . . . does violence" to "natural shapes," also
               “stretches them unnaturally" in order to "<emph>elevate their phenomenal appearance
                  to the Idea</emph>" (I.76; italics mine). There is thus something sublime in its
               deformations that distinguishes it both from Classical complacency and from the
               ineffectually angelic claims of the Romantic.</p>
<p> Hence Hegel’s strategic location of the sublime in the Symbolic rather than Romantic
               phase. For there are two kinds of Symbolic art: the “positive” art of India and
               Persia and the “negative” art of the sublime (I.364). In a section of the third
               Critique that Hegel cites, Kant argues that the physical presentation of the sublime
               (as in a raging ocean) is merely “horrible,” because it fails to understand the
               sublime as an “invisible meaning devoid of shape” that has no adequate objective
               correlative in phenomena (Hegel, Aesthetics I.363-4). Hence Kant prefers the dynamic
               sublime to a merely mathematical sublime limited to <foreign>res extensa</foreign>.
               Hegel’s criticism of Symbolic forms such as the grotesque that involve a hyperactive
               visual surface has its origin in these comments by Kant, and is generated by a
               philosophical argument against visibility as the premature foreclosure of negativity.
               The Symbolic, then, is by no means simple. It is the site of a difference between an
               Idea falsely posited in a determinate image-figure like Nempere, or Zastrozzi whose
               gigantic stature makes him mathematically sublime, and the more invisible matrix to
               which this character gestures.</p>
<p> At the same time this matrix is by no means to be identified with the
                  <emph>transcendental</emph> Idea of the Kantian sublime. It is not just that Kant
               still assumes that “the Thing-in-itself, ” or we might say Idea, “exists as something
               positively given beyond the field of representation,” whereas for Hegel the “basic
               dialectical moment of the Sublime” consists in “the notion that the Idea is reached
               through purely negative presentation – that the very inadequacy of the phenomenality
               to the Thing is the only appropriate way to present it” (Žižek, <title level="m">Sublime Object</title> 205). Kant, as Žižek says, also refused to confront the
               monstrous (<title level="m">Plague of Fantasies</title> 280-1).Thus on the one hand,
               in the wake of the Kantian sublime, Hegel’s location of the sublime in the Symbolic
               associates even the more positive forms of the Symbolic such as the Gothic with
               projects of Reason and freedom. Hence Ginotti’s excursus on materialism (236-8) and
               Zastrozzi’s defiant embrace of an atheism that rises “above the shackles of prejudice
               . . . and injurious superstition” (153). But on the other hand the Kantian sublime
               involves a missed encounter of these projects of Pure Reason with a core of darkness
               that we necessarily confront in characters like Ginotti.<note xml:id="ftn6" place="foot" resp="editors" n="6">Comparing Godwin with Kant, David Collings

               freedom.</p>
<p> Yet the Symbolic artist, “toss[ing] about in a thousand forms” and adapting “to the
               meaning sought the shapes that ever remain alien,” does possess a freedom denied to
               the Classical artist, even if this freedom is entwined with necessity (I.438-9).<note xml:id="ftn7" place="foot" resp="editors" n="7">For elaboration of this point see
                  Rajan, “Difficult Freedom: Hegel’s Symbolic Art and Schelling’s Historiography in
                     <title level="m">Ages of the World</title> (1815).”</note> For in Symbolic art
               “the spirit . . . shapes itself out of its own resources” (I.362). Its “restless
               fermentation” is the “labour” of the negative, wherein consciousness is still
               “producing its content and making it clear to itself,” rather than resting in ideas
               “already determined for imagination as settled” (I.438-9). Similarly, to adapt
               Shelley in <title level="m">A Defence</title>, the “distorted notions of invisible
               things” in the Gothic are the “mask and the mantle” that conceal a certain “poetry”
               (526). But this very distortion makes aesthetic form the site of a perpetually vital
               struggle between dominant, residual and emergent ideologies: one that calls for a
               symptomatic reading of what Jameson calls “the form of content” and “the content of
               form” (<title level="m">Political Unconscious</title> 99). Other essays in this
               volume also locate in the Gothic a “matrix” that continues to trouble Shelley’s work.
               But the question is whether this matrix, even if it recurs in Shelley’s work, is a
               kind of “vanishing mediator” that serves as a transition out of a particular
               historical moment, or whether it represents a permanent kernel of error at the heart
               of all idealism. And the further question is whether “error,” the word with which
                  <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title> concludes (252), simply means “mistake” or
               whether it is, in a pathological and twisted way, also creative.<note xml:id="ftn8" place="foot" resp="editors" n="8">Thus Stanley Corngold distinguishes between
                  mistakes, which are simply wrong, and error: “the skew of error implies a truth”

</p>
<p> In Jerrold Hogle’s essay in this volume this question remains unanswered, or is
               perhaps answered in the form of a “both/and” rather than an “either/or.” In Hogle’s
               previous work, which has been seminal in opening up the seriousness of the genre, the
               post-Walpolean Gothic is the expression of a particular cultural moment that is riven
               by underlying contradictions. Or as he puts it here, it has been “<emph>the</emph>
               fictive place where the deepest and thus most feared irresolutions in the culture
               between ideologies and world-views are sequestered and distanced.” But insofar as
               Hogle places these irresolutions within a historical development that in fact does
               resolve them—from feudal to capitalist, Catholic to Protestant, or symbol to
               sign—the Gothic then becomes what Jameson calls a “vanishing mediator.” For Jameson,
               writing on Max Weber, the vanishing mediator is the catalyst that disappears in the
               transition from the residual to the emergent. But if Shelley inherits a “Gothic
               complex” “almost intact” from Walpole and the 1790s Gothic, and if Shelley’s Gothic
               novels are in this sense derivative, does the Gothic “complex” in becoming a “matrix”
               reconstitute the Gothic as the permanent expression of an irresolvable contention and
               ferment in the work of culture, for which Hegel’s Symbolic also provides a name? And
               is this emergence of the Gothic as not simply a complex but also a matrix what
               happens between Shelley’s early Gothic novels and <title level="m">The Triumph of
                  Life</title>? My answer would be in the affirmative. Indeed it is because the
               Gothic becomes a matrix, and not just a complex flattened out by its containment
               within a genre that is its “form-figure,” that the Gothic has become so
               interimbricated with Romanticism itself, as an anamorphic distortion that traverses
               texts that do <emph>not</emph> formally belong to the genre: texts such as Blake’s
               Lambeth books, Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> and <title level="m">Fleetwood</title>, Mary Shelley’s <title level="m">Mathilda</title>, and Byron’s
                  <title level="m">The Giaour</title>, and even <title level="m">Adonais</title> as
               discussed by Christopher Bundock in this volume.</p>
<p> For on the one hand, as Hogle argues, Gothic figures are transitional insofar as
               they are “‘floating signifiers’ separable from their older grounds and thus able to
               signify newer ones.” As a result the “figures ever new” of <title level="m">The
                  Triumph of Life</title> (248), “the material simulacra given off by objects and
               people in Lucretius” (and Baudrillard), are the sedimented traces of past ideologies
               which they render “spectral.” The Gothic mode thus becomes an epistemology for
               diagnosing how the present continues to be haunted by the ghosts or residues of “old
               symbolic orders,” and in this way is part of the work of ideological progress. But on
               the other hand it is precisely this progress that is put in question when Shelley, as
               described by Hogle, recognizes the claims of the old as well as the new:<note xml:id="ftn9" place="foot" resp="editors" n="9">Shelley’s interest in Charles I,
                  on whom he wrote a fragmentary play, is also relevant here.</note> hence the
               functioning of these figures not just as “signs” but more archaically as “symbols.” I
               would go farther and suggest that the force of these symbols is not just critical—a
               sense that the new must be mediated through the old if anarchy is not to result<note xml:id="ftn10" place="foot" resp="editors" n="10">I take this to be the gist of
                  Hogle’s comment, in his essay here, that the “looking-backwards-and-forwards
                  simultaneously, like the ‘Janus-faced shadow’ that actually drives Life’s chariot
                  for Shelley, coincides with Walpole’s preference . . . for keeping at least a
                  ‘shadow of monarchy’ on an ‘otherwise empty chair of state,’ . . . rather than
                  facing the uncertainties of total revolution that eventually made England (and
                  even Shelley) fearful of the violence in France.” </note>—but also creative. The
               “emptied-out figures” of the procession, Gothicized as “vampire bats” (484), retain,
               in their very decay, a kind of creativity. Thus in the enthusiasm of the procession,
               which includes Plato as well as Caesar and Constantine, “something not yet made good
               pushes its essence forward,” as Habermas says of the utopianism of Ernst Bloch (71).
               This (de)constructive creativity is implicit in the differend between “Shelley” and
               Rousseau over the “figures” cast onto and cast off by the Car of Life. “Shelley”
               disdains to “worship” these idols that fashion projects onto “the world’s false and
               fragile glass.” But Rousseau, even as he acknowledges the relentless consumption of
               the old by the new, insists that the “vitally metaphoric” process of history goes on
               as a mixture of idealism and idolatry: “Figures ever new / Rise on the bubble, paint
               them how you may” (<title level="m">Defence</title> 512; <title level="m">Triumph</title> 243-51).</p>
<p> Put differently, the cultural work of the Gothic is not limited to the
               demystification of past systems of belief. As Deborah White argues, in the spirit of
               Adorno and Horkheimer’s critique of “enlightenment,” the Romantics’ attitude to
               “superstition” is tied up with the issue of imagination. This is to say not only that
               modernity is itself built on superstitious foundations, but also, as a correlative,
               that literature “cannot surrender the resources of illusion” even if it
               thereby becomes a form of superstition (12, 51). Hence a certain persistence of
               idolatry in <title level="m">The Triumph</title> that resists both “Shelley’s”
               disdain for life, and what White calls the “Enlightenment’s quasi-materialist vision
               of history,” evident in the poem’s relentless serialization of its failed “figures”
               (12). Hence also the way the rationalization of the supernatural in Gothic novels is
               set up <emph>not</emph> to work: a procedure that Shelley strategically if
               impatiently repeats in the emptiness of the formulae that conclude <title level="m">St. Irvyne</title>. For the Gothic is in fact a shelter for the potentiality of
               superstition and perversion, for the “gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the
               present” (Shelley, <title level="m">Defence</title> 535). </p>
<p> This restless fermentation of the Idea as superstition is what Hegel tries to access
               through the Symbolic. For the Symbolic is the form taken by what Žižek calls the
               “sublime object of ideology”: as a form of fantasy rather than Coleridgean
               imagination, it projects an Idea but, through its bad and untrue determinacy, allows
               for a “traversal” of the fantasm (<title level="m">Plague</title> 7-11, 97). Of
               course in the spirit of Enlightenment, Hegel dismisses the Symbolic as crude and
               pagan. He prefers the Romantic because its dissonance of matter and spirit is
               Christian and accords with criteria of beauty. Shelley expresses the same historical
               complacency when he claims that the “poetry” of “Chivalry and Christianity . . .
               erase[s]” the “deform[ities]” of earlier social formations (<title level="m">Defence</title> 518). But the Romantic for Hegel is an alibi for revisiting the
               Symbolic; hence their distinction in terms of a reversed relation in the two between
               the Idea and its embodiment keeps collapsing. </p>
<p> In the Symbolic, as we will recall, the Idea itself is said to be inadequate, while
               in the Romantic the Idea is complete in itself but external forms are inadequate for
               its purposes. But if the Symbolic warps the forms it takes, is this not because they
               are inadequate, or as Shelley says,because its “distorted notions of invisible
               things” are “the mask and mantle” in which poetry “walk[s] through eternity enveloped
               and disguised” (526)? And if the Romantic cannot find adequate forms, is this not
               because its Idea too is undeveloped? And finally if art needs an “external medium for
               its expression,” is not the Romantic also defective in resisting an “adequate union
               with the external” (Hegel, <title level="m">Aesthetics</title> I.81)? At issue here
               is the very criterion of “adequacy,” since as Hegel also says "the specific shape
               which every content of the Idea gives” itself “is always adequate to that content”
               (I.300), which means that Symbolic forms too are organic and purposive
               dis-integrations of their content. Unable to resolve these tensions in his idea of
               art, Hegel finally announces the “end of art” (I.602). But rather than conclude that
               there is no future for art, we should see this “end,” as the ex-termination of a term
               exhausted in its current conception. For in conjunction with the forms of art that
               have emerged in the <title level="m">Aesthetics</title>, the end of art can also
               serve as a deconstruction that allows us to imagine new configurations of the
               aesthetic.</p>
<p> But as we think such models, we must also attend to the difference between the
               Symbolic and Romantic. Pinnacled dim in the intense inane, the Romantic artist is the
               beautiful soul whose bad faith Hegel criticizes in the <title level="m">Phenomenology
                  of Spirit</title> (406-7). He is superior to the Symbolic artist because he
               withdraws from existing discourses into the clarity of a free resistance, while the
               latter is at the mercy of contemporary material, his imagination deformed by what it
               cannot form. On the other hand, this withdrawal into Spirit is a form of bad
               infinity. By contrast the Symbolic artist does not refuse mediation, but works on
               content at the material site of forms. This positing and consequently positivity,
               which Hegel also criticizes, often results in a "bad and untrue determinacy" which
               closes off the dissonance of “Idea and shape” (I.76-7). Thus Ginotti,as the schema
               for an Idea with neither “form nor outline,” is given an untrue determinacy by his
               avatar Wolfstein and by his own role in the narrative: a role constricted by the form
               Shelley had available to him, namely Faustian melodrama. And Zastrozzi too, the
               eponymous hero of Shelley’s previous Gothic novel, is conventionalized by the way his
               author has been interpellated into the model of revenge tragedy. Nor is the Gothic as
               a genre unaware of the force of institution, what Jean-Paul Sartre calls the
               “practico-inert,” or the matter in which past praxis is stuck by a “reifying
               sociality” (67, 318). It is this automatized sociality that leads Verezzi to prefer
               Julia to Matilda, even though the Narrator concedes that what he prefers is Julia’s
               “image” (116). Interestingly, the Narrator goes so far as to note “a comparison
               between [Matilda] and Julia” (84); and hence in the next novel, <title level="m">St.
                  Irvyne</title>, the lovely Megalena quickly deteriorates from being a Julia to
               being a Matilda. Indeed the Gothic insistently marks its conventionalism, its
               badness, as a way of breaking the moulds into which it is forced.</p>
<p> For Shelley such deformations of “poetry” occur in “periods of the decay of social
               life,” such as the one he describes after the Restoration, when “vice,” “weakness,”
               and “obscenity” take over (<title level="m">Defence</title> 520-1): an account that
               applies equally to the depraved world of Italy and Bohemia in the Gothic novels.
               Symbolic art is just as frequently limited by its bad determinacy as it is expanded
               by an indeterminacy that allows for the development of the idea which Ginotti’s
               dream-vision gestures towards. Yet such determinacy is what Jameson calls a “symbolic
               resolution”: a temporary overriding of contradictions, without which negativity could
               not be invested in the work of history (<title level="m">Political
                  Unconscious</title> 77-80). And it is only through this investment that art
               remains responsible to the cultural unconscious, or to what is left out in its
               attempt to classically domicile the Idea or romantically defer it into the infinite
               future. We see this investment in history in Shelley’s novels. Indeed in <title level="m">The Defence</title> Shelley’s description of the decayed history he
               despises is strikingly Gothic. The “obscenity” of the Restoration, he says, “is a
               monster for which the corruption of society for ever brings forth new food, which it
               devours in secret” (521). And yet this supposed monster recalls the earlier
               description of poetry as “replenishing” imagination “with thoughts of ever new
               delight . . . which form new interstices whose void for ever craves fresh food”
               (517).</p>
<p>In short, Hegel lets us think a dialectic that circulates imagination between its
               premature hypostasis in the Symbolic, and withdraws it as “spirit” from the concepts
               that limit it so as to think it once more. In its disfiguration of the Romantic Idea
               the Gothic is thus part of the work of the negative, whether as a transitional
               negation of Romanticism’s tendency to settle into aesthetic ideology, or as an
               untransformed potentiality aware of its traumatic core. Conceived on this model, the
                  <emph>work</emph> of art is not form or hypostasis, but “configuration,” “the work
               on form, the deformation of form” as much as its “formation” (Carroll 29, 39). As
               such, even in its positivity it requires what Žižek calls an “anamorphic” reading,
               able to release the underlying negativity of its bad and untrue clichés. In “Kantian
               terms,” as Žižek puts it, such a reading would allow “us to discern an apparently
               positive object as a ‘negative magnitude,’” to see even a character such as Nempere
               or Zastrozzi as the “‘mere positivization of a void’” (<title level="m">Plague</title> 97).</p>
<p> In conclusion let me then sketch three versions of the relation between the Romantic
               and its Gothic disfiguration that attempt to deal with the return of the moment of
               Symbolic blockage staged in Shelley’s early Gothic novels: a return more fully
               detailed in other essays in this volume. In <title level="m">Prometheus</title> the
               Gothic is no more than a concessive clause. Shelley grants the Romanticism of an Idea
               that cannot be embodied in existing forms when Prometheus and Asia retire to a cave
               after their marriage, to dwell “Like human babes in their brief innocence”
               (II.iii.33). At the same time the means used to end the Jovian age in the present are
               crudely Gothic. For if Demogorgon is a metaphysical principle or Idea “devoid of
               shape” (Hegel <title level="m">Aesthetics</title> I.363), in order to act in time he
               becomes Jove’s son. The bad and untrue determinacy of this positing of the negative
               is then reflected in the brutality with which he overthrows Jove: a violence at odds
               with the Promethean reign of peace. Hence Shelley, who as Asia has insisted on
               converting Demogorgon’s cryptic words into a project of Reason and freedom, admits
               that Jove may rise again, offering a variety of “spells” to deal with him (IV.562-9),
               which are no more than what Kant would call rational ideas.</p>
<p> Nevertheless in <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> Shelley manages to
               segregate the Romantic from its Gothic disfiguration. In fact the Gothicism of Jove’s
               downfall reduces to a cliché the unreadable matrix that the play approaches in the
               figure of Demogorgon. More tangled is <title level="m">Alastor</title>, which
               conflates the Gothic and Romantic. In the opening, the Narrator invokes the Muse of
               the Greater Romantic Lyric, only to speak of himself as a “desperate Alchymist” who
               has made his “bed / In charnels and coffins” (23-5). At the end, having failed to
               make the Poet credible, he ends with a disconnected outburst on the elixir of life
               and the Wandering Jew, describing himself as a “dark magician . . . raking the
               cinders of a crucible” (682-4), and appealing to “Medea’s wondrous alchemy” (672).
               This Gothic self-representation is matched by the Narrator’s lurid figure of the
               Poet, whose “divinest lineaments” are “Worn by the senseless wind” (704-5), as if he
               foresees the body of the Poet, whose grave was “ a pyramid / Of mouldering leaves”
               decaying, his skin and bones blown round and literally caught on the thorns of life
               (53-4). And yet the Poet is also referred to Romantically as a “surpassing Spirit”
               (714), a beautiful soul whose inwardness transcends materiality.</p>
<p>
<title level="m">Alastor</title> is Shelley’s autonarration of his unsettled
               relationship to “poetry” as “subjective poetry,” which Browning in his essay on
               Shelley describes as the “<emph>Ideas</emph> of Plato, seeds of creation, lying
               burningly on the Divine Hand” (63-7). Yet the “frail” figure of the Poet (<title level="m">Alastor</title> 687) cannot bear this Romanticization, which has become
               part of the practico-inert. Indeed the Poet seems disconnected from the “image” of
               him that the Narrator constructs (661). For the depopulated global landscape through
               which he moves, the perilous journey he takes in his drunken boat, and the tattered
               scenery of a Nature that Shelley cannot put into a Wordsworthian frame, all point to
               a more modern conception of poetry as sifting through the waste land of culture that
               would emerge later with Rimbaud, Nerval and Baudelaire. <title level="m">Alastor</title> is thus hysterically split between the Romantic “spirit” of
               poetry, and its de-jection into the Gothic as a “peculiar cultural space into which
               the horrors generated by early modern cultural changes . . . can be ‘thrown under’”
               or abjected, as Jerrold Hogle puts it (178): cast off but also cast into a future
               “crucible” whose void “for ever craves fresh food” (<title level="m">Alastor</title>
               683; <title level="m">Defence</title> 517).</p>
<p> Nevertheless in <title level="m">Alastor</title> the Gothic is more a defacement of
               the Romantic than it is the creative matrix suggested by the word “crucible” (624).
               Finally, in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life </title>Shelley’s Gothicism shows
               itself first in the defacement of Rousseau, whom “Shelley” initially encounters in
               the vegetable form of an “old root which grew / To strange distortion” (182-3), and
               then in the disfiguration of the Shape all light, the figure for the dawn of a new
               revolutionary era. It would be easy to see the Shape in the Car as punishing the
               idealism of the Romantic shape, and the poem as demystifying <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound,</title> where Asia, after her missed encounter with the
               Symbolic matrix of the play in the Cave of Demogorgon, romantically bounds off the
               Chariot of the Hour driven by the spirit with a “dreadful countenance” from the one
               guided by a spirit with the “dove-like eyes of hope” (II.iv.142-62). Returning to
               this scene of the chariots through the Car of Life, Shelley’s last poem unleashes a
               different hour in which the two perspectives on the second coming of the
               world-historical spirit can no longer be separated. Nevertheless the ensuing
               dis-integration releases an energy as powerful as the beauty of the Shape was
               lethargic, for the “crew” dance “like atomies . . . / Within a sunbeam” (444-6),
               while Rousseau “plunge[s]” into the future (467) with a blindness that is the very
               condition for the deconstructive creativity thrown off and around the Car in whose
               disaster he urges “Shelley” to participate as “actor or victim” rather than
               “spectator” (305-6). Shelley describes this “restless fermentation” of “Life” in
               terms of a Symbolic pre-maturity when he compares the Car to “the young moon,” which
               bears “As the herald of its coming . . . / The ghost of her dead Mother, whose dim
               form / Bends in dark aether from her infant’s chair” (79-85). In this Gothic
               unfolding of the beautiful simile of the moon, history becomes a “process without a
                  <foreign>telos</foreign> or a subject” (Althusser 91-8). For the dead mother
               shrouds a chair that may be empty, since the lines refer only to the infant’s chair.
               Moreover, she bends “from,” not over, the chair, as if brought down by this second
               coming of an infant power whose advent is or was expected, but whom we do not
               see.</p>
<p> Yet it is notable how simile follows simile, or how one simulation enfolds another,
               such that “veil after veil [is] undrawn” (<title level="m">Defence</title> 528),
               without any adequate embodiment of a phenomenon that has neither “form nor outline.”
               For like the “sun’s image” reflected in a well, which is then brought into focus and
               perceived as the “shape all light” (<title level="m">Triumph</title> 345-52), the
               young moon contains another figure: the dead mother bending from her infant’s chair.
               This composite simile is then displaced by a further likeness, as the slouching
               mother becomes “the dusky hood and double cape” shrouding a shape that is now
               unnaturally old rather than young: “as one whom years deform” (87-90). “Figures ever
               new” are cast off in the cinematography of the poem (248), which commingles the
               beautiful, the sublime, and the repellent. “Shelley” wants to arrange these figures
               to distinguish various phases of the procession: the Car at the centre, and in front
               the leaders, while an anonymous crowd brings up the rear (101, 131-8). Because the
               core experience for him is the Shape’s disenchantment, “Shelley” also wants to level
               the difference between those who lead and those who follow, dismissing “All but the
               sacred few” as a “deluded crew” (128, 184). He asks himself why “all” is “here amiss”
               and does not hear the irony when a voice answers “Life!” (178-80).</p>
<p> But the scene is in fact a moving army of differences, metaphors and metonymies. At
               the end the poem is taken over by Bosch-like scenes of “vampire bats” and “vultures”
               sitting on the tiaras of “pontiffs” (484-505), what Shelley in the <title level="m">Defence</title> describes as the “utter anarchy and darkness” that sometimes
               threaten to engulf poetry (523). But since the manuscript of <title level="m">The
                  Triumph of Life</title> omits quotation marks, we cannot know if this segment
               marks Rousseau’s renunciation of his idealism, or is spoken by the Thel-like
                  “Shelley.”<note xml:id="ftn11" place="foot" resp="editors" n="11">The manuscript
                  does not contain quotation marks, which were added by Mary Shelley so as to create
                  a reading text, and retained by Donald H. Reiman with slight alterations that
                  often have unscrutinized consequences. Thus we do not always know whether to
                  attribute particular lines to Rousseau or “Shelley,” or where the breaks between
                  the lines of the two speakers occur. On this subject see Rajan, <title level="m">The Supplement of Reading</title> (332-35, 346-48). As regards the infernal
                  vision with which the poem ends, Reiman attributes everything after l. 300 to
                  Rousseau. But one could argue that “Shelley” again becomes the speaker after l.
                  469 (the description of Dante) or after l. 480.</note> Moreover, just as the
               leaders include figures as different as Plato and Caesar, so too the ribald crowd is
               metamorphically imaged through bats and apes, but also “elves / Danc[ing] in a
               thousand unimagined shapes” (490-1). Indeed this last segment is prefaced by a
               reference to Dante and described as “a wonder worthy of his rhyme” (469-80), though
               what follows is hardly wondrous in any conventional sense. The scene, in other words,
               is one of degeneration and entropy, yet harbours a strange vitality. Its logic is not
               Dante’s serial logic of Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso, but combines all three “in
               the chaos of a cyclic poem” (<title level="m">Defence</title> 512), whose “rotary
               motion” is figured in the wheel of the Car and the cyclic form of the poem itself,
               which returns upon and into itself through its folding of figure within figure. In
               this chaos, Shelley can no longer insulate “the form and the splendour of unfaded
               beauty” from “the secrets of anatomy and corruption” (531), nor protect literature
               from a cultural and political debasement that “eats out the poetry” from history so
               as to rethink both poetry and history as a void that forever craves fresh food (515,
               517). Instead he lets down his ladder “into the foul rag and bone shop of the heart”
               (Yeats 391-2), finding the crucible of a disastrous creativity in this space into
               which the horrors of early modern culture have been cast off.</p>

<div type="abstract">
<p rend="noCount">This volume brings together essays from Japan, China, Taiwan, and
                    Korea to offer an unprecedented view of English Romanticism’s presence in the
                    modern literature and literary criticism of East Asia. Going beyond simply
                    tracing the influence of English Romantic writing on East Asian writers and
                    critics, each essay reveals an intrinsic and often surprising interconnectedness
                    in the Romantic aesthetics and mode of thought across the borders of East and
                    West. This collection’s reflection on English Romanticism through the historical
                    particularities of East Asian nations at the onset of modernity sheds light on
                    Romanticism as a still valid form of cultural critique against the shared yet
                    divergent forms, experiences, and questions of modernity.</p>

<div type="section">
<head> Three Vignettes: English Romanticism and Asian Modernity</head>
<p>East Asian countries, traditionally belonging to a common “Chinese character
                        cultural sphere,” have shared the same written sign to refer to the
                        “Romantic”: 浪漫. The origin of this word is the French
                            <foreign>roman</foreign>, which the Japanese began to transcribe
                        phonetically with these very Chinese characters in the late nineteenth
                        century. Inscribed within the word itself is the history of East Asia’s
                        import of Romanticism from European cultures. To break ground on what may be
                        a bewilderingly large project, I begin this introduction to English
                        Romanticism in East Asia with three figurative junctures in the literary
                        histories of China, Japan, and Korea. These synecdochic sketches, each
                        showing an archetypal Romantic figure taking root in a new host and mutating
                        into an uncanny form of revolution, melancholy, or rebellion, evoke some of
                        the main historical and aesthetic issues that entailed the presence of
                        Romanticism in the modern imagination of East Asia. </p>

<p>Lu Xun<note place="foot"> Throughout the volume, the personal names of all
                            writers and critics of Asian nationality will be marked in their
                            original form—the family name preceding the given name. The names of the
                            contributors to this volume will be the only exception, following the
                            English convention for index purposes.</note> (1881–1936), one of the
                        most influential writers of twentieth-century China, is well known for
                        writing novels that embody the trials of a nation undergoing radical
                        transformation. Not many know that he was also one of the most important
                        translators of modern China, committed to translating Marxist literary
                        theories to define himself as a leftist intellectual in the midst of
                        vigorous debates on revolutionary literature. In his essay “‘Hard
                        Translation’ and the ‘Class Character of Literature’” (1930), Lu Xun cuts a
                        unique figure for the translator: <quote>To chew and anatomize the enemy now
                            seems inevitable, but if we have a book of anatomy and a book of cuisine
                            to guide our practice, then the structure [for anatomy] and the taste
                            [for chewing] can be clearer and better. People like to compare

</quote> Casting the translator
                        into a Promethean figure, Lu Xun not only redefines the role of the Chinese
                        translator in modern China but also reshapes the Promethean figure by
                        dislocating it from the Western context. The Promethean translator steals
                        fire from foreign countries not merely to pass it on to Chinese readers; he
                        uses the fire to cook his own flesh, making it more palatable to both
                        himself and the readers. As Wang Pu astutely notes, “[c]ooking one’s own
                        body with the foreign fire and tasting one’s own cooked flesh is evidently
                        an allegorical scenario of meticulous self-criticism and self-dissemination”
                        (333). Lu Xun’s self-annihilating translator emerges from a rigorous
                        criticism of the revolutionary possibilities of simply transplanting foreign
                        ideas to the Chinese consciousness. The corporeality of the cannibalistic
                        allegory overrides and distorts the enlightened idealism of the rebellious
                        Prometheus, echoing Mary Shelley’s perversion of Percy Shelley’s
                        revolutionary idealism through the monstrous creation of her modern
                        Prometheus. However, the self-sacrifice and martyrdom of Lu Xun’s translator
                        go beyond Romantic self-criticism or self-ironization in the vein of Mary
                        Shelley or even Byron. The near Eucharistic practice of the translator
                        suggests the possibility of benevolence and common good after a painful
                        trial of self-sacrifice. </p>
<p>Lu Xun’s Promethean translator embodies the predicament of a nation for which
                        opening up to the modern culture of the West meant doing away with a
                        four-thousand-year-old tradition. At the turn of the century, China could no
                        longer ignore pressures both internal and external to modernize, compelled
                        to remake itself into a modern nation while defending itself against foreign
                        aggression. The Chinese Revolution of 1911, also known as the Xinhai
                        Revolution, allowed the Chinese people to overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and
                        establish the Republic of China. The Japanese writer Natsume Soseki likened
                        this event to the French Revolution, feeling the terror of witnessing the
                        revolutionary spirit quickly translating to violent upheaval and radical
                        break with the past—a lesson in historical feeling that the British knew
                        well, as noted by Soseki (Hiyama 44). That Lu Xun’s Prometheus steals a
                        “foreign” fire, however, marks a crucial difference between Eastern and
                        Western histories of modernization: modernity for the East was a condition
                        shaped by essentially extraneous and often dissonant forces while modernity
                        for the West was comparatively a condition of internal necessity and
                        voluntary progress. With rapid import of Western ideas and technologies,
                        ever intensified by such cultural reform movements as the May Fourth and New
                        Culture Movements, tradition had become an excessive vestige that needed to
                        be either removed from or incorporated into the process of modernization. Lu
                        Xun’s vehement condemnation of those foreigners who opposed China’s
                        Westernization in order to protect the exotic culture of the natives was
                        already a sign that the natives could no longer view their tradition
                        divorced from the larger historical milieu. The radical self-renovation of
                        the Promethean translator, who “cooks” his own consciousness with foreign
                        thought in order to transform Chinese culture into a much more consumable
                        form, is in line with Lu Xun’s belief that the right way to China’s
                        modernity lies in actively reorganizing and renewing tradition itself.
                        Burning one’s flesh and offering it up for people’s nourishment are the
                        price to pay for China’s modernization.</p>

<p>Natsume Soseki (1867–1916) is a writer without whom the discussion of modern
                        Japanese literature would be severely circumscribed. Well-versed in
                        Japanese, Chinese, and English literatures, Soseki<note place="foot">Born
                            Natsume Kinnosuke, the novelist took on the pen name of Soseki in
                            1889.</note> was acutely attentive to the state of Japanese literature
                        in the context of international literary milieu. One of his earlier novels,
                            <title level="m">Kusamakura</title> (literally meaning “grass pillow”),
                        is exemplary of the novelist’s modern consciousness. The novel, published in
                        1906, is a <foreign>Künstlerroman</foreign> composed of the inner
                        reflections and thought experiments of a young artist who goes on a walking
                        trip through the mountains and stays at a remote hot spring inn where he
                        meets a woman named Nami. The opening scene of the novel presents the artist
                        contemplating on the perfect artistic vision through which life becomes art:
                        “You have only to conjure up the world before you, and there you will find a
                        living poem, a fount of song. No need to commit your thoughts to paper—the
                        heart will already sing with a sweet inner euphony. No need to stand before
                        your easel and limn with brush and paint—the world’s vast array of forms and
                        colors already sparkles within the inner eye” (4). However, this
                        transcendental vision of unity is broken when the artist slips on a loose
                        piece of rock and ends up on his bottom. The artist’s rude awakening to the
                        physicality of the solitary walk and the ensuing reveries bring to light the
                        difficulty of life and art, which also colors his perception of a skylark
                        that “suddenly bursts into song” beneath his feet in a valley (6). As in
                        Shelley’s poem “To a Skylark,” which incidentally “leaps to my [the
                        artist’s] mind” upon hearing the skylark’s song, the unseen bird fills the
                        air with a song that soars along with the creature high up into the clouds
                        (6–7). However, Soseki’s skylark is far less ethereal and otherworldly than
                        Shelley’s in that the artist exerts his imagination to envision a bird
                        tumbling in the valley: “Then I imagine the tumbling skylark crossing paths
                        with another as it rises. My final thought is that, whether falling or
                        rising or crossing midair, the wild, vigorous song of the skylark would
                        never for an instant cease” (6). The arduousness of the artist’s climb and
                        the skylark’s flight deflects the transcendental power of the artist’s
                        imagination and the skylark’s song, and what may have been a seamless flight
                        of mental association between the skylark’s song and Shelley’s poem is
                        skewed by the recitation of a fragment from Shelley’s “To a Skylark,” which
                        the artist struggles to remember: <quote>
<lg>
<l>We look before and after</l>
<l> And pine for what is not:</l>
<l>Our sincerest laughter</l>
<l> With some pain is fraught;</l>
<l>Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.
                                    (Soseki 7)</l>
</lg>
</quote> This quotation is a strange representation of Shelley, who
                        momentarily dwells here on the pain and sadness of life transcended by the
                        skylark’s song. Soseki’s emphasis falls on the other, darker side of
                        Shelley’s uplifting vision, recalling for the artist a common expression
                        found in Chinese poetry: “a hundredweight of sorrows” (7). Heightened by the
                        hyperbolic expression of sorrow, the poignant conclusion reached by the
                        artist is that “poets are great sufferers; they seem to have more than
                        double the nervous sensitivity of the average person” (7). </p>
<p>Compared to China’s history, Japan’s process of modernization was relatively
                        gradual and voluntary. Japan abandoned its isolationist policy with the
                        advent of the Meiji era in 1868, after which the nation worked actively to
                        Westernize its governmental system and social and cultural practices. Soseki
                        was a beneficiary of Japan’s modernization policy, being granted a
                        government scholarship to study in London for two years. Ironically, what
                        Soseki gleaned from the overseas experience, at the price of a nervous
                        breakdown due to intense loneliness in a foreign city, was a clearer vision
                        of Japan’s national character and historical fate in relation to the West.
                        Soseki criticizes Japan’s idolization of the West as the common evil of a
                        “forgetful” people intent on imitating the West in the name of progress
                        (Hiyama 25–26). Putting the Chinese classics, which he had studied since
                        boyhood, into perspective against English literature, Soseki also realizes
                        that the two literatures are so radically different as to defy common
                        categorization. Ruptures are formed in Soseki’s double consciousness, and it
                        is out of these ruptures that a true understanding of what is Japanese or
                        Eastern is gained. As seen in the scene from <title level="m">Kusamakura</title> above, the aesthetic vision of a Japanese artist
                        emerges in genuine form only after he awakens from his “forgetfulness” in
                        Shelleyan transcendentalism. What little Shelley the artist can quote from
                        memory is not quite so transcendental or sublime, but with this Shelley the
                        expression taken from Chinese poetry rings more authentic. The rest of the
                        novel, written in Haiku style, explores the uniquely Japanese consciousness
                        of “non-sentiment,” a way of considering sentiment as a thing of nature
                        rather than human (Hiyama 83). Soseki’s “unforgetting” is a sign of negative
                        resistance to Western dominance, exposing Japan’s mock modernity under the
                        Western-oriented regime of the Meiji era while bring the East into relief
                        against the West. </p>

<p>Yun Dong-ju (1917–1945), it is safe to say, is one of the most popular poets
                        in modern Korea, known for his lyricism and spirit of resistance underlying
                        a unique body of anti-colonial poetry. With his posthumous collection of
                        poems entitled <title level="m">Sky, Wind, Star and Poetry</title> (1948), Yun
                        also makes a mark in the tradition of Korean Romantic literature, one trend
                        of which was revolutionary and politically radical (Park 28–52). The
                        following poem “Liver” (1941) is one from the collection, written when
                        colonial aggression was growing ever more heavy-handed with Japan’s wartime mobilization:<quote>

</l>
</lg>
</quote> This poem is a strange amalgam of the Prometheus myth and
                        a popular Korean folktale. Like the Romantic Prometheus, the rabbit in the
                        Korean fable symbolizes resistance against oppressive power. The rabbit is
                        lured by the tortoise with promises of great riches to the dragon king’s
                        underwater palace only to discover that the king is in dire need of a
                        rabbit’s liver to cure his deathly illness. The quick-witted rabbit fibs to
                        the king that rabbits hide their precious livers in secret places and that
                        he will quickly retrieve his if the king would allow him a trip back
                        aboveground. Of course, the rabbit runs away as soon as he reaches land, and
                        his clever trick has traditionally been associated with the powerless
                        peasants’ survival tactic against despotic authority. In Yun’s poetic remake
                        of the traditional folklore, the tortoise stands for Japanese colonial
                        power, to which the speaker stands up defiantly. If the wet liver preserved
                        and guarded by the rabbit alludes to the unwavering spirit of autonomy, the
                        starved eagle is less the Promethean symbol of punitive authority than a
                        historically marked figure for the colonized people’s desire for liberation.
                        The rabbit escaping from the Caucasus Mountains reinforces the cause of
                        liberty by bringing the two stories of rebellion together in hybridized
                        form. </p>
<p>However, the hybridity between traditional and foreign narratives also
                        exposes the double bind in which the colonized speaker finds him- or
                        herself—a situation in which neither Korean tradition nor Western thought
                        can have resistant power against Japanese oppression. As seen in the last
                        stanza of Yun’s poem, Prometheus is found in an alien context, paying for
                        his sin by drowning in the sea with a millstone around his neck. The fall of
                        Prometheus is figured forth in biblical terms, but the allusion to the
                        undersea menace in the Korean folklore is also clear. Prometheus’s
                        foreignness becomes noticeable as he fails to emerge as the universal symbol
                        of resistance and liberation. Prometheus’s despair is that of the wasted
                        speaker’s—the one whose defiant act of feeding the salvaged liver to the
                        eagle does not quite square with his rebellious tone against the tortoise.
                        Both Prometheus and the speaker find their acts of defiance missing the mark
                        in this strange wonderland of mixed-and-matched tales. Such impotence is the
                        plight of the colonized Koreans, whose history of modernization and
                        Westernization significantly overlapped with their colonial history.
                        Prometheus’s theft and the rabbit’s wit, seen out of its original context,
                        can even call the legitimacy of the rebel’s defiance into question,
                        obscuring the fact that the original thief and trickster is the tortoise.
                        For a people whose liberation “came like a thief in the night” at the end of
                        World War II (Kim 499), not much was in its power to change against the
                        throes of imperialist world history. Yun may have read and been inspired by
                        Shelley’s <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> as an English major at
                        Yeonhui College in Korea and Doshisha University in Japan (Park 44). He
                        certainly lived a Shelleyan life, finishing his short life of twenty-eight
                        years in prison for anti-Japanese activities. Yet, his Prometheus remains
                        bound and fallen as the unclaimed liver is fed to the eagle starved for
                        liberation. </p>

<head>Opening a Dialogue: Romanticism beyond East and West</head>
<p>Lu Xun’s reengagement with the past, Soseki’s interiorization of the artistic
                        spirit, Yun’s struggle for freedom and justice—these are responses
                        hauntingly similar to those of English Romantics towards the onset of
                        modernity a century ago during the Enlightenment era. It is no simple
                        coincidence that the three “national” writers of East Asia rigorously
                        employed the literary figures and works of English Romanticism in coming to
                        terms with their experiences of loss and change in the face of radical
                        historical rupture. Yi Zheng, in her study of the modern sublime in Chinese
                        literature, grounds her idea of the “commensurability” between British and
                        Chinese aesthetics of the sublime on a “shared modern history” (3). The
                        three vignettes above suggest that this commensurability may extend to
                        Europe and Asia, West and East. From this broader perspective, we can
                        historically verify that reaction to modernity is an intrinsic part of the
                        literary and cultural phenomenon we know as Romanticism. As Löwy and Sayre
                        argue, “Romanticism is a modern critique of modernity”—that is, “the
                        Romantic view constitutes modernity’s self-criticism” (21). Romanticism is
                        not just <emph>against</emph> modernity but <emph>of</emph> modernity,
                        offering a critique of modernity from within modernity itself. As long as
                        modernity retains the capability of self-reflection, Romanticism will
                        continue to be a valid form of cultural critique beyond spatial and temporal
                        boundaries. Thomas Pfau and Robert Mitchell have noted that this element of
                        self-criticism is what makes the conceptualization of Romanticism
                        particularly difficult: “Romanticism’s marked ambivalence and resistance to
                        decisive conceptualization arise from the fact that it simultaneously
                        extends the project of European modernity while offering itself as a
                        sustained critical reflection on that very process” (267). The ambivalence
                        and difficulty of defining Romanticism are certainly exacerbated by
                        exploring its instantiation in multiple forms, circumstances, and
                        articulations of modernity. However, such historically diverse explorations
                        should also offer new possibilities for understanding the complexities and
                        urgencies of Romanticism. </p>
<p>The Romantic consciousness of East Asian writers is a product of East Asian
                        modernity. The term “modernization,” along with “Westernization,” is the
                        more customary and perhaps more critically apt way of referring to that
                        historical phase in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century when
                        Western thought and way of life were quickly saturating and tangibly
                        supplanting the traditional ways of the East. The political and cultural
                        resistance, which we can detect in the three authors above, is symptomatic
                        of an acute sense of asymmetry between West and East in the political agency
                        and cultural influences asserted by the two powers as their histories
                        intertwined ever more closely in the context of global politics and economy.
                        Some critics, like Tani E. Barlow, call Asian modernity “colonial,” which in
                        truth spawns confusion and alarm about the obfuscation between actual and
                        virtual colonialisms, but there is an element of truth in finding the common
                        ground of Asian modernity in the colonial. As suggested by the concept of
                        “semi-colonialism,” used by Lenin and Mao to explain the state of nations,
                        like China, that officially preserved juridical independence but was de
                        facto controlled by Western imperialist powers, the question of coloniality
                        in East Asia is not confined to matters of juridical autonomy.<note place="foot">For many critics of East Asian studies, this is one of the
                            main points on which the postcolonial critique of Asian history breaks
                            paths with Anglo-Indian postcolonialism (Barlow 4–5).</note> In the case
                        of China and Taiwan, the civil war in mainland China and the eventual
                        separation of the two states were the consequences of severe internal
                        conflicts overdetermined by an ideological war between communism and
                        republicanism—the two mainstays of modern nation-building founded on Western
                        political thought. The more perplexing case would belong to Japan, which had
                        maintained autonomy against European aggression only to be a major contender
                        in the Western imperialist powers’ race toward the acquisition of Asian
                        colonies. Japanese imperialism was heavily grounded on the idea of building
                        “one Asia”—a modern form of Eastern civilization in the likes of modern
                        Europe—thereby marking its difference from and resistance to Western
                        imperialism while ideologically inheriting the expansionist vision. Korea,
                        like other nations colonized by Japan, became a scapegoat of conflicting
                        imperialist interests between East and West and could not separate its
                        process of Westernization from Japan’s colonial projects. Whether Korea’s
                        modernization is indebted to Japanese rule is still under vigorous debate,
                        but it is undeniable that Korean modernity constitutes a prominent part of
                        Asia’s colonial modernity. That the Koreans had to adjust abruptly to the
                        modern nation-state system and resort to the Western notion of national
                        sovereignty for their fight against imperialist aggression is another sign
                        that Asia’s connection to the Western form of modernity is always vexed and
                        double-sided.</p>
<p>What becomes clear here is that the Enlightenment project originating in the
                        West had decidedly far-reaching consequences in fulfilling its totalitarian
                        nature across the globe. As Horkheimer and Adorno claim, Enlightenment is
                        inherently totalitarian whereby knowledge is power and “[t]he awakening of
                        the subject is bought with the recognition of power as the principle of all
                        relationships” (5). The form of power relation itself changes as
                        “Enlightenment dissolves away the injustice of the old inequality of
                        unmediated mastery, but at the same time perpetuates it in universal
                        mediation, by relating every existing thing to every other” (8). The notion
                        that unjust power relations are perpetuated by the universal
                        commensurability and conformity of all existing things becomes the
                        philosophical grounds for acknowledging the commensurability between Western
                        and Eastern modernities under the aegis of Enlightenment. What I hope our
                        exploration of English Romanticism in East Asia may suggest is that the
                        Romantic mindset serves as a universally applicable antidote to a
                        totalitarian system of knowledge and power. Romanticism emerges as one form
                        of Enlightenment’s self-criticism, bringing into critical discourse a
                        Kantian insistence on universal hospitality and cosmopolitan right against
                        the aggravation of global wars and colonial violence.<note place="foot">It
                            is not coincidental that Kant in “Toward Perpetual Peace” points to
                            China and Japan as examples of a nation exercising universal hospitality
                            by authorizing the foreigner the right to visit—not to enter and stay as
                            had the peoples of the Americas, Africa, Southeast Asia, and India
                            (329). China and Japan had been defending themselves against the
                            aggressions of the Dutch, Portuguese, and British, and Kant singles out
                            Japan for successfully fending off colonial powers by limiting its
                            international relations to commercial trade with the Dutch, who were
                            excluded from any other forms of interaction with the natives
                            (330).</note> Asia’s critical adoption of the Romantic standpoint in
                        response to different historical exigencies ultimately testifies to the
                        intrinsically historical consciousness of Romanticism. It is the
                        interconnectedness rather than the commonality or homogeneity among diverse
                        forms of modernity and its discontents that should emerge through such a
                        global scope of inquiry. Far from erasing historical differences and local
                        particularities, rethinking East and West and their relationship through the
                        prism of Romanticism will allow us to contemplate the shared
                            <emph>and</emph> divergent forms, experiences, and questions of
                        modernity.</p>
<p>The following collection of essays from Japan, China, Taiwan, and Korea is
                        the first attempt to explore English Romanticism in East Asia in a
                        multinational and cross-cultural context. The history of each nation’s
                        reception of English Romanticism has mostly been studied locally in isolated
                        form, and the scope of these studies varies widely for each nation. Japan
                        has the longest history of the literary reception of English Romanticism and
                        the critical investigation of this reception history. The first anthology of
                        English poetry translated into Japanese was published in 1882 under the
                        title <title level="m">Shintai-shisho</title> (<title level="m">New-Style
                            Poetry</title>), which soon after instigated scholarly interest in
                        English Romanticism in Japan. Critical interest in Japan’s reception of
                        English Romantic literature bloomed after World War II, with Matsuura Tohru
                        producing the earliest study on Keats in Japan in 1959. Reception studies in
                        Japan have become strikingly popular in the last decade or two, and English
                        publications on the subject have recently been on the rise—Okada on Keats
                        (2006), Clark and Suzuki on Blake (2006), and Vallins et al. on Coleridge
                        (2013). In China, occasional discussions of foreign literature’s impact on
                        Chinese literature began to surface in the 1940s, but a systematic study of
                        reception history did not take off until the late 1990s and has continually
                        been on the rise since the 2000s. Leo Lee’s work on the Romantic writers of
                        modern China (1973) has been influential in understanding English
                        Romanticism’s impact on modern China’s political and cultural movements.
                        Taiwan and Korea have come relatively late into the field of reception
                        studies, having yet to produce sustained criticisms on how English
                        Romanticism influenced their respective national literatures.<note place="foot"> Taiwanese scholars Wu Ya-feng and Wang Chih-ming have
                            written essays on English Romantic studies and foreign literary studies
                            emerging in Taiwan in the middle of the twentieth century. Studies of
                            Korea’s reception of English Romantic literature have been performed
                            sporadically by scholars of Korean literature. I would like to thank all
                            of our contributors for this historical overview of English
                            Romanticism’s reception studies in East Asia.</note> What I hope this
                        volume of the Praxis Series will achieve is to open a new critical sphere
                        where more rigorous and integrated discussions of Romanticism within Asia
                        and across Eastern-Western borders can take place. These efforts will not
                        only help us to relativize and historicize our understanding of Romanticism;
                        they will also lay the foundation for a much-needed conversation among Asian
                        nations toward a more serious and less ideologically inflected reflection on
                        their intricately connected histories of modernization. </p>
<p>This volume of the Praxis Series presents select papers from the NASSR
                        Supernumerary Conference that took place under the theme “Romantic
                        Connections” in June 2014 at the University of Tokyo, Japan. The national
                        and thematic diversity of these papers contributes to a comparative
                        understanding of the different historical and aesthetic issues faced by
                        Japan, China, Taiwan, and Korea with the onset of modernity. Mie Gotoh’s
                        opening essay focuses on the poets of Meiji Japan and their invention of
                        modern landscape, arguing that Keats’s poetry provided crucial momentum for
                        the development of “a new phenomenology of landscape through a new mode of
                        seeing.” For the Meiji poets, this meant a turn towards the inner self,
                        which not only inflected their modes of perceiving nature and the outer
                        world but also transformed Japan’s poetic language into a vehicle for a more
                        “real” landscape. According to Gotoh, these epistemological and formal
                        changes reflect the historical transition Japanese poetry underwent in the
                        late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when the poets were
                        developing a modern aesthetics by appropriating Western literature as well
                        as recasting the traditional influence of Chinese classics. </p>
<p>Ou Li’s essay, in contrast, discusses the influence of Keats on the poets of
                        modern China and contextualizes the shifting implication of Keats’s poetics
                        in the tumultuous history of twentieth-century China. The discord between
                        Keats’s so-called escapist aestheticism and China’s violent political and
                        ideological upheavals makes for a particularly complex case of interaction
                        between the original text and its foreign context. Marking the three
                        distinctive stages of Keats’s reception in China, Li demonstrates how Keats
                        continued to affect China’s literary imagination and the making of its
                        modern literature by surviving the oppressive mood of the Mao regime and
                        satisfying the need for a literature that transcends political ideology. Li
                        attributes this tenacious appeal of Keats to the “multi-faceted richness and
                        indeterminacy achieved by his remarkable sympathetic imagination and honesty
                        about the human condition”—something that becomes clear through Keats’s long
                        afterlife on foreign soil. </p>
<p>In Terence H. W. Shih’s essay, we learn how English Romanticism was
                        transmitted from mainland China to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War
                        between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang and the consequent withdrawal
                        of the latter’s Republic of China to Taiwan in 1949. Following the life and
                        legacy of Hsu Chih-Mo, a.k.a. “the Chinese Shelley,” Shih traces the course
                        in which Percy Shelley’s radical spirit affected Hsu’s poetry and eventually
                        had a wider repercussion through the political and poetic influence that
                        Hsu’s writing exerted on Taiwan’s student movements and campus ballads. The
                        campus ballad is a uniquely Romantic genre of musical songs, which inspired
                        a sense of freedom and national identity in the young people of Taiwan and
                        allowed them an imaginative space of autonomy against a history of colonial
                        rule, the threats of communist China, and the authoritarian regime of the
                        Kuomintang. </p>
<p>Through the last two essays in this volume, we can compare how modern
                        literary criticism developed under the influence of English Romanticism in
                        Japan and Korea, whose inextricable historical ties prompted interesting
                        connections in their critical histories. Yoshikazu Suzuki’s essay explores
                        early Keats scholarship in Japan through the works of three main scholars:
                        Saito Takeshi, Sato Kiyoshi, and Hinatsu Kohnosuke. Saito set the tone for
                        Keats criticism in Japan with his keen attention to the form and language of
                        Keats’s poetry and a rigorous method of scholarship. While Saito found the
                        significance of Keats’s aesthetics in its humanistic spirit based on
                        Christian ethics, Sato and Hinatsu were more attuned to a critique of
                        national literature through and against Keats. Sato was the more politically
                        conscious of the two, discovering in English Romanticism a love for freedom,
                        which he believed should serve to strengthen the national literature of
                        Japan as the well as the national spirit of the Korean students he was
                        teaching at Keijo Imperial University in occupied Korea. Hinatsu’s national
                        consciousness emerged in a more mediated form through his archaism and a
                        classical style of writing reflecting Keats’s poetic refinement and
                        sensibility. Suzuki notes these three scholars for their significant
                        contributions to building the foundation for Japan’s national consciousness
                        and modern literary studies.</p>
<p>Suh-Reen Han picks up where Suzuki leaves off, tracing the critical career of
                        Choe Jae-seo, one of the first Korean scholars of English literature who was
                        incidentally a student of Sato Kiyoshi’s at Kyungsung Imperial University
                        (the Korean appellation for Keijo Imperial University). Having inherited his
                        professor’s interest in English Romanticism, Choe worked through the
                        different implications of Romantic aesthetics in the whirlwind of Korea’s
                        modern history. Choe’s perspectives on Romanticism bear the burden of a
                        historical and political consciousness reacting to the turbulent experiences
                        of colonial oppression, totalitarian militarism, and a civil war between
                        North and South. In his struggle to find the voice of a colonized critic,
                        Choe negatively comes across the possibility of a Romantic cosmopolitan
                        criticism against the frailty of a creative and critical spirit exposed to
                        political violence. </p>

<div type="abstract">
<p rend="noCount">This essay applies concepts from object-oriented ontology (OOO) to the study of communications media specifically with respect to Lord Byron’s <title level="m">Don Juan</title> (1819-1824). The essay’s primary contention is that OOO provides a conceptual stance
      well-suited to reveal some of the early media-ontological speculations performed in, around, and through <title level="m">Don Juan</title>. This
      object-oriented ontology of media, rooted in Romantic-era texts, also provides us with tools for analyzing our current media ecology.</p>

<head>Multi-Media Objects</head>
<p>As I compose this paragraph on an Apple laptop projected through a 27-inch LED monitor, on my desk next to these objects sits a cardboard
          virtual reality viewer with a smartphone tucked inside it. On a shelf behind me lie boxes containing several antiquated gaming consoles, a
          smattering of game cartridges, and a bottle of rubbing alcohol required to clean decades of disuse off the connector pins and thereby coax
          the games back to life. Surely we mean items like these when we us the term “multi-media.” Why, then, am I arguing for a multi-media
          Romanticism through the case of Lord Byron’s <title level="m">Don Juan</title> (1819-1824)? <title level="m">Don Juan</title> certainly
          enables engagement with the broader nineteenth-century media ecology, as others have demonstrated.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For
            instance, Colette Colligan analyzes <title level="m">Don Juan</title>’s (1819-1824) “unruly copies” circulating through the underground
            radical press and its correlative pornographic print industry (and particularly the connection between <title level="m">Don Juan</title>’s
            harem cantos and pornographic representations of the harem in visual culture). Both Tom Mole and Ghislaine McDayter demonstrate the
            crucial role of visual culture (and of the broader media ecology of the Romantic era) to Byron’s status as and negotiation of celebrity.
            Many others have also examined Byron’s place in the specifically literary print arena. To name only a few: Jerome Christensen recognizes
            Byron’s strength as the ability to resist, while participating in, the commercial print market; Nicholas Mason demonstrates the pivotal
            role of advertising in creating the brand of Byron that Christensen characterizes; Mark Schoenfield examines Byron’s career-long
            preoccupation with doing battle in the trenches of periodical magazines and reviews; and William St Clair tracks Byron’s cultural impact
            as viewed through publication histories (“The Impact of Byron’s Writings”).</note> In this essay, however, I develop a vocabulary for
          describing the multiplicity of a singular medium: print (even though to call it singular belies its assemblage-like nature and its capacity
          to remediate other objects into its regime). My broader aim is to demonstrate the complexity of thought around notions of media and
          mediation displayed by Romantic-era writers. It would be naïve to assert that nineteenth-century print matches our modern communications
          technologies when it comes to relative degrees of multiplicity and complexity of mediation. Even so, I adopt a speculative attitude in order
          to leave room for the possibility that we might not yet fully know a medium’s capacities; by attending to earlier interventions in media
          practice and theory, we might encounter new ones. </p>
<p>So why <title level="m">Don Juan</title>? Even though the Romantic era did not produce a fully developed notion of media theory, nor a
          clearly articulated definition of “medium” as a technological communicative apparatus, that does not preclude the possibility that those
          using, creating, and speculating on instantiations of different media were engaged in complex ways.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See
            John Guillory’s “Genesis of the Media Concept” for a thorough treatment of the pre-history of modern media philosophy and theory.</note>
          The discourse around <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, in particular, shows a wide range of that complexity. The poem’s forms of mediation
          accounted for as much of its reception as did its scandalous content. John Gibson Lockhart, in
          <title level="m">John Bull’s Letter to Lord Byron </title>(1821), draws attention to this fact when describing the
          poem’s appearance and impact: “Every body poring over the wicked smiling face of Don Juan,—pirated duo-decimo competing it all over the
          island with furtive quarto” (83-4). Because John Murray would not acknowledge himself as the poem’s publisher, piracies flooded the
            market.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Hugh J. Luke, Jr.’s “The Publishing of Byron’s <title level="m">Don Juan</title>” for
            details on the <title level="m">Don Juan</title> piracies as well as on Murray’s various editions. Murray’s reluctance to acknowledge
            himself as the publisher stemmed from his concern that the poem would be deemed blasphemous or seditious, which would render him liable
            for prosecution and strip him of any copyright protections.</note> What the piracies and the responses to those piracies reveal is an
          insight familiar to those conversant with bibliography: that the physical object conveys meaning in concert with the text it delivers. The
          significance of what Jerome McGann calls linguistic and bibliographic codes<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Jerome McGann’s <title level="m">The Textual Condition</title> (1991) (13-16). </note> are clearly understood by the <title level="j">Quarterly</title>
          reviewer (believed to be Robert Southey) who writes, “‘Don Juan’ in quarto and on hot-pressed paper would have been almost innocent—in a
          whity-brown duodecimo it was one of the worst of the mischievous publications that have made the press a snare” (“Cases” 128). Engagement
          with the complexity of nineteenth-century media is also one of Byron’s frequent moves in the poem. Its founding impulse emerges from Byron’s
          attention to the contingencies of paper. <title level="m">Don Juan</title> begins with the poet seeking out a new hero in the pages of
          contemporary newsprint, and Byron frequently performs other self-reflexive tropes, as when he ends Canto I with the famous borrowing—and
          mockery—of Southey’s lines bidding the “‘little book’” (1.222.1769) to go out into the world in search of “gentle reader[s]! and / Still
          gentler purchaser[s]!” (1.221.1761-2).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> All citations from <title level="m">Don Juan</title> (indicated
            parenthetically with canto, stanza, and line numbers) are to volume five of McGann’s <title level="m">Complete Poetical Works</title>. The
            citations from <title level="m">Beppo</title> (1818) are to volume four of the same edition (with stanza and line numbers indicated in the
            parenthetical citations).</note> Indeed, that self-reflexivity is arguably the poem’s most consistent feature, particularly as it relates
          to the materiality of the media ecology from which it emerges and into which Byron serially casts it. Byron’s sense of mediation insists on
          the poem’s contingency, its uncertainty, and its correspondence with speculation. Paper—one readily identifiable medial substrate of the
          poem—exudes a lively variability, which contributes to the multiplicity of the poem’s mediation. As Byron repeatedly jokes about the fate of
          “uncertain paper” (1.218.1738), his poem, thanks in part to its wide availability in pirated form, could have easily found a second life
          lining a trunk (“the next time their servants tie on / Behind their carriages their new portmanteau, / Perhaps it may be lined with this my
          canto” [2.16.126-8]), as culinary wrapping paper (“What, must I go to the oblivious cooks? / Those Cornish plunderers of Parnassian wrecks?”
          [4.108.861-2]), or perhaps worse, as a “rare deposit” discovered “In digging the foundation of a closet” (3.89.807-8), a metonymic
          association which, we might say, in the paronomastic spirit of <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, links literary posterity with the paper
          needs of the posterior. </p>
<p> But I digress. In pointing toward the poem’s self-reflexivity about its material manifestations, I raise a familiar, fundamental issue for
          literary studies: the relation between text and physical object. In particular for literary critics engaging with book and media history,
          this question remains central. In nineteenth-century literary studies, we see such efforts in recent books by Andrew Piper and Leah Price,
          both of whom argue that to understand books as objects, we need to attend to how writers from the period imaginatively represent books and
          the interactions they afford. Byron in general, and <title level="m">Don Juan</title> in particular, offer bountiful material for querying
          what it means for a poem and a book to exist in 1819. In what follows, I suggest that object-oriented ontology (OOO) provides a conceptual
          stance well-suited to reveal some of the early media-ontological speculations performed in, around, and through <title level="m">Don
            Juan</title>. Following an overview of OOO and my reading of it in relation to media studies, I offer analyses of how <title level="m">Don
            Juan</title> interrogates two media objects essential to its existence: paper and ink. In so doing, I suggest that despite its complicated
          relationship with materialism, OOO nonetheless equips us with tools for rethinking the materiality of media—a necessarily multiple
          materiality—in the Romantic era and beyond.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For instance, see Timothy Morton’s <title level="m">Realist
              Magic</title> (2013), in which he argues that materialism is merely a form of correlationism, the stance against which OOO argues
            (61-2). Graham Harman insists throughout his work on his adherence to realism in opposition to materialism. Levi Bryant, however, has
            begun to distance himself from the OOO label, calling his most recent work “machine-oriented ontology” (<title level="m">Onto-Cartography</title> 15), and in the process he has advocated for a revival of materialism.</note>
</p>
<p>But first, what is OOO? And how might it enhance our understanding of media in general and Romantic-period media in particular?<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Several scholars have in recent years brought Speculative Realism and/or OOO to bear on Romanticism (and the
            other way around as well). I’m indebted to them for the many insights I’ve gleaned from their conference papers, published arguments, and
            from the conversations shared with them at conferences and other events as I’ve developed my own thinking on the topic as presented here.
            Among these are: Greg Ellermann, with recent articles in <title level="j">Studies in Romanticism</title> (“Late Coleridge and the Life of
            Idealism”) and <title level="m">SubStance</title> (“Speculative Romanticism”); Evan Gottlieb, who recently published an essay titled,
            “Seeing into the Life of Things: Re-Viewing Early Wordsworth through Object-Oriented Philosophy,” and whose monograph titled, <title level="m">Romantic Realities: British Romanticism and Speculative Realism</title>, has just been published in the Speculative Realism
            series from Edinburgh University Press (unfortunately the book’s release came too late for me to consult it for this essay); Anne
            McCarthy, who has a forthcoming essay in <title level="j">Studies in Romanticism</title> which reads “Mont Blanc” through the work of
            Quentin Meillassoux; Aaron Ottinger, whose essay on Wordsworth, affect, and geometry situates the poet’s thinking in relation to the
            current “speculative turn”; Michele Speitz, who brilliantly combines a new formalist method with strains of new materialist thinking in
            “Catastrophe and Form; or, an Experiment in Formal Historicism”; and Chris Washington, who has offered compelling readings of Speculative
            Realism in two recent articles, “Byron’s Speculative Turn: Visions of Posthuman Life in <title level="m">Cain</title>,” and “Romanticism
          and Speculative Realism.” This meeting of contemporary continental philosophy and Romantic studies, particularly in recent scholarly work, represents an exciting direction for the future of the field.</note> OOO was christened by Graham Harman, who, along with Levi
          Bryant and Timothy Morton, forms the core group of OOO practitioners. OOO is a subset of the broader Speculative Realist movement, first
          dubbed as such at a workshop held in 2007 (titled simply, “Speculative Realism: A One-Day Workshop”), which featured talks by Harman, Ray
          Brassier, Iain Hamilton Grant, and Quentin Meillassoux. The loose grouping of Speculative Realists is held together by their shared
          rejection of what Meillassoux terms “correlationism,” the tendency in post-Kantian philosophy to investigate only the correlation between
          being and thought, never being itself.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Meillassoux’s <title level="m">After Finitude</title> (2008) (4-9).</note> The
          OOO answer to correlationism is to affirm the existence of objects apart from relations and to insist on objects’ “withdrawal” (the term
          that Harman, in <title level="m">Tool-Being</title> [2002], adapts from Heidegger’s tool analysis from <title level="m">Being and
            Time</title> [1927]). OOO is speculative in that it affirms the being of objects but not their presence to us, to other objects, or to
          themselves. In a formulation similar to Meillassoux’s, Harman claims that “contrary to the dominant assumption of philosophy since Kant, the
          true chasm in ontology lies not between humans and the world, but between <emph>objects and relations</emph>” (<title level="m">Tool-Being</title> 2). What emerges from this recognition, as Harman puts it in <title level="m">Guerilla Metaphysics</title> (2005), is
          the centrality of withdrawal: “Object-oriented philosophy has a single basic tenet: the withdrawal of objects from all perceptual and causal
          relations” (20). Objects only ever enter into relations through some form of translation, which means that relation never exposes the
          essence of the object. And this truth applies to relations with humans (as when a human reads a poem by translating “a small drop of ink”
          into a “lasting link / Of ages” [3.88.793, 797-8]), and also to relations between non-human objects (as when an aeolian harp translates the
          wind into song).</p>
<p>As suggested by the focus on causality in Morton’s <title level="m">Realist Magic</title> (2013), OOO offers great insight on how objects
          come to interact with one another despite their mutual conditions of withdrawal. If objects ontologically withdraw from full presence, then
          the work of speculative philosophy means exploring how these “vacuum-sealed” entities (Harman, <title level="m">Guerilla Metaphysics</title>
          2) communicate, correspond, or otherwise enter into relation. That focus on relation ports smoothly into media studies, particularly to help
          think through the relation between the fraught terms, book and text—or, put another way, the relation between the mediating object and the
          object mediated. This has been and continues to be a pressing question for book and media history. For instance, in <title level="m">The
            Reading Nation in the Romantic Period</title> (2004), William St Clair notes that “when we have reconstructed the production, access,
          sales, and readerships of the materiality of books [. . .] our best resource for understanding the impact of the reading of the literature
          of the romantic period may be the literature itself” (412). Or to pose the issue more succinctly via Andrew Piper, “Literature makes books
          as much as books make literature” (11). This claim applies especially to the Romantic era since books were still relatively fluid cultural
          objects. As Ina Ferris and Paul Keen note in their introduction to <title level="m">Bookish Histories</title> (2009), “[print] remained
          visible as a medium, palpable [. . .]. Books were not the taken-for-granted objects they would soon become” (5). St Clair, Piper, and
          Ferris and Keen all demonstrate that how Romantic readers (and how we) understand a given book, or the book, connects intimately with how we
          understand the literary (or non-literary) objects that come into being through books. From an OOO perspective, a poem is an object, and it
          exists independently of its particular material instantiations. Of course, this notion is nothing new to literary scholars—one thinks of F.
          W. Bateson’s famous question, as paraphrased by James McLaverty: “If the <title level="m">Mona Lisa </title>is in the
          Louvre, where are <title level="m">Hamlet</title> and <title level="m">Lycidas</title>?” (82). But OOO would also add that the gap between
          poem and its appearance to us in different mediated forms is not some trick of textuality but the condition of being itself. All objects
          withdraw, not just poems whose existence cannot be reduced to their bibliographic histories. An object-oriented media studies can therefore
          investigate object relations that extend into realms we might not typically see with a solely textual focus.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Jussi Parikka’s <title level="m">A Geology of Media</title> (2015) provides one such example. He refers to his approach as
            “a media history of matter: the different components, minerals, metals, chemicals, and other things involved in media are considered as
            essential to media history and archaeology” (25). Parikka’s focus rests primarily on contemporary computational media, and although I do
            not develop such an approach at length here, I do suggest that an object-oriented ontology of media offers the potential to perform such
            explorations with respect to older forms of mediation as well. </note> To employ that claim in Byronic terms, such an approach enables our
          critical Muses to “treat[] all things, and ne’er retreat[] / From any thing” (16.3.17-8). </p>
<p>As such, an object-oriented ontology of media enables us to see media from their side as well as from ours. In the case of books, it helps
          us to imagine, as Price does in her reading of it-narratives, “how accounts of print culture would look different if narrated from the point
          of view not of human readers and users, but of the book” (“From <title level="m">The History</title>” 120). Book history’s fundamental
          premise, as D. F. McKenzie claims, is that “[i]t can, in short, show the human presence in any recorded text” (29). But in order to
          understand what it means to come into contact with a book, or with a human presence through a book, we need first to understand the object
          and the nature of its object relations. Though it may seem counterintuitive, I contend that we can better conceive of the human presence in
          books if we first attend to how they exist in their strange bookishness, how they enlist many non-human agents in order to exist.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Bryant uses this formulation in describing all objects as a “crowd”: “Every object is populated by other
            objects that it enlists in maintaining its own existence” (<title level="m">Democracy of Objects </title>217).
          </note> The human presence we encounter is never fully itself—it remains fundamentally withdrawn, only made present in the form of a
          translation through a medium and through each object’s mode of appearing in that medium. An object-oriented media studies thus affirms the
          existence of media objects and their irreducibility to their qualities or relations. The result is a greater capacity to account for
          qualities or relations of which we may be unaware but which may emerge through unforeseen contingencies. Typically in book history and media
          studies, analysis of book/media objects focuses on subject-object relations (e.g., between human subject and book/media object, as in H. J.
          Jackson’s study of Romantic-era marginalia), or on object-object relations (e.g., the relations between books and the other objects which
          make up the systems of print circulation, as in McKenzie’s “sociology of texts,” or Robert Darnton’s similar “communications circuit”).
          Eugene Thacker, in theorizing what he calls “dark media,” suggests that we shift away from those models and instead attend to object-thing
            relations.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In OOO terms, Eugene Thacker’s object-thing distinction could map onto Harman’s sensual-real
            distinction, Bryant’s local manifestations and virtual proper being, and Morton’s more concise (and Aristotelian) appearance and essence.
            I recognize the critique of OOO made by Nathan Brown and others: that it amounts to nothing more than verbal and stylistic window-dressing
            on the firmer foundations of other, more fully consistent philosophical systems. Not being a philosopher, I have no stake in defending or
            attacking the viability of OOO as a philosophy. But, as <title level="m">Don Juan</title> teaches us, “words are things” (3.88.793), and
            the value of developing and employing new conceptual vocabularies should not be overlooked, especially since as scholars and teachers,
            interventions in the materiality of language are our last and best hopes for effecting changes that matter.</note> Such a method would
          interrogate media as paradoxical mixtures of intentional objects-for-us and things-in-themselves that resist full access from any other
          beings—human or otherwise. Dark media demonstrate more clearly what is true of all media: that they withdraw from full access even when
          hinting at their existence through particular qualities and appearances. When we theorize mediation, we must contend with the deeply inhuman
          core of those media objects to which we ascribe so much human presence. Media objects benefit from an object-oriented position precisely
          because it’s all too easy to locate their essences <emph>as</emph> mediums in the emergent properties of their uses for us. It
          may seem odd to imagine a book apart from the human actions that brought it into being, or the intentions humans had for it, or the uses to
          which humans put it. Yet, an object-oriented media studies calls for just that, and we can do so by entertaining Byron’s speculations on the
          non-human elements of mediation in <title level="m">Don Juan</title>.</p>

<div type="section">
<head>Paper Objects</head>
<p>Paper is a speculative material. We speculate on it, with it, and through it. And it remains subject to ever more instances of speculation,
          or as Byron phrases it in <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, it remains always “uncertain,” always poised between existing as communicative
          medium and as mere material object (“a rag like this” [3.88.799]). As such, paper brings to light the complex temporality inherent to any
          act of mediation, which can be posed in the form of Craig Dworkin’s question in <title level="m">No Medium</title> (2013): “was the paper
          you are holding already a medium before it was brought together with the ink?” (29). To ponder the answer to that question is to pursue an
          ontology of media. Dworkin turns to a process-based answer when he asserts that “[media] are not things, but rather activities” (28). As I
          discussed above, OOO refutes process (or activity, flow, relation, etc.) as a ground for ontology. Following that refutation, we find in
          Byron’s <title level="m">Don Juan</title> an approach to mediation which likewise insists on “things” over “activities.” In the next two
          sections, I’ll briefly read Byron’s engagements with mediation through the two objects mentioned in Dworkin’s question: paper and ink.</p>
<p>While we tend to think of paper as an inert substance awaiting the variable accidents of new and true poetic attempts, Byron’s poem
          repeatedly poses paper as itself an agential object. He writes to Murray a month after the publication of <title level="m">Don Juan</title>:
          “I <emph>have</emph> no plan—I <emph>had</emph> no plan—but I have or had materials”
          (<title level="m">Letters </title>207). Of course, Byron here means <emph>source</emph> materials or ideas,
          but this comment should nonetheless suggest to us that Byron’s poetics embraces the contingency of matter. Paper functions as an insistently
          material presence, though one with a vitality we tend not to associate with material objects like fused bits of cloth.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I borrow here the language of Christopher Breu’s <title level="m">The Insistence of the Material</title> (2014), in which
            he argues for renewed attention to the intransigence of matter in order to counter contemporary culture’s overriding “fantasy of the
            transcendence of the material” (23). In referring to paper’s “vitality,” I have in mind something akin to Jane Bennett’s account in <title level="m">Vibrant Matter</title> (2010) of the agency of things outside of human control.</note> From early in the poem, and throughout
          its development, Byron’s paper moves. Or in OOO terms, it withdraws, escaping full apprehension and only showing itself and its powers in
          partial, translated manners. Toward the end of Canto I, in one of Byron’s many digressions about the nature of fame, paper’s materiality
          first surfaces with “the end of fame” amounting to nothing more than a spatial concern: “’tis but to fill / A certain portion of uncertain
          paper” (1.218.1737-8). As he is “born for opposition” (15.22.176), it comes as no surprise that Byron employs “certain” in its two
          oppositional senses: the “certain portion” refers to an undetermined or unspecified amount (and thus, a not very certain portion after all),
          and then the “uncertain paper” calls to mind the opposite meaning (fixed, determined, stable), though here negated by the prefix.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Byron employs this same punning sensibility with certain/uncertain in <title level="m">Beppo</title>, where
            he writes that Laura “was not old, nor young, nor at the years / Which certain people call a ‘certain age,’ / Which yet the most uncertain
            age appears” (22.169-71). A similar joke recurs in <title level="m">Don Juan</title>: “A lady of a ‘certain age,’ which means / Certainly
            aged” (6.69.546-7). </note> Fame, then, requires a certain—that is to say, an unknown—amount of material production, which resides in an
          object whose stability is likewise suspect. Paper must be acted upon by willful agents, but that control over paper is compromised by the
          material’s own particularities. In this case paper’s instability primarily results from change over time, but it possesses synchronic as
          well as diachronic uncertainty. Although the latter sense is more apparent, Byron at least gestures toward paper’s lively materiality with
          the rhyming words, “vapour” and “taper,” a trio employed three more times across the poem. The vapour appears in another metaphor for fame
          (that of walking up a hill “lost in vapour” [1.218.1740]), but the echoing of paper with a seemingly immaterial substance rhetorically
          heightens the changeability of the former. And the “taper,” which metonymically stands in for literary production (“bards burn[ing] what
          they call their ‘midnight taper’” [1.218.1742]), also reminds us that the paper medium requires additional material supports (such as light,
          ink, quill, etc.). Paper and taper are etymologically as well as sonically linked, both coming from “papyrus,”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
<title level="m">The Oxford English Dictionary</title> notes that from “taper” likely comes the practice of making candle wicks from the
            pith of papyrus; “paper” is a much clearer lexical descendant, via Latin, of “papyrus.” </note> an earlier writing surface which, as it
          ceased to function materially, continued its legacy discursively by lending its name to other composite materials (such as cotton fibers)
          assembled for the purposes of writing and printing. Through the ottava rima form’s particular affordances, the linking of paper/vapour/taper
          encourages us to consider paper’s multiplicity and variability even as it exists in a single moment. </p>
<p>Given that the first instance of the paper/taper rhyme occurs just twenty stanzas earlier, as Julia composes her farewell letter to Juan,
          it’s worth linking the two passages and their approaches to paper as a medium. The narrator informs us that “This note was written upon
          gilt-edged paper / With a neat crow-quill.” As Julia uses a candle to seal the letter, “Her small white fingers scarce could reach the
          taper.” The seal itself, with its “white cornelian” and its motto reading “‘<foreign>Elle vous suit partout</foreign>,’” functions as
          another layering of mediation with text inscribed in wax sealing in text upon “gilt-edged paper” (1.198.1577-9, 1582-3). And Julia (or at
          least her letter) does indeed follow Juan everywhere for a time, as the paper (and Juan) travels to sea to begin Canto II. Byron undoes the
          sincerity of Julia’s composition with Juan’s nauseous response to his reading of it (helped along by the lurching of the ship). After Juan’s
          reading of the letter, it appears once more after the shipwreck but only for its material substrate: “At length the lots were torn up, and
          prepared, / But of materials that much shock the Muse— / Having no paper, for the want of better, / They took by force from Juan Julia’s
          letter” (2.74.589-92). Paper at first functions as the medium for Julia’s sincere outpouring of feeling, but even so its significance
          depends on the quality of the paper, the wax seal, and the motto. And then in its final form (as lots to decide which shipwrecked survivor
          will be eaten), the paper signifies a death sentence for “poor Pedrillo” (2.77.616)—there being essentially no distinction between the
          content and the medium. The paper in this final instance carries meaning only through its dimensions relative to other bits of rag. We might
          recall here the <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title> distinguishing between a proper “‘Don Juan’ in quarto and on hot-pressed paper”
          and the smaller, lesser quality “whity-brown duodecimo,” which renders the poem so potentially dangerous. As Andrew Franta writes of the
          scene, the focus on the “materials that much shock the Muse” suggests that Byron “offers a proleptic acknowledgment of the reading public’s
          outraged response to the eating of Juan’s tutor, Pedrillo” (52). Moreover, the emphasis on “materials” points toward the physical media
          responsible for conveying the poem’s “shocking” content. Again, Byron demonstrates the potential of the paper medium to acquire agential
          force. Any attempt to account for the poem and its significance thus requires attention to the relations into which it enters via multiple
          modes of mediation. To return to the language of OOO, the poem exists, but it also withdraws from full presence, only ever showing glimmers
          of itself through the different material media that make it possible and which Byron figures into his poetics. Even though Byron claims in
            <title level="m">Don Juan</title> to “rattle on exactly as I’d talk / With any body in a ride or walk” (15.19.151-2), his attention to the
          materiality of composition and printing demonstrates that his poetic process emerges from his acute awareness of the movement from speech to
          writing and from writing to print. And his poetic treatment of paper is crucial for understanding those processes.</p>

<head>Inky Objects</head>
<p>As seen in the shipwreck episode or in the references to reused paper, the medium does not require written or printed content for it to
          matter significantly. But paper acquires particular powers when brought into contact with another object of interest to Byron: ink. In one
          of Byron’s most famous statements on the nature of literary fame, he begins with an optimistic notion of literary production and
          dissemination: “But words are things, and a small drop of ink, / Falling like dew, upon a thought, produces / That which makes thousands,
          perhaps millions, think” (3.88.793-5). Byron supposes that an ostensibly minor material intervention (“a small drop of ink”) has the
          potential to influence greatly that which is known and thought. “Words are things” at least in part because of their material carriers. Ink
          is not merely subordinate to discourse but, rather, intimately connected (materially as well as sonically via the ink/think rhyme) with the
          mental activity we tend to view as the primary mover of cultural production. Writing and printing also appear superior to the more
          immaterial act of speech (working as it does through the evanescent mediums of “vapour” and air): “’Tis strange, the shortest letter which
          man uses / Instead of speech, may form a lasting link / Of ages” (3.88.796-8). Prefiguring a later passage in the poem which similarly pits
          the materials of literary production against human thought (“’Tis strange the mind, that very fiery particle, / Should let itself be snuffed
          out by an Article” [11.60.79-80]), Byron begins to mourn the human reliance on the vagaries of matter. The stanza’s final lines intensify
          that feeling of regret, but they also offer potential consolation, as the poet turns from ink back to paper: “to what straits old Time
          reduces / Frail man, when paper—even a rag like this, / Survives himself, his tomb, and all that’s his” (3.88.798-800). The human body and
          paper share a common frailty, and yet the greater durability of the latter offers the potential to make up for the former’s rapid movement
          toward “dust” (3.89.801). But the “rag like this” reminds us again that paper is “uncertain,” that it involves change, and that it
          ultimately withdraws from any full presence to other objects. Paper is nothing but rag, but it is not <emph>only</emph> rag. The
          poem to which Byron refers exists apart from, even as it relies on, any single, stable paper substrate. </p>
<p>Of course, even if paper lasts long enough to secure some semblance of fame for the person responsible for sending that rag out into the
          world, fame may not persist in a true form (as with “some dull MS” Byron imagines being recovered from “oblivion” in the next stanza
          [3.89.805]). Byron explores this concern repeatedly while discussing newspapers’ lists of soldiers killed in combat. Newspapers, of course,
          are defined by their ephemerality. They must present that which is new, and they must do so serially (whether daily, weekly, etc.).
          “[M]odern fame” moves at such speed that “ere the ink be dry,” the newspapers move on to the next story (13.51.402, 405). Byron thus pits
          the “poet’s page” (1.5.36) against the gazettes with their lists of the dead, which are at best well-intentioned but flawed. As Daniel
          Hitchens suggests about Byron’s attitudes toward misprints, Byron takes seriously the notion that “poets should feel as great a
          responsibility as they would if they were at war,” and they thus “ought to be wary of hastiness, of textual mistakes, omissions, misprints”
          (139). What matters for Byron, according to Hitchens, is “the weight of detail, digression, anecdote and inconsistency” (140) in contrast
          with history, which “can only take things in the gross” (8.3.17). Hitchens connects that use of “gross” with Byron’s couplet about the
          soldier “whose loss / Was printed <emph>Grove</emph>, although his name was Grose” (8.18.143-4). Nothing but “a small drop of
          ink” separates Grove from Grose. Byron’s poem, with its embrace of contradiction, change, digression, and detail strives to correct such
          inky mistakes, but it also opens itself up to other inevitable new ones, particularly since the poem appeared in so many guises with varied
          levels of stability and authenticity. The fluidity of ink means that it is rooted in and leads to further change. Poets are similarly fluid
          with their feeling, as “they are such liars, / And take all colours—like the hands of dyers” (3.87.791-2). Instead of rejecting or
          condemning that fluidity, however, Byron accepts contradiction and opposition: “But if a writer should be quite consistent, / How could he
          possibly show things existent?” (15.87.695-6). Ink matters for poetry precisely because it dwells both in (withdrawn) existence and in
          inconsistency (variable processes). </p>
<p>If, as Siegfried Zielinski writes, “Media are spaces of action for constructed attempts to connect what is separated” (5), then the meeting
          of paper and ink is one space where such attempts seek to connect a variety of separated things. But as Alexander Galloway, Eugene Thacker,
          and McKenzie Wark argue in <title level="m">Excommunication</title> (2013), “non-media always lurk at the threshold of media” (11). Rag and
          paper, drops of ink and words—the objects through which we attempt to connect what is separated also contain within themselves a fundamental
          alterity, which insists that no separation is ever entirely overcome. We’ve known at least since Robert Hooke’s <title level="m">Micrographia</title> (1665) that the meeting of inked type and paper (the essential process of the print medium) is not always entirely
          as it appears. What looks to unaided human eyes as a circular full stop featuring stable rounded edges appears with the help of a microscope
          as <ref target="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015020857309;view=1up;seq=45">ragged and irregular</ref>, like “<emph>smutty daubings</emph>” or “a great splatch of <emph>London</emph> dirt” (3).
          When ink meets paper, the two objects enter into a fluid aesthetic dance—one in which ink bleeds into paper, and paper receives ink, in
          unpredictable ways. The two objects enter into relation, but they do so only through their particular mechanisms of translating one another.
          We see the objects not for what they are but for how they affect and allude to one another. Mediation, by definition an attempt to overcome
          separation, only ever alludes to those separated things. Mediation is predicated on absence, but that does not mean mediation accomplishes
          nothing. Byron clearly recognizes the potential for paper, ink, and humans to interact with and affect other existing objects. But his
          approach to mediation in <title level="m">Don Juan</title> continually recognizes the reality of contingency and the necessary agency of
          non-human objects. </p>
<p>So that I might “end at least with the beginning” (13.73.584), I’ll turn for a moment to <title level="m">Beppo: A Venetian Story</title>
          (1818), which is where <title level="m">Don Juan</title> arguably has its beginning. In addition to the former poem supplying the latter
          with its stanzaic form, both poems share a focus on the materiality of media. In <title level="m">Beppo</title> Byron speaks of hating “an
          author that’s <emph>all author</emph>, fellows / In foolscap uniforms turned up with ink” (75.593-4), a formulation which merges
          the body of the human author with the non-human objects (paper and ink) responsible for making authors. Earlier in the poem he offers
          another connection between clothing and the cloth so crucial to the print medium, when he compares Laura’s beauty to an image from a
          “frontispiece of a new Magazine, [. . .] / Coloured, and silver paper leav’d between / That and the title-page, for fear the press / Should
          soil with parts of speech the parts of dress” (57.452, 454-6). As is true of the simplest printed mark in Hooke’s <title level="m">Micrographia</title>, ink here bleeds into paper of its own accord. Writers, publishers, and readers can merely and futilely attempt to
          maintain the separation of language and materiality. We might put this truth in more positive terms by connecting it to Byron’s desire to
          capture truth and reality in his poem, which he poses in contrast to the “cant” that he saw characterizing the spirit of the age. For Byron,
          poetic truth emerges out of an approach to materiality which leaves behind the illusion of total discursive control. The reference to “parts
          of speech” and “parts of dress” subtly reminds readers that when they encounter speech translated into writing or print, such language is
          conveyed on the parts of dress (i.e., rags turned into paper). But dress is not mere brute materiality: it involves arrangement, form, and
          shape. Dress is aesthetic. It requires discourse and materiality as well as the productive tensions emerging from their collision. <title level="m">Beppo</title> ends not so much when the discursive gives up on making material interventions, as when the material refuses to
          accommodate the discursive any longer: “My pen is at the bottom of a page, / Which being finished, here the story ends; / ’Tis to be wished
          it had been sooner done, / But stories somehow lengthen when begun” (99.789-92). The story “slips for ever through [the poet’s] fingers”
          (63.498), lengthening with a desire of its own by entering into relation with other material objects. The discursive can never leave behind
          the material, nor can it ever fully exhaust it. An object-oriented ontology of <emph>media</emph> applies this logic
          specifically to communications media in order to refocus our critical vision on media’s material resistance to discourse, culture, or pure
          formalism. Byron’s attention to the instability of inky marks on paper translates the material reality of mediation—presenting an unknowable
          absence—into aesthetic, discursive, and often comic forms of signification. Ultimately it’s that probing of the relation between the
          material and the discursive that an object-oriented ontology of media can assist us in performing and which Byron’s poetics continue to
          instigate as we (“Why, I’m Posterity—and so are you” [12.19.145]) take up his materials anew.</p>
<p>What, then, are we to make of a renewed meeting of media studies and literary criticism as a path to a multi-media Romanticism? Thanks to
          many scholars working in nineteenth-century studies,<note place="foot" resp="editors">As should be apparent to readers of this <title level="m">Romantic Circles Praxis</title> volume, Romanticist scholars in recent years have shown a surge of interest in rethinking
            media, particularly junior scholars like those of us gathered together in this volume. James Brooke-Smith and Andrew Burkett have both
            recently published articles on the topic, the former finding William Wordsworth and Charles Babbage engaged in a nascent “media theory in
            the absence of a <emph>technological</emph> media concept” (2), and the latter reading <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>
            (1818, 1831) as a novel wrestling with the fraught connection between embodiment and information (a connection that Burkett links to N.
            Katherine Hayles’ work on the history of cybernetics, but one that has been less visible in studies of the long eighteenth century [584]).
            Like my colleagues also featured in this volume, I have found significant theoretical, methodological, and historical grounding in the
            following work: Miranda Burgess’s work on affect and the significance of mediation to eighteenth- and nineteenth-century models of
            sympathy; Kevis Goodman’s <title level="m">Georgic Modernity </title>(2004), in which she approaches “the early
            history of contemporary media in relation to print culture” (10) by reading the georgic as the primary mode of mediating the affects of
            history in the long eighteenth century; Celeste Langan’s reading of Sir Walter Scott’s
            <title level="m">Lay of the Last Minstrel </title>(1805), and how in that poem “the medium of print becomes
            recognizable <emph>as</emph> a medium” (70); Langan and Maureen McLane’s contention that “Romantic poetry might even serve as
            a synonym for what we mean by multimedia” (239); and Andrew Piper’s
            <title level="m">Dreaming in Books </title>(2009), which demonstrates “how the history of books, and romantic books
            in particular, can help us contextualize our understanding of digital or new media today” (8). Many Romanticists are also <emph>making</emph> innovative digital work, not the least of which are <ref target="http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/">
<title level="m">The Blake
              Archive</title>
</ref> and <ref target="http://www.nines.org/s">
<title level="m">NINES</title>
</ref>, two longstanding digital humanities projects
            which have spread their influence far beyond the purview of nineteenth-century studies. I also have in mind work like Paul Youngquist’s
            playful and incisive “Techno-Prosthetic Romantic Futurism,” an essay in the shape of hypertext fiction, in which he suggests that we might
            imagine <ref target="http://www.erudit.org/projspec/article/013157ar/950.html">“criticism of Romanticism as a field of digital possibility,”</ref> a realm where the <ref target="http://www.erudit.org/projspec/article/013157ar/190.html">hacker is the hero of “digital resistance,” analogous to the Romantics hacking textuality in the nineteenth
              century</ref>. Andrew Stauffer has especially broadened one area of digital possibility (digitization) with his call to arms for
            humanists to play a larger role in reckoning with the massive commercial digitization projects that have unfolded in the last decade. He
            insists that, in the digitizing and archiving of nineteenth-century texts, we ought to “use the digital environment not to supplant the
            paper record, but to develop a more nuanced critical method for understanding the physical forms and features of the papers that the
            Romantics left behind” (17), an insistence that Stauffer has supported with his recent “<ref target="http://www.booktraces.org/">Book Traces</ref>”
            project. In <title level="m">A New Republic of Letters</title> (2014), Jerome McGann presents a compelling argument and model for how such
            future scholarly work will reckon with the reality that “the whole of our cultural inheritance has to be recurated and reedited in digital
            forms and institutional structures” (1).</note> as well as others more firmly rooted in media studies,<note place="foot" resp="editors">
            At this point, it almost goes without saying that the “new” of new media is problematic. As Alexander Galloway, Eugene Thacker, and
            McKenzie Wark write in <title level="m">Excommunication</title> (2013), with obvious fatigue from having made the point many times
            already, “So let’s have no more talk about ‘new media’—as if we already knew everything about old media” (2). That caveat aside, it
            behooves me to recognize some of the specific ways in which scholars have resisted the uncritical deployment of the “new” in new media.
            Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin argue that the “logics of remediation have a long history,” the opposite poles of hypermediacy and
            immediacy characterizing different aesthetic modes “from the Renaissance to the present day” in their analysis (21). Two anthologies,
              <title level="m">New Media, 1740–1915</title> (2003) and
            <title level="m">New Media, Old Media; A History and Theory Reader </title>(2006), demonstrate that already in the
            early 2000s there was significant desire to “[shift] from ‘what is new’ to what work the new does” (Chun 3). Lisa Gitelman’s <title level="m">Always Already New</title> (2006) is rooted in that shift. She argues that “the introduction of new media [. . .] is never
            entirely revolutionary: new media are less points of epistemic rupture than they are socially embedded sites for the ongoing negotiation
            of meaning as such” (6). Gitelman acknowledges in her approach a debt to media archaeology, a field that has surfaced in several recent
            literary-focused studies of media. A primary aim of the media archaeological approach, as Siegfried Zielinksi poses it, is to “not seek
            the old in the new, but find something new in the old” (3). Following that impulse, Lori Emerson pursues the task of “wield[ing] media
            archaeology as a conceptual knife that cuts into the present and the near future, not just [. . .] into the past” (2), one she
            accomplishes by tracing an aesthetic of the interface from Emily Dickinson, to mid-twentieth-century typewriter poetry, to various
            instances of contemporary new media art. Yohei Igarashi’s recent article in <title level="j">Studies in Romanticism</title> represents
            another merging of literary studies and media archaeology, although as he notes, his adoption of the method is tentative, recognizing the
            potential pitfalls of anachronism inherent to it (177-8).</note> the binary qualifiers “new” and “old” have been productively rethought
          over the last fifteen years. At this point, a foundational question is being revisited: what are media? We see this question probed in
          several recent media studies projects which, in different ways, tend to emphasize media as processes or activities rather than as things or
            objects.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Craig Dworkin’s <title level="m">No Medium </title>(2013); Galloway’s
            <title level="m">The Interface Effect </title>(2013); the collaborative volume, <title level="m">Excommunication</title>, by Galloway, Thacker, and Wark; and Gitelman’s <title level="m">Always Already New</title> and <title level="m">Paper Knowledge</title> (2014).</note> For instance, as Craig Dworkin argues, “No single medium can be apprehended in
          isolation [. . .][;] media (always necessarily multiple) only become legible in social contexts because they are not things, but rather
          activities” (28). While process ontologies, such as Dworkin’s, productively illuminate the variability of media, they also risk eliminating
          distinctions between things. If all is process, then any media object can be <title level="m">processed</title> into any other, like
          discrete bits of cow flesh rendered into pink slime. In borrowing from OOO, media studies can make room for both the simultaneous plenitude
          of distinct objects and their strange, processual variability by reversing Dworkin’s claim: media are things, not activities. Media of
          course involve activities, but activities are not the same as, and should not take priority over, the media objects themselves. A book is
          not the poem printed within it, nor is it the means and mechanisms of its circulation, use, and storage that welcome it into the
          twenty-first century in a variety of forms (in a Rare Books room, in the stacks, in digital databases, in a trash heap, etc.). As I’ve
          discussed, <title level="m">Don Juan</title> is particularly receptive to an object-oriented ontology of media since it exploits the extent
          to which the existence of a media object is always multiple—not because its existence is predicated upon a variety of activities, but
          because objects (such as poems and paper and ink) withdraw from access. </p>
<p>The stakes undergirding my argument are the political effects that emerge from our media ontologies. I share with Alexander Galloway the
          urgency of asking, “What should we do so that thinking does not purely and simply coincide with the spirit of capitalism?” (“Poverty” 364).
          But I disagree with his contention that “recent realist philosophy mimics the infrastructure of contemporary capitalism” (“Poverty” 348). In
          its resistance to reductionism, OOO counters the logic of neoliberal techno-utopianism, the dominant ideology of the information economy
          against which Galloway writes.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Galloway describes post-Fordism as such: <quote>The economy today is not
              only driven by software (symbolic machines); in many cases the economy is software, in that it consists of the extraction of value based
              on the encoding and processing of mathematical information. Monsanto, Equifax, or Google—they are all software companies at some basic
              level. As one of the leading industrial giants, Google uses the pure math of graph theory for monetary valorization. Monsanto translates
              living organisms into bioinformatic gene sequences, thereby subjecting them to information processing. Equifax, in the sphere of
              consumer credit, leverages complex algorithms to extract value from databases. (“Poverty” 358)</quote>
</note> Contemporary capitalism
          translates all into code. It thereby seeks to control social and economic flows with greater efficiency, to monetize any and all forms of
          interaction, and to eliminate any variations that would upset the algorithmic machinery. As William Blake wrestled with the machines of
          church and state, we now face media as the gardens of love in which our joys and desires are bound in the briars of algorithmic reduction.
          The rhetoric of process—which implies that activities (like data manipulation) are all that matter—risks capitulating to such restriction.
          If we abandon the notion of the irreducible existence of media and of other objects, if we focus instead on pure flows and endless process
          as the things to which objects are reduced, and if we accept that all objects and all media exist merely as different data configurations of
          the same inert substance, then we embrace twenty-first-century global capitalism and its fantasies of immaterial production. Even though a
          philosophy centered on objects may seem to imply a dull, static materialism, OOO actually reveals the plenitude at the core of all objects.
          In applying this logic to media, I do not claim that older media are somehow more real or more physical than electronic media. The latter
          too have equal claims on reality and materiality.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Matthew Kirschenbaum shows in dazzling fashion how one
            might consider the materiality of digital media with his analysis of the hard drive in <title level="m">Mechanisms</title> (2008).</note>
          But I resist the notion that we can ignore or transcend materiality (an attitude often expressed with respect to computational media), and
          the reductionism of process-based ontologies risks leading us down that path. If we go that route we’ll find nothing more than the endless
          procession of the same dull round, to which we can only reply as one: <graphic n="1001" width="0.5041277777777777cm" height="0.4318cm" url="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/multi-media/images/rejack-image1.png" rend="inline"/>.
          An object-oriented ontology of media shows us that, as in <title level="m">Don Juan</title>—whose narrator claims, “my tale is / ‘De rebus
          cunctis et quibûsdam aliis’” (“Of everything that is and a few other things besides” [16.3.23-4])—we benefit from speculating beyond the
          everything that is.</p>

<div type="abstract">
<p rend="noCount">Romantic literature at times features instances of positive
                    negation, that trope whereby a literary text gives a body, face, visible form,
                    or effective agency to negativity. In doing so, it anticipates similar features
                    in modernist critical theory, such as Heidegger’s notion of the possibility of
                    the impossibility of existence, or Bataille’s rendition of the presence of the
                    absence of God. Such figures appear in the late poetry of Samuel Taylor
                    Coleridge, especially “Human Life, On the Denial of Immortality,” which reveal a
                    counterside to his late theological reflections. That poem’s deployment of what
                    Coleridge elsewhere considers to be the “positive state” of “Eternal Death”
                    proposes that without the immortality of the soul, the best instance of positive
                    negation is the living human being, who (in an echo of Milton’s Death)
                    personifies the nothingness she or he must face. Such a figure, the poem
                    suggests, can neither mount a suitable emotion in relation to its nothingness
                    nor make its nothingness meaningful; nevertheless, as something crafted by
                    nature’s “restless hands unconsciously,” the mortal becomes a figure of excess,
                    of what interrupts mere blankness, exemplifying not a dialectical rendition of
                    death but a second-order nullity, and thus can be defined through a Lacanian
                    enigmatic signifier, even if one deprived of any code in which it may make
                    sense. The poem thus anticipates certain a/theological features of recent
                    thought, mapping the human as a site for the assertion of negativity. </p>

<head>Positive Negation: On Coleridge’s “Human Life”</head>
<p> In taking up the theme of the “rights of the negative,” one might reasonably ask
                    how the negative has rights, how it might assert its rights, indeed how it might
                    make a demand of any kind. The negative, one might argue, is
                        <emph>negative</emph>, operating over against the domain of positive
                    institutions, assertions, and demands. Yet one might reasonably argue that by
                    virtue of that fact, nothing asserts itself so insistently as the negative, that
                    any positive instance necessarily operates in relation to a negativity that
                    never ceases to make itself felt.</p>
<p> Such reflections, however, rely on the prior fact that something like “the
                    negative” or one of its analogues has been isolated, named, and given specific
                    powers within a discourse or practice. But this minimal figure, which makes of
                    negativity a moment within the domain of the apparently positive, may at times
                    adopt a more radical form through the trope of direct embodiment—that is, a
                    face, voice, or agency, a capacity to challenge the subject explicitly. Within
                    canonic Romantic literature, one might find several examples of this trope,
                    including the metafictional ghost that appears in <title level="m">The
                        Monk</title>, the “unfathered vapour” in Wordsworth’s crossing of the Alps,
                    the creature in <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, and the figure of deathly
                    negation in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>. All of these
                    instances, as well as many others, no doubt allude on some level to the most
                    notorious instance of the figure, that darkness visible, Milton’s Death. These
                    versions of the negative appear in order to assert themselves, to make
                    implacable demands, and thus in some degree to horrify and alter those who
                    encounter them. Various renditions of positive negation emerge in other forms of
                    articulation in the Romantic era as well: one might think of the “empty place of
                    power” that according to Claude Lefort emerges over the course of the French
                    Revolution to become a constitutive aspect of modern democracies (27), or
                    alternatively of the formative role of natural disaster, war, and famine in
                    Malthusian demography. Some might argue that the Kantian analytic of the
                    sublime, Schelling’s notion of the rotary motion of antithetical principles in
                    his <title level="m">Ages of the World</title>, or Hegel’s account of Absolute
                    Knowledge belong within this field as well. If one glances ahead to later
                    moments in the philosophical tradition, one might think of Heidegger’s
                    discussion of the “possibility of the measureless impossibility of existence” in
                        <title level="m">Being and Time</title> (307) and of what Denis Hollier,
                    capturing the sense of Georges Bataille’s notion of the sacred, describes not as
                    the “<title level="m">absence of</title> [God’s] <emph>presence</emph>” but the
                        “<emph>presence of</emph> [his] <emph>absence</emph>” (133). Even nearer to
                    us is the Lacanian Real, which takes a logic or process that perpetually
                    undermines the symbolic and imaginary orders and treats it as an entity, an
                    uncanny Thing.</p>
<p> Within this broad ensemble, certain moments in Coleridge’s late poems may seem
                    inconsequential, for they do not seem to be motivated by any ambitious poetic or
                    philosophical project. Indeed, in some cases the key articulations take place in
                    poems he did not at first intend to publish. Yet it is well worth reading those
                    moments carefully with a view toward the broader questions raised by Romanticism
                    and its heirs, for they make visible the counterseams in the texture of
                    Coleridge’s overall theological and philosophical thought, and articulate, with
                    unusual brevity and precision, some of the continuing stakes of positive
                    negation.</p>
<p> These preoccupations first appear explicitly in a tangle of incipient poems
                    written in an 1811 <title level="m">Notebook</title> entry, especially the two
                    poems eventually published in 1834 under the titles of “Limbo” and “Ne Plus
                    Ultra” (<title level="m">Notebooks</title> 4073–74; <title level="m">Complete
                        Poems</title> 357–59). The poem “Limbo” initially outlines the limbo-zone of
                    “half-being,” which is “Wall’d round” to secure it from a more fearful state,
                    “the mere horror of blank Naught-at-all” (4, 23). In its final lines it moves
                    beyond the “Purgatory curse” of “dull Privation” to contemplate a darker
                    alternative: “Hell knows a fear far worse / A fear—a future state;—‘tis positive
                    Negation!” (26–28). In settling on this final phrase, Coleridge departs from an
                    earlier line in the notebook draft where he writes of “aye-unepithetable
                    Negation” (<title level="m">Complete Poems</title> 584; <title level="m">Notebooks </title>4073), in effect hinting that “unepithetable” is itself
                    an epithet—and that the notion of a positive negation only makes sharper the
                    idea of an unmodifiable one. As Morton Paley points out, these lines allude to a
                    notion in the third sermon of John Donne, an author central to the entire
                    notebook entry, that hell is the privation of God (Paley 202). But by shifting
                    from privation to negation, Coleridge suggests in effect that hell is nothing
                    other than a certain negation itself, or what in a later annotation to the
                    anonymous book <title level="m">Eternal Punishment Proved to Be Not Suffering,
                        but Privation</title> (1817), he calls the “positive State” of “Eternal
                    Death” (<title level="m">Marginalia</title> 559). Through the notion of
                    “positive Negation,” Coleridge does not simply write an oxymoron but invokes a
                    fully considered concept, one we could describe not merely as absence, but more
                    fundamentally as the presence of absence, the possibility of impossibility.</p>
<p> That poem’s intervention is so brief, however, that it only broaches the theme.
                    Thus it is not surprising that Coleridge extends its musings in nearby notebook
                    lines, published under the title “Ne Plus Ultra,” where a speaker initially
                    addresses nothingness as the “Sole Positive of Night!” (1). Here that
                    nothingness is given a much broader force, for the speaker goes on to suggest
                    that it is “The one permitted opposite of God!,” the “sole despair / Of both th’
                    eternities in Heaven!” (4, 14–15). The poem seems to rest on the notion that
                    only nothingness is permitted to oppose God, insofar as God has no true
                    opposite. But if there is a <emph>positive</emph> negation, then its
                    antithetical persistence can indeed generate astonishment. Rather than
                    representing Hell, a domain presumably subject to divine control, or a blank
                    naught-at-all of death, which only those alive may fear, here it has power to
                    interdict the activity of God and the angels. The negative has become a threat
                    to the most assertive sway of the positive itself. </p>
<p> But the import of this poem’s stance remains unclear: <emph>how</emph> might
                    sheer nothingness have the capacity to interdict God’s actions? Is Coleridge
                    riffing on his trope here, as if in the spirit of his version of Donne, or is he
                    beginning to conceive of a negativity like those that appear in Hegel or
                    Schelling? The final lines of the notebook entry speak of his ambivalence in
                    this regard, where he writes, “A Specimen of the Sublime dashed to pieces by
                    cutting too close with her fiery Four in Hand round the corner of Non-sense”
                        (<title level="m">Complete Poems</title> 584; <title level="m">Notebooks
                    </title>4073). </p>
<p> Yet Coleridge does not abandon the themes broached in these lines, for he
                    explores them more fully soon thereafter in a poem published in 1817, “Human
                    Life, On the Denial of Immortality” (<title level="m">Complete Poems</title>
                    362)—a continuity made even more evident by Coleridge’s remark in a marginal
                    annotation that this poem, too, was written “in purposed imitation of Donne”
                        (<title level="m">Poetical Works </title>1101). Here he takes up the
                    possibility, already broached in “Limbo,” that human beings may enter the
                    “future state” of nonexistence, but for now considers the implications of that
                    possibility for the significance of human life as it is lived. If human beings
                    face a blank nothingness after death, the poem suggests, then the value of life
                    itself is cancelled. Accordingly, in this poem positive negation is neither what
                    the living fear nor an agency that interdicts God’s activity but an absence that
                    transforms the positive itself into a nullity, into a “Blank accident” (14). If
                    human life is mortal, the poem suggests, then the exemplary figure of “positive
                    Negation” is the human being, who ultimately personifies the nothingness that
                    she must face, as if to instance in another way what is visible in Milton’s
                    Death. Yet here that trope uniquely appears not as a ghost, monster, allegorical
                    construction, structural principle, or demographic driver, but as the living
                    human being. </p>
<p> In that respect, Coleridge’s nullified subject comes into close proximity with
                    the subject of Hegel’s <title level="m">Phenomenology</title>.<note place="foot">In the Preface to that work, Hegel crucially places his account of
                        “tarrying with the negative” in the context of the demand to confront death;
                        for him, Spirit “wins its truth only when, in utter dismemberment, it finds
                        itself.” Moreover, in his depiction of this tarrying, Hegel gives death’s
                        negativity a certain positive force, a face: “Spirit is this power only by
                        looking the negative in the face, and tarrying with it.” In this key
                        passage, Hegel arguably places a version of positive negation (negation
                        given a face, voice, or agency) at the heart of his project. See Hegel
                        19.</note> Indeed, one can trace in this poem certain features of a
                    dialectical shift: the transformation of an external or future nullity—death, a
                    future state of nonexistence—into an internal or present one. Here the subject
                    is placed in dialectical relation with death, except that in this case, no
                    negation of the negation takes place, no sublation of the subject’s mortality.
                    Here one arrives at “positive” negation not through a dialectical reversal of
                    the negative but through its intensification, its emergence as an even more
                    clearly delineated instance of the negative, one that leads to nothing other
                    than itself. This poem thus anticipates those who refuse the turn whereby Hegel
                    transforms the negative into the starting point of the subject’s becoming (cf.
                    Bataille); instead, it transforms nullity into a higher version of nullity, into
                    a subjectivity nearly indistinguishable from its own future inexistence. Where
                    Hegel affirms and dialectically transposes the subject’s mortality, Coleridge
                    refuses to accept it; for him, a subject characterized by its negation becomes
                    the very emblem of absurdity and inexistence, of a life lived under the shadow
                    of what Tilottama Rajan has in another context called “unusable negativity”
                    (46). </p>
<p> Of course, the poem is meant in part to explore a <title level="m">reductio ad
                        absurdum</title>, to conceive of the ludicrous implications of what its
                    title marks as the “denial” of the immortality of the soul. As several scholars
                    have suggested, the fact that the poem is written in the conditional mode—“If
                    dead, we cease to be” (1)—signals that it takes up a contrary-to-fact scenario,
                    a possibility excluded by the theology Coleridge articulates in many of his late
                    writings (Kessler 69–80; Vaz-Hooper).<note place="foot">Insofar as the poem
                        pursues this approach, it deploys a strategy characteristic of the late
                        theological writings. A key passage of the <title level="m">Opus
                            Maximum</title>, for example, maintains that “[w]e affirm” that work’s
                        central postulate “&lt;not&gt; because we . . . comprehend the
                        affirmation, but because we clearly comprehend the absurdity of the denial”
                        (221). On negative proofs in that work, see Evans 17, 36–38, 59,
                        105–117.</note> But such is not its entire purpose, for it also takes up the
                    concern with hopelessness or loss which informs a half-dozen lyrics he composed
                    after 1805, from “Constancy to an Ideal Object” through “Love’s Apparition and
                    Evanishment,” and thus exemplifies what Eric Wilson has described as the poet’s
                    “double vision,” his ability to linger with opposed possibilities (xiii).<note place="foot">The most significant poems in this group (apart from several
                        notebook fragments) include “Constancy to an Ideal Object,” “The Blossoming
                        of the Solitary Date-Tree. A Lament,” “The Visionary Hope,” “Limbo,” “Ne
                        Plus Ultra,” “Human Life, On the Denial of Immortality,” “Work Without
                        Hope,” “The Pang More Sharp Than All: An Allegory,” “Phantom or Fact?,” and
                        “Love’s Apparition and Evanishment: An Allegoric Romance.” The fact that
                        Coleridge wrote so many poems of such ambition on these themes suggests that
                        together they constitute a key dimension of his corpus, an important—if less
                        discussed—dimension of his authorship.</note> This lyric, in short, balances
                    itself between the scorn for disbelief and the lyrical evocation of a negated
                    state; it explores nonsense seriously, articulating the nearly inexplicable
                    logic of the theological uncanny.</p>
<p> Initially it charts its concerns by suggesting that a purely mortal life, in
                    finding no realization after death, consists of nothing but biological life,
                    nothing but “sound,” “motion,” or “breath” (4, 5)—not so much bare life as
                        <emph>wasted</emph> life. In a later passage, the poem extends this thought
                    by suggesting that such a life’s “laughter and tears / Mean but themselves”
                    (17–18)—in effect, that even nonverbal expressions cease to find their place in
                    any code. The reflexive consciousness of this state is equally futile; as the
                    poem later suggests, it would be just as useless to mourn the passing of such a
                    life as to attempt <emph>not</emph> to mourn it. To react to it in
                        <emph>any</emph> fashion, it suggests, would be vacuous: “Yet what and
                    whence thy gain, if thou withhold / These costless shadows of thy shadowy self?
                    / Be sad, be glad, be neither! seek, or shun!” (25–26). Moreover, it contends
                    that the defeat of signification also defeats affect itself, making “dreams” and
                    “hopes and fears” equally weightless (16–17). The poem thus expresses a longing
                    for the <emph>gap</emph> between sign and signified, between nonverbal
                    expression and code; the absence of that gap, it seems, cancels significance,
                    emotion, and purpose alike, as if in its absence existence remains so
                    insistently literal that it cannot even attain to the minimal, impoverished
                    status of the pure signifier. In the poem’s account, only a possible immortality
                    can ground meaning; without that immortality, human life has an uncanny status,
                    for having only “phantom purposes,” it becomes merely an “Image of image, ghost
                    of ghostly elf” (9, 23)—a ghostly “gust[]” and no more (3).<note place="foot">My
                        thanks to Brian McGrath for the suggestion that “gust” resonates with the
                        theme of the ghost and phantom throughout the poem.</note>
</p>
<p> But if it is merely an image <emph>of</emph> image, ghost <emph>of</emph>
                    ghostly elf, then it replicates a nonexistence it shares with the nonhuman
                    world; what precedes and generates it is a phantom like itself. The absence of
                    substance in human life implies in retrospect the absence of substance in nature
                    as well. The poem thus begins to outline a logic of nullity’s perpetual
                    replication, whereby the absence of immortality undoes the substance of human
                    being, which in turn demonstrates the absence of being in nature.</p>
<p> Although it often relies on this repetition of futility across several
                    registers, and thus on a sort of flat “hauntology” (Bryant 245–90; Derrida 10),
                    in a key passage it interrupts that prospect as it depicts the moment in which
                    nature produces humankind: <quote>
<lg>
<l> O Man! thou vessel purposeless, unmeant,</l>
<l> Yet drove-hive strange of phantom purposes! </l>
<l> Surplus of nature’s dread activity, </l>
<l> Which, as she gazed on some nigh-finished vase,</l>
<l> Retreating slow, with meditative pause,</l>
<l> She formed with restless hands unconsciously!</l>
<l> Blank accident! nothing’s anomaly! (8–14)</l>
</lg>
</quote> At first a reader might think that in these lines apostrophe,
                    which may be taken as a trope that typically animates or gives life, instead
                        <emph>dis</emph>animates “Man.”<note place="foot">For a key intertext here
                        see the passage in which Sara Guyer follows Barbara Johnson’s discussion of
                        lyric animation, apostrophe, prososopeia, and abortion (11–20). “Human Life”
                        for a moment deploys similar tropes to figure what one might call an
                        animated instance of nonlife (or abortive creation), but it eventually
                        resorts to a slightly different set of tropes as discussed below.</note> But
                    rather than being reducible to flat nothingness, human life soon attains the
                    status of “surplus” or “anomaly,” terms that retain the sense of the purposeless
                    or unintended but that also hint that human life <emph>exceeds</emph> mere
                    blankness. Indeed, if nature—herself an instance of personified nullity, of
                    positive negation—could interrupt herself and create humankind with “restless
                    hands unconsciously,” then humankind is the surplus of an unconscious act, a
                    slip of the hand, something unmeant—but still exceptional and potentially
                    significant in the way that the father’s “unmeant” words in the Conclusion to
                    Part II of <title level="m">Christabel</title>, for example, still retain an
                    unconscious import (cf. Mileur 63–66).<note place="foot">The prospect of
                        interpreting nature as a nullity with restless hands would, of course,
                        ordinarily vex Coleridge, but such a rendition of nature is not entirely
                        outside the realm of his thought; on his difficulty in establishing a firm
                        interpretation of nature within the context of natural religion, see
                        Brice.</note> A phantom, it seems, is not merely nothing; insofar as it
                    instantiates an impulse that caused an artist meditatively to interrupt her task
                    of shaping a “nigh-unfinished vase,” it reveals a <emph>telling</emph>
                    nothingness, one that would intrude into the activity of positive creation to
                    produce the anomalous signifier. In this respect, it enacts an agency quite
                    similar to the interruptive power we encountered in “Ne Plus Ultra,” the sort
                    capable of interdicting the activity of a god; after all, if nature here is in
                    the midst of producing an artifact such as a vase, she may be informed by the
                    capacity for creative intention, however dreadful her activity may be. In that
                    case, however, humanity remains distinctive as the product of an
                        <emph>unconscious</emph> act, a cryptic intention. Since the poem regards
                    humanity as “nothing’s anomaly,” as if nature here is synonymous with the
                    nothing, perhaps it suggests that <emph>nullity, through its power to interrupt
                        itself, can produce something distinctive, something irreducible to bare
                        absence</emph>. Of course, the poem almost simultaneously suggests that the
                    significance of that accidental surplus must remain “blank,” that the unmeant
                    can never attain positive meaning. Yet the anomalous blankness to which it
                    points suggests that human life is a meaningfully meaningless interruption, a
                    significant insignificance, a distinctive sort of nonsense—in effect a semiotic
                    and ontological phantom. </p>
<p> In the absence of a gap between affect and meaning appears another gap: that
                    between nothingness and its surplus. This second gap enables human life to
                    become more than merely literal, for its status as unconsciously generated
                    surplus makes it an enigmatic signifier, even if one deprived of any code in
                    which it can make sense. That development, however, suggests as well that the
                    negative has not merely replicated itself across registers, for by interrupting
                    itself it gives the further version of nullity a distinctive import. As if to
                    confirm these suggestions, in its final line—which, as Onita Vaz-Hooper points
                    out, as a twenty-ninth line, constitutes a surplus within a poem that otherwise
                    consists of two complete sonnets (536–37)—the poem does not claim that human
                    life lacks being; on the contrary, it broaches the possibility that the human
                    “being’s being” is contradiction, suggesting that one finds contradiction in the
                    being <emph>of </emph>human being, the difficult shift from one level to
                    another. In some measure, then, that line registers the deadlock inherent in the
                    status of being nothing’s anomaly and, through its very status as surplus,
                    insists on the haunting quality of that useless excess.</p>
<p> These possibilities may return us as well to the invocation of Milton as a
                    highly conventional emblem of theological, political, poetic, and personal
                    immortality (7). On one level, this passage invites us to consider and repudiate
                    the apparently absurd possibility that such a figure could “know death,” could
                    indeed cease to be. Yet until his correction to the poem’s proofs, Coleridge had
                    written, “And <emph>when</emph> a soul like Milton’s can know death” (<title level="m">Poetical Works</title> 1101), gesturing toward the possibility,
                    which still lingers in the published version of the poem, that perhaps so great
                    a soul as Milton’s could do that difficult thing and <emph>know</emph> death,
                    could contend with the impossible task of grasping it—or that so great a poet as
                    Milton, through his figure of Death, could create the template for later
                    attempts, indeed for Coleridge’s own effort in this poem.<note place="foot">For
                        a contrasting reading of the revision of this line consistent with her
                        overall account, see Vaz-Hooper, 538–39.</note> By suggesting, even in such
                    a cryptic manner, that such an act might be done, and to some extent attempting
                    to carry it out in its own right, the poem hints that attempting to know a final
                    death could be its most urgent, if undeclared business, as if it could set
                    itself the task of exploring the possibility of a certain impossibility, the
                    presence of a certain absence.</p>
<p> Thus this poem in certain moments articulates a distinctive rendition of
                    negativity, conceiving of a broadly Gothic a/theology or hauntology that refuses
                    the dialectical process visible in Hegel in favor of a proto-psychoanalytic
                    account. Indeed, Coleridge’s most direct interlocutor may be Lacan, whose sense
                    that the subject is an enigmatic signifier that ultimately lacks an Other in
                    which that signifier would attain a secure meaning (cf. Žižek 110–128) and which
                    can perhaps best encounter itself anamorphically in the image of a skull (Lacan
                    79–90) matches well with the indications in this poem. But the poem may
                    anticipate Lacan in these ways precisely by making explicit those elements of
                    Romanticism on which psychoanalysis eventually draws, taking its place within
                    the long genealogy of a certain rendition of human inexistence.</p>
<p> In doing so, the poem also entangles that genealogy with other important
                    strands. In his recent book, <title level="m">Minding the Modern</title> (2013),
                    Thomas Pfau lucidly designates the Coleridge of the <title level="m">Opus
                        Maximum </title>as his chief exemplar of one who, living in the midst of
                    modernity, nevertheless sustains and advocates those concepts of person,
                    relationship, and normative framework, inherited from Aristotle, Augustine,
                    Aquinas, and others, that modernity has forsaken (Pfau). But one might well take
                    up a question Pfau does not consider: whether Coleridge’s positive theology
                    might be shadowed by another discourse, not by a concession to modernity
                        <emph>per se</emph>, but rather by the counterside of theological certainty
                    itself, a poetics that finds in that contrary domain the distinctive
                    possibilities of positive negation. Such a poetics might anticipate as well
                    certain a/theological features of recent thought, not least in Lacan, where
                    negativity continues to assert its rights, even over against the apparent
                    nullity of the human condition.</p>

<div type="abstract">
<p rend="noCount">This article takes up the act of retreating or withdrawal as a way
                    of reading the unpublished and published versions of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's
                    "Christabel." Although Coleridge intended to publish "Christabel" in the second
                    edition of the <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> in 1800, the poem was
                    withheld from publication until 1816 and further revised by Coleridge until
                    1834. Rather than reading revision as clarifying authorial intention, or seeing
                    less revision as creating more indeterminacy, I see Coleridge's revisions to
                    "Christabel" as representing revision in a third sense: considerable revision
                    that appears insignificant but instead compounds the indeterminacy of the text's
                    writing. Taking up Coleridge's addition of <title level="m">The Conclusion to
                        Part the Second</title> as well as the modifications to the primary scene of
                    unreadability between Geraldine and Christabel, I argue that Coleridge's
                    repeated retreating and returning to these scenes are symptomatic of a traumatic
                    relation that cannot be read in terms of authorial intention, but rather, in the
                    words of Catherine Malabou, as an involuntary retreat that "the psyche cannot
                    stage . . . for itself" (Malabou 9). </p>

<head>The Immaterial “Christabel”: Reading Revision Before and After
                    Publication</head>
<div type="section">
<p> The idea for this essay emerged because of an article by Catherine Malabou
                        in the journal <title level="m">Public</title> entitled “Is Retreat a
                        Metaphor?” (2014). Retreat, it is true, is an act, but a negative one that
                        negates even the decision to retreat, because “there can be no retreat,” in
                        Malabou’s words, “without a retreat of the retreat itself, no retreat
                        without a re-doubling, to the extent that the only gesture or move
                        retreating can perform is to perform nothing, that is, to retreat”
                        (“Retreat” 35). For Malabou, the retreat cannot be economized. Retreating
                        does not, then, perform the move of withdrawing, as in the negative ebb to
                        the positive flow of the ocean, and neither is it a remove from the
                        profanity of the world towards some posited purity in absolute privacy. In
                        contrast, the retreat demonstrates effectively “what it is not, that is
                        . . . [not] a form of presence, be it God, substance, or reality”
                        (“Retreat” 35). Much like what Derrida says of literature, there is in the
                        retreat, “a chance of saying everything without touching upon the secret” of
                        the retreat, for in the act of retreating, the retreat itself remains
                        perpetually barred (“Retreat” 29). </p>
<p> Though not mentioned in Malabou’s article, Jean-Luc Nancy and Philippe
                        Lacoue-Labarthe had earlier theorized an alternative version of the retreat
                        in <title level="m">Le Retrait du Politique</title> (1997). Their position
                        remains tentatively hopeful, for the “retreat,” according to Nancy and
                        Lacoue-Labarthe, “makes something appear or sets something free,” not
                        “according to the rule of a nostalgic lamentation for what would have drawn
                        back . . . but according to the hypothesis that this retreat must
                        allow, or even impose, the tracing anew of the stakes of the political”
                        (131). Rather than take a position, they argue for a
                            “<emph>de</emph>-<emph>position</emph>” as a sort of
                            <foreign>Aufhebung</foreign> that thinks the limits of the political and
                        the philosophical while still holding both in reserve for something yet to
                        come (94). The hopefulness that is sketched out by this idea of the retreat
                        relies on the possibility of retracing a new ground for the political, as
                        both theorists argue in another essay, “The Jewish People Do Not Dream”:
                        “[t]o draw back [<foreign>se retirer</foreign>] is not to disappear, and
                            <emph>is</emph> not, strictly speaking, any mode of being. . .
                        . [T]he <foreign>retrait</foreign> is the action of disappearing appearing,”
                        which means that one does not merely “appear <emph>in </emph>disappearing,”
                        but rather one “appear[s] <emph>as</emph> disappearance” (qtd. in Sparks x). </p>
<p> In her own way, Malabou recognizes Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe by means of
                        Derrida, as she mentions that Derrida notes, in “The Retreat of Metaphor,”
                        that the limits that separate authenticity and inauthenticity have become
                        “absolutely porous” (Malabou, “Retreat” 37). Malabou continues that this
                        results in an “aporia [that] does not equate [to] an impossibility,” but
                        rather allows for the possibility to “still invent a new meaning for a
                        retreat, . . . open a new possibility of withdrawing
                        . . . [for] something yet to come,” or as Nancy and
                        Lacoue-Labarthe would say, clear the ground for a new encounter at “the
                        incision” of the retreat (Malabou “Retreat” 37, Nancy &amp; Lacoue-Labarthe
                        133). However, Malabou herself withdraws performatively, as her text moves
                        from the conditional tense of the “I would have liked to dwell” towards, as
                        she says, an other Catherine, one enveloped involuntarily that “suddenly
                        become[s] motionless and speechless, “ one that “would lie in bed often with
                        her eyes open but with a blank facial expression,” only to return again to
                        the anxious hopefulness of the conditional tense (“Retreat” 36). If
                        Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy wish to retreat as a means towards de-positioning,
                        Malabou’s performance demonstrates the fragility that underscores
                        de-position’s purposelessness; the retreat cannot be intentional, according
                        to Malabou, for from where would one have the authority to withdraw, to
                        retreat from the political in order to re-treat it? </p>
<p> While Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe are concerned with re-treating the
                        political––which Malabou categorizes along the lines of several voluntary
                        and intentional retreats of past figures such as Maurice Blanchot, Alexander
                        Grothendiek, and Thomas Bernhard––Malabou’s concern is with the retreat as
                        something that is accidental, making retreat impossible as a result of its
                        traumatic immediacy. For Malabou, the retreat, then, is not something chosen
                        because the subject is indifferent to the retreat. She writes that
                        “indifference” is “undecided, unvoluntary, non-chosen,” while its “rhetoric
                        comprises figures of interruption, pauses, caesuras––the blank spaces that
                        emerge when the network of connections is shredded or when the circulation
                        of energy is paralyzed” (“Retreat” 41). She further elaborates this position
                        of indifference in <title level="m">Ontology of the Accident</title> (2012),
                        where she distinguishes indifference from sorrow: indifference “is the
                        suffering caused by an absence of suffering,” a suffering in which pain
                        “manifests as indifference to pain, impassivity, forgetting, the loss of
                        symbolic reference points” (Malabou, <title level="m">Ontology </title>18).
                        Finally, in <title level="m">The New Wounded</title> (2012), the retreat’s
                        affective mode of indifference is linked to the indifference that arises
                        after neuronal trauma or the trauma of the accident, as distinct from the
                        definition of trauma offered by traditional psychoanalysis. Trauma, which is
                        associated with “permanent or temporary behaviors of <emph>indifference
                        </emph>or <emph>disaffection</emph>,” “thus designates the wound that
                        results from an effraction––an ‘effraction’ that can be physical (a ‘patent’
                        wound) or psychical. In either case, trauma names a shock that forces open
                        or pierces a protective barrier” (Malabou, <title level="m">New Wounded
                        </title>10, 6). Whereas Freud may emphasize that trauma is endogenous to the
                        psyche, Malabou expands on Freud’s analysis by including the exogenous
                        causes of trauma by integrating recent studies in neurology. In this sense,
                        Malabou’s definition of trauma recognizes that the alterations to the ego
                        that are caused by external trauma have the potential to “manifest
                        themselves as an <emph>unprecedented metamorphosis </emph>of the patient’s
                        identity,” effectively creating a new person that is cut off from their past
                        selves (<title level="m">New Wounded </title>15). Trauma, then, becomes
                        something “the psyche cannot stage . . . for itself” (Malabou,
                            <title level="m">New Wounded </title>9). Because of this change that
                        results in an indifference or disaffection, any agency linking the subject
                        to the retreat has been shattered, so that there is no longer any
                        possibility for re-treating the political. In the case of the traumatic
                        event that is exogenous to the psyche, one cannot speak of the intentional
                        retreat; rather, one can only identify the involuntary retreat that is seen
                        in the destructive negativity and unproductivity of trauma, which nullifies
                        the circulation of desire.</p>
<p>Because Coleridge withheld “Christabel” from publication for seventeen years,
                        it is not only necessary to re-analyze the act of withholding as a retreat
                        of a voluntary kind, but also to consider the retreat as that which is
                        indifferent with regard to the imperative towards productivity implied by
                        the act of publication. The non-publication of “Christabel” poses a problem
                        because it begs the question: what was Coleridge trying to preserve by
                        withholding “Christabel,” and from what was he retreating? Furthermore, it
                        leads us to ask: can we even read the decision to withhold a text from
                        publication? And if so, how can we read the negativity of that which appears
                        only by not appearing, that is the immaterial, which is and is not there?
                        And yet, because we cannot read that which is not there, I intend to read
                        the different versions of “Christabel” before and after publication as a way
                        of developing the concept of the retreat; for, if Derrida is correct to
                        state that the line between the public and the private is absolutely porous,
                        the unpublished versions that come before the first published edition in
                        1816 mark a way of reading Coleridge’s retreat from publication in the sense
                        of Malabou’s failure of the retreat more than Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe’s
                        re-treating the political. </p>

<head>A Practical and Theoretical Approach to Revision</head>
<p>Before turning to an analysis of “Christabel,” it is necessary to outline its
                        textual history. Thanks to the work of Jack Stillinger, whose <title level="m">Coleridge and Textual Instability</title> (1994) lays the
                        groundwork for all further studies on the versions of “Christabel,” we have
                        available the most well-composed textual and compositional history of the
                        poem. Stillinger outlines the poem’s textual history from its earliest
                        stages all the way to the final versions that Coleridge was involved in
                        revising: <quote> For “Christabel,” which Coleridge began writing in 1798,
                            expanded in 1800, and then tinkered with, but never completed, all the
                            rest of his life, we have or can reconstruct some eighteen versions, but
                            almost certainly there once existed several more than that in sources
                            now lost. To begin with, we know of nine manuscript versions (or partial
                            versions earlier than the first printed text of 1816: a holograph fair
                            copy of the equivalent of 1–655 (that is, part 1, the conclusion to part
                            1, and part 2) at Victoria College, Toronto (CoS 52); transcripts of the
                            same span, 1–655, by Dorothy Wordsworth and Mary Hutchinson among the
                            Wordsworth papers at Dove Cottage, Grasmere (CoS 51), Sara Hutchinson
                            (at Yale, CoS 53), Sara Fricker Coleridge, the poet’s wife (at the
                            University of Texas, Collection, CoS 55 and 58), and an unidentified
                            copyist (at the Bodleian Library, CoS 59); readings from a now-lost
                            holograph reported by John Payne Collier in his preface to Coleridge’s
                                <title level="m">Seven Lectures on Shakespeare and Milton
                            </title>(1856); and the quotation of 656–77, which later became the
                            conclusion to part 2, in Coleridge’s letter to Southey of 6 May 1801
                                (<title level="m">CL</title>, 2:278). The first printed text, in the
                                <title level="m">Christabel</title> volume issued by Byron’s
                            publisher, John Murrary, in May 1816 (<title level="m">1816</title>),
                            can count as the tenth version. There are at least five subsequent
                            versions constituted by changes and additions that Coleridge and others
                            entered by hand in copies of 1816 [(CoS 60, CoS 61, CoS 62, CoS 63, CoS
                            64)]. The last three versions are the texts in <title level="m">1828</title>, <title level="m">1829</title>, and <title level="m">1834</title>. (<title level="m">Coleridge</title> 79)</quote>
                        Stillinger’s position regarding the versions is two-fold. First, because
                        Coleridge revised his texts so many times throughout his life, Stillinger
                        argues that “the longstanding practice of identifying definitiveness with
                        ‘final authorial intention’ is no longer defensible” (<title level="m">Coleridge </title>10). Second, Stillinger suggests that a practical
                        theory of versions should adopt an approach of “textual pluralism,” which
                        would make “every separate version” have the right to “its [own] separate
                        legitimacy,” so that “all authoritative versions [would be] equally
                        authoritative” (<title level="m">Coleridge</title> 121). This position,
                        similar to those propounded by “James Thorpe in the 1960s and then developed
                        and championed . . . in Germany by Hans Zeller, in the United
                        States by Jerome McGann, Donald Reiman, [and] Peter Shillingsburg,” would
                        thus displace final authorial intention, and finally take into account the
                        fact that authors revise (<title level="m">Coleridge </title>121).</p>
<p>Revision, therefore, becomes a sign that allows one to read the differences
                        in versions as not better or worse, because these versions are legitimate,
                        discrete authoritative works in themselves. Stillinger compares writers who
                        revise—such as Coleridge—to writers who revise very little, for example John
                        Keats. What is most remarkable about the latter is “Keats’s facility in
                        drafting upon, or for, an occasion” all at once, and the fact that “there is
                        practically no evidence that he wrote his longer or more ambitious poems in
                        any other way” (<title level="m">Coleridge </title>102–03). On the other
                        hand, Coleridge’s revisionary practice is a way for Stillinger, according to
                        his “Old Critical and . . . New Textual point of view,” to read
                        authorial intention into the revisions Coleridge made to his texts (<title level="m">Coleridge </title>100). The spontaneity with which Keats wrote
                        his poems stands in contrast, for Stillinger, to Coleridge’s inveterate
                        revising. For instance, Stillinger quotes a letter Coleridge wrote to Joseph
                        Cottle on February 1797: “‘I torture the poem, and myself, with corrections;
                        and what I write in an hour, I sometimes take two or three days in
                        correcting,’ such as is the case with ‘The Religious Musings, [which] I have
                        altered monstrously’ (<title level="m">CIL</title>, 1: 309)” (qtd. in
                        Stillinger <title level="m">Coleridge </title>104). In this sense,
                        Coleridge’s mode of composition required of him to become both “critic<emph>
                            and interpreter</emph> of what he had initially created without a plan,
                        and now, in these subsequent stages of writing, <emph>added authorial
                            intention</emph> that was not consciously present in the original
                        composition” (Stillinger, <title level="m">Coleridge </title>107). In order
                        to account for revision while still maintaining authorial intention,
                        Stillinger thus states that one can read revision as adding in authorial
                        intention to a text that seemingly showed an unclear authorial intention at
                        the outset of composition.</p>
<p>That Coleridge revised “Christabel” many times is clear from the many
                        versions before and after publication. And yet, the revisions Coleridge made
                        to “Christabel” were so minimal, changing a word here, a comma there,<note place="foot">In fact, Coleridge’s modifications only become more
                            aggressive after publication, after the text is given over to the
                            public. In this sense, Coleridge’s withholding shows a markedly
                            different form of revision that attempts to maintain a personal
                            connection in the unpublished versions that is separate from and yet
                            still attempts to maintain a connection with the symbolic order. The
                            effect of publication shows revisionary practices that are more
                            concerned with impersonal pronouns, and increasingly shifts towards a
                            more mediated and generic gothic poem that attempts to retreat from the
                            destructive limits the poem transgresses before publication.</note> that
                        they lead Stillinger to revise his own thesis in <title level="m">Coleridge
                            and Textual Instability</title> (1994) about Coleridge’s revisionary
                        practices. This is made clear in a footnote that Stillinger adds as he
                        theorizes the revisions Coleridge made to “Christabel” and “Kubla Khan”:
                            <quote> If there is a causal relationship––in Coleridge’s not rewriting
                            the two poems [“Christabel” and “Kubla Khan”] to add authorial intention
                            in the way I have described––then perhaps a tentative generalization is
                            in order: the more revision in a Coleridge poem, the greater the
                            likelihood of receiving determinate (authorial) meanings––and,
                            conversely, the less revision, the greater the indeterminacy. (<title level="m">Coleridge </title>246)</quote> However, the differences
                        and repetitions involved in returning, retracing, or re-treating
                        “Christabel” show that there is something that perhaps gripped Coleridge in
                        a third sense that even Stillinger, despite the modification he makes to his
                        own argument, has not yet taken into account. For if the quantity of
                        revision in a Coleridge poem should indicate more determinate authorial
                        intention, and if less revision indicates a more indeterminate intention,
                        Stillinger does not account for the fact that in “Christabel” there is
                        considerable revision that appears <emph>insignificant </emph>but still
                        compounds the indeterminacy of the text’s meaning. If we invert Stillinger’s
                        argument, this third sense of revision is defined by changes whose
                        negativity turns over and over again around an insoluble secret which
                        retreats from the author, thereby substituting the fetish of revision for
                        clarification. Despite his claiming that he had a clear intention in his
                        mind, “Christabel” appeared to have a libidinal hold on Coleridge that he
                        could not quite shake, as can be seen in his inability to truly revise the
                        poem, that is, not until his first attempt to relinquish it by giving it
                        over to the public by means of its publication in 1816. In this manner, the
                        endless revisions delayed ever having to end the poem, and thus prolonged
                        Coleridge’s libidinal relation to the text, since, in the words of Žižek in
                            <title level="m">Looking Awry</title> (1991), desire “does not consist
                        in its being ‘fulfilled,’‘fully satisfied,’” but “coincides rather with the
                        reproduction of desire as such, with its circular movement” (7). </p>

<head>Revision, Retreat, and the (Un)public Sphere</head>
<p> Coleridge, as many know, had at best an ambivalent relationship with the
                        public sphere in England. “The word ‘public,’ he claimed, was ‘of pernicious
                        effect by habituating every Reader to consider himself as the Judge &amp;
                        therefore Superior of the Writer,’” and Coleridge believed, in the words of
                        Lucy Newlyn, that “readers were . . . appealed to as an infallible
                        judge: he dismissed them himself, sweepingly, as ‘the half-instructed Many’”
                        (qtd. in Newlyn 52). Coleridge’s general dismissal of the growing reading
                            public<note place="foot">Coleridge’s intentional withholding of
                            “Christabel” from publication can be read more generally in terms of
                            Romanticism and its relation to “publics” and “counter-publics.” For
                            instance, the intentional act of withholding a work from publication
                            shows that the unpublished is at times dialectically related to the
                            published in the same way that spheres of the counter-public attempt to
                            respond to the hegemony of the public sphere. Andrew Franta’s argument
                            in <title level="m">Romanticism and the Rise of the Mass Public</title>
                            (2007), “that the regime of publicity could be employed to manipulate
                            the very notion of representation—not by transforming debate into
                            consumption but by bypassing debate altogether,” signals that
                            Coleridge’s anxiety over the public’s power to bypass interpretation
                            altogether was an all too common concern (33). For more research
                            concerning the relation of the public sphere and Romantic authors see

                        seemingly be read as a dismissal of his early communitarian ideals such as
                        his scheme with Robert Southey to establish a Pantisocracy; this dismissal,
                        it would seem, is further reinforced by his later desire for the
                        establishment of the “clerisy” class in <title level="m">On the Constitution
                            of Church and State</title> (1829). As Jon Klancher notes in <title level="m">The Making of English Reading Audiences</title> (1980),
                        Coleridge’s “clerics were meant to be . . . masters of
                        interpretation,” that is, they were meant to take possession of what could
                        be read, “to rule in and rule out the possible readings of social and
                        cultural discourse,” effectively mirroring Coleridge’s relationship with his
                        own texts as simultaneous critic and interpreter (5, 136). However, as
                        Newlyn argues, “[i]f Coleridge’s ideas about literary ownership reflected
                        his political ambivalence, more generally, towards the idea of property,
                        they can also be read as paradigmatic of the transitional status of the
                        author at the time <title level="m">Biographia </title>was published” (69).
                        What Newlyn shows is that Coleridge’s anxiety over the reader is not merely
                        an anxiety concerning his work’s reception by the public sphere; his anxiety
                        was both internal and external. The unpublishability of “Christabel”
                        directly threatens Coleridge’s idea of a class of readers that have the
                        ability to judge and interpret texts, and, therefore, represents a danger to
                        himself and to the very community of the clerisy that he envisions.
                        Coleridge’s retreat can then be read as symptomatic of his growing anxiety
                        over the poet’s failure to critically engage with and direct the
                        constitution of that public sphere, because “Christabel” is as much about a
                        neurotic obsession over an unconstitutable negativity as it is a repression
                        of that negativity, confronting its readers with a poem that remains
                        consumed with an anxiety regarding its own publishability. Taken this way,
                        Coleridge’s decision to finally publish the poem in 1816 may be read not
                        only as a historical fact, but can be read through the lens of Lacanian
                        anxiety, as Žižek argues, because “it is not the lack of the object that
                        gives rise to anxiety but, on the contrary, the danger of our getting too
                        close to the object and thus losing the lack itself”; taken this way,
                        Coleridge’s anxious revisions provide insight into the complex relation that
                        anxiety has to desire at the level of publication, as “[a]nxiety is brought
                        on by the disappearance of desire” (8).</p>
<p>Through withholding a work from publication, the negative right to retreat
                        not only disturbs the notion of work as a material object, but also
                        deconstructs the insistence of public sphere theorists––such as Jürgen
                        Habermas and Clifford Siskin––that literature must be interpreted as a work
                        of writing under a discourse of the professionalization of the author. Even
                        in its early conception, “Christabel” was defined by its own
                        unpublishability. The poem was originally planned for the second volume of
                        the 1800 version of the <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, but
                        instead was replaced with Wordsworth’s “Michael,” which Wordsworth quickly
                        finished off in order to fill in the gap. The reason for the replacement is
                        not known, but we do know that Wordsworth, in a letter to his publishers,
                        Longman and Rees, stated, “upon mature deliberation I found that the Style
                        of this Poem was so discordant from my own that it could not be printed
                        along with my poems with any propriety” (qtd. in Gamer and Porter 31). After
                        1800, Coleridge circulated and performed versions of “Christabel” for
                        friends and family, and, as Christopher Laxer notes, the poem gained
                        popularity among the British reading public due to the fact that Coleridge
                        “controlled all access to his poem and could frame the perception of it in
                        any way he liked” (169). However, while Laxer argues that Coleridge held on
                        to “Christabel” because “publication itself shines a destructive and
                        leveling sort of light” (176), one could argue that Coleridge began to lose
                        control over “Christabel” well before its publication, at both the level of
                        writing as well as at the level of performance. Indeed, Walter Scott did not
                        hear it first from Coleridge, but from Sarah Stoddart in 1802, showing that
                        well before its publication the poem had already begun to circulate outside
                        of Coleridge’s immediate control. Furthermore, the impression that
                        “Christabel” left on Scott was seen not only in its metrical resonances in
                            <title level="m">The Lay of the Last Minstrel</title>, but also in
                        Scott’s recitation of the poem, which, it turns out, was how Lord Byron had
                        “first heard the poem . . . at his publisher Murray’s house on
                        Albermale street,” which in turn is the reason for Byron’s involvement in
                        putting Coleridge in touch with Murray, who later published the poem in 1816
                        (Laxer 170). Indeed, Coleridge, when he first wrote the <title level="m">Preface</title> to “Christabel” for its initial publication, “feared
                        his own work would appear derivative of precisely those poems and poetic
                        identities that it had helped to shape” (28), as Tilar Mazzeo notes in
                            <title level="m">Plagiarism and Literary Property in the Romantic
                            Period</title> (2007). Mazzeo continues, “Christabel” “had been widely
                        circulated in manuscript among the literary coterie, and, as Coleridge knew,
                        the poem had influenced the compositions of some of his more celebrated
                        contemporaries, including Lord Byron and Walter Scott” (27). For this
                        reason, Coleridge ends his preface to “Christabel” with a “doggerel version
                        of two monkish Latin hexameters”:<quote>

</quote> From one perspective, Coleridge’s decision to
                        withhold “Christabel” from publication can be read as an attempt to preserve
                        a relationship between author and text. But every time Coleridge returns to
                        the text, it signals a further loss of authority. It is important to note
                        that the decision to remove the poem from <title level="m">Lyrical
                            Ballads</title> arose out of an agreement between Coleridge and
                        Wordsworth, allowing us to read this decision to quarantine the poem not
                        only as a means to preserve Wordsworth’s style, but also to preserve
                        Coleridge’s own. While “Wordsworth’s exclusion” of the poem, argues Jerome
                        Christensen, “registers the threat that [“Christabel”] represented as
                            <emph>text</emph> (and, in the character of Geraldine as performative
                        theory of the rhetorical power of texts) to the <title level="m">Lyrical
                            Ballads</title> as book,” the non-publication of “Christabel” was also
                        extended to Coleridge’s other publications, when Coleridge did not include
                        the poem in the quarto volume containing “Fears in Solitude” (217). And when
                        “Christabel” was finally published alongside “Kubla Khan” and “The Pains of
                        Sleep,” it is telling that Coleridge did not try to publish the poems as a
                        book, but rather, as Stillinger has called it in <title level="m">Romantic
                            Complexity</title>, “a pamphlet,” a medium of print that, ever since the
                        sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, because of the influence of Calvin and
                        Luther, was overwhelmingly political (<title level="m">Romantic Complexity
                        </title>163). The pamphlet, as Laurel Brake argues, is profoundly dialogic
                        and in “dialogue with other agents of print and speech,” and to quote Orwell
                        in Brake’s essay, “it is written because there is something that one wants
                        to say now . . . in essence it is always a protest” (3). </p>
<p>And yet, the pamphlet is also closer to the fragment<note place="foot">Because Romanticists have long approached “Christabel” as a fragment
                            poem, it is important to mention some of the most important work on the
                            Romantic fragment, such as Marjorie Levinson’s <title level="m">The
                                Romantic Fragment Poem: A Critique of a Form</title> (1978) and
                            Thomas McFarland’s <title level="m">Romanticism and the Forms of Ruin:
                                Wordsworth, Coleridge, the Modalities of Fragmentation
                            </title>(1981). However, rather than considering the fragment as an
                            intentional form, I argue that “Christabel” evokes the externally
                            unintended, unanticipated, and traumatic sense of Malabou’s use of the
                            term “effraction,” which requires a shift of focus away from the
                            fragment as an unfinished project towards something more akin to the
                            project’s disintegration, which is radically more negative.</note> or
                        even the manuscript than to the serialized publication or the book, since
                        pamphlets were “normally unbound . . . [and] not always aimed at
                        public, or <emph>wide circulation</emph>” (Brake 8). Indeed, as is shown in
                        a letter Coleridge wrote to Sarah Stoddart in 1803, Coleridge’s intention to
                        publish “Christabel” remained always in flux. Insofar as he considered
                        publishing it, his plan was at least never to put it in a “guinea volume,”
                        as Karen Swann notes: Coleridge “[refused] Sotheby and the ten gentlemen
                        [that accompanied him], [so that] Coleridge [stood] on his literary
                        principles” and would rather have “Christabel” published on Ballad paper
                        (397). Thus on the one hand, the pamphlet, like the ballad sheet, is still
                        aligned with the publicity of print and is categorically different from the
                        private circulation of manuscript culture. But, on the other hand, if the
                        pamphlet remains a medium of print that is devoted to protest, it also
                        troubles the Habermasian conception of the public sphere, which, as Lee
                        Morrissey argues, is based on the false “presumption of a mutually
                        reinforcing relationship between literary criticism and democracy” (2).
                        Instead, the publication of “Christabel” in the form of a pamphlet
                        participates in and simultaneously questions the very form in which the
                        public sphere is constituted, inasmuch as Coleridge attempts to publish a
                        text that thematizes its own retreat from the circulation of a symbolic
                        order. The medium of the pamphlet invites readers to consider the
                        relationship between literature and the public sphere as one that is not
                        mutually reinforcing, but rather unstable and even antagonistic, since the
                        pamphlet’s engagement with the political does not have the transparency of a
                        Habermasian communicative rationality. Much like de Man’s conception of
                        language, which “combines a logical side, which it is possible to decode,
                        and a ‘tropological’ or metaphorical side, which stays as a ‘residue of
                        indetermination’ after a decoding of the grammar has occurred,” Morrissey
                        argues that literature opens the political to that which is left unread,
                        which results in the paradox: “the avoidance of one side of the meaning is
                        unavoidable” (9). As opposed to Coleridge’s hope that the clerisy would be
                        able to become critic and interpreter for the public sphere, the revisions
                        he made to “Christabel” before and after publication thus commit him to a
                        different conception of the political and the public sphere that remains
                        under erasure. Because of the act of revision, as well as the choice of
                        publishing in the form of the pamphlet, the boundary between the published
                        and the unpublished, or the public sphere and the (un)public sphere remains
                        in question, leaving open the indeterminacy that ungrounds them both.</p>

<p>While the published version offers one interpretation of the life of the

                        Bellemin-Noël calls the <emph>avant-texte</emph>, these can be read
                            genetically<note place="foot">The <emph>avant-texte</emph> is, according
                            to the work of Jean Bellemin-Noël, “the totality of the material written
                            for any project that was first made public” (31), so that any return to
                            those pieces that remained unpublished represents an attempt to read the
                            collection of manuscripts, notebooks, and other texts in the space
                            surrounding a published text psychoanalytically rather than for
                            continuity. The concept of the <emph>avant-texte</emph> is related more
                            generally to the field of genetic criticism, a mode of textual studies
                            and textual history that moves the study of manuscripts away from merely
                            establishing a fair or accurate copy of a text. Reading genetically
                            moves one away from reading for the “final” text, and provides readers a
                            way of dialectically relating the <emph>avant-texte</emph> to the
                            published or public text in order to re-construct the writing
                            process.</note> so as to “reconstruct the configurations of unconscious
                        desires that [allow] themselves to be seen” in “Christabel,” which opens the
                        possibility to reconstruct the “unconscious discourse [that] slips into
                        conscious discourse” (6). While it has been noted that Coleridge rarely
                        changed “Christabel” in significant ways, the one major revision comes in
                        the form of <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the Second</title>,
                        which was originally from a letter addressed to Robert Southey dated May
                        6th, 1801, and which was later transposed into the first published version
                        in 1816. <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the Second</title> of
                        “Christabel” is so strangely placed that it somehow appears out of place.
                        Indeed, if we compare the 1816 version of the poem with its prior versions,
                        there is no Conclusion of any kind, so that the
                            <foreign>avant-texte</foreign> provides us with a more formally
                        fragmentary and unstable poem; even the first of two transcripts by Sarah
                        Stoddart ends with the words, “A fragment” (Stillinger, <title level="m">Coleridge</title> 214). In a poem so obscurely uncertain of itself, the
                            <title level="m">Conclusion</title> appears as yet another failed
                        attempt made by Coleridge to close off the poem and make it ready for the
                        public. And yet, this crossing-out or repression of the poem’s fragmentary
                        condition indicates an attempt at “a mechanism of production” (Bellemin-Noël
                        6), because “[negation],” as Freud has noted, “is a way of taking cognizance
                        of what is repressed; indeed it is already a lifting of the repression,
                        though not, of course, an acceptance of what is repressed” (235–36). Because
                        the transcripts leave the reader with Sir Leoline leading forth Geraldine,
                        and because the narrator of <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the
                            Second</title> appears unwilling to admit the psychological trauma that
                        is central to the text yet exceeds the limits that <title level="m">The
                            Conclusion </title>attempts to impose, Christabel seems more abjected in
                        the first published version of 1816 than in the various earlier versions.
                        Rather than concluding the poem, then, <title level="m">The Conclusion to
                            Part the Second </title>disfigures the very possibility of completion,
                        for it replaces the thematic of the mother and daughter relationship found
                        in <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the First</title> and substitutes
                        the Wandering Mother for the Name of the Father. When Christabel confronts
                        Sir Leoline, entreating him to send Geraldine away, we do not see a
                        resolution, but instead the Baron is revolted by his own daughter, as the
                        narrator explains, “[i]f thoughts, like these, had any share, / They only
                        swell’d his rage and pain, / And did but work confusion there” (“Christabel”
                        625–27). This rage Sir Leoline feels is fueled by Christabel’s perceived
                        incongruity with the symbolic order, which the father wishes to establish by
                        means of exchanging Geraldine for the renewed friendship of Lord Roland de
                        Vaux of Tryermaine, a friendship long lost that left a hole in both men’s
                        hearts “[l]ike cliffs which had been rent asunder” (“Christabel” 410). Since
                        “never either found another / [t]o free the hollow heart from paining”
                        (“Christabel” 407–08), Geraldine functions as a means of re-establishing
                        discourse between the two men, and thereby restoring the homosocial bond
                        with Lord Roland by means of the feminine signifier. As Kristeva says of the
                        father’s relation to the abject in <title level="m">Powers of Horror</title>
                        (1982), “a representative of the paternal function takes the place of the
                        good maternal object that is wanting,” resulting in discourse “being
                        substituted for maternal care” (45). What <title level="m">The Conclusion to
                            Part the Second</title> effectively represses is not merely Christabel,
                        but the conflict that is staged at the end of <title level="m">Part the
                            Second</title>, that is the conflict between speech and the unspeakable.
                        Taken this way, the repression of Christabel’s inability to speak results in
                        the text’s missed opportunity to engage with the retreating retreat, which
                        then haunts the poem in Coleridge’s repeated attempts to revise the
                        poem.</p>
<p> Arguably the narrator of <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the
                            Second</title> is “Coleridge,” inserting himself to limit the poem by
                        means of form and genre, and is separate from the narration that is present
                        throughout <title level="m">Part the First</title>, <title level="m">The
                            Conclusion to Part the First</title>, and <title level="m">Part the
                            Second</title>. While both narrators are characterized by a tendency to
                        repress that which they cannot accept, the first narrator appears at least
                        willing to show but not tell, while the second narrator appears to downplay
                        the experience of Christabel altogether, and instead shifts the perspective
                        to the experience of the father as a kind of substitute for the authority of
                        the writer. That <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the Second</title>
                        also originates from a letter Coleridge wrote to Southey is yet another
                        indication of Coleridge’s new presence at the end of the poem. Much like the
                        way <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the Second</title> focuses on
                        the role of the father as a means of further shifting focus away from
                        “Christabel”’s unfinished ending, the fact that Coleridge replaces the more
                        descriptive narration of the first narrator with a theorization on the
                        “words of unmeant bitterness” (“Christabel” 652) indicates a retreat away
                        from the unconscious of the text; for even in <title level="m">The
                            Conclusion to Part the First</title>, the narrator appears unwilling to
                        tell but still knows of the “sorrow and shame” (“Christabel” 296) that had
                        taken place between Christabel and Geraldine. Even in the <title level="m">Biographia</title>, Coleridge attempts to downplay the spectral
                        presence of the unknown in “Christabel”, describing it rather as a “work . .
                        . that pretended to be nothing more than a common Faery Tale” (238). <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the Second</title> also presents
                        Coleridge explicitly attempting to impose the generic form of the fairy tale
                        to “Christabel,”<quote>
<lg>
<l>A little child, a limber elf,</l>

</lg>
</quote> But what is it that Christabel finds? On the contrary, is
                        she not seeking something at the beginning of the poem? One can see the
                        split in the narration between that which comes before and after <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the Second</title>, as the first
                        narrator even admits his confusion as to why Christabel is seeking something
                        that “makes her in the wood so late, / A furlong from the castle gate”
                        (“Christabel” 25–26), while the second narrator, “Coleridge,” seems to have
                        a slightly sadistic relation to Christabel’s desolation, as can be gleaned
                        from the assertion that it is “tender too and pretty / [a]t each wild word
                        to feel within / A sweet recoil of love and pity” (“Christabel” 672–74). But
                        while the narrators of the poem fail to recognize that Christabel seeks
                        recognition––which she finds in the figure of Geraldine, though
                        negatively––they, along with Geraldine as “A sight to dream of, not to
                        tell!” (“Christabel” 248), and the Wandering Mother that only Geraldine
                        seems capable of seeing and interacting with, are symptoms of Coleridge’s
                        repression of the absence that the text does not or cannot speak. For the
                        first narrator describes the traumatic encounter but does not seem to
                        realize that it has taken place, whereas the second narrator attempts to
                        sentimentalize the poem as a means of containing the trauma that comes
                        through at the level of writing; for the second narrator is not willing to
                        give voice to the trauma of the text, though it is recognized negatively by
                        means of the addition of <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the
                            Second</title>, which represses the ending of <title level="m">Part the
                            Second</title> . This traumatic absence comes through, and “even
                        contrives,” to quote J.C.C. Mays, “to become a metrical event” in the tale,
                        so “that the true subject of the poem is only part-contained in words” (72).
                        For instance, the em-dash that occurs when Christabel first hears the moan
                        on the other side of the old oak tree, “It moan’d as near, as near can be, /
                        But what it is, she cannot tell,—” (“Christabel” 41–42) the break in
                        narration at line 42 implies the unknown known of the text, that is, in the
                        words of Joel Faflak, the “de-humanizing generation of affect that resists
                        intellectual or textual containment” (145). </p>
<p> Whereas Coleridge’s non-publication of “Christabel” could be read as a
                        voluntary retreat, a decision to withhold the poem from the public as a
                        means to contain its fragmentary condition, the publication of the poem
                        presents the reading public with the involuntary retreat of Christabel as
                        subject. This involuntary retreat clashes with the assumed Romantic retreat
                        of the poet from the world of politics into nature, as Christabel does not
                        retreat as a placeholder or reserve to re-treat the political “world of
                        death” (Coleridge 321). Christabel’s withdrawal signals a way of reading the
                        retreat at a further remove from historicist narratives that read
                        Romanticism as an intentional retreat away from the public, because
                        “Christabel” as text and Christabel as character both present specifically
                        involuntary examples of the retreat that do not conform to preconceived
                        Romantic shelters in the natural or the transcendental, thus forcing us to
                        re-think these issues more generally. Consequently, the difference between
                        the voluntary and involuntary here shows that the initial retreat of
                        non-publication still implies a will to power, a hope for completion, and
                        for an end to the infinite project of writing that is implied in Coleridge’s
                            <title level="m">Preface</title> to the poem. There, he writes,
                            <quote>But as, in my very first conception of the tale, I had the whole
                            present to my mind, with the wholeness, no less than with the liveliness
                            of a vision; I trust that I shall be able to embody in verse the three
                            parts yet to come, in the course of the present year. (<title level="m">Preface</title> 161)</quote> It is telling that by the last version
                        that Coleridge revised, which was printed in 1834, this sentence was not
                        included in the text’s <title level="m">Preface</title>. Instead, what we
                        are left with is Christabel’s involuntary withdrawal from language “in the
                        touch” of Geraldine’s “bosom” that becomes the “lord of [Christabel’s]
                        utterance” (“Christabel” 255–56). </p>
<p> This scene has its parallel with Hegel’s description of the master-slave
                        dialectic in <title level="m">The Phenomenology of Spirit</title> (1807).
                        There, Hegel argues that once the difference between master and slave is
                        achieved, the dialectic gives way to a new moment when “servitude in its
                        consummation will really turn into the opposite of what it immediately is;
                        [because] as a consciousness forced back into itself, it will withdraw into
                        itself and be transformed by independent consciousness” (117). It is then
                        that the difference is negated once again, resulting in a negation of the
                        previous negation, which is meant to provide the grounds for liberated
                        consciousness. Christabel’s withdrawal, on the other hand, appears to show
                        that the involuntariness of that retreat presents itself as an effraction
                        that results in disaffection, neutrality, and the inevitability of
                        abjection. Instead of the liberation of consciousness Hegel describes,
                        Geraldine is not present for her, because she is rather another symptom of
                        absence, so that Christabel’s encounter with Geraldine eliminates and voids
                        recognition as evidenced by the effect of Geraldine’s “serpent’s eye” upon Christabel.<quote>

</lg>
</quote> Rather than interiorizing Geraldine as other in the way
                        that Hegel expects, Christabel internalizes Geraldine’s absence, because
                        Geraldine represents in the text an absence in the form of the Lacanian
                            <foreign>objet petit a</foreign>. In Žižek’s words: <quote> [T]he object

                        the narrator shies away from telling the reader what Christabel herself
                        sees, because Geraldine must never be looked at directly; for if seen,
                        Geraldine could no longer be the “lord of thy utterance” and the mechanism
                        by which language continues to circulate and thus perpetuate the symbolic

<p> “Geraldine,” as Coleridge told Henry Nelson Coleridge in July of 1833, “so
                        far as she goes, is successful”; but the success, the achievement that is
                        Geraldine, stands in contrast to Coleridge’s failure to complete the three
                        parts yet to come. <quote> [T]he reason for my not finishing Christabel is
                            not that I don’t know how to do it; for I have, as I always had, the

                            not carry on with equal success the execution of the Idea– the most
                            difficult, I think, that can be attempted to Romantic Poetry–I mean
                            witchery by daylight. (<title level="m">Table Talk </title>1:
                            409–10)</quote> The missing parts to “Christabel” have become a kind of
                        trope at the level of composition for reading the poem as a failure, partly
                        due to Coleridge’s habit of constantly telling people that he had “the whole
                        present to [his] mind, with the wholeness, no less than with the liveliness
                        of a vision” (<title level="m">Preface </title>161). But the publication of
                        “Christabel” alongside “Kubla Khan” and “The Pains of Sleep” indicates a
                        thematic ambivalence with respect to making known the unknown that these
                        texts seem to communicate at the level of affect. For instance, the affect
                        in “Kubla Khan” is nostalgic, as the narrative voice asks itself if it is
                        possible to accomplish its desire, the narrator questioning, “[c]ould I
                        revive within me / Her symphony and song / . . . I would build
                        that dome in air” (“Kubla Khan” 42–43, 46); and, in “The Pains of Sleep,”
                        what is communicated is the affective anxiety that comes from desiring to
                        withdraw from “[d]eeds to be hid which were not hid, / Which all confused I
                        could not know, / Whether I suffered, or I did” (“The Pains of Sleep”
                        27–29). Until the pamphlet’s first printing, one could read the retreat from
                        publication as a desire to withhold—to be with and to hold on to—these
                        poems, both out of a desire for completion and because of Coleridge’s
                        fascination with the poem, for Coleridge was in many ways compelled to
                        recite “Christabel” “in societies of the most different kinds” (<title level="m">Biographia</title> 238). And yet the act of publication, if we
                        take the verb “to publish” literally in its meaning “to make something
                        public” or “to make something known,” can be read as Coleridge’s attempt to
                        retreat from his relation to the poem, as he literally gives over
                        “Christabel” to the public, which would be in line with Peter Melville’s
                        approach to reading Coleridge’s poetics “through the fort-da mechanism”
                        (107). If the figure of Geraldine is the success of “Christabel,” perhaps
                        the failure to write the next three parts is due to the effect of
                        representing that “witchery by daylight,” resulting in a text that is
                        mesmerized by but can never actually speak its desire. As <foreign>objet
                            petit a</foreign>, Geraldine stands for the absolute negativity of the
                        Real, but, by the same token, remains a part of the text so as to generate
                        desire in all its manifestations. In this sense, Geraldine guarantees the
                        libidinal economy of the text, but one that, as Kristeva argues, “maintains
                        the symbolic order through exclusion” (Kristeva 10). Coleridge’s pleasure in
                        reading aloud can then be read against the grain as the pleasurable pain of
                            <foreign>jouissance</foreign>, as he even remarks in the <title level="m">Biographia Literaria</title> concerning the experience of the
                        “enkindling Reciter,” that it “is equally possible” that “a reader left to
                        himself should sink below the poem, as that the poem left to itself should
                        flag beneath the feelings of the reader” (<title level="m">Biographia
                        </title>239–40). As Coleridge was well aware, it was possible for a reader
                        to be enlivened by the performance of a poem, but the affective potential of
                        a poem may be too overwhelming in solitude; as such, Coleridge’s decision to
                        publish comes from the need for the distance of publication, of
                        relinquishing the text to a public, to preserve the desire for completion by
                        retreating from the poem itself, in the same way that he discusses the
                        possibility of pleasurable pain at the end of the poem: <quote>
<lg>
<l>And pleasures flow in so thick and fast</l>
<l>Upon his heart, that he at last</l>
<l>Must needs express his love’s excess</l>
<l>With words of unmeant bitterness.</l>
<l>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . </l>
<l>Perhaps ‘tis tender too and pretty</l>
<l>At each wild word to feel within</l>
<l>A sweet recoil of love and pity. (“Christabel” 650–53,
                                    668–70)</l>
</lg>
</quote> However, the act of publication does not rid Coleridge of
                        his relation to “Christabel,” as is shown in the revisions that he makes in
                        the versions after publication, specifically those found in the five marked
                        copies of the 1816 version, and furthermore from the eleventh version to the
                        eighteenth version. For none of these additions clarify the text.
                        Significantly, the prose glosses, like those added to “The Rime of the
                        Ancient Mariner” (1798), further obscure and contribute to the fantastic
                        elements of the text: for instance, the annotations that Coleridge made to
                        lines 249–55 in 1824, “As soon as the wicked Bosom, with the mysterious sign
                        of Evil stamped thereby, touches Christabel, she is deprived of the power of
                        disclosing what has occurred” (169). Indeed, Coleridge’s lifelong revision
                        of the poem exemplifies a relationship to the text that is emblematic of
                        what Tilottama Rajan calls the “textual abject” (45). In her article, “Mary
                        Shelley’s ‘Mathilda’: Melancholy and the Political Economy of Romanticism”
                        (1994), Rajan distinguishes the “textual abject” from Kristeva’s concept of
                        the abject, thereby transposing it into a means of reading Romanticism’s
                        tendency to re-cover, “both in the sense of redeeming and of covering up,
                        the abject by absorbing its affect into narrative and explanatory
                        structures” (45). The textual abject, as opposed to the Kristevan abject, is
                        introjected instead of being cast out, because the relation becomes internal
                        to the subject in contrast to the way that Christabel at the end of the poem
                        is left abjected from the text’s libidinal economy. Indeed, the text itself
                        retreats from the abject by casting it out in so many unreadable moments,
                        and repeats Coleridge’s lifelong return and rejection of the poem, whose
                        traumatic core he cannot confront except by retreating from the facticity of
                        Christabel’s final abjection. </p>
<p> While the primary scene of unreadability wherein Geraldine reveals herself
                        to Christabel has been “read” many times as a lesbian fantasy or as a
                        demonic enchantment which threatens Christabel’s purity and innocence, these
                        prurient readings arguably remain under the same fantasy that Coleridge
                        himself perpetuates by re-turning and re-treating the text so as to re-cover
                        a relationship to the symbolic order, to quote Žižek once again, which
                        spares him “the encounter with the real of [his] desire” (60). Prior to
                        publication, Coleridge never changed the scene, but neither could he narrate
                        Geraldine’s body. Instead, he leaves us with a fragmented body, “Behold! her
                        bosom and half her side—” (“Christabel” 246), but somehow this body should
                        be “full in view” (“Christabel” 245). Another em-dash gives rise to the
                        narrator’s decision to cover over the encounter, so that this is a “sight to
                        dream of, not to tell” although one that “is to sleep by Christabel”
                        (“Christabel” 247–48). It is here, after the publication of the 1816
                        version, that Coleridge makes one of the most substantive changes to the
                        poem, as is shown in marginal and interlinear annotations in copies of the
                        1816 version of the text, where he replaces on “And she is to sleep by
                        Christabel” with “O shield her! shield sweet Christabel!” (Stillinger <title level="m">Coleridge</title> 85). In later additions<note place="foot">

<lg>

<l>Ah! what a stricken look was hers!</l>

</lg>
</quote> The most common interpretation of these changes is that
                        they result from a public outcry against the poem; however, if we read the
                        published text against its<foreign> avant-texte</foreign>, the dramatic
                        interruption of the narrator, “shield sweet Christabel,” covers over the
                        indifference present in the punctuation of earlier versions in the lines
                        such as “And she is to sleep by Christabel,” as well as “And lay down by the
                        maiden’s side” (“Christabel” 248, 250). In contrast to the earlier versions,
                        the later versions intimate a much more dramatic and anxious narration, the
                        lines cut vertically with multiple exclamation marks, which constantly
                        interrupt the text. However, the exclamation marks interrupt in a way that
                        is different from the horizontal em-dashes, which present moments of
                        unspeakable silence, in much the same way that Derrida describes the secret
                        as that which “is without content, without a content separable from its
                        performative experience” (24). Reading the versions genetically from the
                        earliest versions before publication to those after publication allows
                        readers to see the changes Coleridge makes to the passage as not merely with
                        a view to the public’s reception of the poem. Rather, the revisions
                        themselves stand in for Coleridge’s failed attempts at solving the problem
                        that arises from keeping the encounter of Christabel and Geraldine in
                        reserve. This foreclosure that prevents Coleridge from disclosing this
                        moment of the text is thus performative of the economy of the text, an
                        economy ungrounded by its own recourse to negativity, and which retreats
                        from that thing which cannot be re-invested in the economy: the secret as
                        absolute reserve.</p>
<p> This absolute reserve remains a “sight to dream of, not to tell” and thus
                        arrests Coleridge in such a way that he spends most of the second part of
                        the poem trying to de-mystify the foreclosed disclosure. Unlike Christabel
                        and Bard Bracy, where the former can see but cannot tell while the latter
                        can tell but cannot see Geraldine for what she is not, Sir Leoline sees
                        “this Geraldine,” and deems “her sure a thing divine” (“Christabel” 463–64).
                        For the Baron, Geraldine becomes the empty signifier upon which he can
                        re-constitute a relation to the public sphere with Lord Roland, and forget
                        the loss of his wife and a present life that he calls explicitly, “a world
                        of death” (“Christabel” 321). Whereas Coleridge, in <title level="m">On the
                            Constitution of Church and State</title> (1829), outlines the balance of
                        the State by means of three estates, specifically the Barons (the
                        land-owners), the merchants (the distributive class), and the clerics (those
                        in charge of the cultivation of civilization), “Christabel” offers a
                        narrative that shows the limits of reason in the prose text, showing a much
                        more affective and repressive imbalance foregrounded in the later political
                        text. In <title level="m">Church and State</title>, Coleridge argues that
                        the state relies on the “balance of the two great correspondent, at once
                        supporting and counterpoising, interests of the state, its
                            <emph>permanence</emph> and its <emph>progression</emph>” (<title level="m">Church and State </title>21; my emphasis). For Coleridge, this
                        harmony plays itself out between the two houses, “the first consisting
                        wholly of barons or landholders, permanent and hereditary senators” and “the
                        second comprising the merchants, the manufacturers, free artizans, and the
                        distributive class” (<title level="m">Church and State </title>21, 33). The
                        copula that ties these two together, according to Coleridge, is the clergy
                        or clerisy. The national clerisy are to be made up of people who are to
                        “remain at the fountain heads of the humanities, in cultivating and
                        enlarging the knowledge they already possessed, and in watching over the
                        interests of physical and moral science,” and this community is to be
                        distributed throughout the country, as was previously stated above (<title level="m">Church and State </title>34). </p>
<p> If we use Coleridge’s schemata from <title level="m">Church and
                            State</title> as an optic for the characters of “Christabel,” we can see
                        corresponding figures of permanence and clerisy in Sir Leoline and Bard
                        Bracy respectively. Indeed, Bard Bracy’s position in the text is to
                        interpret in the same way Coleridge describes the objectives of the clerisy:
                        “to preserve the stores, to guard the treasures, of past civilization, and
                        thus to bind the present with the past; to perfect and add to the same, and
                        thus to connect the present with the future” (<title level="m">Church and
                            State</title> 34). In contrast with the “custom and law” (“Christabel”
                        326) that Sir Leoline represents, Bard Bracy’s interpretation of his dreams
                        positions him as a proto-analyst of the internal state of the psyche, but at
                        the same time, his role seems to extend towards the external as well, as is
                        evident in his desire to delay Sir Leoline’s order to seek out Lord Roland
                        so as to go out and investigate the woods. As Bracy states, “[t]his day my
                        journey should not be,” (“Christabel” 528) because the dream is a sign that
                        there is something wrong with the world. <quote>
<lg>
<l>So strange a dream hath come to me;</l>
<l>That I vowed with music loud</l>
<l>To clear yon wood from thing unblest,</l>
<l>Warn’d by a vision in my rest! (“Christabel” 529–32)</l>
</lg>
</quote> When Sir Leoline only “Half-listening hear[s]”
                        (“Christabel” 553) Bard Bracy’s dream interpretation, his indifference to
                        the Bard’s request represses the role of the clerisy as analyst of the mind
                        and of the world, and, in fact, goes further by mistaking Bracy’s
                        interpretation to mean that Geraldine was “Lord Roland’s beauteous dove,”
                        and vows “With arms more strong than harp or song, / Thy sire and I will
                        crush the snake” (“Christabel” 557–59), the snake being his actual daughter,
                        Christabel. As opposed to the ideal of the clerisy Coleridge sets out in
                            <title level="m">Church and State</title>, “The bard obey[s]”
                        (“Christabel” 640) the orders of Sir Leoline, and thus represses the role
                        that balances the order of permanence with that of progress, which leaves a
                        world out of balance and Christabel alone and silent at the end of the text.
                        That Bracy is able to interpret the dream but fails to intervene in the
                        world demonstrates that the clerisy and the poet alike assume a politics of
                        the future like that of the narrator of the poem, “That saints will aid if
                        men will call: / For the blue sky bends over all” (“Christabel” 318–19).
                        However, if it is a prayer, it is one that does not inspire hope, but that
                        echoes out into a poem characterized by what Malabou calls the theatre of
                        absence, “the privileged expression of affective impoverishment and
                        destructive metamorphosis” (“Retreat” 41). The invocation of the social at
                        the end of “Christabel” reveals, on the one hand, an incapacity to move
                        beyond the fantasy that relies on a future-oriented return to a public
                        sphere, and on the other hand, it shows that this attachment requires a
                        sacrifice to the future that Christabel represents as the abject that must
                        be excluded. But, like the prayer that echoes out into nowhere, Coleridge’s
                        three parts yet to come fail to materialize because “Christabel” returns
                        Coleridge back to the point of abjection, and provokes his return to the
                        unspeakable moment at the end of <title level="m">Part the First</title>
                        instead of proceeding further into the fantasy of the social. This
                        unspeakable moment, the trauma from which Christabel withdraws, enacts
                        Coleridge’s desire to go back into the past of the text rather than keep
                        moving forward, for indifference destroys the possibility of fantasy, as a
                        result of the deep effraction, the wound from which Christabel suffers but
                        cannot communicate. It is perhaps, for this reason, that so many readers
                        return to “Christabel” because, in the words of Bard Bracy, it “would not
                        pass away––” and “seems to live upon [the] eye” (“Christabel” 546–47).</p>
