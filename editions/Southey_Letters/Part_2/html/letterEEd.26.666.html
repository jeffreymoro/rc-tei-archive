               Southey to Charles Danvers, 26 January 1802, Letter 652). The same letter to Danvers
               records Southey’s annoyance at discovering a printing error in the large copies of
               his <em>Poems</em> intended as presentation volumes. The identical error is mentioned in the letter
               to Heber, where it becomes a ‘curiosity’ that might be valued by a noted bibliophile.
               The gift of a presentation copy of Southey’s poems additionally suggests an early
               date in his friendship with Heber, whom he had met during his Welsh tour of autumn
               1801.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
