               Latin verse is the only one in which you are deficient. that worthless habit is little
               necessary &amp; may soon be acquired to the needful extent.</p>
            <p class="indent1">All this I have said that you may make your judgement knowing all the circumstances.
               the most important is upon what principles you could enter the establishment. Whatever
               your opinions be, right or wrong, they must as yet be the prejudices of friendship,
               &amp; personal attachments. it is not possible that you should yet have knowledge whereon
               to found belief or disbelief. My conduct ought not to influence yours. the cases are
               wholly different. Nor would I advise you or any one to be as inattentive to worldly
               advancement as I have been.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Should you continue in your present choice, you know your expectations. application
               may raise you to eminence &amp; affluence – you will have a profession most useful &amp; most
               honourable, &amp; if the surgical studies are at first loathsome there is pleasure enough
               in chemistry amply to counterbalance what is unpleasant in anatomy. your alternative

               increased here, &amp; my resources for the time cut off. there is the heavy charge of
               returning to look on to. a years hard labour in England will hardly make me again

               <p>Our return may probably be hastened. May is the month fixed, but the state of Portugal
                  is become uncertain &amp; dangerous. if France be resolved to shut this port also against
                  England, there is nothing but Famine to prevent her. Spain is <span style="text-decoration: line-through">weak</span> willing but weak. the force of the country absolutely nothing, no preparation whatever
                  of magazines or even ammunition. yet a French army must bring their own food – for
                  they cannot find it here. &amp; a weeks blockade would starve Lisbon, for here we are
                  dependant upon almost daily supplies by sea. We cannot protect Portugal by land –
                  France cannot support it by water – the country cannot please both powers, &amp; may be
                  ruined by either. this is exactly our state – &amp; France &amp; England are equally imperious
                  in injustice. the merchants are preparing to secure their property, those who can.
                  to the many whose trade is selling to the natives it will be utter ruin. That the
                  danger may again be bought off is merely possible. the Spanish Ambassador
