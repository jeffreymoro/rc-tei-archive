I am obliged to Burn for his offer of writing to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a>, but it will come more properly from me.</p>

               pursuit in life. but <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</a> has taken an unhappy dislike to his situation, &amp; is about to quit it. I am concerned
               very much on his account, &amp; perplexed as to settling <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a>. to educate him myself is utterly impracticable. my time was always little enough
               for my business, &amp; now I am obliged to walk eight miles a day, &amp; read &amp; write less,
               <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> I have been much indisposed in consequence of too sedentary a life, &amp; this is my

I saw enough to think the book makers who travel in Wales
               very stupid not to write more entertaining volumes. we were but seven days &amp; a half
               walking to Hereford, one of which was spent with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MaberGeorge">Maber</a>, &amp; I am sure if we had but doubled the distance I should enough matter, &amp; that new

                  </div> because from knowing the country you can judge of their merit. to me it appears that
                  the requisites for a traveller who means to publish his journal, are a quick eye &amp;
                  quick comprehension. if he can add to these botanical &amp; mineralogical knowledge &amp;c
                  it is well, but these scientific views are of less import. very few persons are interested
                  in the soil or plants of Spain, but sketches of the people &amp; scenery, if characteristic
                  &amp; well chosen, necessarily amuse every body. the book will be ready by Xmas. I am
                  sorry that we have been obliged after all to abandon the idea of giving prints, as
                  the expence would occasion loss. the first cost of engraving six only would be 36
                  guineas – which with retouching &amp; working off would run up the whole at least to 50.</p>
