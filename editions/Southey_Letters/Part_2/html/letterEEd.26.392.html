                  never saw a lad with a better capacity or with habits more compleatly bad.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ThomasDr">D<sup>r</sup> Thomas</a> has written to me. he says he has struggled hard to preserve <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Miss Tylers</a> estates for better times, that he has raisd the rentals, which will make &lt;them&gt; sell
               better if they must be sold – that till her affairs be settled he will supply her
               with money as it comes into his hands, or before, if it can be done with any convenience
               to himself. “Yet (he adds) every thing that can be done will be of no avail unless
               she will resolutely determine to live within her income.” – how <span style="text-decoration: line-through">all</span> this business can be settled I know not – as her embarrasments become more pressing
               she has let <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> know more respecting them, &amp; she is indebted to her friends more deeply than I supposed
               or than <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ThomasDr">D<sup>r</sup> Thomas</a> can imagine. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a> must certainly be removed – the situation is ruinous to him. his restraints &amp; indulgencies
               are equally improper. he is never suffered to play with his school-fellows – therefore
               whenever he has been playing he comes home with a falshood to excuse himself. he has
               been so much her companion that he has all the forward tittle-tattle of an old superannuated
               Master-of-the-Ceremonies. he has no diffidence, no sincerity – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">the boy</a> has lived so much in the theatre that he is perpetually acting a part. of me &amp; only
               of me he stands in some awe – but the moment he is out of my sight he is doing something
               wrong, &amp; neither repeated detection, reproof nor admonition seem to have &lt;any&gt; effect
               in curing him of falshood. Nothing can be so ruinous as living with a person whom
               he does not love &amp; does not respect. I shall be in town the first of May &amp; will take
               measures for settling him.</p>
