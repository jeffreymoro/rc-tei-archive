                  before a voyage –! Falmouth too does not exhilirate me. I am in the room where I met
                  poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LovellRobert">Lovell</a> – the last man with whom I shook hands before I left England – as I was stepping into

                  did not walk up one hill, so slight were the ascents. At Lostwithiel after breakfast
                  we embarked &amp; got safely – half a mile out of the town. then the horses stopt. not
                  from fatigue, for they were fresh. it was pure restiveness – a more vicious spirit
                  never filled a four-legged animal than was in the head &amp; the heels of our shaft horse.
                  the Postilion was as obstinate as the beast. &amp; while we below the hill, fought him
