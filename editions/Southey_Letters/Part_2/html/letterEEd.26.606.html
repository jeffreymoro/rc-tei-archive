                  will not make amends to me for English climate. The truth perhaps is that I never
                  felt the want of it in Portugal. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My Uncle</a> with me was always the man of letters, &amp; the many points in common to us quite hid
                  the difference of age &amp; the utter dissimilarity of opinions on more important but
                  not every day topics. When I lost <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BarkerMary">Miss Barker</a>, I soon found you – your loss drove me to the old folios. I should miss Mrs Gonne

                  to any foreign country I should carry so much local ignorance as would make any common
                  acquaintance interesting. The lowest Franciscan knows something which is worth knowing
                  &amp; I would willingly endure the odour of one of these oily garlicky fellows a whole
                  evening to learn from him the history of his daily life. For this reason dull company
                  has sometimes been interesting to me at Lisbon, &amp; many a one there who never thought
                  himself, has given me the materials of thinking. I am going seriously to work at French,
                  so as to write &amp; speak it. My Portuguese is easily converted into Italian – or Spanish
                  should Madrid happen to be my place allotted, which I should hope it would not be,
                  were it not for the old Spanish poets. My worst &amp; least curable deficiency is the
                  finger-fault. Zounds that I should be able to paint what I hear &amp; feel – &amp; yet so
                  utterly at a loss to paint what I see. Were we but as near neighbours as we have been
                  &amp; as I heartily wish we were I should take your drawing book out in my walks &amp; screw
                  up my mouth to explain on my return in French that this stood for a church &amp; that
                  for a tree.</p>
