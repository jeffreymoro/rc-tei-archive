                  is painful. I do not love to write concerning what I never mention. I am very well

                  my fortune at a subscription. I will print it for a guinea – in one quarto if possible

                  without being published. because if it fails I can better go to a bookseller. if you

                  course no money till delivery of the book. A subscription for 300 copies would insure
                  me far more profits than the sale of an edition to a bookseller who always must make

               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> was made acquainted with it almost at the time. it has been so much the subject of
               my thoughts &amp; dreams, that in compleating it – in sending quite off what has been
               so peculiarly &amp; solely my own – there is a sort of awefulness – a feeling as if one
               of the purposes of my existence will then be accomplished. Of its destiny I have a
               clear foresight – it will procure for me little profit – fresh notoriety – the censure
               of town readers, &amp; the love of a few country readers. some present envy, &amp; a fame
               as lasting as the English language &amp; the passions &amp; affections of man. You Grosvenor
               put you that down in the preface if ever you edit a posthumous edition of my works;
