            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Amid the bustle &amp; everlasting motion in which of late I have been engaged, I have
               neglected to apprize you of my goings on. partly indeed trusting that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</a> would learn every thing worth knowing from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">his Mother</a>.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Soon after my letter to him I joined my friends in Wales. we made what was designed
                  to be our first journey, which terminated at Llangedwin, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynns</a> abode. there I found a letter inviting me to Ireland to become <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CorryIsaac">Corrys</a> private Secretary for one year. the term prudently limited lest we should not suit
                  each other. the proffered salary 400£ Irish. about 350 English, of which the half
                  was specified as travelling expences. my circumstances neither required nor allowed
                  hesitation. So after touching at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> twice, on my road to &amp; from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Dublin">Dublin</a>, here I am in my scribe capacity. My friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickmans</a> acquaintance with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CorryIsaac">Corry</a> brought this about. he is Secretary to Abbot.

                  </div> &amp; his residence in <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Dublin">Dublin</a> will render my Irish half year very endurable, as he is one of the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">most</span> men whom I most esteem for his whole moral &amp; intellectual character</p>

               <p>I have been a week in town, &amp; in that time have learnt something. the civilities which
                  already have been shown me discover how much I have been abhorred for all that is
                  valuable in my nature. such civilities excite more contempt than anger – but they
                  make me think more despicably of the world than I would wish to do. As if this were
                  a baptism that purified me of all Jacobinical sins – a regeneration – &amp; the one congratulates
                  me, &amp; the other visits me, as if the author of Joan of Arc &amp; of Thalaba

               man doubtless very desirable, tho the ladder is longer than I design to climb. my
               principles &amp; habits are happily enough settled. My objects in life are leisure to
               do nothing but write, &amp; competence to write at leisure, &amp; my notions of competence
               do not exceed 300 a year. – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CorryIsaac">M<sup>r</sup> Corry</a> is a man of gentle &amp; reconciling manners. fitter men for his purpose he doubtless

                  your literary character. to this he will not stoop – at present he has employment.
                  but he neither calculates rightly on its precariousness nor on his own fitness &amp; ability
                  to discharge it. his knowledge is not <span style="text-decoration: line-through">at hand</span> &lt;ready&gt; – like the Bank it has cash – but alas! not payable on demand.</p>
