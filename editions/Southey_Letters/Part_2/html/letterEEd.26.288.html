                  wounded, is left on the ground, &amp; carried into an alehouse close by kept by Joan &amp;
                  her sister &lt;Blanch.&gt; Some English soldiers storm the alehouse, &amp; are proceeding to
                  behave somewhat uncivilly to Joan &amp; her sister when Young Talbot enters &amp; protects
                  them. immediately both sisters fall in love with him. (do’nt swear Tom!) they make

                  Devil – (do’nt swear Tom!) up comes old Lucifer – red hot – hissing from hell. he
                  gives her a compact to sign. she hesitates. the rock opens &amp; discovers Talbot &amp; Blanche
                  in a bower, with Cupids hovering over them. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">she xxxxx xx</span> She resolves – <span style="text-decoration: line-through">the</span> &amp; signs her name in letters which appear traced in fire as she writes them. then <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Beelz</span> Lucifer gives her a banner, she proclaims her mission – takes the armour from the

                  throws them into a dungeon. they escape – another battle ensues – her sword &amp; shield
                  break – she is taken prisoner – but pardoned at the intercession of her sister – out
                  she rushes to the place of her incantation – &amp; up comes Lucifer. the rock opens &amp;
                  discovers the mouth of hell – like a large cod fish. the mouth opens – a legion of
                  Beelzebubs come out – &amp; bear in Joan amid fire &amp; flames. Tom I did not swear at all
                  this – but I believe had you been there, you would have rapped out some most seamanly
