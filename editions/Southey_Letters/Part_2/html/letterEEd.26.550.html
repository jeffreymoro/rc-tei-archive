               <p>The long intermission of my letters must not make you think I have forgotten you.
                  Since we came to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</a> I have been employd in finishing, correcting, &amp; copying Thalaba – which now wants

            <p class="indent1">You have probably heard enough of the infection at Cadiz to be anxious for information.
               our accounts agree on nothing but in the extent of the calamity. one day we are assured
               it is the Black Vomit – another day the yellow Fever, &amp; now it is ripened into the
               Plague. this only is certain that for the last ten or twelve days of our accounts,
               from 240 to 260 persons have died daily in Cadiz. whether it has extended beyond that
               city is also uncertain – some reports say it has spread to the South – to Malaga &amp;
               Alicant – others bring it to the frontier town – within 200 miles of us. We all think
               &amp; talk seriously of our danger – &amp; forget it the moment the conversation is changed
               – Whenever it actually enters Portugal – we shall probably fly &amp; probably to England.
               I hope the rains which we may soon expect will stop the contagion.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>So much have I to tell you that it actually puzzles me where to begin. – My <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</a> memorandums must be made; <span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> more than once have I delayed the task of describing this place from a feeling of
                  its difficulty. There is no scenery in England which can help me to give you an idea
                  of this. the town is small – like all the country towns of Portugal containing one
                  Plaza or square, &amp; a number of narrow &amp; crooked streets that wind <span style="text-decoration: line-through">up</span> &lt;down&gt; the hill. the Palace
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The medieval royal palace at Cintra served as a summer residence for the royal family.</span></div>
                  </div> is old – remarkably irregular – a large rambling shapeless pile – not unlike the prints
                  I have seen in old Romances of a castle or palace whose infinite corners overlook
                  the sea – two white towers – like glass-houses exactly – form a prominent feature
                  in the distance, &amp; with a square tower mark it for an old &amp; public edifice. from the
                  valley the Town appears to stand very high, &amp; the ways up are long &amp; winding &amp; weary.
                  but the Town itself is far below the summit of the mountain. You have seen the Rock
                  of Lisbon from the sea – that Rock is the <span class="ital">Sierra</span>, or mountain – of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</a>. above us it is broken into a number of pyramidal summits, of rock piled upon rock
                  – two of them are wooded completely – the rest bare. Upon one stands the Penha Convent
                  – a place where if the Chapel of Loretto had stood one might have half credited the
                  lying legend – that the Angels – or the Devil – had dropt it there – so unascendable
                  the height appears on which it stands. yet is the way up easy. on another point the
                  ruins of a Moorish Castle crest the hill. to look down from here upon the Palace &amp;
                  Town my head grew giddy, yet is it further from the town to the valley, than from
                  the summit to the town. the road up is as a terrace, now with the open heath on the
                  left all purple with heath flowers &amp; here &amp; there the stoney summits, – &amp; coombs winding
                  to the vale, luxuriously wooded, chiefly with cork trees. descending as you advance
                  towards Colares, the summits are covered with firs, &amp; the valley appears in all the
                  richness of a fertile soil under this blessed climate. The Cork is perhaps the most
                  beautiful of trees, its leaves are small &amp; have the dusky colour of evergreens, but
                  its boughs branch out in the fantastic twistings of the oak, &amp; its bark is of all
                  others the most picturesque. you have seen deal curl under the carpenters plane –
                  it grows in such curls – the wrinkles are of course deep – one might fancy the cavities
                  the cells of hermit-fairies. There is one Tree in particular here which a painter
                  might well come from England to see. large &amp; old – its trunk &amp; branches are covered
                  with fern – the yellow-sun-burnt-fern – forming so sunny a contrast to the dark foliage
                  –! a wild vine winds up &amp; hangs in festoons from the boughs – its leaves of a bright
                  green – like youth – &amp; now the purple clusters are ripe. – These vines form a delightful
                  feature in the scenery. the vineyard is chearful to the eyes – but it is the wild
                  vine that I love, matting over the hedges, or climbing the cork, or the tall poplars,
                  or twisting over the grey olive, in all its unpruned wantonness. The Chesnut also
                  is beautiful. its blossoms shot out in <span class="ital">rays</span> like stars, &amp; now its hedge-hog fruit stars the dark leaves. We have yet another Tree
                  of exquisite effect in the landscape – the fir – not such as you have seen, but one
                  that shoots out no branches, grows very high &amp; then spreads broad in a mushroom shape
                  exactly – the bottom of its head of the brown &amp; withered colour that the yew or the
                  fir always have, &amp; the surface of the brightest green. If a mushrooms serve as the
                  Pantheon dome for a faery ball – you might conceive a giant picking one of these pines
                  for a parasol. they have somewhat the appearance in distance that the Palm or the
                  Cocoa has in a print.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The English are numerous here, enough to render it a tolerable market, for sellers
               will not be wanting where purchasers are to be found. yet last year the Magistrate
               of the place was idiot enough to order than no English man should be served till all
               the Portugeuze were satisfied, one of those laws that carries its antidote in its
               own absurdity. among the people the English are in high favour. they are liberal –
               or if you will extravagant, &amp; submit to imposition, – now a Portugueze fights hard
               for a farthing. servants love to be in an English family. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">The mistress when they go</span> If a Portugueze mistress goes out she locks up her maids for fear of the men: the
               relations of the servants often insist that this shall be done. Oftentimes the men
               &amp; women servants in a family do not know each other. all kitchen work is done by men
               who sleep &amp; live below, the females are kept above, – a precious symptom of national
               morals! calculated to extend the evil it is designed to prevent – but I wander from
               <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</a>. the fire flies were abundant when we first came here – it was like faery land to
               see them sparkling under the trees at night. the glow-worms were also numerous. their
               lights went out at the end of July – but we have an insect which almost supplies their
               place – a winged grasshopper. in shape like our own, in colour a grey-ground hue,
               undistinguishable from the soil on which they live – till they leap up &amp; their expanded
               wings then appear – blue, or purple. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">at night</span> we hear at evening the grillo – it is called the cricket because its song <span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> is like that animal but louder – it is however wholly different – shaped like a beetle,
               with wings like a bee, &amp; black. they sell them in cages at Lisbon by way of singing
               birds.</p>
            <p class="indent1">We ride asses about the country – you would laugh to see a party thus mounted, &amp; yet
               soon learn to like the easy pace &amp; sure step of the John <span class="ital">burros</span>. At the S. Western extremity of the Rock is a singular building which we have twice
               visited – a chapel to the Virgin – (who is omnipresent in Portugal) – on one of the
               stoney summits – far from any house. it is the strangest mixture you can imagine of
               art &amp; nature – you scarcely at approaching know what is rock &amp; what is building. &amp;
               from the shape &amp; position of the chapel itself it looks like the Ark left by the waters
               upon Mount Ararat. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> long flights of steps lead up &amp; among the rocks are many rooms designed to house
               the Pilgrims who frequent the place. a poor family live below with the keys. From
               this spot the coast lies like a map below you – to Cape Espichel, with the Tagus.
               Tis a strange place – that catches every cloud &amp; <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxx</span> I have felt a tempest there when there has been no wind below. in case of plague
               it would be an excellent asylum. At the N. Western extremity is a rock which we have
               not yet visited where people go to see Fishermen run the risque of breaking their
               necks by walking down a precipice. – I have said nothing to you of the wild flowers
               so many &amp; so beautiful – purple crocuses now cover the ground. nor of the flocks of
               goats that morning &amp; evening pass our door. nor of the lemon gardens of these hereafter.
               Our Lady of the Incarnation will about fill the sheet. Every Church has a fraternity
               attached to its patron Saint for the anniversary festival they beg money, what is
               deficient the chief of the brotherhood supplies. for 3 or four more days preceding
               the holy day, these people parade the country with the church banner, taking a longer
               or shorter circuit according to the celebrity of the Saint, attacking the Sun with
               sky rockets, &amp; merry-making all the way. Those of whom I now speak travelled for five
               days. I saw their nature – they had among them four <span class="ital">Angels on horseback</span>, who as they took leave of the Virgin at her church door, each alternately addressed
               her, &amp; reminded her of all they had been doing to her honour &amp; glory, &amp; requested
               to continue the same devout spirit in <span class="ital">her</span> Portugueze which must infallibly render them <span class="ital">still</span> invincible: this done the Angels went into the Plaza – to see the fireworks. I regret
               much that I was not present last year when the fireworks were singularly ingenious
               as there were then – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> saw them two Lions who spit fire at each other, &amp; then they made fire from a part
               which would have been more naturally employed in water-works – &amp; then they tacked
               about, &amp; <span class="ital">bum</span>barded each other with fire – &amp; all in honour of our Lady of the Incarnation!</p>
