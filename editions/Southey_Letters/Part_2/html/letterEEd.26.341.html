                  hundred thousand Hungarians, and got such a footing in this kingdom, that he could

            <p class="indent1">In our literary desiderata, a true orthography seems particularly wanted in maps and
               geographical books, where the names are often so egregiously mis-spelt, as to make
               it difficult to recognize them as the places meant; and this error, especially in
               maps, I suspect to be principally owing to surveyors adopting the provincial pronunciation,
               which, in many instances, is quite foreign to the spelling.</p>
            <p class="indent1">There is too, a shameful neglect in the compilers of our modern gazetteers, which
               is that of copying the descriptions of places from former publications, without giving
               themselves the trouble to enquire what alterations may have taken place in the course
               of time, what improvements may have been made in public buildings, trade, or manufactures,
               &amp;c. or their decline; by which means error becomes perpetuated from one generation
               to another. Some curious specimens of which might be selected, that would prove these
               otherwise useful publications to be, in general, mere catchpennies and the sources
               of much misinformation. I am, your’s,</p>
