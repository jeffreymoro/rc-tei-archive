            <p class="indent1">My brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</a> will return to Normanstone in the course of a few days. he has been visiting at Bath,
               &amp; this has been one cause of an improper delay. I find him very greatly improved in
               every respect, indeed more so than I could have ventured to hope. it has not been
               in my power to continue his studies, we have not been under the same roof, &amp; the state
               of my health condemns me to exercise &amp; idleness. I have however seen enough of his
               acquisitions to be truly thankful for the attention which you must have bestowed upon
               him.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I thank you also Sir for noticing a tendency which it is of the utmost importance
               that he should subdue. I have myself observed the same fault &amp; endeavoured to counteract
               it <span style="text-decoration: line-through">rather</span> by example, &amp; conversations so indirect that he <span style="text-decoration: line-through">himself</span> must feel rather than perceive their object. immediate precepts would produce only
               a painful feeling &amp; a momentary effect. But he is not always with me, &amp; I am sorry
               to perceive that his other relatives want the thought &amp; the steadiness to check his
               thoughtlessness. my endeavours have been directed to impress upon <span style="text-decoration: line-through">th</span> him that without habits of frugality, it will be difficult to preserve integrity,
               &amp; impossible to retain independance.</p>

               <p>My health is considerably amended. I believe the use of the extraordinary gas

                  or employ the summer in travelling thro Vienna to Trieste is yet undetermined. If
                  our wise governors had acted with common honesty or common sense France &amp; Italy would
                  have been open.
