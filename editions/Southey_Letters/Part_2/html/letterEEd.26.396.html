                  </div> – if I had, I would immediately have written – not to have intruded on you with idle
                  consolations – but at least to say that we think of you in your affliction. I know
                  not how to address you, to say much were impertinence – &amp; yet the silence of a friend
                  is unkind. these things make one tremble.</p>

               compels us to the only source of consolation. </p>
            <p class="indent1">We have often thought of you with thankfulness &amp; regard &amp; pleasure. we shall think
               of you more frequently now in sorrow. your little girl – I hope she will be spared
               – but the life of an infant is even more uncertain than our own. it is dangerous to
               fix our affections on earth – &amp; yet unless we do what is existence!</p>
            <p class="indent1">God bless you. I will write again soon – &amp; often – any thing that but for a moment
               engages your attention now must be relief. – I write on the immediate receipt of your
               letter – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> knows not yet your loss but she will feel with you.</p>
