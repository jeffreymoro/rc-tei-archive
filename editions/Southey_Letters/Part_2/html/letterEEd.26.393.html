                           on a sliding scale on incomes from £60pa to £200pa and at 10% on incomes over £200pa.</span></div>
                  </div> is the best possible mode of taxation has long appeared to me probable. in the present
                  bill however I see great injustice &amp; great absurdity. for instance − is it not absurd
                  to make the man with 185 £ a year pay <span class="ital">more than one pound</span> a year more than him who has 184? cast your eye upon the latter part of the scale
                  &amp; you will see the same blunder at every jump. upon this scale 201 £ make a less neat
                  income than 199. are not these schoolboy blunders? you talk of the deduction for children
                  − it is too little – the man who has 60 £ a year &amp; one child − is allowed sixpence
                  a year for it. the tax certainly falls very heavy upon the rich, but the progression
                  ceased too soon. ten per cent is too much to take from 200. it is acting upon the
                  metaphor of Bishop Watson,

                  </div> &lt;of&gt; which, I have not charity enough to believe he could not himself see the absurdity.
                  you remember <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WakefieldGilbert">Wakefields</a> reply – all parts of the building may sink together – &amp; the gentlemen up stairs still
                  have their comfortable prospect – but where is the ground floor sunk to?

                  </div> – another fault is, a man is allowed a deduction for children – good. suppose he has
                  ten for instance, he avoids half the tax. the father dies – the brother has to maintain
                  the nine children – &amp; he is allowed nothing while they live in the house with him.
                  is it equitable to take the same proportion from one who supports a housefull of relations
                  – &amp; from a single unencumbered person? these things strike me as strange oversights
                  in the framers of the bill, but all remediable.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The commercial objections to it are less easily removed. in the country it must happen
               that many a man has for his commissioner his principal creditor. every body knows
               how much business depends upon credit. where is the use of secresy in this case? the
               consequence is that to keep up credit – they over-rate their income. the revenue indeed
               profits by this – but it is grievous upon the individual.</p>
