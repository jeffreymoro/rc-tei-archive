                           suppress dissent, and Southey is comparing the situation in Ireland with that of the
                           Protestant Netherlands under the absolute rule of the Spanish Catholic Philip II (1527–1598;
                           reigned 1556–1598). After a period of discontent and repression, in 1566–1572 the

                           and these included torture. The best-known local method was ‘pitchcapping’ – forcing

                  worst lengths in Ireland: not merely to compel a discovery of arms, but to compel
