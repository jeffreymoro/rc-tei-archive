            <p class="indent1">It is said that when a woman has any business to write about it always comes in in
               the postscript – my own nature is quite opposite. &amp; the reason that makes me write
               must come first.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I received from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CorryIsaac">Corry</a> my first quarters salary in advance – 87 £ English according to the then exchange.
               travelling has consumed 50 £. to remove my mother from Bristol has cost me 15–. I
               need not state other items. London <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxx</span> doubles my expenditure. I know not from what time my secretaryship is to date – if
               from my first meeting <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CorryIsaac">Corry</a> – ten weeks have elapsed. if from his summons – the quarter wants but a few days
               of its fulfillment – but a second payment cannot be expected before the end of the
               six months. – send me one draft – &amp; I will make it last till April by what else I
               can get from newspapers &amp; reviews. – then – receiving the salary at the end of the
               term, &amp; the heaviest expences &amp; embarrasments being overcome – I shall go on well
               while the sinecure continues, &amp; will never be unjust enough to receive what I do not
               want. my dear <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> it was this hope that made me joyfully connect myself with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CorryIsaac">Corry</a>. it is only this that makes me regard the probable breach of that connection with
               regret. – In my last I laid open my dreams &amp; wishes for the future – another year
               will lessen my expences – but at a heavy price. – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillMargaret">my Cousin Margarett</a> is gone! – I have just paid part of her death expences – <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxxx</span> – I hardly knew how like a sister she was to me before. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> is going – unless some sudden amendment appears – a few weeks – or even days must
               compleat the dissolution. all claims upon me for exertion will soon cease.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I never saw <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> &lt;so&gt; quiet &amp; easy a decline. the spirits still remaining – <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> enough of hope, yet still a forefeeling of the event – but without fear. – I thought
               to have written of other things – but this possesses me – &amp; these feelings are best
               kept to oneself. my own system leads me to avoid all painful feelings when we may
               avoid them – of course when they come there is no need to communicate them –</p>
