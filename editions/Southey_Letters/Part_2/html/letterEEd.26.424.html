               <p>I write to you from Minehead. we arrived here on Thursday night, I wish I could add
                  after a pleasant journey, but <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</a> state of health embittered it &amp; every hour since. Maurice,

                  proved otherwise, &amp; unless a speedy amendment take place, we must measure back our
                  way to Bristol, that she may have daily &amp; hourly advice if needful. extreme debility,
                  pains in the back &amp; bowels, &amp; a wasting away, with sleeplessness, &amp; total want of
                  appetite, these are her complaints. I am little able to attend to my usual employments.
                  restless &amp; uneasy I turn from one thing to another &amp; find myself unfitted for all.
                  Danger in her complaint there is not – there is no organic affection no part diseased
                  – but this debility – this atrophy is alarming – I fall into gloomy day dreams; &amp;
                  dread the future while I wish the present were past. her sister is with us. this is
                  fortunate. I get out a little, but the weather is cold &amp; stormy, &amp; I carry with me
                  no chearful thoughts.</p>

                  neither can he be ever quite otherwise. in sickness in poverty in death the evil extends
                  not beyond himself, he is prepared for all the contingencies of life, &amp; its close
                  is not embittered by the grief of the survivors whose happiness or welfare depends
                  upon him. it has always been &lt;my wish&gt; to die far from my friends. to crawl like a

                  but there is an interesting simplicity in the tenets it inculcates. What was Mohammed?

                  wherein does real inspiration differ from mistaken? this is a question that puzzles
                  me – because to the individual they are the same, &amp; both effects equally proceed from
                  the first impeller of all motions, who must have ordained whatever he permits. in
                  this train of reasoning I suspect a fallacy, but cannot discover it. but of Mohammed,
                  – there is one fact which in my judgement stamps the imposter – he made too free with
                  the wife of Zeid – &amp; very speedily had a verse of the Koran revealed to allow him
                  to marry her.

                           custom, which treated such a union as incest. But Muhammad received a revelation (Qu’ran

                  belief. There is but one God – this is the foundation – Mohammed is his prophet –
