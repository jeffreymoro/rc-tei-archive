               the body’s natural electricity could draw out pain and disease. He developed brass
               and iron rods of about 4 inches in length, with one flat side and one round side with
               one blunt end and one pointed end. The practitioner held the rods in his hand and
               rested the point of the rods on the skin. Then he stroked or drew the tractors over
               the unhealthy area of the body to attract and draw out affliction; see Benjamin Douglas
               Perkins (1774–1810), <em>The Influence of Metallic Tractors on the Human Body</em> (1798). The subject of much controversy, Perkinism was attacked by James Gillray
