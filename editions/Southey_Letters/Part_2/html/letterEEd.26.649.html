               <p>I should not so immediately have answered your letter but for what you have heard
                  of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridges</a> seperation.

                           He returned home in March 1802.</span></div>
                  </div> On this subject I have been silent even towards you, nor did Edith ever mention it
                  to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerMary">her sister Lovell</a> – till he had made it the talk of all his acquaintance.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Something I saw myself. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> saw a great deal. in no one instance was <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<sup>rs</sup> Coleridge</a> ever to blame. sometimes he has succeeded in provoking her by saying how <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthDorothy">Dorothy Wordsworth</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthMary">Mary Hutchinson</a> would have acted towards him – by eternally &amp; falsely praising them. &amp; he has repeatedly
               before me failed. I never saw two tempers so altered.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>He complains that she irritates him &amp; makes him so ill that he can do nothing. this
                  is a wretched excuse for idleness. ill he assuredly is &amp; that illness has perhaps
                  so changed his temper. he is in debt to the booksellers – to Johnson.

                  letters come to him which he often will not open – still they vex him – &amp; he can vent
                  the vexation only upon his wife. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> has heard him talk to her seriously of seperating – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<sup>rs</sup> Coleridge</a> never knows whether he means it or not – . she <span class="ital">now</span> knows not that his conversation with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DavyHumphry">Davy</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TobinJamesWebbe">Tobin</a> &amp;c is about his wifes ill temper – in order that it may reach Wedgwood

                  </div> thro those channels. the worst trait is he has charged her with extravagance in keeping
                  two servants. she did keep two servants for three months – that is from the time that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDerwent">Derwent</a> grew so heavy that she could not nurse him all day, till he was able to crawl about.
                  &amp; during that time <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> himself was half his time in bed &amp; had always a room &amp; fire to himself – &amp; you know
                  that in health he takes up the time of a servant in waiting upon him.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I shall write to him to say that as for seperating that will be a good thing certainly
               for both. but that he is very foolish &amp; very criminal in making his domestic disputes
               the talk of all his acquaintance – men whose system it is to <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx</span> disallow all matrimonial connections. On this subject if he will make it so publick
               I cannot be silent, because I know from what I have seen &amp; heard that the fault is
               his. she <span style="text-decoration: line-through">did</span> told him once in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</a> hearing that he had been a bad son, a bad brother, a bad friend, &amp; a bad husband.
               it stung him – because it was true.</p>
            <p class="indent1">In the first years of their marriage she often put him out of temper by urging him
               to write. this was natural enough but very unwise, &amp; she at last left it off as useless
               &amp; only productive of dissention. the fact is no wife could suit <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> – he is of all human beings the most undomesticated.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center">____</p>
            <p>Do you write to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a>. it will be better than my writing as you can state more clearly the situation of
               his things. this has been a very troublesome business to you &amp; I am heartily sorry
