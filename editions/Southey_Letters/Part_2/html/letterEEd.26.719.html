               <p>I write from Pile Inn – thirteen miles short of Neath Sunday evening Sept 20. – We
                  mist the boat on Friday &amp; were obliged to hire the small one – or lose the half day.
                  our passage was quite pleasant – on the other side Miss Shapland

                  fine as to produce, but of no remarkable beauty. On arriving I made a sad discovery
                  – a huge &amp; ugly blister on my right heel. Saturday 12 to Caerphilly – the country
                  rather better, the castle there famous – &amp; large – but not fine in its parts. a huge
                  mass but nothing when compared to Obidos or Leiria.
