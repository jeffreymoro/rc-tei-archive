            <p>My dear friend</p>
            <p class="indent1">Doubtless the date of my letter will surprize you. I hurried hither with such speed,
               as to allow myself neither leisure of time nor rest of mind for announcing to you
               &amp; the rest of my friends, my change of circumstances.</p>

                  since my return from Portugal, written to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</a>, were by him shown to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CorryIsaac">M<sup>r</sup> Corry</a>, as explanatory of my then views. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CorryIsaac">M<sup>r</sup> Corry</a> then wrote to me – offering me 200£ a year, &amp; a like sum for travelling expences.
                  for one year – that if the diplomatic line pleased me better, or promised more I might
                  get into it. – I was with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</a> in Wales when the offer arrived. there could be no hesitation in accepting it – there
                  was indeed no power of choice. I hurried back to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> – hastily prepared there, left <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">her sister</a> &amp; here I am. – as yet I have not seen <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CorryIsaac">M<sup>r</sup> Corry</a> who is from town. in the course of ten days he will probably remove to England, of
                  course I follow him, with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> to London, where we abide till June.</p>

               produced in addition to the 160 which I should have received. but if I should like
               my situation &amp; suit it, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CorryIsaac">M<sup>r</sup> Corry</a> can be a very useful friend, &amp; if otherwise, as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> observed, a diplomatic situation is more readily obtained for one who has already
               had some employment in official transactions. As yet knowing nothing of the person

            <p class="indent1">However that I have acted not only with common prudence &amp; due worldly wisdom, but
               as was incumbent upon me in my circumstances, in conformity to all reason, &amp; principle,
               &amp; duty, I feel fully &amp; entirely satisfied. how my health will bear a town life, is
               the only doubt. that I loathe &amp; abhor it with all my physical &amp; moral being is of
               inferior consideration. One obvious source of pleasure it affords – access to many
               friends. I hope &amp; expect to shake you by the hand in three weeks. but let me first
