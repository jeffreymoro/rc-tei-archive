            <p class="indent1">The Monastic History is to me extremely interesting. the detail of a very odd system.
               &amp; the biography of a very odd breed of mortals, whose cerebrella I think must have
               been organized in a different way from mine. Anecdotes of folly or fraud, &amp; not unfrequently
               of both so blended that they cannot be seperated, perpetually stimulate &amp; waken ones
               attention in these folios. they have something like the interest of a fairy tale –
               the manners, opinions &amp; feelings they describe are so utterly out of the sphere of
               English sympathy. their main historical value is mere accident. A good monk illuminates
               his own Convent only for the honour &amp; glory of the order, but we see what is passing
               by, by the light. There is a sort of sportsman-pleasure in this startling information.
               besides it always comes fairly – it is accidental – not wilfull evidence.</p>
