               <p>Throughout the winter I had a complaint of my eyes, which I may fairly estimate at
                  a hundred pounds loss. This was an evil – spring is come &amp; the complaint is better.
                  I have pored over Chronicles till they have made me ten times more in love with Portugal
                  than ever, &amp; I often push on another page that I may the sooner have occasion to return
                  there. This will be in the winter of next year. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My Uncle</a>, I hope, is fixed there. He does not at least talk of removing, &amp; the factory have
                  at last raised his salary, which they ought to have done ten years ago. When once
                  I set foot upon Portuguese ground again, I do not soon quit it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be hard to say how much of my history

                  </div> is done, so many parts are begun at once &amp; so much miscellaneous matter collected
                  – but I think the full labour of two quartoes is gone thro, tho not one in a straight
                  forward course. I could show you some passages of such fine &amp; noble incident as would
                  make the tears start. God Almighty what a people they were – &amp; what they are come
