               <p>Send me your Ink receipt – &amp; without loss of time, for look what a vile mulatto composition
                  is here, &amp; all kickman-jiggery of manuscripts must be at a stand till I get something
                  better. this being of the first importance comes first. in the same letter tell me
                  when you will set forward for these Lakes &amp; Mountains. God bless them! I look with
                  something like awe &amp; envy at their unchangeableness. It is but two years since I left
                  them, &amp; I would give two ears to wake and find it all but a dream, &amp; that I was as
                  in September 1801. but ones dreams are not at our own disposal. by day I am the great
                  Autocrat of my own thoughts &amp; feelings, &amp; could, I am sure, utter jokes &amp; quaintities
                  upon the rack. but by night the poor brain gets loose, – I &amp; the Blue Devil battle
                  it like the Persian Gods

                  Beelzebub gets at me when I am asleep, &amp; it is but poor consolation to abuse him thus

               <p>So I made this poem, &amp; then you know could laugh by way of consolation. I have you
                  to thank you for all the kind attentions we received at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Congreve">Congreve</a>. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> was certainly the better for being there. She is at first somewhat more dispirited
                  here as I expected. indeed the sight of the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">little Sara</a>, &amp; her infantine sounds produce in me more shootings of recollection than are good.

                  </div> <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> had taught me to expect something beautiful in her – she is a fine child – but like
                  other fine children. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaretEdithdau">My poor Margaret</a> was the little wonder of every one who beheld her. Sometimes I feel as if it were
                  fit that she should grow up an Angel. few men have had more of these weanings of the
                  heart from earth than have been dealt to me! All who were about my infancy are gone
                  – I have no friends left but those of my own making – all the faces that I first learnt
                  to love have been taken away, &amp; all prematurely. as far as survivorship gives the
                  feeling, I am old already – but this has been the heaviest blow &amp; has gone the deepest.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Come! if I twisted language into every possible form of invitation it could not mean
               more. I shall hardly have enough power over myself to quit the fireside till you go
               with me into the fells &amp; vallies. tell me that you will come &amp; I will write full directions
               where to stop &amp;c. You must see this country once, &amp; when could you see it so well?
               I have no fixture-feeling about me. no symptoms of root-striking here. Alas! what
               am I but a feather driven by the wind &amp; God knows where the wind may drive me next.
               When I so far forget ten years experience as to form a plan or indulge a hope – my
               heart goes to Portugal. this is a wonderful country here, it does every thing to the
               mind except gladden it – but there is a life &amp; joy-giving power in the very air of
               Portugal – even to breathe was a pleasure there – I would give one eye to blind Fortune
               if she would let me look on the Tagus with the other. N.B. She should have the sore
               one tho!</p>
