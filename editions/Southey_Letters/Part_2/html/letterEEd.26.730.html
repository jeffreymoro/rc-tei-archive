            <p class="indent1">So long a time has elapsed that I know not when I wrote last to you, or whether I
               am about to tell you what has been before communicated.</p>
            <p class="indent1">My design of residing at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> has proved abortive. the quantity of room required could not be spared, tho I had
               reason to expect otherwise. I had then to look about again – for some residence to
               suit me – &amp; hope I am in a fair way of finding one, being in treaty at present for
               a house in Glamorganshire, eight miles from Neath – in a good climate, &amp; most beautiful
               country, where food is cheap, fuel at a very low price, &amp; a canal near the house for
               regular conveyance – even from Bristol if I need it. the house is furnished – a great
               convenience as it leaves me more at liberty. in a fortnight I am to hear farther about
               it – our negociation is about certain alterations – there is a kitchen to be added
               &amp; I want a room above it – somewhat larger than the others, to be my study.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This I know has not been communicated to you before – but am not quite so sure that
                  what follows will not be a twice told tale. I went to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyJohn">John Southey</a> – that Uncle whom for 26 years I had not seen. he received me with great civility.
                  the wig that is only powdered for Sunday, was powdered in the middle of the week –
                  the Sunday coat put on – a barrel of strong beer broached, &amp; a fire lit in the best
                  parlour. good symptoms you will say but I have opened an intercourse which I know
                  not how to keep up. his talents were by nature of no common stamp – they have been
                  exclusively directed to the law, which he has now for years abandoned. his books are
                  such books as a man buys who thinks he must fill a bookcase, because a bookcase is
                  a common piece of furniture. Smollets History

                  they also have been blasted. one only passion has actuated him thro life. that of
                  accumulating money – he learnt to dislike his relations because he was afraid their
                  poverty would make claims upon his riches – &amp; now at the age of something more than
                  sixty he is without one friend in the world. his manners have grown boorish in solitude

                  left him he shook me by the hand &amp; wished me a pleasant <span class="ital">tower</span>, for I was going into Glamorganshire in quest of this house. before he saw me he
                  had said I was “a damnd shrewd fellow” – &amp; now this precious commendation is exchanged
                  for pity – my voice, he says, is gone already – &amp; doubtless he thinks that I had better
                  be thinking of my own death, than gaping for his. poor miserable man. I sate smoking
                  with him till midnight &amp; thinking how miserable he was, &amp; what he must think of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> &amp; myself, then in the room with him – who had grown up with no feeling of family love
                  – &amp; who could only be regarded by him as vultures following an army. I talked with
                  an effort – not of my own concerns – not of my family – those were subjects not to
                  be touched upon – we had no common feelings, no common interests – no common recollections.
                  time hung heavy – the mouldering of a wood fire became a perceptible sound – &amp; I never
                  ceased to hear the click of the house &lt;clock.&gt; there was no after invitation at parting
                  – nothing like – I shall be glad to see you – or hear of you – a low bow &amp; a shake
                  by the hand – &amp; I know as little as ever how to act with him. pride &amp; resentment for
                  the neglect of a common duty would have justified me in never noticing him – but what
                  intercourse can I keep up – or how? – I can only call at his house if ever my road
                  lies near it – or if any thing of importance befalls me let him know by letter – that
                  is of important good – for other news would only provoke a curse at impertinence.
                  his occupation now is farming – he has no longer strength for it &amp; means to give it
                  up – what will become of him in utter illness – without any resource, without any
                  companion – for already he has quarrelled with all his old companions from a trick
                  of thinking over words by himself till he extracts from them some uncivil sense as
                  food for resentment.</p>
