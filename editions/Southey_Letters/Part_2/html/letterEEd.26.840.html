                  the panorama from the summit is very grand – not indeed equal to what I had seen from

                  of unequalled interest, the Lake Keswick &amp; Basenthwaite lying below us, &amp; seeming
                  each to fill its vale, for the shores are merged in the mountain &amp; quite lost as you
                  look down, whereas the water lying all in light is seen in its full extent. The summit
                  is covered with loose stones split by the frosts &amp; thus gradually are they reduced
                  to a very rich soil &amp; washed <span class="strikethrough">to the</span> down to the glens, so that like old women Skiddaw must grow shorter. for some little

                  to have been called Great S. but its name hath a good &amp; most apt meaning – the loud
                  lamenter. it is a lovely stream. I have often forded such among the mountains of Algarve,
                  &amp; lingered to look at them with <span style="text-decoration: line-through">that</span> &lt;a&gt; hungry eye, if I may so express myself <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> with a feeling that it was the only time I was ever to behold the scene before me,
                  so beautiful. that feeling has often risen in me when gazing upon the permanent things
                  of Nature which I was beholding but for a time. God knows I often looked upon my poor
                  child with the same melancholy, as tho to impress more deeply in remembrance a face
                  whose beauties were certainly to change – &amp; perhaps to pass away. – How glad shall

                  the shorn lamb, should brace me up to the climate – this is the best place for my
                  sojourn. We had indeed a gloomy &amp; comfortless parting. your comfort had been more

                  – he is too clever to live, than appears to a common observer. diseases which ultimately
                  destroy, in their early stages quicken &amp; kindle the intellect like opium. it seems
                  as if Death looked out the most promising plants in this great nursery to plant them
                  in a better soil. – the Boys great delight is to get <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">his father</a> to talk metaphysics to him – few men understand him so perfectly. &amp; then his own incidental
                  sayings are quite wonderful. the pity is, said he one day to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">his father</a>, who was expressing some wonder that he was not so pleased as he expected with riding
                  in a wheel barrow – the pity is that <span class="ital">I’se</span> always thinking of my thoughts. – The Child’s imagination is equally surprizing. he
                  invents the wildest tales you ever heard – a history of the Kings of England who are

                  actually terrifies himself &amp; says I’se afraid of my own thoughts. It may seem like
                  superstition but I have a feeling that such an intellect can never reach maturity
