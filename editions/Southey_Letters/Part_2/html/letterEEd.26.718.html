               <div class="salute">Dear Wynn</div>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have been to Taunton &amp; slept two nights in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyJohn">my Uncles</a> house. he was very civil – powdered his wig which is only done on Sundays – changed
                  his vest &amp; moved into the best parlour. I found a strange man living a comfortless
                  life. his dress shabby – his manners boorish. a strong understanding wasted – &amp; good
                  feelings habitually suppressed till they have been almost destroyed. he keeps no company
                  &amp; his establishment is almost miserly. there is plenty – but every where a meanness
                  – the pride of wealth, &amp; the passion of accumulation eternally counteracting each
                  other. before I went down his phrase respecting me was that I was a damned shrewd
                  fellow – he now thinks me not long for this world – &amp; says – my voice is gone already.
                  he himself I think is nearer the end of his lease. He never said he was glad to see
                  me – never uttered a hint respecting my views in life nor those of any of his family
                  – never said he should be glad to see me again – but when <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> &amp; I left him followed us to the door – shook us heartily by the hand, &amp; wished us
                  a pleasant <span class="ital">tower</span>. he is proud of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a>, wants him to make an appearance in the world – knows he has only a Lieutenants half
                  pay – &amp; yet has not the heart to give him a single guinea. I talked with him – laughd
                  with him &amp; made him laugh – he pushd the bottle – loaded my plate with fruit – broached
                  his best beer for me –, still it was not comfortable – I heard the click of the clock
                  – &amp; the hum of the gnats at evening, &amp; the crumbling of a wood fire – &amp; a man never
                  hears those sounds if he is enjoying himself. the ice however is broke. if his property
                  takes the legal course

                  </div> had been long looking out for that inheritance – but now he has foolishly quarrelled
                  with the old man – &amp; so the only rival is removed. the chance of the reversion from
                  that quarter is greater than you allow – for he is not a hale man. I heard at Lisbon
                  that the seeds of consumption were in him. he is a good man &amp; a useful man – &amp; his
                  death would be a loss to the community. I only wish it may be his humour to continue
                  single.</p>
