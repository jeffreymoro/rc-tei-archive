               <p>My chief motive for writing thus immediately on the receipt of yours is a suspicion
                  that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaretEdithdau">my vagabond brother Edward</a> may apply to you for money, in which case you must refuse him. He writes to me some
                  ten days ago that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">his Aunt</a> has persuaded him to leave his ship that he “might smooth the pillow of her declining
                  age” &amp;c – accordingly he had done so – quarrelled with her afterwards – &amp; then knew
                  not what he should have done if some M<sup>r</sup> Barham

                           and partner in Plummer, Barham &amp; Co. How Edward Southey had made his acquaintance
                           is unclear.</span></div>
                  </div> of Exeter had not invited him to spend his Christmas there. the whelp then writes
                  to let me know this – to say he will follow what line of life I chuse – &amp; to ask for
                  money. I lost no time in telling him he must go to sea again &amp; sent him twenty shillings
                  just to pay his washing bills till a ship could be procured – not chusing to supply
                  him with more. this letter of his was directed to Bristol. Yesterday another letter
                  with the same direction found me out, from some low tradesman by the writing enclosing
                  a bill for five pounds thirteen, for acceptance drawn on me by this wretched boy –
                  &amp; stating that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">M<sup>r</sup> E. S.</a> had said I was duly advised. After consulting with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a>, &amp; knowing that such conduct must be decidedly stopt at the first I have refused
                  to accept the bill &amp; told the holder that not being advised of the cause &amp; occasion
                  I was at a loss to conceive what could have been the circumstances that could have
                  justified a respectable tradesman in cashing a bill for a boy of fifteen. I wrote
                  to him to tell him he might learn by this lesson how I was resolved to act toward
                  him, – for every good purpose I was ready to exert myself for his assistance to my
                  utmost – but never would become his accomplice in any wrong action by giving my after
                  consent or connivance. Unless I had acted thus you will feel that I should never be
                  safe. the Boy as you know has no shame – &amp; I fear no principle or feeling of good
                  to supply its place. The little that he can suffer now may prevent a more severe evil
                  hereafter. on what pretext he had taken up the money I know not – this is certain
                  that there can have been no good one – &amp; that if I permitted him to incur debts upon
                  my credit at his mercy – I should very soon become involved myself. It is by no means
                  impossible that he may apply to you, it would be quite in character with that impudence
                  which will be his ruin. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MayJohn">John May</a> will procure him a ship &amp; I shall supply him with means to join it. from the present
                  scrape he must get out as he can by refunding or returning what he may have received.
                  the more he is frightened the better. if he writes to you you will know in what tone
                  to answer him – &amp; I beseech you if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">M<sup>rs</sup> Tyler</a> should make any such application for him or for herself answer to the same purport.
                  Of the curses of life worthless relations are the worst – I may apply <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworths</a> lines &amp; say of Death that my mind – Mourns less for what he takes away Than what he

                  I may be called abroad – I may be disabled by ill health – by accidents – prevented
                  by other employments – or induced to change the mode of publication for want of success.
                  this last is very probable, indeed most probable. I rather try the experiment to satisfy
                  those who would say why did you not do so – than from any expectation of even tolerable
                  encouragement. less than 300 names will not render it prudent to publish on my own

                  the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">po</span> value of the poem when I shall be obliged to carry it to market. I get on with the
