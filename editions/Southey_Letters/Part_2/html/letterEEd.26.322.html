               <div class="l">Edith, it ever was thy husband’s wish,</div>
               <div class="l">Since he hath known in what is happiness,</div>
               <div class="l">To find some little home, some low retreat,</div>
               <div class="l">Where the vain uproar of the worthless world</div>
               <div class="l">Might never reach his ear; and where, if chance</div>
               <div class="l">The tidings of its horrible strifes arrived,</div>
               <div class="l">They would endear retirement, as the blast</div>
               <div class="l">Of winter makes the sheltered traveller</div>
               <div class="l">Draw closer to the hearth-side, every nerve</div>
               <div class="l">Awake to the warm comfort. Quietness</div>
               <div class="l">Should be his inmate there; and he would live</div>
               <div class="l">To thee, and to himself, and to our God.</div>
               <div class="l">To dwell in that foul city, — to endure</div>
               <div class="l">The common, hollow, cold, lip-intercourse</div>
               <div class="l">Of life; to walk abroad and never see</div>
               <div class="l">Green field, or running brook, or setting sun!</div>
               <div class="l">Will it not wither up my faculties,</div>
               <div class="l">Like some poor myrtle that in the town air</div>
               <div class="l">Pines on the parlour window?</div><br><div class="l">Everywhere</div>
               <div class="l">Nature is lovely: on the mountain height,</div>

               <div class="l">Where not a hillock breaks the unvaried plain,</div>
               <div class="l">The eye may find new charms that seeks delight.</div><br><div class="l">At eve I walk abroad; the setting sun</div>
               <div class="l">Hath softened with a calm and mellow hue</div>

                  at the moment when the heads of her parents are brought in to terrify her into an

                  and purity, and holy grief; it is by Carlo Dolce. I have seen many fine pictures,
