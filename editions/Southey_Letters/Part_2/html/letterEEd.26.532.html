                  strewn with sand, &amp; the houses hung with crimson damask from top to bottom. When the
                  morning arrived the streets were lined with soldiers, they marched on filing to the
                  right &amp; left. their new uniforms are put on this day, &amp; their appearance was very
                  respectable. this alone was a fine sight. we were in a house in one of the new streets,
                  where the houses are high &amp; handsome &amp; perfectly regular &amp; the street longer than
                  Redclift Street. every window &amp; balcony crowded, &amp; the Portugueze all in full dress

                  The banners of the city &amp; its various corporate trades led the way. I never saw banners
                  so clumsily carried. they were stuck out with bars – not suffered to play freely &amp;
                  wave with the wind &amp; roll out their beauties in light &amp; shade. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">their</span> sticks were stuck at right angles in the poles to carry them by – nothing could be

                  along. then came a champion in armour carrying a flag – God knows his armour was heavy

                  him on by the feet. his house, when he is at home, is the Castle, from whence he goes

                  as austere as conscientious folly could desire. the Knights of the different orders
                  walked in their superb dresses – the whole patriarchal church in such robes! &amp; after

                  the Friars – it was hot – tho temperate for the season – yet the Sun was painfull
                  &amp; on their shaven heads – they were holding up their singing books – or their hands,
                  or their handkerchiefs – or their cowls to shade them. I have heard that it has been
                  death to some of them in a hot season. two years ago at this very procession, a stranger
                  received a stroke of the sun &amp; fell down apparently dead. the Irish Friars got hold
                  of him &amp; carried him off to be buried. the coffins here are like a trunk, &amp; the lid
                  is kept open during the funeral service – before it was over the Man moved. what then
                  did the Paddies? oh to be sure &amp; they could not bury him then! – but they locked him
                  in the church instead of calling assistance, &amp; the next day the man was dead enough
                  &amp; they finished the job.</p>

            <p class="indent1">Had this been well managed it would one of the finest conceivable sights, but it was
               a long procession broken into a number of little pieces, so irregularly they moved.
               on the Prince &amp; the group about the Body of God – I like to translate it that you
               may see the nakedness of the nonsensical blasphemy – they showered rose leaves from
               the windows. The following day S<sup>t</sup> Anthony had a Procession, &amp; the trappings of the houses were ordered to remain for
               him. this was like the Lent procession a perfect Puppet Show – the huge Idols of the
               people carried upon mens shoulders. there were two Negro Saints carried by Negroes
               – I smiled to think what black Angels they must make. We have yet another Raree-show
               to see in honour of the Heart of Jesus. this will be on Friday next, – &amp; then we think
