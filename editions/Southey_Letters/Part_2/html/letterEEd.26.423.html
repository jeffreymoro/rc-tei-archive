               to have seen <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BowlesWilliamLisle">Bowles</a>, the careless fine gentleman, would have destroyed the charm of his productions,
               which have already half lost their effect from my knowledge that they did not proceed,
               that they could not proceed, from the habitual character of the man.</p>

                  – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BiddlecombeCharles">Biddlecombe</a> takes the premises &amp; keeps to himself a field belonging to them. there is a garden,
                  which we shall find unstock’d, but which stands well – it is sufficiently large to
                  hold gooseberry &amp; currant bushes for a great devourer of fruit-pies, to raise cabbages
                  &amp; potatoes enough for our consumption &amp; allow room for a few flowers next the house,
                  for I would not have my eyes &amp; nose starved in the country. there is a fishpond, supplied
                  by a spring that rises very near the house. before the door is room enough for a few
                  flowers &amp; shrubs between the house &amp; road – at present the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxx</span> space is open &amp; stoned. I look forward to many pleasant summers there, as much as
                  a man can look forward who has experienced something of the uncertainty of future
                  prospects.</p>

               the place we look to for our longest residence. I am told the scenery is wild &amp; impressive
               – there I expect to finish my play, which from the moment I quit this place, &amp; our

                  if I live it is my determination not to publish it for many years – I would build
                  upon it my after reputation, &amp; correct in the maturity of life what was produced in
                  the warmth of younger years: but I am anxious to have it ready because in case of
                  my death this work might be made of important value to my family; &amp; to neglect it
                  would be like neglecting to make a will where the property would otherwise be improperly
