            <p class="indent1">You will probably be surprized at the contents of this letter. you were however I
               believe aware that the when &amp; where of my departure from England were to be determined
               by advice from Lisbon, whither I had written stating to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> the nature of my disorder, &amp; the advice which had been uniformly given with regard
               to its remedy. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My Uncles</a> reply leaves me no choice, even if I were desirous of deferring my embarkation –
               for he has engaged a house for me &amp; arranged every thing as to furniture &amp; establishment
               – so that we are now in all the hurry of preparation. designing if possible to set
               out for Falmouth on this day fortnight.</p>

                  </div> a history fertile in magnificent actions. no country was ever more splendid in its
                  rise, or more instructive in its decline. this will be a work of much labour, but <span style="text-decoration: line-through">of</span> the execution will interest me, &amp; the end be important.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Portugal is so small a country, that a few easy journies will make me well acquainted
               with it, &amp; enable me to understand every field of battle, &amp; every siege; an important
               advantage, not easily attainable in any other country. how I go on in health, &amp; in
               occupations you shall of course from time to time be acquainted with.</p>
            <p class="indent1">It is very satisfactory to me to have my destination settled, &amp; also that it is settled
               in this way. I left Lisbon with enough regret – &amp; with enough attachment to place
               &amp; persons, to render the return there an object of much pleasant anticipation. besides,
               tho <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> my tongue be not – my ears are ready at the language, &amp; a little serious application
               in the country will make me no despicable Portugueze. &amp; I can already talk a very
               understandable lingo. the voyage is the most unpleasant business – I anticipate high
               wind &amp; low spirits – &amp; my inside – with the very recollection of past sickness, threatens
               me, &amp; omens intestinal insurrections.</p>
