               <p>I was thinking over the Iris &amp; whether or no I was not bound in conscience to the

                  you have ruined your style by germanisms, latinisms &amp; Greekisms: that you are sick
                  of a surfeit of knowledge – that your learning breaks out like scabs &amp; blotches upon
                  a beautiful face. I am led by indolence &amp; by good nature always rather to feel dislike
                  than to express it. &amp; if another finds the same fault that has displeased me in your
                  writings, have always defended them more zealously than if they had been my own. but
                  faults they are, faults anywhere, &amp; tenfold aggravated in a newspaper. how are plain
                  Norfolk farmers – &amp; such will read the Iris to understand words which they have never
                  heard before &amp; which are so foreign as not to be even in Johnsons

                  such as mere English readers can understand. Ours is a noble language – a beautiful
                  language. I can tolerate a germanism, for family sake, but he who uses a Latin or
                  a French phrase where a pure old English word does as well, by God he ought to be

                  edites the Iris. Even here I have heard it. but is William Taylor to learn that detraction
                  is the resource &amp; the consolation of inferiority – that every one of his acquaintance
                  who feel themselves inferior will gladly flatter themselves by dwelling upon &amp; magnifying
                  every error or resemblance of an error that he may commit? the world always expect
                  more than they can find, &amp; to this evil you are peculiarly subject because you have
                  hitherto kept yourself back. I doubt whether precipitancy be so dangerous as such
