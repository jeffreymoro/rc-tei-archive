                  common tragedies or comedies is easy childsplay – I should find it easier to satisfy
                  an audience than to satisfy myself. Our stage seems to have reached the very depth

                  In looking back upon the list of English plays it is astonishing among those that
                  have obtained any celebrity to see how few deserve it. Shakespere stands above all
                  other names. I never feel so proud of my country as when I remember that Milton &amp;
                  Shakespere were Englishmen, the two unequalable men. &amp; Bacon &amp; Newton in philosophy.
