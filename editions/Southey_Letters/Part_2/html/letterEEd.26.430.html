Antippas, ‘Four New Southey Letters’, <em>The Wordsworth Circle</em>, 5 (1974), 93.<br>Dating note: In his letter to Danvers of Tuesday, 20 August 1799 (Letter 428), Southey
               asked Cottle to immediately forward three copies of the recently-published <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1799). This letter is dated by Southey as ‘Sunday’ and thanks Cottle for the books,
               making its most likely date to be Sunday, 25 August 1799.</p>
            <div class="opener">
               <div class="salute">My dear Cottle –</div>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The books arrived safely. I was vexed to see the paragraph you had added to the Preface
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>‘Advertisement’, Annual Anthology (Bristol, 1799), (unpaginated). The final paragraph
                           inserted by Cottle ran as follows: ‘It is the intention of the Editor to publish annually
                           a similar volume. Communications are to be addressed to Messrs. BIGGS &amp; Co. Printers,
                           Bristol, for the Editor of the Annual Anthology. It is requested that the Writer will
                           enclose his address, that the piece may be returned, if found inconvenient to insert.’</span></div>
                  </div> – the more vexed because every person who has yet seen the volume cry out against
                  the folly of <span style="text-decoration: line-through">it</span> desiring an opportunity of telling contributors their verses are bad. people who wished
                  their peices returned would have said so without being asked. the sentence can only
                  operate to prevent <span style="text-decoration: line-through">post</span> men of diffidence from sending me anything. I cannot conceive why you added it – to
                  say the best of it it is perfectly useless – &amp; I am afraid it will be mischievous.
                  if it were possible the leaf should be cancelled.</p>

                  application be made to him for contributions. if he sends them he may but I will not
                  be dictated to. nor treated with impertinence by any man. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes</a> has my respect &amp; respectful voice – I look up to him as a useful &amp; benevolent man,
