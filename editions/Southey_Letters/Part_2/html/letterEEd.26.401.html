            <p class="indent1">The <span style="text-decoration: line-through">character</span> &lt;conduct&gt; of Judas Iscariot affords an argument against Xtianity because he must
               have seen the moral excellence &amp; the miraculous powers of Jesus, &amp; in that case must
               have knowingly acted to his own damnation; a madness seemingly impossible. to this
               the answer may be that like his countrymen he might impute miracles to magic. Judas
               was evidently predestined to his guilt; the doctrine of universal restitution enables
               us to reconcile this to the Goodness &amp; Justice of Deity – yet is it still a difficulty.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Another objection to Xtianity is the prophecy of Jesus which is explained to relate
                  to the destruction of Jerusalem tho its obvious meaning is the end of the world.
