            <p class="indent1">I have been very much vexed by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a>. As if he had not behaved sufficiently ill already there came yesterday a letter,
               by the handwriting &amp; shape from some very low tradesman – inclosing a draft on me
               for acceptance for five pounds thirteen shillings, saying that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">M<sup>r</sup> E. S.</a> had informed the holder I was advised. this letter had been directed to Bristol.
               As you may suppose I was as much perplexed as provoked – on consulting &amp; deliberating
               what to do I determined not to accept the bill, that a lesson now may save him from
               one of more serious consequences hereafter. &amp; in fact if I once suffered him to begin
               the boy has so little shame &amp; so little principle that I should never be safe. To
               the holder I said that I was at a loss to conceive what circumstances could have justified
               a respectable tradesman in cashing a bill for a boy of fifteen. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a> will be obliged to refund what money is left or return what articles he may have
               bought – &amp; the fright &amp; mortification will do him good – if any thing can do him good,
               but indeed I have &amp; long have had a very hopeless opinion of him. Clothes he cannot
               have wanted, having had a plain suit just before he went to sea, – nor if he did want
               them can he be excused for procuring them without any consent or knowledge &amp; taking
               up money in my name with a lie in his mouth that I was advised.</p>
            <p class="indent1">To him I said that for every worthy purpose he might depend upon my assistance &amp; exertion
               to the utmost of <span style="text-decoration: line-through">power</span> my power but that I never would become an accomplice in any wrong action that he
               might commit by conniving or abetting it when done. I had before sent him a one pound
               bill to pay for his washing (for it was not right to trust him with more) &amp; should
               as soon as ever a ship could be obtained, supply him with means to get on board. this
               lesson will teach him that I can act decidedly. –</p>
            <p class="indent1">I think it very probable that when he is again got on board, he will again leave his
               situation &amp; go to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">his Aunt</a> – that they will quarrel again that at last he will turn sharper or strolling-player.
               his destiny will be better than his deserts if he ends in the last. You I know will
               hope better things, but I cannot shut my eyes nor disbelieve my own intuitive fore
               feelings. When <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> returned last from England he said to me he never knew a boy like him turn out well,
               or <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> be good for anything. if you knew how very reservd <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> is respecting any of his family you would feel how strongly he must have been impressed
               to say this.</p>
            <p class="indent1">When he gets on board if he continues I will take care to supply him tho I pinch myself
               let me know what you should think sufficient to allow him. pinched I shall be to do
               it – for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> is a heavy weight upon me – &amp; I am already much in debt to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MayJohn">John May</a> on his account. he himself has no feeling upon the subject, but spends away &amp; incurs
               debts, careless so they &lt;be&gt; paid with what difficulty the money is to be f<span style="text-decoration: line-through">aid</span>ound. I hope he will mend at Edinburgh as he promises – but I have little faith in
               his promises.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Saturday Dec. 10.</span> So far I had written yesterday. this evening a Gunsmith of Exeter sends me another
               draft of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a> for three pounds – &amp; the boy himself incloses me besides all this a Taylor bill of
               eleven pounds sixteen – to show me he says that he has not been extravagant. It is
               indeed very fortunate that I acted as I did in the first instance.</p>
            <p class="indent1">God bless you <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a>. I am grieved to fret &amp; fever you as this needs must do. write – &amp; expect to hear
               again – I trust on pleasanter subjects in a few days.</p>
