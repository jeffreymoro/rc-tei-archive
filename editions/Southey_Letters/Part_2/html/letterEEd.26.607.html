                  most useful to me, &amp; the goodness of the claret made the delay very endurable. in
                  the intervals of sunshine we saw the surrounding scenery – the Dee flowing thro high
                  banks of wood – &amp; the pillars of a prodigious bridge which is to support the canal,
                  a work of wonderful magnitude, so large indeed as almost to deserve forgiveness for
                  its intrusion. Llangollen is seven miles from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Wynnstay">Wynnstay</a> – the village itself is ugly – deformed by some smoky works, – one might colour it

               <p>Two miles from Corwen is a waterfall – Rhaiadr Cynwid. the best I have ever yet found.
                  the body of water is enough to make a constant shower of its dust, &amp; a most cold wind,
                  &amp; I stood in that cold wind &amp; that shower, &amp; saw rainbows where the shadow of the

                  mountain brooks roars – was the next fine object – &amp; the only in our way to Cernioge.
                  all else was raw &amp; bleak. black boggy looking streams, &amp; cold boggy hills. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> said it was Irish looking – I thought of the worst parts of Alentejo. thence to Llanwrst
                  – but not along the common road. we struck to the left by way of Bettws. &amp; this led
                  us to a glorious pass among the mountains. the mountain side was stony, &amp; a few trees
                  grew among its stones, the other side was more <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxxx</span> wooded &amp; had grass on the top – &amp; a huge waterfall thundered into the bottom &amp; thundered
                  down the bottom. when it had nearly past these rocky straits it met another stream.
                  the width of water then became considerable &amp; twice it formed a large – black pool
                  – to the eye absolutely stagnant – the froth of the waters that entered then sleeping
                  upon the surface – it had the deadness of enchantment – yet was not the pool wider
                  than the river above it &amp; below it where it foamed over a broken bed. Last night we
                  slept at Llanwrst. a little town upon the Conway, remarkable for a bridge which we

                  &amp; half in climbing up to a waterfall which is visible from the road. Conway is walled
                  round &amp; I could have fancied myself in Portugal, only sunshine &amp; a stink were wanting.
                  the castle &amp; the ruined wall are very very fine. It falls <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx</span> lamentably short of Obidos, but in England I have seen no fortifications remaining
                  so entire. thence to Bangor along the side of Penmaenmawr, a road now walled in &amp;
                  safe, but once terribly dangerous – for the wall runs along a giddy precipice, &amp; the
                  sea is at the bottom. the old Penman is a grand fellow. Zounds had he given himself
                  one shake to shake the dust from his coat – a hail storm of rocks would have buried
                  us. the mountain is almost all stone – lying loose, or jutting out like crystals in
                  shape. I want some good Welshman to give me the names of the mountains in their order
                  along this coast. we are now at Bangor – rather an Inn a mile from Bangor. tomorrow
                  we go to Capel Cerrig, &amp; from thence see the one side of Snowdon, &amp; I shall look out

                  because they are more insulated. Wales has wood, &amp; the interest of ruins &amp; many recollections,
