            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Your letter in spite of Norfolk frosts &amp; Norfolk flats would have excited in me some
                  half desire to diet for life upon Norfolk puddings &amp; turnips &amp; turkies – if destiny
                  did not invite me to a better country. I have the hope &amp; prospect of visiting Italy
                  in a prudent way – as Secretary to some legation there – an office of little trouble,
                  with the prospect of advancement.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The proposal by Wynn that Southey should become Secretary to Sir William Drummond
                           (c. 1770-1828; DNB), classical scholar, poet and diplomat; Charge d’Affaires in Denmark
                           1800-1801, Minister-Plenipotentiary in Naples 1801-1803 and 1807-1808, and Ambassador
                           to the Ottoman Empire in 1803.</span></div>
                  </div> you will not wonder that I joyfully look <span style="text-decoration: line-through">for</span> to a residence in that country, &amp; the prospect of a permanent income, without that
                  eternal anxiety about ways &amp; means which have so long harrassed me. This is for your
                  own eye only. my destination will probably be Palermo – if peace comes, as likely
                  to any of the other states – &amp; as willingly. Ultimately I look to Lisbon – &amp; certainly
                  to a long absence from England – to me less an object of regret than it would be to
                  most persons, not merely from my state of health, but from my peculiar circumstances.
                  I have never been settled in England – never had a home there – my friends are scattered
                  – nowhere two in a place. from my family (excepting <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henrys</a> prospects) I receive no comfort, &amp; can communicate none to them. thus without anchor
                  or cable it is but to hoist sail &amp; away! –</p>

            <p class="indent1">To the other part of your letter – a visit to Norwich would promise much pleasure.
               but look at the map. – &amp; there is a wretched distance between. besides my time is
               otherwise allotted. I am going to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>, to pass the Autumn with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> – to work like a negro – &amp; to arrange his future plans with my own. he is miserably
               ill, &amp; must quit England for a warmer climate or perish. I found letters announcing
               his determination to ship himself &amp; family for the Azores, the only spot his finances
               could reach. this I have stopt; &amp; the probability is that he will accompany me abroad.
               thus <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> will have <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">one sister</a> with her to reconcile her to an abandonment of the rest – &amp; I shall have with me
               the man, to whom, in all the ups &amp; downs of six years, my heart has clung with most
               affection, despite even of its own efforts.</p>
