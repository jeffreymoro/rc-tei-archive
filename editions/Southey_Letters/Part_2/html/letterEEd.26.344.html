            <p>MS: MS untraced; text is taken from Joseph Cottle, <em>Reminiscences of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey</em> (London, 1847)<br>Previously published: Joseph Cottle, <em>Reminiscences of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey</em> (London, 1847), pp. 217–218.<br>Dating note: The similarities between this letter and that to John May of 2 September
               [1798] (Letter 346), suggest that the letter to Cottle was written at a slightly earlier
               date.</p>

               <p>My time here has been completely occupied in riding about the country. I have contrived
                  to manufacture one eclogue,

                  </div> and that is all; but the exercise of riding has jostled a good many ideas into my
                  brain, and I have plans enough for a long leisure. You know my tale of the ‘Adite,’
                  in the garden of Irem.

                  </div> I have tacked it on to an old plan of mine upon the destruction of the Domdanyel,

                  </div> There is a tolerable skeleton formed. It will extend to ten or twelve books, and they
                  appear to me to possess much strong conception in the Arabian manner. It will at least
                  prove that I did not reject machinery in my Epics, because I could not wield it. This
                  only forms part of a magnificent project, which I do not despair of one day completing,
                  in the destruction of the ‘Domdanyel.’ My intention is, to show off all the splendor
                  of the Mohammedan belief. I intend to do the same to the Runic, and Oriental systems;
                  to preserve the costume of place as well as of religion.</p>

               <p>I have been thinking that though we have been disappointed of our Welsh journey, a
                  very delightful pilgrimage is still within our reach. Suppose you were to meet me
                  at Ross. We go thence down the Wye to Monmouth. On the way are Goodrich castle, the
                  place where Henry V. was nursed; and Arthur’s cavern.

                           to Goodrich Castle, Herefordshire. Arthur’s cavern is a cave just north of the town
                           of Monmouth, on the English-Welsh borders, where, in legend, Arthur and his knights
                           sleep, awaiting England’s call.</span></div>
                  </div> Then there is Ragland Castle somewhere thereabout, and we might look again at Tintern.
                  I should like this much. The Welsh mail from Bristol, comes every day through Ross;
                  we can meet there. Let me hear from you, and then I will fix the day, and we will
                  see the rocks and woods in all their beauty. God bless you.</p>
