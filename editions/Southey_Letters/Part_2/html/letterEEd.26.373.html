               <p>You ask me why the Devil rides on horseback – “The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman.
                  &amp; that would be reason enough. but moreover the history doth aver that he came on

                  history &amp; make Apollyon a pedestrian? besides Grosvenor, Apollyon is cloven footed,
                  &amp; I humbly conceive that a biped – &amp; I never <span style="text-decoration: line-through">I</span> understood his damnable majesty to be otherwise – that a biped I say would walk clumsily
                  upon cloven feet. neither hath Apollyon wings according to the best representations
                  &amp; indeed how should he? for were they of feathers like the Angels – they would be
                  burnt in the everlasting fire. &amp; were they of leather like a bats they would be shrivelled.
                  I conclude therefore that wings he hath not. yet do we find from sundry reputable
                  authors &amp; divers histories that he transporteth himself from place to place with exceeding
                  rapidity. now as he cannot walk fast or fly, he must have some conveyance stage coaches
                  to hell there are none tho the road be much frequented. balloons would burst at setting
                  out, the air would be so <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx</span> rarified by the heat. but horses <span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> he may have &amp; of a particular breed.</p>
