                  </div> is willing to take <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerGeorge">George</a> into his bank, if you &amp; I will become his bondsmen, bound for 500 £ each. the situation
                  is thought a favourable one. it is for seven years – at a salary of 12 £ the first
                  – 15 the second, &amp; increasing 5£ every succeeding year – at the expiration of that
                  time he is calculated for any situation which requires accomptant knowledge. to be
                  bound for the good conduct of any body is always hazardous &amp; never wise, but it is
                  sometimes right – &amp; so I conceive it to be in the present case. write me your opinion
                  – &amp; that as soon as you can that Savary may be answered. the obvious advantage of
                  the situation is that he will be receiving something towards his maintenance during
                  this apprenticeship; its objection that it leads, in all likelihood, only to a bare
                  support. but it must be remembered that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerGeorge">George</a> is very slow, &amp; therefore unlikely to forward himself in any way of life – &amp; this
