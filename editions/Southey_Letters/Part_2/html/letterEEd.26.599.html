               <p>The tone &amp; temper of your letter left me in an uncomfortable mood. certainly I deserved
                  it – but as far as negligence deserves reproof so harsh – but indeed Grosvenor you
                  have been somewhat like the Scotch judge who included all rape robbery <span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> murder &amp; horsestealing under the head of sedition

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Possibly Robert Macqueen, Lord Braxfield (1722-1799; DNB), who in 1793-1794 presided
                           over the trials and sentencing, in Edinburgh, of radical activists, including Thomas
                           Muir (1765-1799; DNB), Maurice Margarot (1745-1815; DNB) and Joseph Gerrald (1763-1796;
                           DNB). Southey may have misunderstood the fine details of Scottish law, under which
                           rape, robbery, murder and arson were all crimes that had to be tried in the highest
                           court.</span></div>
                  </div> – so have you suspected negligence of cloaking a cold &amp; fickle &amp; insincere heart.
                  dear dear Grosvenor if by any magic of ear you could hear how often your name passes
                  my lips – or could you see how often I see your figure in my walks – the recollections
                  – &amp; the wishes – but what are these? – an hundred times should I have begun a letter
                  if these had been enough to fill it – if I could have sent you the exquisite laugh
                  when I again saw S<sup>t</sup> Augustine &amp; his load

                           could refer to a fellow ex-pupil at Westminster School (whose nickname drew on either
                           St Augustine of Hippo (354-430) or St Augustine of Canterbury (d. 604)) or to an object
                           (possibly a painting) Southey and Bedford both knew.</span></div>

                           whose death at the age of 99 was reported in the London newspapers; see, for example,
                           the Morning Chronicle, 20 May 1801. Alternatively, he may have been someone Southey
                           and Bedford had known at Westminster School. If so, the nickname suggests he was a
                           keen swimmer, like the Leander of Greek legend who nightly swam the Hellespont in
                           order to visit his lover. The joke would have had extra resonance as Bedford’s translation
                           of Musæus (fl. c. early 6th century), The Loves of Hero and Leander, had appeared
                           in 179…</span></div>

                  I was – &amp; for an odd reason. I heard a gentleman imitate Henderson

         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">1.. </span><span class="noteBody">Possibly Robert Macqueen, Lord Braxfield (1722-1799; <em>DNB</em>), who in 1793-1794 presided over the trials and sentencing, in Edinburgh, of radical
               activists, including Thomas Muir (1765-1799; <em>DNB</em>), Maurice Margarot (1745-1815; <em>DNB</em>) and Joseph Gerrald (1763-1796; <em>DNB</em>). Southey may have misunderstood the fine details of Scottish law, under which rape,
               robbery, murder and arson were all crimes that had to be tried in the highest court.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">2.. </span><span class="noteBody">Probably an in-joke dating back to Southey’s and Bedford’s schooldays. ‘St Augustine’
               could refer to a fellow ex-pupil at Westminster School (whose nickname drew on either
               St Augustine of Hippo (354-430) or St Augustine of Canterbury (d. 604)) or to an object
               (possibly a painting) Southey and Bedford both knew.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">3.. </span><span class="noteBody">‘Leander’s’ identity is uncertain. He could be the musician Thomas Leander (d. 1801),
               whose death at the age of 99 was reported in the London newspapers; see, for example,
               the <em>Morning Chronicle</em>, 20 May 1801. Alternatively, he may have been someone Southey and Bedford had known
               at Westminster School. If so, the nickname suggests he was a keen swimmer, like the
               Leander of Greek legend who nightly swam the Hellespont in order to visit his lover.
               The joke would have had extra resonance as Bedford’s translation of Musæus (fl. c.
               early 6th century), <em>The Loves of Hero and Leander</em>, had appeared in 1797.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               first mention of the switch of title from ‘The Curse of Keradou’. He seems to have
               made this change in a new draft of Book 1, begun ‘Aug. 15. 1801’, Department of Rare
