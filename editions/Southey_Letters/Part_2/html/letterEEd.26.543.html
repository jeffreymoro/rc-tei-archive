               laziness, but in the hope &amp; expectation that every packet would bring me some tidings
               from you. soberly &amp; seriously I am angry with you.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Lately I have not been so well as for the first months after my arrival: partly because
               the stimulus of novelty has lost its power, – still more owing to intelligence from
               England that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillMargaret">a near relation</a> is dying in a consumption. – I feel the want of society here – of the free &amp; unrestrained
               intercourse to which I have been accustomed. the weather – the rumour of the day –
               the tittle-tattle of the place – &amp; the politics of last nights rubber, poorly compensate
               the topics afforded by common principles, pursuits in common, or the recollection
               of old times. <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</a> however amply makes amends for this privation. I often gaze &amp; gaze till I forget
               myself &amp; lose all thought – all recollection. You cannot imagine nor is it in my power
               to describe the beauties of this place. there are no miniature resemblances in England
               to assist me.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>We are in some apprehension &amp; some danger of receiving the Pestilence from Cadiz.
                  it is certainly at Seville, where the average number of deaths are forty a day. whether
                  it be the Black Vomit, an epidemic disease which has before ravaged this country,
                  or the Yellow Fever from the Havannah, or the Plague from Tetuan we are even now uncertain
                  – so different are the accounts. No precautions are taken to secure us, nor can any
                  avail. a Gallego

                  </div> was here at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</a> yesterday who left Cadiz only 17 days ago, where he had lost his father by the disease,
                  from which he himself had recovered. he escaped with ten others from Cadiz &amp; they
                  are now all in Lisbon unmolested. If the disease had been infectious it must have
                  broken out here. At Cadiz it abates – because its food is exhausted &amp; the place nearly
                  desolate – but this is poor consolation since it has taken root at Seville. if it
                  comes nearer I may probably be driven to winter in England. but our hope is that the
                  rains &amp; the winter will destroy the disease.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Of invasion &amp; war &amp; such trite evils we now neither think or talk – this nearer <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxt</span> danger which comes home to every one monopolizes our attention. it is the news from
               the South of Spain that we enquire, &amp; the number of deaths, &amp; <span class="ital">where</span> is the disorder now. yet with all this evident &amp; imminent &amp; acknowledged danger I
               do not perceive any person permanently alarmed. the thought seems dropt with the conversation:
               &amp; we propose schemes of retirement &amp; resources as a matter of mirth – which perhaps
               tomorrow may render serious &amp; necessary.</p>
            <p class="indent1">In the course of next week we shall probably remove to Lisbon. <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</a> grows cold, &amp; I daily wish myself in our sunny town apartments. from thence it is
               easy to reach England in case of an attack – but we shall be guided by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a>, &amp; indeed my own wish is to remain &amp; retire into the country if retirement be necessary
               – no English fire, no English comfort, can compensate for your rains &amp; your frosts
               &amp; your fogs. I feel them like a green house plant, &amp; must live in the Sunshine. of
               sunshine I have had my share – we had the Siroc incessantly for almost three weeks
               – I <span style="text-decoration: line-through">I</span> sate without coat or waistcoat in a wet room, idle, &amp; motionless – &amp; yet bathed with
               perspiration. this was unusual weather &amp; uncomfortabell – but it did not affect my
               health, &amp; in spirits I was never better. At Cadiz the<span style="text-decoration: line-through">se</span> Siroc blew for nine weeks, &amp; to this some accounts impute the disorder there. Of
               the heat occasioned by a hot wind you can form no idea – I have felt sweltering days
               in England – but the Siroc is the very breath of Beelzebub – only that I conceive
               Beezlebubs breath smells of brimstone.</p>

                  allows me not room to sketch you an account of them – but in my next I will give you
                  ample &amp; ridiculous specimens. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Bedfordfamily">your father</a> is fond of dramatic history, &amp; they will amuse him. – From the Moors this people have
                  also caught much. a spell called a figa is common to both. tis a clenched hand with
                  the thumb between two fingers, excellent against witchcraft – our proverb a ‘fig for

                  disease. Is the small-pox next door? the mother will not remove her children: no –
                  if they <span class="ital">are</span> to have it it is no use to remove, if they are <span class="ital">not</span>, they are safe where they are. – Fowl broth is the panacea of Portugal, &amp; the idea
                  is scarcely yet obsolete that to render it efficacious it should be made of a cock,
                  whipped to death in the room with the patient. now they think it good for nothing
                  unless it be eaten on the same day that the fowl was killed – the broth having more <span class="ital">life</span> in it! – Nor is it a human remedy only, – nothing is so good for a horse! since we

                  foolish antipathy to it. it was taken out secretly &amp; in darkness &amp; buried: I verily
