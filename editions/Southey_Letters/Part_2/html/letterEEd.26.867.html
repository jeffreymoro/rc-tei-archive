                  knew would produce considerable uneasiness &amp; embarrasment to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> as well as myself. There is a want of feeling in his conduct which I cannot easily
                  pardon, for he knew how difficultly I live, &amp; how <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">his Uncle</a> has always been beggared by his family. but it was always in his nature – &amp; I fear
                  will never get out of it. he writes now as if he felt his situation &amp; of course I
                  say nothing to him of the past – nor shall I think of it except only as it does make
                  me fearful for the future. – Meantime a far worse business has taken place with respect
                  to my younger brother. I placed him in the navy, by his own choice &amp; against my opinion
