                  </div> will let me be sure – of being in town before Xmas – &amp; this makes the warm weather,
                  &amp; the full gallop of willing work on which I am careering, valid reasons for not again
                  going from home. I love warm weather dearly when sitting still – but locomotion in
                  the dog days is purgatory upon earth.</p>

               <p>In my ordinary course of stall-reading I found yesterday a mutilated &amp; very filthy
                  copy of a most quaint &amp; curious book. Battering Rams against Rome, or the Battel of
                  John the Follower of the Lamb, fought with the Pope &amp; his Priests, whilst he was a
                  prisoner in the Inquisition Prison of Rome.

                  at the word of the Lord God,” was the Quaker who went to Rome to convert the Pope.
                  of course they sent him to the Inquisition, but as he wrote in English they allowed
                  him pen ink &amp; paper – &amp; this little volume contains all his letters to the Pope &amp;
                  Priests &amp; what he calls his Epistle General to the Romans, written from the Holy Office,
                  &amp; afterwards from the Madhouse whither they removed him. it is the rarest jewel in
                  all the Bibliotheca Fanatica –</p>
