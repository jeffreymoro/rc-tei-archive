                           redirecting the body’s natural electricity could draw out pain and disease. He developed
                           brass and iron rods of about 4 inches in length, with one flat side and one round
                           side with one blunt end and one pointed end. The practitioner held the rods in his
                           hand and rested the point of the rods on the skin. Then he stroked or drew the tractors
                           over the unhealthy area of the body to attract and draw out affliction. See Benjamin

               Drawing on experiments conducted by Luigi Galvani (1737-1798), Perkins theorized that
               redirecting the body’s natural electricity could draw out pain and disease. He developed
               brass and iron rods of about 4 inches in length, with one flat side and one round
               side with one blunt end and one pointed end. The practitioner held the rods in his
               hand and rested the point of the rods on the skin. Then he stroked or drew the tractors
               over the unhealthy area of the body to attract and draw out affliction. See Benjamin
               Douglas Perkins (1774-1810), <em>The Influence of Metallic Tractors on the Human Body</em> (1798). The subject of much controversy, Perkinism was attacked by James Gillray
               (1757-1815; <em>DNB</em>) in his satirical print ‘Metallic Tractors’ (1801).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
