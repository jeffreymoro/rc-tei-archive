               <p>I should long ere this have written to acknowledge the hospitality I found at Norwich,
                  but that I thought the mere formality of a letter of thanks would be as little agreable
                  to you as to myself. I therefore copy for you an Eclogue just written; for two reasons,
                  as a plea for writing – &amp; because it was suggested by your conversation. What you
                  told me of the German Eclogues revived some almost forgotten plans, &amp; enabled me to
                  correct them. I purpose writing some which may be called English, as sketching features
                  peculiar to England: not like the one which you read to me of Goethe

                  </div> which would suit any country with Roman ruins. like the Germans I would aim at somewhat
                  of dramatic interest. &amp; some of my plans will allow me to introduce that quiet sedition
                  which the Anti-Jacobine

                  it rather favours old prejudices. I like it myself – perhaps because it is newly written
                  – perhaps because I drew from the recollection of such a scene. If I were near you
                  I should profit by your opinions &amp; your knowledge; – &amp; I should be sorry if a two
                  days journey should totally <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxtx</span> cut off my intercourse with one whom I highly respect, &amp; whom if the age of our acquaintance
