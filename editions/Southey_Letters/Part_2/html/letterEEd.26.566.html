                  every where displayed novel &amp; striking views. for the foreground huge aloes &amp; the
                  prickly pear – the broom &amp; furze in blossom – broad-headed firs every where where
                  the sandy soil was not cultivated for vines or olives – the sweep of the bay southward
                  skirted by the pine-covered plains – &amp; the mountain boundary – behind us Lisbon on
                  its heights – &amp; the river blue &amp; boundless as a sea. thro a cleft in a sand bank –
                  a winter ravine way for the rains, we first saw the Costa at about half a mile below
                  us, the most singular view I ever beheld – huts all of thatch scatterd upon the sand
                  – we descended by a very steep way cut thro the sand hill – the sand on either side
                  fretted by the weather like <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> old sculpture long weather worn. all below belongs to the sea – but on the bare sands
                  a numerous tribe have fixed their habitations – which exactly resemble the wigwams
                  of the Nootka savages.

                  saw – or more prolific, for children seemed to swarm. as parties from Lisbon are frequent
                  here there are two or three hovels of entertainment. ours had ragged rhymes upon its
                  walls recommending us to drink by the barrel &amp; not by the quart ale-house advice in
                  lines almost as long as the poem upon Pharaoh King of Egypt.

               <p>In riding to Odivellas I saw somewhat curious – it was a Padroñ<span style="text-decoration: line-through">a</span> by the road side. we have no other word in English – &amp; it occurs often in romance
                  – for a place raised by the wayside where a station or inscription is placed: there
                  was an image of Christ there – &amp; some unaccountable inscriptions about robbery &amp; hiding
                  heaven in the earth, which a series of pictures in tiles behind, explained. A hundred
                  years ago the church at Odivellas was robbed of the church plate &amp; of the sacrament
                  – then I saw the thief playing at skittles when the sacristan of the church past by
                  – whom he followed in &amp; hid himself – then I saw him robbing the altar – next “you
                  shall see how he hid the church-dresses in the house of a woman – &amp; here he is burying
                  the sacrament plate in a vineyard upon this very spot. here he is examined upon suspicion
                  &amp; denies all, &amp; says who ever did the sacrilege ought to have his hands cut off. here
                  he is taken in the act of stealing the fowls of the convent – &amp; he confesses all.
                  here they dig up the hidden treasure &amp; carry it back in a solemn procession – here
                  he is going to execution – here you see his hands cut off according to his own sentence
                  – &amp; here he is strangled &amp; burnt. It is remarkable that in almost all these tiles
                  the face of the criminal is broken to pieces – probably in abhorrence of his guilt.
                  The loss of the Wafer has been ever regarded as a national calamity – to be lamented
                  with public prayers &amp; fasts &amp; processions. It happened at Mexico in the Conquerors

                  </div> a Doctor at Aldea da Cruz of whom we besought houseroom one night in distress told
                  us with more truth than politeness that four women were a mighty inconvenience. We
                  did not find them so – they made our chocolate at morning. laughed with us by day

                  with a patience that entitles them to an honourable place in the next martyrology.
                  All Lisbon I believe thought us mad when we set out – &amp; they now regard our return
                  with equal envy as only our complections have suffered – to detail the journey would
                  be too long – we asked at Santarem if they had room for us – they said plenty – we
                  begged to see them – they had two rooms – four men a-bed in one – one fellow a bed
                  in the other, at Pombal Waterhouse &amp; I slept in public – in a room that served as
                  a passage for the family. Men &amp; women indiscriminately made the Ladies beds. one night
                  we passed thro a room wherein eight men were sleeping – who rose up to look at us
                  – something like a picture of the resurrection. these facts will enable you to judge
                  of the comforts &amp; decencies of Portugueze – they once wanted us – 4 women &amp; two men
                  – to sleep in two beds in one room.</p>

            <p class="indent1">We crost the Zezere. a river of importance in the history of Portugal, as its banks
               form the great protection of Lisbon. it is the place where a stand might most effectually
               be made against an invading army. the river is fine – about our Avon width at Rownham,
               &amp; flowing between hills of our Clifton &amp; Leigh height that are covered with heath,
               &amp; gum-cistus. the water is beautifully clear, &amp; the bottom sand. like all mountain
               streams the Zezere is of irregular &amp; untameable force. in summer horsemen ford it.
               in winter the ferry price varies according to the resistance of the current – from
               one vintem to nine – that is from a penny to a shilling. It then enters the Tagus
               with equal waters – sometimes with a larger body, for as the rains may have fallen
               heavier East or North, the one river with its rush almost stagnates the other.</p>
