               <p>First &amp; foremost I have to tell you that what you have been wishing to take place

                  of joy to me. I rather look on with a sort of cowardice – but all will come in <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx</span> good time. my optimism is of a practical character – if we knew as much of the moral
                  world as we do of the physical I believe we should find it as wisely &amp; unerringly
                  directed. secondly I wish you to give <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerGeorge">George Fricker</a> five guineas for me. poor fellow I wish it were in my power to serve him essentially
                  – if he had but the head of my brothers – or they had his good disposition, which
                  God knows is worth ten times more – what a happy mixture it would be!</p>

                  tell him that he &amp; she might settle their matters as they pleased, &amp; so I have done
                  with him. In his last letter he let the cat out of the bag, showing that he was still
