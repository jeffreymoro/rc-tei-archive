            <p class="indent1">At last my dear Edith I can write of my return with certainty. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CarlisleAnthony">Carlisle</a> will not come to Bristol till some days after me. therefore I will take my place
               by Sundays mail, &amp; if no accident intervene hope to be at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Westbury">Westbury</a> to dinner on this day week. you will therefore I suppose leave <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Stowey">Stowey</a> on Saturday if no Sunday coach goes – &amp; by this time this day week my dear Edith
               we shall have met once more. six days more – &amp; &lt;a&gt; mail-coach night – the pleasantest
               night my Edith that I have past since I left you.</p>

               <p>I had a letter today from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</a> with the news of his fathers

                  </div> death, &amp; am about to write to him. the death of a parent is, where parents have done
                  their duty, a severe &amp; irreparable loss; but it is an event the probability of which
                  has ever been contemplated, &amp; which affects us less deeply as it happens in the common
                  course of nature. it is the death of the young, of children, friends &amp; those we love
                  still more dearly, that desolates life. I should hope that in our next state of existence
                  death will not be permitted; at least that the ties of affection will not be cut asunder,
                  but that when it be time to proceed to some more advanced being, friends &amp; families
                  may emigrate together. I must not lose you thro eternity my Edith – at least if I
                  thought it a thing probable it would deaden all earthly enjoyment. I shall on finishing
                  this write to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</a> – not that there is any thing in the common consolation still to be said, for all
                  that I could say he knows – but to be silent on these occasions looks like unkindness
                  &amp; indeed is unkind; &amp; the very sight of a letter from a friend alleviates painful
                  feelings in some degree by breaking in upon them. I am anxious to know if Burnetts
                  father has left him anything, if it be but a few hundred pounds, enough to float him
                  in his studies I shall be easy. but <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">George</a> has had enemies at home whom I wish were now to be buried instead of the poor old
                  man. The sooner he can come to us the better. to stay at Huntspill, unless business
                  detains him, will be only making himself uncomfortable &amp; benefitting nobody.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">But Edith let me turn to pleasanter subjects. three weeks have I been absent – &amp; the
               last week of absence is begun. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> I hope that it will be many many months before we are seperated for a day again.
               about our summer plans I have written in my last – we may go where we please, &amp; no
               place seems to lie more conveniently situated than Devonshire, or to offers situations
               more beautiful.</p>

                  &amp; with what possible matter could I fill another letter? you hear all the little unimportant
                  uninteresting occupations that fritter away my time from eight in the morning till
                  eleven at night, the two pleasantest periods in the day, because when I get up I reflect
                  that another day is begun, &amp; when I lie down comfort myself with the thought that
                  it is over. time does not hang so heavily at home. Saturday evening we were at the

                  </div> here, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenors</a> Quaker friends – I wishd myself at home, wished myself here, anywhere where a pen
                  or a book might have relieved me from the tedium of strange society. they are according
                  to all that has been told me very good people. but he seems to be sixty years old,
                  &amp; his wife does not look above thirty. this is a vile &amp; unnatural disproportion. I
                  have no conception of husband – &amp; wife – feelings between two persons so differently
                  aged. Edith could you share the identity of a husband old enough to be your father?
                  – I do not like the Quakers. many good points they have, &amp; like most sects act upon
                  the perception of some important truth. but there is a profession of kindness, an
                  affected meekness &amp; amiability about them which always puts me upon my guard. they
                  are so plaguey civil that they must be insincere.</p>

            <p class="indent1">you tell me nothing about <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Stowey">Stowey</a> in your letter – how you like the place, how you like the people, how you are received

               be much interested. however all this will be matter for conversation. you will &lt;not&gt;
               I think be persuaded to remain at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Stowey">Stowey</a> so as to let me arrive &amp; look for you &amp; not find you. it is true you will have been
               but a fortnight at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Stowey">Stowey</a>, but you will have been some months with your sister, &amp; it is her you wishd to see
