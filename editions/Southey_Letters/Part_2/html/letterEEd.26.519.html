               <p>We had a fine passage of five &amp; a half days, delightful weather &amp; light winds all
                  the way. yet we both suffered much, scarcely eating or sleeping the whole of the way.
                  On Thursday we left Falmouth, at five in the evening, glad to escape. my feeling at
                  quitting England was not unpleasant, serious but not depressing. as we left the harbour
                  all the land objects seemed to rock like a dream. one hour sickened me – I only rose
                  the three following days just to wash myself &amp; crawl on deck while John Moor

                  there struck me much. a hen had just laid an egg &amp; was eating it. so totally the sea
                  seemed to denaturalize every thing. On Sunday a frigate chased us for seventy miles.
                  Monday I heard the Captain

                  the Cutter did not answer. we fired a gun – she did the same, &amp; preparations were

                  my station with a musquet. The Cutter bore down between us – I saw the smoke from
                  her matches. her colours were English. we spoke her – she answered in broken English,
                  &amp; passed on. still we believed her French &amp; expected she was coming round. it was
                  a Guernsey man who hailed us &amp; I laid down my arms with high delight. – You may conceive
                  the feelings this whole business excited in me, not satisfied with myself for taking
                  up arms – my wife below – in full expectation of an engagement &amp; myself no ways interested
                  in the business – for God knows I think nothing worth fighting for, &amp; my little luggage
                  was insured. there I was going to fight for company-sake – I – who have fired a gun
                  these seven years, &amp; never intended to fire one again. Oh the joy of feeling two legs,
                  two arms, &amp; a head in my own possession! it made my stomach in good humour for half
                  the day. the morning was a busy one. the Endymion Frigate boarded us. &amp; I had the
                  pleasure of seeing porpusses about the ship &amp; a small grampus.</p>
