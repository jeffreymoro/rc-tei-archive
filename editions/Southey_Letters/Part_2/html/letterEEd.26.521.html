               <p>Here then I am once more, safe over the seas. our passage was uncommonly fine – five
                  days &amp; a half only. light winds the whole way, yet I never suffered so much from sickness. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> was dreadfully affected. We left Falmouth at five on Thursday afternoon. the three
                  following days I merely crawled out of bed for the sake of washing myself, &amp; then
                  lay down again, scarcely eating or sleeping. On the Monday morning about six I heard
                  the Captain

                  </div> was bearing down upon us. We had another Packet in company carrying six guns,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)

                  </div> our own force was ten. the Cutter hoisted English colours, we made a signal which
                  she did not answer, we fired a gun, she did the same. every body thought her certainly
                  French &amp; we prepared for action. imagine <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</a> terror; I bulwarked her with mattrasses in the cabin – but she could not fancy herself
                  safe there. so I lodged her in the cockpit, &amp; was glad to escape, took my station
                  on the quarter deck with a musquet. The Cutter bore down between us – I counted seven
                  guns on <span style="text-decoration: line-through">the</span> her side, &amp; saw the smoke from her matches. we hailed her. she answered in broken
                  English, &amp; past us. her language left us no doubt that she was French &amp; we imagined
                  it was a manouvre either to bear round us, or to attack the other Packet. She was
                  English however, manned chiefly from Guernsey. I replaced my musquet in the chest
                  with no small satisfaction. my <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> former feeling had been an undistinguishable mass of wonder &amp; apprehension, but when
                  that was over it was pure joy that was left. The comfort at feeling two legs, two
                  arms &amp; a head upon my shoulders put my stomach in good humour for half the day. Now
                  it is a subject of satisfaction that I have seen all the preparatory bustle of a sea
                  fight, tho certainly in none of the pleasure: packet sailors will fight well, but
                  not with enthusiasm – they get nothing by a prize. this regulation is owing to the
                  folly of one in the American war – or the war before last, who left her course to
                  take a French vessel. the moment she came alongside, the Frenchman opened his ports,
                  which had been somehow disguised, &amp; the packet was obliged to strike without firing
                  a gun. – Immediately after this we saw Cape Finisterre, &amp; were boarded by the Endymion
                  Frigate. it was a busy morning – &amp; to make it more so the porpusses played around
                  the vessel &amp; we saw a small grampus. on Tuesday we saw Cape Mondego – but still the
                  land lay like a cloud scarcely visible to a strong eye. Tuesday night we made the
                  Berlings. Wednesday I rose at sun rise – the sun was rising over the rock of Lisbon.
                  the flat shores of Yarmouth would have been delightful to me, but this was magnificent.
                  we were very near the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">shore</span> &lt;land&gt; – the wind fresh, the breakers swelling up along the shore, &amp; multitudes of
                  sea birds sporting over their silver dust. the heights of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</a> rose upon us &amp; I distinguished the Penha convent, &amp; the summits which I had trod.
                  we continued close along the land. you know the entrance up the Tagus is wonderfully
                  fine. four years had unfamiliarized all objects – they had a white wash of novelty.
                  we anchored soon after ten &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> was immediately on board. at night we took possession of our house. it is very small
                  &amp; quite Portugueze, but large enough &amp; delightfully situated. if I turn my head <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxxxx</span> from this table I look over the Tagus to Almeida &amp; the farther shores of Alentejo,
                  &amp; a boundary of hills high as Malvern. houses are very difficult to find upon the
