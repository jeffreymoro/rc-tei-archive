               guide a bad pen that I cannot see to mend – begin to converse with you – my head aches
               – every limb is fatigued. I want rest – I want to be at home – I want to be with you.
               this accursed London! I cannot walk a street without wanting to wash my hands – the
               air is so thick that my very lungs feel dirty. nothing but noise &amp; nastiness. even
               the sight of my friends is fatiguing – after absence there is so much to say that
               I hear &amp; talk till my head throbs with the unremitting exertion. one never enjoys

               <p>To the history of yesterday I have little to add. after sealing my letter I left the

                  but now it disorders me. Oh for a draught of good Westbury air – &amp; you have wind to

               <p>Friday morning. I write from a coffee house in the Hay Market – for in this runabout

                  incommoded by the company. breakfasted at his rooms on ginger tea which he always
                  drinks. we then set out to see Barkers picture, but on the way called on Matthew Lewis,
                  the Monk or rather the Monkey Lewis.
