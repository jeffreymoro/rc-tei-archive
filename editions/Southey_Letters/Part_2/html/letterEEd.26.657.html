                  </div> I retain my first opinion. it is delightful poetry badly put together. an exquisite
                  picture in a clumsy frame. Margaret is a noble girl – the other characters not so
                  well conceived. A better imitation of old language I have never seen – but was the
                  language of the serving men ever the language of nature? <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LambCharles">Lamb</a> has copied the old writers – I suspect that they did not copy existing characters.
                  those quaint turns of words &amp; quainter contortions of thought never could be produced
                  by ignorant men. the main incident of the play – (the discovery) is too foolish –
                  the effect produced too improbable. Withal so beautiful is the serious dialogue that
                  it more than redeems the story. most I like the concluding scene.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I am half amused &amp; half provoked by the civilities which my Secretaryship procures
               me. &amp; receive them with an accurate sense of their value. I on my part also am more
               civil perhaps than usual. my wish is to get abroad, &amp; I am old enough never to kick
               away the stone which I may want to step upon. abroad I must go – so says my head &amp;
               my whole intestinal canal &amp; my inclination. Lisbon of course is the place desirable.
               I would compound for Madrid. it is a hateful city – &amp; only its books can atone for
               a bad situation both as to earth &amp; heaven. If in October however I see no near chance
               of a legation Southward – as the world will be before me I shall seriously think of
               taking root in Portugal, &amp; seriously labour to get money enough for a land journey
               from Bilboa or S<sup>t</sup> Sebastians thro Biscay to Madrid &amp; thence elbow out of the straight road to Toledo
               &amp; Cordova. These <span style="text-decoration: line-through">speculations</span> &lt;plans&gt; you see are post-obit speculations for the natural death of my office may
