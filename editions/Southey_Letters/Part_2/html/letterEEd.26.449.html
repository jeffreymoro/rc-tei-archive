                  </div> at least we hope so. it is eight or ten weeks since we have heard from him. on our
                  arrival here we saw in the newspaper that a large Kings brig had been seen lying in
                  Ferrol, &amp; that she was supposed to be the Sylph. here our intelligence ends – but
                  this is almost a certainty, &amp; our chief uneasiness arises from not knowing whether
                  there had been an action previous to the capture. I conclude not – because a Spanish
                  brig would not attack &amp; could not take an English one, &amp; because a brig could not
                  resist a ship of superiour force. It is most probable that the Sylph was picked up
                  by the line of battle ships that have been dodging from Ferrol to Rochefort, from
                  Rochefort to L’Orient &amp; from L’Orient to Ferrol again. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">My mother</a> is of course very uneasy.</p>
