               <p>I shall take your advice respecting Milton; − it may I think be doubted whether a
                  poet (allowing him enough previous knowledge of the best authors) would most improve
                  himself by studying the best writers, or reading the obscure ones. I speak of epic
                  writers. I read ten books of the Italia Liberata when at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Norwich">Norwich</a>, &amp; Trissino taught me very clearly what ought to be avoided in epic poetry.

                  </div> it is astonishing how servilely these fellows imitate the established writers. The
                  great advantage of Madocs story is that the whole &amp; all its parts are unlike any thing
                  before it. Every incident appears to me original.</p>
