On my return I found <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</a> in the bustle of quitting one house without having fixed upon another to remove to.
                  We took one at last at this place, little more than two miles from Bristol, over Durdham
                  Down, &amp; this is likely to be our home till <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</a> health can bear London air &amp; London confinement.</p>

               Spithead &amp; about to be docked. he has about six months longer to serve &amp; will I doubt

                           Spain and Portugal was published in 1799. Southey’s two volume collection Poems appeared
                           in 1799: volume one was a third edition of the collection first published in 1797;
                           volume two consisted of poems published previously (though not under Southey’s own
                           name) in the Morning Post and the Monthly Magazine or published for the first time.
                           It included the six ‘English Eclogues’.</span></div>
                  </div> both which will be published by Christmas. you will find in them some tolerable ballads,
                  &amp; half-a-dozen Eclogues, in my own judgement the best of my smaller pieces. at present
                  more time than I can either willingly or conveniently spare is taken up in walking
                  eight miles every day, which I do in obedience to medical advice. I have been a good
                  deal indisposed, &amp; at the heart, which is an awkward place. they tell me I have sate
                  too much &amp; walked too little, &amp; this daily journey, for so I may call it, is my chief
                  prescription. it has I think already rendered the seizures I complained of less frequent
                  &amp; less violent.</p>
