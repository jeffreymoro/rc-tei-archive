               ouran-outangs there, which I remember to have heard of some years ago. The poor fellow
               who owned them was walking quietly with a stick in his hand. A European saw him and
               shot him. He was more like the human animal than any ape that had been seen before.
               Unless you remember the face, you will hardly believe how human it is, – with black
               eyebrows and a woolly head like a negro’s. I could and would have given a conscientious
               verdict of wilful murder against the man who shot him – the cruelty pains me; and

                           (1672), no. 3799 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. Jose de Anchieta (1534-1597)
                           was a Jesuit missionary to Brazil and one of the first Brazilian writers. He was beatified
                           in 1980, but still awaits canonisation.</span></div>
                  </div> very much tickled my fancy. As a Latin poet, I biographise him; but Anchieta was a
                  candidate for canonisation, and worked more miracles than all the Apostles. Strip
                  him of his miracles, and the truth is, that he was an honest Jesuit, who wrote vile
                  verses in alphabetical praise of the Virgin Mary. He was among the savages in Brazil,
                  and his practice was to write his verses upon the sea-sands, and then commit them
                  to memory; and so, says his Life-writer, he brought home in his head about 5000 lines.
                  You may believe the Jesuit, if you please; but he is so abominable a liar that I do
                  not. Anchieta was in <span class="ital">the habit</span> of turning water into wine – “he did not do it once only, like Christ at Cana,” says
                  the Jesuit; “and when the sun was too hot he called the birds to fly over his head
                  and screen him, which was a much more elegant (<span class="ital">gracioso</span>) miracle than the cloud that shadowed the children of Israel!”

               <p><span class="date"><span class="ital">Monday, June 23rd</span>.</span> – The bull-fight excited nothing but pain and anger at the cruelty and the cowardice
                  of the amusement. These spectacles must have a bad effect upon the public morals.
                  Mr. Wyndham and Mr. Canning defended bull-baiting upon the ground that these sports
                  preserved the national courage.

                           Canning (1770–1827; DNB), Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office, 1795–1799, Commissioner
                           at the Board of Control 1799–1800 and Paymaster of the Forces 1800–1801, had been
                           the most eloquent opponents of the unsuccessful Bill to outlaw bull-baiting in 1800.</span></div>
                  </div> The opinion was absurd enough and unfeeling enough to come with propriety from Mr.
                  Wyndham and Mr. Canning. If it were true, the courage of a nation would be in proportion
                  to the cruelty of its sports or to the danger, the same would be the case with individuals;
                  the Spaniards therefore who fight the bulls with untipped horns must be the most courageous
                  people in Europe, and the butchers the bravest class of the community. Our laws only
                  recognise them as men necessarily hardened by the habitual sight of blood, and therefore
                  exclude them from the office of jurymen. I cannot understand the pleasure excited
                  by a bull-fight. It is honourable to the English character that none of our nation
                  frequent these spectacles. <span class="ital">I am not quite sure that my curiosity in once going was perfectly justifiable; but
                     the pain inflicted by the sight was expiation enough.</span></p>
