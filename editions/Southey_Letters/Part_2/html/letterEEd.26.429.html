                  you probably know the hill streams of Devonshire – each of these flows down a coombe,
                  rolling down over huge stones like a long waterfall. immediately at their junction
                  they enter the sea, &amp; the rivers &amp; the sea make but one sound of uproar. of these
                  coombes the one is richly wooded, the other runs between two high bare stoney hills.
                  from the hill which rises between the two is a prospect most magnificent. on either
                  hand the coombe<span style="text-decoration: line-through">s</span> &amp; the river – before, the little village – the beautiful little village which I am
                  assured by one who is familiar with Switzerland resembles a Swiss village. this alone
                  would constitute a view beautiful enough to repay the weariness of a long journey
                  – but to compleat it – there is the blue &amp; boundless sea – for the faint &amp; feeble
                  line of the Welch coast is only to be seen on the right hand &amp; if the day be perfectly
