            <p class="indent1">I had the good luck as a poet, &amp; the misfortune as a man to feel the night mare last
               night. the night was very hot, I had been extremely restless for many hours, the intelligence
               that my <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillMargaret">Cousin Margarett</a> was in a decline had reached me in the morning &amp; prevented me from sleeping. a sort
               of delirious activity at last seemed to possess my imagination &amp; I remember combining
               in words that the mind heard the most incongruous associations of monstrous thought,
               involuntarily. I was in a seperate bed, lying on my back, my arms &amp; legs stretched
               out asunder, the right hand fearing to touch the left on account of the heat. I recollect
               my last definite feeling was as tho I had been stretched on a wheel that raised up
               my breast &amp; strained my extremities. after that, I had forgotten myself &amp; the seizure
               came on. it was a weight on the breast – I thought some evil being was trying to destroy
               me. I attempted to move but I saw other legs than my own coming from the bed as if
               mocking me – I thought I was awake – this was the most singular circumstance – I knew
               where I was – I knew it was the night mare, I knew one word one motion would relieve
               me yet it appeared that my eyes were open – that I saw a red fire suspended in the
               middle of the room, that some evil being had caught me. there was a lamp burning on
               the table. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">at length with great effort I made a feeble noise which awakened Edith. she called

                  him breathe or move. that night I was attacked as when in England. anxiety had renewed
                  the complaint. the news of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillMargaret">my Cousins</a> state of health produced the same effect. Pitcairns was right when he told me I should
