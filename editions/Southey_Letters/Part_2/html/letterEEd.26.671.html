                           (c. 1400-1470). John King’s drawing was used for the engraving opposite the title

I prefix an Essay on Romance. for this they
                  offered me, with my name to the <span class="ital">Essay only</span>, 100 £. It would have been imprudent to let my name appear – because the notion that
                  I am <span style="text-decoration: line-through">of</span> a man of business may help me on in the world. they then offered 60 £ when the book
                  was done, &amp; when 750 were sold the remaining 40. £. I have bargained for 30 £ more
                  if a second 750 sell. the definitive answer is not yet come – but I have no doubt
                  they will accede to the terms. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ReesOwen">Rees</a> said so, &amp; only the formality remains of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</a> assent. Now as my name is not to be publickly known, neither should it privately.
                  I am trying to persuade them to have vignettes, which if I can effect I would beg <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KingJohn">King</a> to design, &amp; take the fair price for them which the booksellers usually pay. &amp; so
                  sure am I that with the subjects which I should chuse, a print in the title page would
                  encrease the sale of the book, that if they will not otherwise accede, I will propose
                  to them to risque a ten pounds of my own certain profit. There is a farther view in
                  this job. if the book sells which is highly probable from its name &amp; excellence, they
                  will go thro the whole army of Romances in the same manner – indeed this is meant
                  as an experiment with that in view.
