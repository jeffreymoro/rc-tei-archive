In no other part does it require correction. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">Sir Herbert</a> does not deny that <span class="ital">he promised to return the letters in an hour, when he borrowed them</span>, nor that <span class="ital">he published them without the knowledge of the family, for his own emolument</span>.
