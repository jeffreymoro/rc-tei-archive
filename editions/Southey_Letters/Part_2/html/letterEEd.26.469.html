                  </div> I must make sure work and speedy, for abroad I <span class="ital">must</span> go. Complaints of immediate danger I have none, but increased and increasing nervous
                  affections threaten much remote. I have rushes of feeling nightly, like fainting or
                  death, and induced, I believe, wholly by the dread of them. Even by day they menace
                  me, and an effort of mind is required to dispel them. . . . . So I <span class="ital">must</span> go, and I <span class="ital">will</span> go. Now, then, the sooner the better. Some progress is made in the sixth book of Thalaba;
                  my notes are ready for the whole, at least there is only the trouble of arranging
                  and seasoning them. If the bargain were made, it would be time to think of beginning
                  to print, for the preliminaries are usually full of delays, and time with me is of
                  importance. I must have the summer to travel in, and ought to be in Germany by the
                  beginning of June. Treat, therefore, with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a>, or any man, for me.</p>

                  it was with the conviction that it was a vain wish, but it is a very earnest one.
                  Together we might do so much; and we could leave the women for excursions – now into
                  Hungary, now into Poland, and see the Turks. Zounds! who knows but, like Sir John
                  Maundeville, we might have gone where the Devil’s head is always above ground!
