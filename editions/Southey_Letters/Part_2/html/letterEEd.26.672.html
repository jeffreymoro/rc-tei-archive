               <p>Since your departure I have received letters from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W<sup>m</sup> Taylor</a> at Paris. interesting inasmuch as they differ from the common newspaper accounts,
                  &amp; are the observations of an observing man. he says that the public conversation is
                  free, worthy of a free people, &amp; that at the coffee houses the measures of government
                  are discussed acutely &amp; severely but without ill-will or acrimony. The temper of the
                  people disposes them to peace. Order is worth more than Liberty. – In changing governments
                  we do not change men. – New Constitutions are periodical publications – &amp; each costs
                  something. These &amp; like proverbial maxims are the favourite texts in Paris. My friend<span style="text-decoration: line-through">s</span> says that the French are less officious in politeness than formerly. that manners
                  &amp; morals of a more English character are fashionable. that young men talk of the “Religion
                  of our fathers” as if they meant to learn the Catechism. that the tide in fact is
                  setting in to those opinions of morality, religion &amp; politics which pervade the works
                  of Burke.
