               it. I am driven again to my nightly dose of ether, sorely against my will, for it
               is very unpleasant to accustom myself to such a stimulus. it is a nervous affection
               that I have, the consequence of sedentary habits, &amp; more obstinate than I expected.
               I have good advice but not good tidings respecting it, for I am told that without
