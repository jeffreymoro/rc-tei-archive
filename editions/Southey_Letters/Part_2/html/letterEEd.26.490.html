               <p>Your last letter entered into an interesting subject. a young man entering the world
                  is exposed to hourly danger − &amp; what more important than to discover the best preservative?
                  to have a friend, dear enough &amp; respectable enough to hold the place of a Confessor,
                  would assuredly be the best, − &amp; if the station of Confessor could always be well
                  filled, I would give up half the Reformation to restore it. In my moments of reverie
                  I have sometimes imagined myself such a character, <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxxxx can be more</span> the obscure instrument in promoting virtue &amp; happiness. But it is obvious that more
                  evil than good results from this power being, like all other power, in improper hands.
                  − I have wandered from the subject. it is not likely that I shall ever gain the confidence
                  of my brothers

                  mixed with it – I am more the object of their esteem than love. there has been no
                  equality between us – we have rarely domesticated together, &amp; when that has been the
                  case, they have been accustomed, if they were faulty, to understand my silent disapprobation.
                  No – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> will never entrust his feelings to me −. &amp; for precepts of warning – indeed I doubt
                  their propriety – I doubt lest from the strange perverting powers of the mind, they
                  should me made minister to temptation. indirect admonition – example – are not these
                  better means? − Feelings almost romantically refined were my preservation − &amp; with
                  these I amalgamated afterwards a Stoical morality. I perceive the seeds of neither
                  in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a>.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">My health fluctuates − &amp; the necessity of changing climate is sadly &amp; sufficiently
               obvious, lest, tho my disease should prove of no serious danger, the worst habits
               of hypochondriasm fasten upon me &amp; palsy all intellectual power. I look with anxiety
               for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</a> letter, &amp; think so much of Lisbon, that to abandon the thoughts would be a considerable
               disappointment. it would greatly gratify me to see <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a>, &amp; I have associations with Lisbon<span style="text-decoration: line-through">s</span> that give me a friendship for the place – recollected feelings &amp; hopes – pleasures
               &amp; anxieties – all now mellowed into remembrances that endear the associated scenes.
               But that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> should approve this is perhaps little probable. a few weeks will decide, &amp; if I do
               not go to Portugal – I have no choice but Italy. for Madeira is a prison, &amp; the voyage
               to the West Indies of a terrifying length. this detestable war! if they would make
               peace upon motives as light as they made war, <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx</span> there would be cause enough because I want to cross from Dover to Calais. it would
               save me some sea-sickness − &amp; the wealth &amp; blood of the nation in to the bargain.</p>

                  an episode &amp; must be seperately related. the manners &amp; literature of the country should
                  accompany the chronological order of events. I should disturb the spiders at the Necessidades
                  &amp; leave no convent library unransacked. should Italy be my destination no definite
                  object of research presents itself. the literature of that country is too vast a field
                  to be harvested by one labourer. the history split into fifty channels – the petty
                  broils of petty states – infinitely perplexed, infinitely insignificant.</p>

                  </div> you will feel an interest in this subject. I shall be little more than mason in this

                  intended to impress upon the reader the necessity of alleviating the evil which he
                  sees inforced, will be mine – for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</a> would write too strictly &amp; closely for the public taste. you probably know the nature
                  of the Beguinages, they were female <span class="ital">fraternities</span>, where the members were engaged in some useful employment, &amp; bound by no religious
                  obligation. the object is to provide for the numerous class of women who want employment,
                  the means of respectable independance, by restoring to them those branches of business
                  which the men have mischievously usurped, or monopolized when they ought only to have
                  shared. – O what a country might this England become did its governors but wisely
                  direct the strength &amp; wealth &amp; activity of the people! every [MS torn]fession, every
                  trade, is overstocked, there are more adventurers in each than possibly can find employment.
                  hence poverty &amp; crime. do not misunderstand me as asserting this to be the sole cause
                  – but it is the most frequent one. a system of colonization that should [MS torn]
                  an outlet for the superfluous activity of the country would convert this into a cause

                  that to the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">gre</span> disgrace of man, occupy so great a part of the world! assuredly poverty &amp; the dread
                  of poverty are the great sources of guilt. want fills our streets with prostitutes,
                  &amp; the dangerous imprudence of early marriage drives many young men to a worse danger.
                  but the country cannot be well regulated where marriage is an imprudence, where children
                  are a burthen &amp; a misfortune.</p>
