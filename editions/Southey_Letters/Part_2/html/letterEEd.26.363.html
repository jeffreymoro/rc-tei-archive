               <p>I have this instant received a letter from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LambCharles">Charles Lamb</a>. after mentioning your friendly offer to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</a> of serving him in the India house

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Charles Lamb was a clerk at the British East India Company’s headquarters, East India
                           House, in Leadenhall Street. John May had offered to help Charles Lloyd gain a similar
                           post, as he was acquainted with Sir Francis Baring (1740–1810; DNB), a leading Director
                           of the Company, 1779–1810.</span></div>
                  </div> he proceeds thus. “It is not likely that I shall ever put his goodness to the test
                  on my own account, for my prospects are very comfortable. But I know a man, a young
                  man

                  </div> whom he could serve thro the same channel, &amp; I think would be disposed to serve, were
                  he acquainted with his case. This poor fellow (whom I know just enough of to vouch
                  for his strict integrity &amp; worth) has lost two or three employments from illness which
                  he cannot regain: he was once insane, &amp; from the distressful uncertainty of his livelihood,
                  has reason to apprehend a return of that malady. he has been for some time dependant
                  on a woman, whose lodger he formerly was, but who can ill afford to maintain him,
                  &amp; I know that on Xmas night last he actually walked about the streets all night rather
                  than accept of her bed which she offered him, &amp; offerd herself to sleep in the kitchen;
                  &amp; that in consequence of that severe cold he is labouring under a bilious disorder,
                  besides a depression of spirits which incapacitates him from exertion when he most
                  needs it. For Gods sake Southey if it does not go against you to ask favours, do it
                  now, ask it as for me – but do not do a violence to your feelings, because he does
                  not know of this application, &amp; will suffer no disappointment.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">What I meant to say was this – there are in the India house what are called Extra
               Clerks, not on the establishment like me, but employed in Extra-businesses, by-jobs.
               these get about £50 a year or rather more but never rise. a Director can put in at
               any time a young man in this office, &amp; it is by no means considered so great a favour
               as making as establishd Clerk. he would think himself as rich as an Emperor, if he
               could get such a certain situation, &amp; be relieved from those disquietudes which I
               do fear may one day bring back his distemper.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You know <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> M<sup>r</sup> May better than I do, but I know enough to believe that he is a good man. he did
               make me that offer I have mentioned, but you will perceive that such an offer cannot
               authorize me in applying for another person. But I cannot help writing to you on the
               subject, for the young man is perpetually before my eyes, &amp; I should feel it a crime
               not to strain all my petty interest to do him service.”</p>
            <p class="indent6">–––––</p>
            <p class="indent1">I have just time my dear friend to copy this for to days post. these miserable tales
               make<span style="text-decoration: line-through">s</span> one sick when without the power of doing good. I should add if you wish to communicate
               immediately with Lamb upon the subject a letter to the India house will find him.</p>
