               <p>According to the family Bible my brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Thomas</a> was twenty on the 1<sup>st</sup> of December last. he has been five years in the service. certainly it is his intention
                  to continue &lt;in&gt; it till he gets a Lieutenancy. his future plans, future circumstances
                  must determine, &amp; no person has any business to enquire into them. As for his political
                  opinions, I am not his conscience keeper, nor do I think it a question to be &lt;asked
                  or&gt; answered, till S<sup>t</sup> Dominic

            <p class="indent1">My dear Grosvenor do not suppose that I am insensible of your friendly intentions.
               but whoever the person may be who thus qualifies his hints of patronage, I think his
               questions somewhat unnecessary &amp; impertinent. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> is a good sailor, he is a young man in whom I know no fault, not even a failing;
               I love &amp; respect him, not because he is my brother, but because I know no one more
               entitled to respect &amp; love. Assuredly every additional interest is desirable – but
               I trust he has enough, to need but little, any assistance so proffered.</p>
            <p class="indent1">And now Grosvenor I will write to you upon this subject, for I have been thinking
               of your friend in power all the last page. I thank you. write to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> – he will be gratified by hearing from you, &amp; his answer will be the only proper
               data for you to act upon. I answer but only for myself in this world.</p>
            <p class="indent1">As for news of myself – I have none – except indeed that an event of some importance
               happened to me on Friday, when I had a tooth drawn. I am well – tho I believe approaching
               still nearer to the true skeleton proportion. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> is better than when she left London – but not in health. She is very thin &amp; very
               weak. more I have not to say. I have no love of epistolizing; in this I am altered.
               in other points I am the same – &amp; among those others, <span style="text-decoration: line-through">I</span></p>
