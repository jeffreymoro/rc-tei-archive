                           had previously served in the Royal Navy and been Superintendant of British Honduras
                           1787-1790. He was imprisoned without trial in 1798-1801 under particularly harsh conditions

                  </div> business is to me still mysterious. I could have found him guilty of high folly –
                  but not of high treason. it rather seems as if he <span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> had been talking treason than conspiring, prating about what might or could be, not
                  plotting what <span class="ital">should</span> be, playing with a halter till he was caught in the noose. I wish he had been spared,
                  because tho his former <span style="text-decoration: line-through">offerings</span> services were no fair plea for pardon upon such an occasion, his former sufferings
                  were: oppression maketh a wise man mad, &amp; it should have been remembered that Colonel
                  Despard had been the most oppressed man in his Majestys dominions. his pardon would
                  have given administration a character for clemency which is always advantageous. however
                  to their credit they saw none of that wanton cruelty in the whole proceedings which
