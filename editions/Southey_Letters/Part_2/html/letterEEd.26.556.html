               answer to your last; &amp; gallop thro this as fast as I can lest the Post should leave
               me behind. – the Yellow Fever has not yet reached us &amp; the hubbub of invasion has
               long subsided. Of the paper money I have before detailed the evil consequences at
               present a new financial <span style="text-decoration: line-through">operation</span> &lt;operation&gt; is about to be adopted, not in opposition to system &amp; experience – but
               in sheer ignorance – the copper is to be called in, recoined, &amp; issued at double its
               value – to the great advantage of our Birmingham traders, who have already sent over
               a brave cargo of bank notes. provisions are most enormously dear – <span style="text-decoration: line-through">the</span> every one raising the price of his commodity to repay the discount which he loses.
               <span style="text-decoration: line-through">the poor &amp;</span> the servants of government suffer the whole loss – &amp; the poor pay the advance upon
               every thing with no increase of <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> wages adequate. the wisdom of thus defrauding their army &amp; navy officers of a fifth
               part of their pay is too obvious to need a comment. moreover they have reformed the
               army – that is taken away the regiments from their Colonels – &amp; left the old officers
               who have grown grey in the service with less than they had thirty years ago.</p>

               <p>You know the precarious state of Lisbon. the earthquake may shatter it today. it may
                  be only warned by its annual slight shocks. the state stands upon as uncertain a foundation.
                  the court is poor, &amp; blindly &amp; beastily ignorant. provisions dearer than in any other
                  part of Europe. the Princes

I saw him lately at Mafra following S<sup>t</sup> Francis &amp; his <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx</span> flour-&amp;-water-Deity round the town, &amp; feasting &lt;a&gt; <span style="text-decoration: line-through">the</span> set of beggarly friars – the most ignorant &amp; blackguard of all the monastic orders
                  &amp; thus he spends his time, &amp; lies down at night with the idea that he has done his
                  duty in the day. He has had a monument made for the Prince of Waldeck
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Christian August von Waldeck (1744–1798), Marshal of the Portuguese army 1797–1798.
                           His monument finally found a place in the English Cemetery in Lisbon.</span></div>
                  </div> who died here. a costly &amp; handsome piece of sculpture which he wished to see when
                  it was finished. But the German Princeling was a Protestant – &amp; the Regent of Portugal
                  would not enter a heretical burying ground. the monument has therefore been put up
                  for the present in one of the convents that he may see it!</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">But with all this court devotion a spirit of toleration exists formerly unknown in
               Portugal. there is no doubt that he would think it a good deed to burn a few Jews,
               &amp; that the mob would think it good fun. mobs are never tolerant. Were you to roast
               a Socinian in England there would be a holyday over the Kingdom &amp; all the church bells
               would ring. to the ministry &amp; higher clergy this moderation or indifference must be
               imputed. the friars if I may judge by what I have seen &amp; heard envy the fate of their
               brethren in France, &amp; like them would gladly join a revolution which – whatever it
               did to the other classes of society, certainly gave liberty to them. A Portugueze
               of good family had <span style="text-decoration: line-through">in</span> a sister in a French nunnery. on the dissolution of the convents he immediately secured
               her an admission here &amp; wrote to her to come with all speed from the land of Atheism.
               she replied – she was very much obliged to him – but she was married.</p>
            <p class="indent1">To the prevalence of indifference or infidelity I attribute this sort of toleration.
               my man observed to me one day that no miracles were worked now – &amp; the reason was
               there was not faith. Sir said he, there was a man in my country who was very ill &amp;
               he wanted to have a relic &amp; there was none to be had. so one of his friends cut a
               piece of dry stick, &amp; wrapt it up in a linen cloth &amp; put it into bed to him, &amp; told
               him that was a piece of S<sup>t</sup> Somebody staff. &amp; the man got <span style="text-decoration: line-through">up</span> well – for his faith cured him. Is not the failure of miracles like the silence of
               the Oracles? the juggle is over – perhaps the people are too wise to be cheated, perhaps
               the clergy are too wealthy to cheat. their predecessors made their fortune – &amp; they
               have given over trade &amp; are enjoying it.</p>
            <p class="indent1">But all is silently done. No hand has laid the Axe to the great Upas Tree the canker
               from France has reached it – &amp; it is ready to fall with the rottenness of age. the
               few books that are published could not be hostile to the established systems – if
               the Authors wished – &amp; the Saints have usually their fair portion of pages – a full
               tythe in kind.</p>

            <p>About India my mind fluctuates. my inclination is against it decidedly – &amp; in the
               opposite scale perhaps curiosity is a heavier weight than prudence. [MS torn] it is
               certain that a hot climate suits me. perhaps is even necessary. if that should prove
               the case it will be Hobsons choice. but India is too hot for comfort – &amp; I have an
               abhorrence of East-Indianised Englishmen. the South of Europe would [MS obscured]redly
               be my choice – if I could chuse. I like this country so well that I should be content
               to exchange the society &amp; the fire &amp; the fogs &amp; the bread &amp; butter of England for
               the filth &amp; the fruit &amp; the sun of Portugal, with no better equipage thro life than
