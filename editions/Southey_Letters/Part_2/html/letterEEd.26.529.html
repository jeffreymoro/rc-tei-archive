The Portuguese settlements in Asia contain
                  50,000 souls; those in Africa 80,000; Brazil 430,000: Madeira and Porto Santo 130,000;
                  the Azore Islands, 80,000; Cape Verde Islands, 16,000; the Islands in the Sea of Guinea,
                  3000. The number of inhabitants in all these colonies and foreign possessions then
                  is 799,000; and consequently, the sum total of all the subjects of the king of Portugal
                  3,024,000.</p>

               <p>This kingdom, according to the statements of the Portuguese, is 150 Portuguese miles
                  in length, and 40 in breadth. According to <span class="ital">Büsching</span> its length is no more than 75, and the breadth 35 common German miles.

                  </div> The whole superficial contents amount, according to the best maps of the country,
                  to 1875 geographical miles: so that there are only on an average 1190 inhabitants
                  to every square mile. This low degree of population is partly owing to the licentious
                  manners of the people, partly to the disproportionate number of the clergy and religious
                  of both sexes, of whom there are said to be 200,000. The population of Lisbon is by
                  Büsching estimated at 150,000. Our author makes it only 100,000. The number of inhabitants
                  of the other cities of the kingdom he gives as follows: Coimbra 12,000; Oporto 50,000;
                  Setubal from 11 to 12,000; the district of Setubal including the city, 20,000.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">All the provinces of Portugal are not equally fruitful. Oranges, which Estremadura,
               Alentejo and Algarve produce in great abundance, and of an excellent quality, are
               wholly wanting in the other provinces. On the other hand, Entre Duero e Minho distinguishes
               itself by its well-conducted agriculture. Traz los Montes is almost wholly barren,
               and cultivated only on the banks of the rivers. Beira produces all the necessaries
               of life: the sea that washes its shores abounds with fish: its pastures feed numerous
               herds of cattle; and it likewise furnishes honey and salt. Estremadura is not less
               favoured by nature: its wines are excellent. In Alentejo rice is produced. Algarve,
               too, is well cultivated. Portugal would be more productive, and the state of agriculture
               more flourishing, if the English had not got possession of the corn-trade.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The land-forces of Portugal consist of 29 regiments of infantry, and 10 regiments
               of cavalry; constituting altogether a military establishment of 30,000 men, under
               the command of 104 colonels, 150 majors, 42 generals, a field-marshall, a general
               of cavalry, a general of artillery, 3 inspectors-general, 8 lieutenant-generals, and
               28 major-generals. Of the wretched state into which the army has here sunken, many
               striking proofs occur; the truth of which cannot well be doubted, as these facts are
               every where asserted, and no where contradicted. The Portuguese navy consists of 13
               ships of the line, and 15 frigates. The trading vessels amount to scarcely 100.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The public revenue of Portugal is, according to some, 76, according to others 80,
               millions of French livres: and the debts of the state had, in the time of our traveller,
               already risen to the sum of 15 millions of cruzados. The chief branch of the king’s
               revenue is that drawn from the American mines; the yearly produce of which is estimated
               at from 50 to 60 millions, of which however a small proportion only comes into the
               royal exchequer. The trade of Portugal is, it is well known, entirely in the hands
               of the English.</p>
