                  days &amp; a half. soon said – but what a world of misery was comprized in those five
                  days &amp; half! I neither could eat or sleep, &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> suffered more than me. all my former sea nausea was trifling to this – &amp; yet our weather
                  was so singularly favourable. I saw porpusses – &amp; a grampus. a shark was seen but

                  the cutter spoke us – or rather answered us in English. it cured me for six hours,

                  a regard for me &amp; talks of our journey with a minuteness of recollection which only
                  pleasure could have preserved. his voice &amp; tones are familiar, &amp; assist me in the
                  language – besides he has brains, &amp; if he cannot take me the straight road to his
                  meaning, will drive roundabout till I get there at last. We are without a female servant.
                  the one who was engaged for us disappointed <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a>. his old woman at present visits us. today I have sate at the receipt of visits –
                  these I must return in due form, – then plead my health, drop the intercourse &amp; go

            <p class="indent1">Four years have passed away since I left Lisbon. so long a time had blunted memory,
               &amp; every thing seems half new to me – new enough to interest – not to depress by a
               total strangeness. I see much which would else have escaped me thro <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</a> eyes. she is as much amused at seeing the Portugueze women walking in thick heavy
               large woollen cloaks in their May, as they would be at her muslin in an English December.
               Every thing, while it amuses her, makes her like England – but you know how any foreign
               country makes an Englishman proud – &amp; will easily conceive that I am all Anglicanized
               already. An Englishman in the streets of Lisbon – is like the Heathen Gods of poetry
               when they descend you know them by their gait – their figure – not by their odours
               indeed – for the difference between them &amp; the natives is that they do not smell,
               &amp; the perfumes of ambrosia could have been nothing to the delight of having no stink
               at all here. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> has discovered that there are no middle-aged women to be seen – this is a well known
               effect of hot climate. like the primrose that <span style="text-decoration: line-through">blossom</span> flowers the Portugueze women burst into full bloom at once – &amp; then wither away.
               I have discovered something too – that married persons use seperate beds – this is
               the necessity of the climate, which I might have guessed. the natives are a libidinous
               people &amp; perhaps this custom may be one of the disposing causes.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I learnt from a fellow passenger, who has been two years ago in Spain, that their
                  abridged translation of Adam Smiths book

                  </div> because he says the passing bell is a ridiculous custom, which sometimes kills the
                  sick by terrifying them. the chief novelty here is paper money – of how long date
                  I know not yet – but the government themselves discounted it at six per cent the first
                  week – &amp; it is now at 20 per cent – <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxxxxx</span> discount! this occasioned an odd symptom here some fortnight ago only. they paid their
                  sailors chiefly in this paper – the men went to pay it away as they received it, at
                  par – &amp; their disappointment produced a sort of riot – they shouted out Liberty –
                  &amp; Bonaparte. it was quelled &amp; some of the ring leaders are in custody, but no punishment
                  has been inflicted.</p>

            <p class="indent1">I must not forget one great innovation – a mail coach runs to Coimbra – on the way
               to Porto &amp; is to go all the way when the road is compleated. it travels eight miles
               an hour. true <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</a> – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> has taken the journey in it. tis a Royal business, &amp; it answers for the road is frequented.
               one might prophecy good from this, the establishment of decent inns &amp; the growth of

               <p>Half a days delay has already given me something to correct. the Mail Coach is not
                  well managed &amp; not expected to last. tis a government business &amp; priced so high as
                  to exclude the great body of travellers – the little dealers who mount their mules.
                  now a single persons expences amount to as much as if he was in a chaise singly. the
                  Paper money has produced its usual consequence – Forgery. you must note however that
                  Portugueze eyes can see these slippery places for roguery. a German of talents &amp; once
                  of respectability is in custody for it in England.
