                  </div> as a reason for at least delaying it. these reasons strike me more forcibly than they
                  can do you from what I know of his connections in this part of the country. his father
                  is a wealthy farmer, just retired from business, but already dissatisfied with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">George</a> for rejecting the profession <span style="text-decoration: line-through">tha</span> he intended for him. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</a> has a brother in law who has done him no kind offices, &amp; his own brothers &amp; sisters
                  were I have heard, somewhat jealous of him who was to be the gentleman of the family.
                  he has never mentioned it to me, but from many circumstances I know he has not been
                  treated quite kindly at home. from that quarter I see little to hope. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EstlinJohnPrior">Estlin</a> is a good man, but he has many claims upon his <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx</span> purse, &amp; then he will be sadly grieved &amp; perhaps angry. he has the sectarian spirit
                  stronger than any man I ever knew. certainly <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</a> will meet with no assistance from him. &amp; for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</a>, he has so many idle habits of expence that he is himself always in want. he is one
                  of a very large family, &amp; his father complains of his thoughtlessness in money matters.
                  all this is very hopeless. I have besought him to think again, &amp; have urged him to
                  set about some literary employment, to try his strength; half his discontent arises
                  from mere indolence. it may amuse the present, &amp; he will find it well to have something
                  ready for the future. the period after his graduation does not alarm me so much, I
                  look forward to an improved situation <span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> myself, &amp; the means of assisting him. but I do not see how the first difficulties
                  can be surmounted, &amp; yet fear his resolution is irrevocable.</p>

                  long acquaintance would enable you to add to what you have said, not to alter it. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</a> is precipitate in all his feelings, &amp; ready to be the dupe of any one who will profess
                  attachment. I never knew a man so delighted with the exteriors of friendship. he was
                  once dissatisfied with me for a coldness &amp; freedom of manner, it soon wore off, &amp;
                  I believe he now sincerely regards me, tho the only person who has ever upon all occasions
                  advised &amp; at times reproved him, in unpalliated terms. certainly he is a powerful
                  reasoner, but he has an unhappy propensity to find out a reason for every thing he
                  does, &amp; whether he drinks wine or water it is always metaphysically right. his feelings
                  are always good, but he has not activity enough for beneficence. I look at his talents
                  with admiration but almost fear that they will leave no adequate testimony behind
                  them. I love him, but cannot esteem him, &amp; so I told him. he thinks nothing but what
                  is good, but then he only thinks. I fear he will never be useful to others, or happy
                  in himself.</p>
