               <p>My first letter is to you – to give you the earliest notice of our safe arrival. We
                  staid five days with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BarkerMary">Miss Barker</a> – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> could nowhere have been so comfortable. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BarkerMary">Miss B.</a> is really attached to us, &amp; I know few persons &amp; scarcely any women who possess so
                  much good sense &amp; good humour. yesterday we reached this place. I feel more pain at
                  the sight of little <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara</a>

                  such as her whom we have lost. her age – her little voice sting me to recollections
                  that I must blunt &amp; wear out, for they are not avoidable. I am as chearful as those
                  about &lt;me&gt; could wish – for that is to be commanded – but my sleep is harrassed by
                  dreams – &amp; the moment I cease to be actively employed either in reading or conversation
                  I feel that I am not happy enough to be idle. So common an affliction ought not to
                  so weigh me down – yet she was not a common child &amp; when I look at other children
                  that thought will recur, &amp; when I am alone in spite of sore eyes I cannot forbear
                  from making them still sorer.</p>
