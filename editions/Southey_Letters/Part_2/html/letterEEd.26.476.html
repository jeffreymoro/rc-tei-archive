                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>A reply to Rickman’s letter to Southey, 4 January 1800, proposing a system of ‘beguinages’,
                           modelled on lay Catholic communities of women in the Low Countries, in which poor
                           single women could work and live together.</span></div>
                  </div> I had considered it cursorily, for my mind has been more occupied by the possible
                  establishment of a different state of society, than by plans for improving the present.
                  To my undertaking the work you propose I wish there were no obstacles, but a very
                  important one exists in the nature of my own powers. The compositions in which I have
                  indulged have encouraged rapidity of feeling, a sudden combination of ideas, – but
                  they have been unfavourable to regular deduction &amp; methodical arrangement. another
                  objection arises from my present plans. I wish to try the effect of a better climate
                  in removing nervous disorders which are, &amp; long have been, growing upon me. However,
                  I am impressed by your letter, &amp; should much like to talk with you upon the subject
                  &amp; map out the country before us. Have you not leisure for a visit to Bristol? We shall
                  be truly glad to have you our guest, – &amp; here is a rich chemical harvest to be reaped.</p>

               <p>I do not see why you, a man of leisure should not execute the work you propose to

                  call, a good name, &amp; could thus procure a degree of immediate attention. But an able
                  book sooner or later must make its way. It is has often excited my wonder, not that

               Southey’s comment could be a garbled observation relating to Beddoes’s concern to
               disseminate his researches via theatrical public demonstration. Moreover, his awareness
               of medical theatres in other cities may have led Beddoes to consider opening a similar
               venue in Bristol. For example, Beddoes’ <em>Contributions to Physical and Medical Knowledge, Principally from the West of England</em> (Bristol, 1799), p. 19 described a ‘theatre’ in a Glasgow infirmary where students
               could observe operations.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
