            </div>
            <p class="indent1">the debility left by my nervous fever I have recovered, &amp; the pain at heart has abated.
               I have &lt;had&gt; the advice of five medical <span style="text-decoration: line-through">men</span> &lt;practitioners&gt; – do not suspect me of hypochondriacal extravagance – my friendships
               here are among scientific men – they agree in not thinking it a topical affection.
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes</a> has known five or six persons similarly affected – some of whom have desired in their
               wills to be opened – but – he added – they have none of them died yet. At night I
               have my old symptoms in a very distressing degree – feelings which I believe no one
               in health could well conceive.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I am advised to change climate, &amp; seriously think of so doing. it is only indisposition
               that has hitherto prevented me from giving myself up to professional labour. compelled
               as I am, almost to pass my days in idleness, &amp; abstain from pursuits the most intensely
               gratifying, how is it possible that I could endure the confinement of a lawyers office,
               &amp; the tedium of studies which only duty could make endurable? my health once established
               I will make every effort. of success I am not sanguine in expectation. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">it</span> I never believed myself qualified for the profession. my powers are only vigorous
               in solitude or in the society that imposes no restraint. I am easily confounded –
               you may recollect the similar temporary want of talent in Rousseau. I resemble him
               in nothing else. – to reestablish my health is the great immediate object – without
               that I am paralysed for every effort. Abroad then I think of going. Of course Lisbon
               offered itself as the most accessible place – but on reconsideration I am inclined
               to think of some other abode. If my health compels me to go abroad, the expence of
               time &amp; money which it will occasion, it must be my business to defray as far as I
               can by the journey itself, this therefore is a motive for a new route. another is
               that I will not go alone – to leave <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> would be saving very little at the expence of much lonely anxiety on her part, &amp;
               some on my own – besides she herself is of delicate health &amp; likely to be benefitted.
               now this would not be convenient to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> certainly, &amp; perhaps not agreable. therefore I have lookd farther south &amp; thought
               of Trieste. <span class="ital">there</span> I could judge of the security of Italy, in safety myself – &amp; the sea would always
               be open – or a retreat into Germany. as yet these are flying thoughts – but the advice
               of my medical advisers &amp; of my friends induces me to it – &amp; the recollection of what
               I was at Lisbon &amp; what I am now in animal strength.</p>
            <p class="indent1">My brothers <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a> are both <span style="text-decoration: line-through">at</span> in Bristol for their holydays. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> is now at the table busy in adjusting a dissected map. I find him grown much &amp; much
               improved, &amp; receive a good account of him. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">some faults he has to correct</span>. he is very quick – but both in him &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a> is the sad want of diffidence; in my judgement the great feature of genius. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> is now approaching to the important period of life. in my own case, early habits
               of solitude, &amp; feelings that shrink from observation counterbalanced the dangers of
               an overactive imagination – &amp; I had early acquired a deep love of morals – perhaps
               the habit induced by poetry of looking every where for the beautiful produced or certainly
               strengthened this. my brothers seems to possess the same imagination without the preserving
               qualities. Of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a> our account is good – far better than I expected – &amp; his master is a good man, whose
               praise deserves belief. so far is well with both. in the event of my death it is something
               consolatory that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> is already able to afford assistance, &amp; <span style="text-decoration: line-through">the</span> the younger ones growing up.</p>
