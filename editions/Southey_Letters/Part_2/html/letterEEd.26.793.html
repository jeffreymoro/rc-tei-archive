            <p class="indent1">It is many a week since I have written to or heard from you, &amp; probably you as well
               as myself have been silent more from industry than idleness. &amp; silent I should have
               continued till my commissions from Lisbon arrive &amp; enable me to say when I shall appear
               in town, if I had not a question to propound to my Oracle.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>How is it that debasing the coin produces such ruinous effects, in countries that
                  not carrying on any extensive commerce, have but very little dealing with foreign
                  states? &amp; at a period when there were no Birmingham traders

                  </div> to set up a mint of their own? the people always have complained that such a measure
                  has increased the price of every thing – was this effect produced merely by increasing
                  the current value, &amp; so lessening the value of money by increasing the quantity? if
                  so – paper money acts in the same manner – &amp; I want you to explain why a piece of
                  copper may not <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxxx</span> pass for five shillings – or five guineas as well as a piece of silver paper. It is
                  very clear that base money will not do for foreign traffic – but the iron money of
                  Sparta served at home as well as gold. the Castilian trade in the 14<sup>th</sup> century was too trifling to account for the general complaint. – When you have half
                  an hours leisure do make this matter plain to me.</p>

                  &amp; then I should go over, &amp; fix no period for my return. Now as things are, perhaps
                  it would be my wisest way to go over at once &amp; collect what I can while I can. but
                  then I shall be wishing myself at home. &amp; to look one way &amp; now another is not the
                  way for any one, except a waterman, to get on. Since you heard from me I have had
                  a sad diabetes, a complaint to which I have been often subject – in consequence probably
                  of general weakness, &amp; both last Autumn &amp; last Spring I felt the climate like a confirmed
                  valetudinarian. now I do not value my self so little as to think myself as well underground
                  as above it, for certainly I am good for something else beside church yard manure.
                  &amp; moreover I like life, for I enjoy it, &amp; have as <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx</span> much reason to like it &amp; as much actual happiness as falls to the lot of most men.
                  And I do verily believe that were I settled in such a climate as that of Lisbon it
                  would renew my lifehold lease, &amp; give me a better tenure, &amp; a chance of a much longer
                  life than I can possibly have here – where I am going on somewhat like a myrtle at
                  a parlour window in London. If there should be an army sent to Portugal, as there
                  was last war, I think I would try to get some <span class="ital">civil</span> appointment – there are plenty of such appointments with good pay &amp; good rations into
                  the bargain, &amp; perhaps <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</a> interest might help me to one – I could do the business &amp; yet have leisure.</p>
