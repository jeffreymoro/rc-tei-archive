               <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> should <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxx</span> be a fixture. besides I have materials enough in England to work upon for three years.
               it is an unpleasant thing to have no local attachment – no motive for choice – the
               neighbourhood of London suits me best for the convenience of getting books – &amp; of
               seeing the friends whom I wish to see while at the same time I am out of the way of
               idle acquaintance. these are solid reasons – but if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MayJohn">John May</a> should not be able to find such a house as would suit me I shall have as good a reason
               for pitching my tent farther from London in the disproportion of expence. if you were
               domesticated at Llangedwin I should wish for a Welsh cottage in sight of the grove
               that grows over the house – where I might learn Welsh from the servant &amp; the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxxx</span> church service! but the constant neighbourhood of one friend is among the necessaries
