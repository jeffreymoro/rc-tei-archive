            <p>Address: To/ Miss Barker/ Congreve/ Penkridge/ Staffordshire<br>Postmark: [partial] BRISTOL AUG 5 803. <br>MS: MS untraced; text is taken from Robert Galloway Kirkpatrick Jnr, ‘The Letters
               of Robert Southey to Mary Barker From 1800 to 1826’ (unpublished PhD, Harvard, 1967),
               pp. 62-63<br>Unpublished.<br>Dating note: Dated from internal evidence, written the day after Southey’s letter
               to Barker, [24 August 1803].</p>
            <p class="indent1">I wrote to you yesterday in haste &amp; since that, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> has been seized with what would have been fever if it had not been stopt in time.
               Of course it delays our departure, but I trust not later than Monday. Thoroughly comfortless
               as this house is become I know not whether this illness should altogether be considered
               as a misfortune – bodily suffering in some degree acts as an antidote against worse
               feelings. in all probability she has brought it on herself by refusing to take food
               for almost three days – now she takes medicines more patiently than she ever did (you
               know her mulishness of old) – in the hope of getting well &amp; departing.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I too am suffering for want of uniform self command. my eyes which God created for
                  the purpose of reading &amp; writing I used as water works with a womanly profusion by
                  fits, the one presently became sore – &amp; warm salt water proved a most vile collyrium.
                  let what will happen, grief must find some other vent in me. You see the original
                  sin begins to appear again in me. in truth I can be chearful &amp; joyous even now, &amp;
                  shall soon be contented – but to be as happy as I was four weeks agone – so calmly
                  &amp; completely happy, &amp; so awake to that happiness as to break out into fits of boyish
                  sportiveness as I then did – O Christ it must be a long time before that blessed state
                  be restored to me. the pain of amputation is over – but God knows how I miss the limb!
                  &amp; I could &amp; would go on but these damned hydraulics begin to work, &amp; if I cry I must
                  actually roar. I never before understood the force of Quarles’s quaint phrase to be
                  pickled in the brine of one’s own tears.

               in Cumberland some time if my health stands the climate. perhaps till I go to dear
               dear Portugal. if things go on smoothly I shall be able to keep a jack ass there –
