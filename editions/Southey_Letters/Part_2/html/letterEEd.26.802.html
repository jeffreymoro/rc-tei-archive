               <p>I have very long been silent – not because you were so – but because I was bound to
                  say something of reproof to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> in my letter – &amp; that was an unpleasant task. by one phrase in yours, I guess that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">his Uncle</a> has enabled him to discharge his debts. I believe it is useless ever to preach frugality
                  to one who has not the principle in his nature. but indeed if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> involves himself he will find that his relations however much they may wish to relieve
                  him, have not the power. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">his Uncle</a> would be able if he had no other calls. I work like a negro &amp; difficultly keep even
                  with the world – indeed not even that. his brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> has not been fortunate as yet in his profession. he is very generous – but has those
                  sailor-like habits – that let him get what fortune he will – he will never <span style="text-decoration: line-through">be rich</span> &lt;have to share.&gt; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> must be his own friend. Enough he shall have, but if he will not abstain from pleasures
                  – he must not expect to draw upon his friends wants to pay for them. Now this is said
                  too harshly – &amp; do not you show it to him. To what you now say I scarcely know how
                  to answer.

                  has no conscientious scruples – that I take it – means he has no conscience at all

                  – or low Arian ground – were I now at three &amp; twenty with the opinions that I hold
                  at nine &amp; twenty – would chuse the church for my profession – but then I have a deep
                  &amp; silent &amp; poet-feeling. connected with these things, that grows <span style="text-decoration: line-through">&amp;</span> with me &amp; will grow. I do not think <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harrys</a> mind has any similarity with mine. That he should change I should never have advised
                  – but now that he has written to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">his Uncle</a> I shall feel no sorrow for the change – tho in truth I believe <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">his Uncle</a> will advise him to follow his first choice.</p>
