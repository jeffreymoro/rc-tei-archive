                  Poet so well, that I shall make it my business to see as many of his pictures as I
                  can. A few lines which you wrote to Falmouth reached me here. we have upon the average
                  a packet weekly, &amp; you know not what a subject it is of hope &amp; expectation – &amp; when
                  it brings no letters what a sinking disappointment. I do not wish you were ill – but
                  I do wish you were idle enough, or curious enough to come over for two or three months
                  in which time you might see the greater part of Portugal. we seem only next-door to
                  Falmouth &amp; when I consider the facility afforded by the packets it seems astonishing
                  that curiosity does not lead more idlers here. I should much like leading you over
                  this country. It was my intention to send over Thalaba for publication – but I am
                  not yet determined – every thing ripens by time –, &amp; the poem appears to me good enough
                  to deserve a serious correction.
