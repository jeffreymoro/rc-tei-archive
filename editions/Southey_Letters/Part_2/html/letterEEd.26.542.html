                  That I have not written sooner is the fault of the wind – we have been three weeks

                  at an early stage, it prevents. however other diseases there are undistinguishably

                  among Christian virtues, &amp; they practise no other so universally. The poor Moriscoes
                  in Spain were forbidden to use their baths – because it was a Turkish custom. Certain
                  of the austerer monks would think it wicked to kill any of their vermin. others wear
