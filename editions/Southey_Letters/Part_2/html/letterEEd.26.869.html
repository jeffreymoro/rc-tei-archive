            <p class="indent1">I intrude upon you for the last time concerning this brother of mine. this evening
               I have received from him a letter as following – </p><br><p>Dear Robert</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I am sorry to be obliged to take up my pen to undeceive you in respect to my being
                  in some things fitted out for the Navy, as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</a> took care to get a person to dispose of my Uniform to a travelling Jew, that she might
                  have the money to help bear her expences into Herefordshire, where she gives me to
                  understand she is gone, but still orders me to direct my letters to Bristol (by the
                  by I do not know your direction.) She has not sent me a farthing nor wrote but once.
                  I believe my information respecting an Ensigns

                  </div> pay is correct, as you will find by examining Steels Army List.

                           was no equivalent publication for the Army.</span></div>
                  </div> I have six shirts &amp; 4 pair of Stockings. I have plenty of brown clothes. at all events
                  the sooner I get from Exeter the better.</p>

               &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">his Aunts</a> better than the sea – &amp; she has thought I should bestir myself the more on the belief
               that he had quarrelld with her – for his former letters did assert a quarrel – &amp; here
               a correspondence comes out. considering <span class="ital">her</span> roguery &amp; <span class="ital">his</span> roguery the sooner I settle the business the better – for his drafts &amp; letters have
               already cost me above twelve shillings. Be so good when you have read the inclosed
               to send it to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MayJohn">May</a>, &amp; desire him if he approves it to forward it to Exeter. you had better send him
               this also that he may see the anecdote of the Jew – &amp; infer from thence how hopeless
