               fact is I have been visiting in Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire, &amp; amid company, journeying
               &amp; some employments that follow me every where, I recollected not my unanswered letters

                  </div> it is unlucky that most of my friends here are yours also; however I mentioned your
                  proposed volumes to some of them who might not perhaps have otherwise known your intention.
                  We will do what we can, if not what we wish. your list has some 8 or 10 names – &amp;
                  it will be some advantage to have a country bookseller in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CottleJoseph">Cottle</a> who will feel a friendly interest in assisting the work.</p>

                  </div> whenever you take the subject of metre into consideration I shall beg you to weigh

                  which you perhaps may have seen in the Morning Post without suspecting their author.
                  four lines seem to me the best length for a lyric stanza. I have disposed them thus
                  differently in different odes. you know the Ode to evening
