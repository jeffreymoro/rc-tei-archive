            <p class="indent1">I inclose a second note with great pleasure – to announce the real &amp; true second birth
               of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">George Burnett</a>. he has found out his blunder – &amp; actually discovered to his own downright conviction
