                  a hundred guineas board and instruct him for four or five years; – a hundred guineas!
                  well, but thank God, there is Thalaba ready, for which I ask this sum. I have therefore
                  thus eat my calf, and desired <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">William Taylor</a> to inquire for a situation, – and so once more goes the furniture of my long expected
                  house in London.

               we yet know what the disease is, though it is not three hundred miles from us, and
               kills five hundred a day at Seville! Contagious by clothes or paper it cannot be,
               or certainly it would have been here. A man was at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</a> who had recovered from the disease, and escaped from Cadiz only seventeen days before
               he told the story in a pot-house here. In Cadiz it might have been confined, because
               that city is connected by a bridge with the main land; but once beyond that limit,
               and it must take its course, – precautions are impossible; the only one in their power
               they do not take, – that of suffering no boat to come from the opposite shore. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> is for packing off to England, but I will not move till it comes, and then away for

                  London. We think of mounting jackasses and rambling some two hundred miles in the
                  country. I shall laugh to see <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> among the dirt and fleas, who I suspect will be more amused with her than she will
                  with them. She is going in a few days to visit the nuns: they wanted to borrow some
