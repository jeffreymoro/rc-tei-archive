            <p class="indent1">It is so long since I have heard from you that I feel a degree of uneasiness at your
               silence. but one great benefit of marriage is that it never allows those intervals
               of vacancy which must occur in the best directed solitude, &amp; which probably create
               the epistolary mania in very young persons. this was my own case once. I wrote not
               from a fullness of matter to communicate but from sheer emptiness – day after day
               – fools-cap sheets &amp; close writing for three pages &amp; the top &amp; bottom of the fourth.
               more knowledge &amp; the daily increasing consciousness of how much yet remains to be
               learnt. more employments &amp; marriage have long since cured me. My pleasure now consists
               in receiving letters, not in writing them. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The state of my health is in some respects amended, in others stationary. I had accustomed
                  myself to low living, seldom eating except at breakfast &amp; dinner &amp; then with an appetite
                  no ways like my Portugal one; &amp; when at home drinking only water. Since my removal
                  here I have increased the number of my meals, taken porter with my meat, &amp; wine after
                  it. certainly I feel stronger, – but the startings &amp; miserable feelings which have
                  so long distressed me at night still continued &amp; were only lessened by ether, not
                  removed. About a fortnight ago I breathed the oxyd of azote

                           Nitrous Oxide, or Dephlogisticated Nitrous Air, and Its Respiration (1800). Widely

                  </div> I had been fearful of it since my return to Bristol – but on making the experiment,
                  was surprized by its beneficial influence. I slept without <span style="text-decoration: line-through">for</span> the disease which for months before had invariably preceded sleep. after several nights
                  it recurred again. I repeated the dose. &amp; have taken it about once in three days since,
                  &amp; the complaint has been till now removed. to say the gas has been the cause would
                  be hasty – but I cannot help thinking so. The pain in my side still continues – its
                  intermittance seems to prove that there is no organic affection, &amp; this is the opinion
                  of all my medical friends. the spring is advancing – &amp; I hope something from warmer
                  &amp; less inconstant weather. certainly I will avoid the next winter. the experience
                  of two has satisfied me of the ill effect of that season on my health. I have written
                  to Lisbon, <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx x</span> &amp; stated to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> my reason for thinking of removing somewhere abroad, &amp; the sum I can raise for the
                  consequent expence. my reasons also for not determining immediately upon Lisbon, at
                  the same time stating that if he thought that more advisable, all circumstances considered,
                  I would adopt that plan, &amp; employ my time there by seriously beginning the History
                  of the country.
