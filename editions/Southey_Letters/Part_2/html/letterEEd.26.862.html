                  return of post. it had been directed to Bristol. I am very much disturbd &amp; distressed
                  by this circumstance. For what he can have incurred the expence God knows. &amp; for a
                  boy of fifteen to be taking up money in my name is a thing which must not be permitted.
                  You know as much of his situation as I do, &amp; if he be at M<sup>r</sup> Barhams

                  </div> by invitation to spend his Xmas his washing bills are all the expences he need incur.
                  I know not what to do &amp; never stood so much in need of advice. my first feeling was
                  immediately to return the draft unaccepted, that the boy may feel the consequences
                  of his ill conduct immediately – for sure I am in my own mind that he must be made
                  to feel sooner or later, &amp; that if he be now encouraged to rely on me I shall never
                  be safe. – On consulting with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Coleridge</a> I have done this – &amp; have told the holder of the draft that not knowing the cause
                  or occasion I could not conceive what circumstances could have justified a respectable
                  tradesman in cashing a draft for a boy <span style="text-decoration: line-through">just</span> &lt;of&gt; fifteen. – &amp; I have said to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a> that he ought to know as I would always exert myself to the utmost to serve him &amp;
                  assist him in any worthy pursuit, so he ought to be sure that I would never become
                  an accomplice in any immoral action by giving my after sanction. this lesson will
                  teach him that I can act decidedly.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Could I with propriety have detained the draft I should have awaited your advice.
                  as that could not be I think what has been done is on the whole best – painful as
                  it is. He can have no excuse for what he has done, having without my knowledge &amp; against
                  my known opinion quitted the situation in which I had placed him.

                  no justifiable expence to that amount. the holder of the draft says <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a> told him I was advised – this was not the case – the boy thought to take me by surprize.
                  I feel confident that if I had in this instance yielded he would have imagined me
                  in his power &amp; proceeded from bad to worse. As it now stands the lesson <span style="text-decoration: line-through">will</span> &lt;can&gt; only frighten him – the man must take back whatever he has entrusted him with
                  – &amp; deserves some loss for having accepted a draft from a boy. – I thought to have
                  ended the letter very differently but thus it is I am plagued &amp; thus it will continue
                  to be. It was <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">Mothers</a> fate before me.</p>
