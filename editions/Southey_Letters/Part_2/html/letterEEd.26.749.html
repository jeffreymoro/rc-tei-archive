            <p class="indent1">Last night – dear <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">William Taylor</a> – I commissioned an Embassador to pay five pounds to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</a>. by this days post I learn that this was too late – &amp; that the debt is transferrd
               to you. half will go in this letter – the other in course as soon as this is acknowledged
               – but do not you give me a mere line of acknowledgement. consider me as a lover of
               letter-reading, however deficient in letter writing from half a dozen causes.</p>
            <p class="indent1">About <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</a> I had written you half a letter when a very absurd explanation took place, which
               rendered that half useless. he has thought proper to quarrel with me. he complains
               that I did not behave well to him in London – that my manners were always those of
               a superiour, always expressing a familiar contempt, that I had not visited him enough.
               All I could reply was that I had never felt or expressed myself as to him but with
               affection. familiar I was indeed, as became me with one of my oldest friends – that
               I did not visit him because, he being single, I made him visit me – that I saw no
               one friend so often in London – that I went to no public sight or amusement without
               him, − that he dined with me whenever I could persuade him, &amp; that twice or thrice
               every week I did not remind him <span style="text-decoration: line-through">of</span>. But this was only the effect of a growing dislike towards me – not the cause. this
               is evident. he tells me that I &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> never treated him properly. mark you this word <span class="ital">treated</span> is in a physico-mental sense – “Every human being – &amp; now <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">William Taylor</a> I quote his words – can influence the mind of another human being <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx</span> whom he is placed– near, &amp; upon this great truth all the principles of education
               defend.” Well! it seems <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> nor I had directed his mind to profitable studies &amp; we had never advised him what
               to do. – upon this I reminded him of my constant cry – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</a> employ yourself! – the advice I had given him from the time of his going to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Yarmouth">Yarmouth</a> &amp; the specific plans which I had from time to time pointed out. But he was determined
               to quarrel with me, &amp; replied that the advice had not been given properly. I had not
               <span class="ital">treated</span> him well. I could not avoid answering that I had ever regarded him as my friend –
               not my patient, &amp; as for advice, if it had failed, it was not because the medicines
               were bad but because they were not taken. he desired not to see me while he was here.
               his mind he confessed was not in a state to judge deliberately – but his feelings
               could not be mistaken, if when he was well he found out that he was wrong in judging
               of me as he did – he would then let me know – I begged him to take care how he fostered
               this dislike, told him that by the time he had found it out, the habit of hatred would
               be confirmed – &amp; besought him very earnestly not to estrange himself from his oldest
               friend than whom he had none who loved him better. you are come here <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">George</a> – said I – for your health. you say company, is necessary for it – &amp; yet you will
               not come to that house where you would be always most welcome. You will excuse me
               – <span style="text-decoration: line-through">said</span> he replied – if I tell you these are mere words. I bore this <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> lie direct twice before I bade him remember I had some pride &amp; some feeling as well
               as himself – then left him to his own ways.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Now indeed envy is at the bottom of all this. as for my own feelings upon the subject
                  you will guess what they needs must be. not anger, for old habits of affections are
                  not so soon worn out – I am merely passive in this quarrel – ready to excuse it upon
                  any plea of diseased head or diseased digestion that he may make. but it has altered
                  my mind towards him, &amp; in spite of regret I am fully awake to the extraordinary folly
                  of his language &amp; actions. he is as completely driven mad by his studies as ever Quixote

                  he has fed upon, &amp; is now bringing them &lt;up&gt; by crude mouthfuls. he walks thro the
                  streets with his head lifted &amp; his eyes looking round to see who hears him, conversing
                  that every body may hear him upon his “high moral <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> views of things” &amp; “principles of conduct different from common men.”</p>

            <p class="indent1">All this will give you pain. I tell it you as the friend of both. when you write to
               him – if you mention the subject at all, say of me that I am sorry he has done this
               – that I [MS illegible]rly deny any intentional disrespect (God knows I never felt
               it) – &amp; that at any time I shall rejoice to shake him by the hand</p>
            <p class="indent1">I am still unsettled – disappointed of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#MaesGywn">Maes Gwyn</a> &amp; looking out for some country dwelling within reach of Bristol. you are unhappily
