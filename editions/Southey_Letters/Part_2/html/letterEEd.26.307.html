               <div class="l">Had made his heart like stone,</div>
               <div class="l">And Jaspar lookd with envious eyes</div>
               <div class="l">On riches not his own.</div><br><div class="l">On plunder bent abroad he went </div>
               <div class="l">Towards the close of day,</div>
               <div class="l">And loitered on the lonely road</div>
               <div class="l">Impatient for his prey.</div><br><div class="l">No traveller came, he loitered long</div>
               <div class="l">And often lookd around,</div>
               <div class="l">And pausd &amp; listened eagerly </div>
               <div class="l">To catch some coming sound.</div><br><div class="l">He sat him down beside the stream</div>
               <div class="l">That crost the lonely way; –</div>
               <div class="l">So fair a scene might well have charmd</div>
               <div class="l">All evil thoughts away.</div><br><div class="l">He sat beneath a willow tree</div>
               <div class="l">That cast a trembling shade,</div>
               <div class="l">The gentle river full in front</div>
               <div class="l">A little island made,</div><br><div class="l">Where pleasantly the moon-beam shone</div>
               <div class="l">Upon the poplar trees,</div>
               <div class="l">Whose shadow on the stream below</div>
               <div class="l">Playd slowly to the breeze.</div><br><div class="l">He listend – &amp; he heard the wind</div>
               <div class="l">That waved the willow tree,</div>
               <div class="l">He heard the waters flow along</div>
               <div class="l">And murmur quietly.</div><br><div class="l">He listened for the travellers tread –</div>
               <div class="l">The nightingale sung sweet;</div>
               <div class="l">He started up, for now he heard</div>
               <div class="l">The sound of coming feet.</div><br><div class="l">He started up &amp; graspt a stake</div>
               <div class="l">And waited for his prey,</div>
               <div class="l">There came a lonely traveller,</div>
               <div class="l">And Jaspar crost his way.</div><br><div class="l">But Jaspars threats &amp; curses faild</div>
               <div class="l">The traveller to appal,</div>
               <div class="l">He would not lightly yield the purse</div>
               <div class="l">That held his little all.</div><br><div class="l">Awhile he struggled, but he strove</div>
               <div class="l">With Jaspars strength in vain,</div>
               <div class="l">Beneath his blows he fell &amp; groand</div>
               <div class="l">And never spake again.</div><br><div class="l">He lifted up the murdered man</div>
               <div class="l">And plunged him in the flood,</div>
               <div class="l">And in the running waters then</div>
               <div class="l">He cleansed his hands from blood</div><br><div class="l">The waters closed around the corpse</div>
               <div class="l">And cleansed his hands from gore,</div>
               <div class="l">The willow waved, the stream flowd on</div>
               <div class="l">And murmurd as before.</div><br><div class="l">There was no human eye had seen</div>
               <div class="l">The blood the murderer spilt,</div>
               <div class="l">And Jaspars conscience never knew</div>
               <div class="l">The avenging goad of guilt.</div><br><div class="l">But soon the ruffian had consumd </div>
               <div class="l">The gold he gaind so ill,</div>
               <div class="l">And years of secret guilt past on</div>
               <div class="l">And he was needy still.</div><br><div class="l">One eve beside the alehouse fire</div>
               <div class="l">He sat as it befell,</div>
               <div class="l">When in there came a labouring man</div>
               <div class="l">Whom Jaspar knew full well.</div><br><div class="l">He sat him down by Jaspars side</div>
               <div class="l">A melancholy man,</div>
               <div class="l">For spite of honest toil, the world</div>
               <div class="l">Went hard with Jonathan.</div><br><div class="l">His toil a little earnd; &amp; he </div>
               <div class="l">With little was content,</div>
               <div class="l">But sickness on his wife had fallen</div>
               <div class="l">And all he had was spent.</div><br><div class="l">Then with his wife &amp; little ones</div>
               <div class="l">He shared his scanty meal,</div>
               <div class="l">And saw their looks of wretchedness</div>
               <div class="l">And felt what wretches feel.</div><br><div class="l">That very morn the Landlords power</div>
               <div class="l">Had seized the little left,</div>
               <div class="l">And now the sufferer found himself</div>
               <div class="l">Of every thing bereft.</div><br><div class="l">He lent his head upon his hand</div>
               <div class="l">His elbow on his knee,</div>
               <div class="l">And so by Jaspars side he sat,</div>
               <div class="l">And not a word said he.</div><br><div class="l">Nay – why so downcast? Jaspar cried –</div>
               <div class="l">Come cheer up Jonathan!</div>
               <div class="l">Drink neighbour – drink – twill warm thy heart</div>
               <div class="l">Come come – take courage man.</div><br><div class="l">He took the cup that Jaspar gave</div>
               <div class="l">And down he draind it quick;</div>
               <div class="l">I have a wife, said Jonathan</div>
               <div class="l">And she is deadly sick.</div><br><div class="l">She has no bed to lie upon –</div>
               <div class="l">I saw them take her bed –</div>
               <div class="l">I have three children – would to God</div>
               <div class="l">That they &amp; I were dead.</div><br><div class="l">Our Landlord he goes home to night</div>
               <div class="l">And he will sleep in peace;</div>
               <div class="l">I would that I were in my grave</div>
               <div class="l">For there all troubles cease!</div><br><div class="l">In vain I prayd him to forbear </div>
               <div class="l">Tho wealth enough has he.–</div>
               <div class="l">God be to him as merciless</div>
               <div class="l">As he has been to me!</div><br><div class="l">When Jaspar saw the poor mans soul</div>
               <div class="l">On all his ills intent,</div>
               <div class="l">He plied him with the heartening cup</div>
               <div class="l">And with him forth he went.</div><br><div class="l">This Landlord on his homeward road</div>
               <div class="l">Twere easy now to meet;</div>
               <div class="l">The road is lonesome Jonathan!</div>
               <div class="l">And vengeance man, is sweet.</div><br><div class="l">He listened to the tempters voice</div>
               <div class="l">The thought it made him start –</div>
               <div class="l">His head was hot, &amp; wretchedness</div>
               <div class="l">Had hardened now his heart.</div><br><div class="l">Along the lonely road they went</div>
               <div class="l">And waited for their prey,</div>
               <div class="l">They sat them down beside the stream</div>
               <div class="l">That crost the lonely way.</div><br><div class="l">They sat them down beside the stream</div>
               <div class="l">And never a word they said,</div>
               <div class="l">They sat &amp; listened silently</div>
               <div class="l">To hear the travellers tread.</div><br><div class="l">The night was calm, the night was dark,</div>
               <div class="l">No star was in the sky,</div>
               <div class="l">The wind it waved the willow boughs,</div>
               <div class="l">The stream flowed quietly.</div><br><div class="l">The night was calm, the air was still,</div>
               <div class="l">Sweet sung the nightingale,</div>
               <div class="l">The soul of Jonathan was soothd</div>
               <div class="l">His heart began to fail.</div><br><div class="l">Tis weary waiting here, he cried</div>
               <div class="l">And now the hour is late,</div>
               <div class="l">Methinks he will not come to night –</div>
               <div class="l">Tis useless more to wait.</div><br><div class="l">Have patience man! the ruffian said</div>
               <div class="l">A little we may wait,</div>
               <div class="l">But longer shall his wife expect</div>
               <div class="l">Her husband at the gate.</div><br><div class="l">Then Jonathan grew sick at heart,</div>
               <div class="l">My conscience yet is clear –</div>
               <div class="l">Jaspar it is not yet too late –</div>
               <div class="l">I will not linger here.</div><br><div class="l">How now! cried Jaspar. why I thought</div>
               <div class="l">Thy conscience was asleep!</div>
               <div class="l">No more such qualms. the night is dark</div>
               <div class="l">The river here is deep.</div><br><div class="l">What matters that, said Jonathan</div>
               <div class="l">Whose blood began to freeze,</div>
               <div class="l">When there is one above whose eye</div>
               <div class="l">The deeds of darkness sees.</div><br><div class="l">We’re safe enough, said Jaspar then</div>
               <div class="l">If that be all thy fear,</div>
               <div class="l">Nor eye below, nor eye above</div>
               <div class="l">Can pierce the darkness here.</div><br><div class="l">That instant as the Murderer spake</div>
               <div class="l">There came a sudden light,</div>
               <div class="l">Strong as the midday sun it shone</div>
               <div class="l">Tho all around was night.</div><br><div class="l">It hung upon the willow tree</div>
               <div class="l">It hung upon the flood,</div>
               <div class="l">It gave to view the poplar isle</div>
               <div class="l">And all the scene of blood.</div><br><div class="l">The traveller who journies there</div>
               <div class="l">He surely has espied</div>
               <div class="l">A Madman who has made his home</div>
               <div class="l">Upon the river side.</div><br><div class="l">His cheek is pale, his eye is wild</div>
               <div class="l">His look bespeaks despair.</div>
               <div class="l">For Jaspar since that hour has made</div>
               <div class="l">His home unsheltered there.</div><br><div class="l">And fearful are his dreams at night</div>
               <div class="l">And dread to him the day,</div>
               <div class="l">He thinks upon his untold crime</div>
               <div class="l">And never dares to pray.</div>
               <div class="l">The summer suns, the winter storms</div>
               <div class="l">Oer him unheeded roll –</div>
