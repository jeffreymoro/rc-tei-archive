            <p class="indent1">I write to you from Ottery where I have been uncomfortably detained five days by the
               impossibility of finding lodgings anywhere in its neighbourhood. I wishd to be as
               near as possible on <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridges</a> account &amp; additionally so as there is the probability of seeing you here – tomorrow
               however we go to Exeter where there can be no doubt of house room – &amp; eleven miles
               is a very walkable distance.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I have now seen <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeGeorge">George Coleridge</a>. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">his brother</a> &amp; you had taught me to respect him. in many things he reminds me of you – there is
               the resemblance that two persons who have lived much together &amp; with attached affections,
               bear to each other. something too he reminds me of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> – of his equalness &amp; kindness of <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> character, but he is not so chearful as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> nor has his situation been so favourable. he told me that from the age of eighteen
               he had never had leisure to read a book thro.</p>
            <p class="indent1">There are three classes of people in whose society I find pleasure. those in whom
               I meet with similarity of opinion – those who from a similarity of feeling tolerate
               difference of opinion, &amp; those to whom long acquaintance has attached me, who neither
               think nor feel with me, but who have the same recollections &amp; can talk of other times
               &amp; other scenes. accustomed to seclusion or to the company of those who know me &amp; to
               whom I can let out every thought as it rises, without the danger of being judged by
               a solitary expression, I am uncomfortable among strangers. A man loses many privileges
               when he is known to the world. go where I will my name has gone before me, &amp; strangers
               either receive me with expectations that I cannot gratify, or with evil prepossessions
               that I cannot remove. it is only in a stage coach that I am on an equal footing with
               an companions &amp; it is there that I talk the most &amp; leave them in the best humour with
               me.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I have just learnt that you do not visit Devonshire – I however have the expectation
               of seeing you in Hampshire during the winter. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeGeorge">George Coleridge</a> has been very friendly towards me &amp; I felt that his opinion of me had been influenced
               by you. he has <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">his brothers</a> forehead – but no other resemblance. it is wonderful how the strong feelings induced
               in composition change the countenance. strong thought is labour – an exercise essential
               to the minds health, or the face of a thinking man like the legs of a porter &amp; the
               arms of a blacksmith indicate how he has been employed.</p>
