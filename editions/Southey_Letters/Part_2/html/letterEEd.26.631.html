               <p>This morning I called on <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</a>, whom I found recovering from a bilious flux &amp; in the act<span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> of folding up a letter designed for you. he then for the first time showed me your
                  letter, &amp; his reply. I perceived that the provoking blunder in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LambCharles">Lambs</a> direction affected the tone of yours <span style="text-decoration: line-through">other</span>, &amp; that the seventeen shillings-worth of anger fell upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">George</a>. your caustic was too violent, it eat thro the proud flesh – but it has also wounded
                  the feeling &amp; healthy part below. the letter which I have suppressed was in the same
                  stile as his last. I prevailed on him to lay it up in his desk – because it was no
                  use showing you the wound you had inflicted – &amp; your time would be better any how
                  employed than in reading full pages that were not written with the design of giving
                  pleasure. That your phrases were too harsh I think &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LambCharles">Lamb</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LambMaryAnne">Mary Lamb</a> think also. twas a horse medicine – a cruel dose of yellow <span class="ital">gamboodge</span>

            <p class="indent1">What I foresaw – or rather hoped would take place is now going on in him. he begins
               to discover that hackneying authorship is not the way to be great. to allow that six
               hours writing in a public office is <span class="ital">better</span> than the same number of hours labour for a fat publisher – that it &lt;is&gt; more certain
               – less toilsome – quite as respectable. I have even prevailed on him to attend to
               his hand-writing – on the possibility of some such happy appointment – &amp; doubt not
               ere long to convince him, in his own way, of the moral fitness of writing straight
               lines &amp; distinct letters – according to all the laws of mind. he <span class="ital">wishes</span> to get a tutors place. in my judgement a clerks would suit him better, for its permanence.
               nothing like experience! he would <span style="text-decoration: line-through">be</span> not think its duties beneath him. &amp; if he were so set at ease from the daily bread
               &amp; cheese anxieties that would disorder a more healthy intellect than his – I believe
               that passion for distinction which haunts him, would make him in the opinion of the
               world – the booksellers – &amp; himself – a very pretty historian. quite as good as any
               of the Scotch breed – It puzzles me how he has learnt to round his sentences so <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> ear-ticklingly. he has never rough-hewn any thing – but he finishes like a first

                  soon will be – &amp; quite enough for daily official work. If you could set him in the

               that he has never asked me to dine with him – &amp; not quite accordant with his general
               courtliness of conduct. Seeing little of him – I have not formed so high an opinion
               of his talents or information as you had led me to conceive. doubtless in his own
               department he possess both – but on all other ground I am the better traveller – &amp;
               he hardly knows the turnpike when I have beat thro all the by ways &amp; windings &amp; cross
               roads. I found it expedient to send him my sundry books in compliance with a hint
               to that effect. he called to thank me – &amp; this dropping a card has been the extent
