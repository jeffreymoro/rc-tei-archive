Life and Letters of John Rickman</em> (Boston and New York, 1912), p. 91 [in part].<br>Dating note: Dated from internal evidence; one of a series of letters written by Southey

            <p class="indent1">You have probably heard how my home comforts have been cut down to the ground. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaretEdithdau">my little girl</a> was laid by the side of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DanversMrs">M<sup>rs</sup> Danvers</a> yesterday. she was the little wonder &amp; favourite of the neighbourhood. &amp; I loved
               her better than man ought to love any thing of such uncertain existence.</p>
            <p class="indent1">We are going to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>, the best place for poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> who is almost heart broken. hers are all chronic feelings, &amp; it will be long before
               she recovers. As for me Suppression is so much my habit &amp; system that a stricture
               ought to be my natural death. I work double tides, work bodily at packing – talk –
               eat – as I should do. I am resigned &amp; shall soon be contented – chearful &amp; even joyous
               – but happy as I have been to that full extent &amp; with that full knowledge of my own
               happiness, that cannot be till I have another child, if it please God to give me another,
               nor even then unless it should be such as the one we have lost.</p>
            <div class="closer">God bless you.
