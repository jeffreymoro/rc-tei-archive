            <p class="indent1">I have written to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</a> to say I shall set out on Sunday if it be convenient to him to receive me at that
               time. his answer has not yet arrived but – if you do not hear from me by Mondays post
               — you may expect to see me on Monday morning. The coach will be in about nine or ten
               I suppose, &amp; as soon as I have cleansed &amp; breakfasted I shall proceed to Lincolns
               Inn.</p>

                  only upon the buyer – the paper duty fell at first in the gross sum upon the bookseller,
                  &amp; was an actual loss to him for all the copies that remained unsold – besides requiring
                  such an advance of first expence it often deterrd him from publishing. a stamp has
                  none of these objections.</p>
