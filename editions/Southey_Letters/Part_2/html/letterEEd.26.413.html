            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Your letter has followed me here &amp; reachd me only this evening. I thank you truly
               for the trouble you have taken. I remember the house you point out, it is if my memory
               does not deceive me near the cross, &amp; opposite the pond where the road bends like
               the letter S. from your account it seems to suit us perfectly, &amp; if there be bed rooms
               for a servant, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</a>, ourselves, &amp; a spare room for a friend, I think there can be no hesitation about
               it. this appears to be the case, as <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> it is divided into two tenements you say, &amp; of course the sitting room of one can
               hold a bed in case of need.</p>
            <p class="indent1">It gives me great pleasure that there is this prospect of our settling near you. we
               shall always spend the summer months there &amp; as much more as we can. I feel attached
               to the country &amp; shall look upon it as my home.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I am term-keeping but leave town tomorrow night &amp; hope to be home on Monday. from
               your letter I guess that you must be in town now, if I knew where or how to trace
               you. as this is impossible my only way is to direct to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Burton">Burton</a>.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I should prefer taking it from year to year to having a term. but this you must regulate
               according to circumstances.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It gives me great pleasure to hear your little girl
