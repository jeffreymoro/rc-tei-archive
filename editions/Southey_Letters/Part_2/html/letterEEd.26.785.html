            <p class="indent1">My letter would be a valuable one if the ability of suggesting any fit subject for
               your talents were equal to the good will with which it is attempted.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Novels are generally interesting in proportion as they excite our attention by what
               is new. I think the manners &amp; customs of other countries &amp; other times afford mines
               of such novelty as yet unransacked. the materials are easily acquired from our numerous
               books of travels. It will be far more difficult to keep up the metaphysical costume.
               if I did not believe you were capable of overcoming this difficulty I should &lt;not&gt;
               offer the suggestion. some materials for thinking may be afforded by thus contrasting
               the opinions &amp; institutions of different countries, &amp; enforcing what is true everywhere.</p>

                  it. Many plans have at various times occurred to me – but the seed never remained
                  long enough to germinate. I remember one which would almost be the antithesis to Atala
                  – a Portugueze on her way from India to the mother country to become a nun, wrecked
                  on the coast of Africa &amp; falling into the power of the Caffers – the best savages
                  of whom we have yet heard – to convert her &amp; her father Confessor till he marries

                  the Civilizer of Peru has always appeared to me an excellent hero for a philosophical
                  romance, but I have felt the full difficulty of forming any solution, short of miracle,
                  for his appearing where he did &amp; improving savages by so wonderful a conquest of intellect

               <p>Whenever I have thought of writing a novel among my own ways &amp; means, to develope
                  some single character has been the main object of the plan. Such for instance as a
                  man who accustoms himself to look at every thing in a ridiculous point of view, till
                  by laughing at every thing, he laughs away every good principle. A great mind ruined
                  by a little failing would well deserve to be delineated – by indecision – or procrastination,
                  or by that excess of good humour which submits to weaker intellects rather than inflict
                  pain. I have dwelt with more pleasure upon the ideal character of a man renouncing
                  fair prospects for principle, throwing himself upon the world with the belief that
                  while he can obtain food, raiment or shelter it is beneath him to be unhappy, &amp; being
                  happy in consequence of that belief.
