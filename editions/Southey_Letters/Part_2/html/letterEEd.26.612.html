               <p>Miss Barker – I would say Mary Barker if my neglect had not forfeited what little
                  claim I might have once possessed so friendlily to address you. – yet I have not ceased
                  to think of you, as one whose society gave me much pleasure in a land of strangers,
                  &amp; we have talked of you, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> &amp; I have <span class="ital">often</span> talked of you, &amp; looked on to an after meeting in the ways of life. There is now a
                  half written letter to you lying in my writing desk – begun at Lisbon – continued
                  on my passage home, &amp; still unfinished.

                  </div> I have been so much the shuttlecock of fortune – so jolted from one spot to another,
                  that it would be almost a valid excuse to alledge that for six months I have scarcely
                  found a resting place wherefrom to write. At this moment I am beguiling some of the
                  heaviest hours in existence, at a distance from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">my wife</a> – in an inn room where a stranger is at his dinner – the packet in sight which is
                  to convey me to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Dublin">Dublin</a> – tomorrow if the Captain pleases to sail – &amp; if it please God to send me there in
                  safety. I am lured there by hope – under the guidance of one whom you may remember
                  to have read of in the Pilgrim’s Progress – one with whom I have long been at variance,
                  &amp; you will perhaps wonder that any thing like acquaintance should have taken place
                  between us. It is Mr. Worldly Wisdom.

                  </div> My residence there will not now be long – it <span class="ital">cannot</span> be many weeks or I would not have stript myself of all comfort by coming alone – perhaps
                  it will not exceed a fortnight, but I will write you again from thence – if only to
                  give you a direction that you may send me my signed &amp; sealed pardon. At Xmas <span class="ital">we</span> shall certainly be in London. – When you are married I trust you will feel what comfort

                  would wish you to write? in what manner you might honorably distinguish yourself?
                  – It is by becoming the historian of manners: fixing the tale of your story in what
                  distant period best pleases you, &amp; making it characteristic of the manners, &amp; what
                  is more difficult, the habits of feeling &amp; thought, prevalent at that time &amp; in that
                  scene. there exists no tale of romance that does not betray ignorance – gross &amp; unpardonable
                  ignorance. Horace Walpole’s indeed is an exception – but even he discovers no knowledge.

                  </div> Such a work would do your own mind good by the necessary reading, &amp; the train of thoughts
                  that would inevitably follow. It would be useful, because it would impart knowledge,
                  tho the book itself should want any other merit, which I will not suspect, because
                  I remember my companion at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</a>. England is the best scene, not only because the information is contained in your
                  own language, but because the scenery is before you, &amp; Nature never can be painted
                  from books. – I was well off with one companion – even when he had done his dinner,
                  he could not talk without my assistance; – but now – enter three Irishmen, fresh from
                  shipboard – &amp; I am at their mercy.</p>
