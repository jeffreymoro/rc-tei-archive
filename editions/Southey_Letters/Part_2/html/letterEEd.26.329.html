            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Here we are, &amp; you see have christened the house, properly I assure you as the Martins
               have colonized all round it, &amp; doubly lucky must the house be on which they so build
               &amp; bemire. We hesitated between the appropriate names of Rat-Hall, Mouse Mansion, Vermin
               Villa, Cockroach Castle, Cobweb Cottage &amp; Spider Lodge – but as we routed out the
               spiders, brushd away the cobwebs, stoppd the rat holes, &amp; found no cock-roaches, we
               bethought us of the animals without &amp; dubbed it <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#MartinHall">Martin-Hall</a>.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I am sorry Tom you could not see us settled. you would like the old house, &amp; the view
               from the <span class="ital">drawing room</span> &amp; garden is delightful. we have turned too most notably. but once the house was an
               inn or alehouse, &amp; we have had applications to sell beer, &amp; buy a stock of tobacco
               pipes. Much has been done &amp; much is yet to do; the rooms are large, the garden well-stocked,
               we cut our own cabbages, live upon currant puddings &amp; shall soon be comfortably settled.</p>
            <p class="indent1">We got your letter from Taunton, there is perhaps another at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cottles">Cottles</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</a> is going to Bristol &amp; will see. We are just beyond the two miles stone. I wish you
               had been here, you might have been up to your eyes in filth &amp; rubbish.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>We are anxious to hear what is become of you. money ran short – &amp; it was well I had
                  a bank to draw upon. We have put up a bed in the Admirals

                  window. moreover she has bespoke a cat, a great carroty cat.</p>
