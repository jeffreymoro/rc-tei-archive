            <p class="indent1">I am anxious to know what prospect of success <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</a> has at Brentford. the plan is so far better than his former ones as it does not leave
               him at once to his own resources. reviewing too is a good way of breaking him in to
               work; the subject is given &amp; the task required, no time need be lost in beating about
               the bushes to start something to pursue. Yet this new prospect offers little or nothing

               a boy of about twelve years old, have escaped the destruction of their tribe &amp; are
               wandering at night in the deserts. they find themselves in the Garden, &amp; one Adite
               still existing in it, who when his nation were destroyed, had for some deed of goodness
               been saved from their damnation, &amp; left to live in that utter solitude till he thought
               himself prepared to die. at times Azrael appeard to him &amp; enquired if he was ready,
               but tho tortured by lonely existence still he dared not meet his judgement. As he

               the Adite. Azrael raises his sword &amp; the drops of bitterness fall on them. the design
               of this is to impress strongly with devotion the boy, reserved for a great exploit,
               the destruction of the Dom Danael.</p>
