            <p class="indent1">It is not easy for a man who does not know how to speak or write in French, to write
               a letter in this language without a grammar or dictionary. Oh well! he will take time
               to learn. and if you want to be irritated by reading letters of the greatest barbarity,
               here is your correspondent – you know I do not like the French language. it does not
               have the softness of Italian, nor the delicacy of Portuguese, nor the majesty of Spanish.
               French poetry is to my taste detestable – for an epigram, for a song, it is good enough.
               for an epic – for tragedy – holy God! what harmony. what a frightfully strange mouth
               is needed to pronounce it. A man of genius such as Voltaire – or the even greater
               Rousseau, will overcome the language. in fact in order to produce good work, a good
               worker is more valuable than good instruments.</p>
