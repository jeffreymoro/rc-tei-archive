                  </div> I have begun − &amp; but begun. for my way is not clear thro the first act. the story
                  has great advantages &amp; it would be difficult to select any so unlike that of other
                  dramas. The elder Brutus has been dramatized by Lee.

                  </div> Lee lived at that time when the French Romances were in vogue &amp; made more use of them

                  subject would be very difficult. his sins are scarcely dignifyed enough for tragedy
                  − &amp; his character seems almost above it. it is for the painter − not the poet. I have

                  or heard of else. Rousseau thought of dramatizing the story of Lucretia.
