               – the journey might not possibly have hurt me but I did not feel equal to it, the
               fatigue appeared tremendous to me in my present state, &amp; I was fearful of fixing a
               cough which I am getting rid of. the advice I have is good, &amp; perfectly understandable
               – it comes too from a man on whom I can rely – &amp; were there any occasion, which there
               certainly is not, for higher authority, I frequently see <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes</a>.</p>
