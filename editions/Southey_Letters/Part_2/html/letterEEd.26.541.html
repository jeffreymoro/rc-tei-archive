                  by little channels, which the man conducts round the roots of every tree, loosening
                  the soil with a hoe. by this the leaves as they fall are sooner mingled with the soil,

                  The Wine owes its advance to the enormous taxes in England. As the English tax it

                  duty of a six-&amp;-thirty per pipe. if people will give 75 £ a pipe, said the Porto Merchants,
