               sleep at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Westbury">Westbury</a> all the time. the inconveniences of this are – coming home so late, &amp; bringing him

The circumstances were these. One evening when her spirits
                  were very much oppressed by some grief, she went on a visit somewhere with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</a> &amp; Stephen Weever Browne:

                           and Writings of the Late William Taylor of Norwich, 2 vols (London, 1843), I, p. 236).
                           He was a Norwich clergyman who later became a Unitarian minister and published The
                           Duties of a Christian Minister (1819).</span></div>
                  </div> a man who<span style="text-decoration: line-through">m</span> you know talks most mightily. from the effort which persons often make when they are
                  depressed, she had talked with a degree of gaiety, so as to exhaust herself. they
                  went home with her, Stephen Brownes talking fatigued her still more, he left her first
                  - &amp; when she came into her lodgings &amp; sat down she burst into tears. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</a> was full of expressions &lt;of friendship –&gt; – had she anything on her mind? &amp;c. &amp;c.
                  &amp; the following day wrote her a letter full of professions &amp; sentiment &amp; feelings.
                  But <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</a> tells this story in company with these alterations – that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HaysMary">Mary Hays</a> was in love with him – that she contrived to send away St. Browne that she might be
                  left alone with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</a>, &amp; burst into tears because <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</a> would not understand her. this was repeated to her, &amp; she wrote to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</a>, rather rallying him for his ridiculous vanity than reproaching him, because it was
                  so contemptible &amp; because she did not fully understand the whole abuse till his reply.
                  he answered by confessing that he had traduced her character – &amp; apologizing most
                  humbly for it, alledging that her principles were so very bad that he had suspected
                  her conduct – yet saying that no one who knew her could doubt her excellence unless
                  he were a fool or a villain. of course she thinks him either the one or the other,
                  nor was it possible for me to justify him – as he evidently has said that she would
                  have prostituted herself to him if he had pleased – &amp; now comes out with a canting
                  repentance. it has sadly sunk him in my opinion. She told me these circumstances because
                  she thought I might hear something of them from him. she spoke with temper &amp; great
                  good sense. you know I like <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HaysMary">Mary Hays</a>. About his marriage she blamed him for telling every body that he had no affection
