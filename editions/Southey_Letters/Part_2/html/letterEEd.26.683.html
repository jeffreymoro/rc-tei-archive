               <p>In reply to your first letter – the statement of M<sup>rs</sup> James’s circumstances is this. her four sons were drowned during the Easter week in
                  our channel. from one of these she received 30 £ a year, of which his death deprives
                  her &amp; she has nothing. the subscription is set on foot to purchase her an annuity
                  to that amount. 160 guineas have been raised here – I collected twelve in London –
                  you mention eight more. She is 62 &amp; it is expected from the nature of the case that
                  14 per cent may be procured.
