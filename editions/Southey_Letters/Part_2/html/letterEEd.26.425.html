                  </div> is so good that I found it an effort of great self-denial not to print it – voila
                  – my reason. the book will circulate much among Ladies who read poetry more than men;
                  there is nothing objectionable <span style="text-decoration: line-through">to</span> &lt;in&gt; the point – but a woman who should be reading the book aloud at haphazard – would
                  feel very awkward when she came to the conclusion. I took counsel &amp; reluctantly yielded
                  to an unanimous opinion, for the ballad is admirable. I did not expect one so good.
