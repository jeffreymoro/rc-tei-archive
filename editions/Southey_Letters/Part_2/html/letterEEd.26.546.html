                  </div> here is something to feed the feelings, to satisfy &amp; kindle this Imagination. Their
                  Deity indeed is somewhat partial to the old Mother Church – but then he is a kind

               they have confessed it to him! for you know the secrets of confession are sacred.

                  </div> Will there never be an end of these absurdities! Vigo can only have been visited for
                  the sake of making a Gazette &amp; varnishing over their failure. the consequence will
                  probably be that Spain will at last commence hostilities here, to draw our attention
                  &amp; keep her own coasts clear. We have no serious apprehensions. it is a mere matter
                  of talk &amp; speculation. But the Pestilence which rages at Cadiz is a nearer &amp; more
                  alarming evil. it is now over the whole Province of Andalusia – within 250 miles of
                  us, &amp; no precautions are taken whatever. A man has just arrived at Lisbon from Cadiz
                  who has had the disease – he has performed no quarantine – &amp; his baggage entered unmolested.
                  What the disorder is I cannot learn, other than it is called the Black Vomit, &amp; that
                  the same kind of plague has formerly ravaged Europe, particularly this peninsula.
                  They say it is <span class="ital">Epidemic</span>, not <span class="ital">contagious.</span> if so we are safe. the Siroc blew for nine weeks at Cadiz. – if this was the cause
                  the rains will remove it – or the winter – if it contagious Lisbon is in hourly &amp;
                  imminent danger. an immense contraband trade is carried on thro the bye passes of
                  the mountains. guard the frontier towns however vigilantly it is impossible to guard
                  the whole line of frontier where Nature has made no boundary. the disease will be
                  smuggled in. indeed my chief reason for believing it not to be contagious, is that
                  it has not reached us. If it comes we fly – perhaps to England – perhaps to Porto
                  &amp; the mountains. the last plan will be sufficiently safe &amp; what I shall prefer – but <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> will decide.</p>
