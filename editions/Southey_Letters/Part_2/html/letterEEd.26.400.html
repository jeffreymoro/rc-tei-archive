            <p class="indent1">Grosvenor I beseech you go to Covent Garden Market &amp; buy a Magpye. you may consult
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CarlisleAnthony">Carlisle</a> upon the propriety of slitting his tongue – however teach him distinctly to pronounce
               Southey, &amp; keep the Magpye in your sitting parlour by day, &amp; in your bed room by night,
               &amp; then perhaps your <span style="text-decoration: line-through">mag</span>&lt;mag&gt;pye may supply the place of your conscience or place the bust you have where
               it may most frequently meet your eyes. O thou idler than idleness.</p>
            <p class="indent1">In May I shall see you, probably on May-day, or before if I go to London with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> whose passing day is the first of next month. Grosvenor I have the middle fortnight
               of May to dispose of, &amp; I want to ramble somewhere if I can get a companion, to walk
               round Kent, of which county I know little, or Surry of which I know less – or to the
               Devil in Derbyshire of which I know nothing. you I fear are tied by the leg. is <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</a> inclined to pedestrianize? or has he an objection to a knapsack tho of the most fashionable
               cut, &amp; occasionally a bread &amp; cheese dinner at a village alehouse?</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> has been laid up with an abscess which is getting well rapidly. his stay in town
               will be very short – merely to pass &amp; join his own ship, or any other to which he
               may be appointed. I <span style="text-decoration: line-through">come</span> leave home neither well nor willingly. more willingly I shall certainly return, but
               whether better or not it is not in my power to decide. in the meantime I expect to
               hear from you because if you write before we meet you will not be quite so much ashamed
               to see me.</p>

            <p>This is abominably brief – but unless I conclude the letter must lie till tomorrow,
               &amp; tomorrow is Saturday &amp; therefore it would not go then – &amp; on the Sunday I do not
               go to the Post-Office. so a piece now is better than waiting for me till Tuesday.</p>
