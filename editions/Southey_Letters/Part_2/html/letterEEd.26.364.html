               <div class="l">On this sad business!</div>
               <div class="l">Gregory.</div>
               <div class="l">Aye James! I am come,</div>
               <div class="l">But with a heavy heart – God knows it, man – </div>
               <div class="l">Where shall we meet the corpse?</div>
               <div class="l">James.</div>
               <div class="l">Some hour from hence,</div>
               <div class="l">By noon, &amp; near about the elms I take it.</div>
               <div class="l">This is not as it should be Gregory!</div>
               <div class="l">Old men to follow young ones to the grave! – </div>
               <div class="l">This morning when I heard the bell strike out</div>
               <div class="l">I thought that I had never heard it toll</div>
               <div class="l">In dismay before.</div>
               <div class="l">Gregory.</div>
               <div class="l">Well – well – my friend – </div>
               <div class="l">Tis what we all must come to soon or late.</div>
               <div class="l">But when a young man dies, in the prime of life,</div>
               <div class="l">One born so well, who might have blest us all</div>
               <div class="l">Many long years, –</div>
               <div class="l">James.</div>
               <div class="l">And then the family</div>
               <div class="l">Extinguishd in him, &amp; the good old name</div>
               <div class="l">Only to be remembered on a tombstone!</div>
               <div class="l">A name that has gone down from sire to son</div>
               <div class="l">So many generations! – many a time</div>
               <div class="l">Poor Master Edward, who is now a corpse,</div>
               <div class="l">When yet a child would come to me &amp; lead me </div>
               <div class="l">To the great family tree, &amp; beg of me</div>
               <div class="l">To tell him stories of his ancestors,</div>
               <div class="l">Of Eustace he that went to the Holy Land</div>
               <div class="l">With Richard Lionheart, &amp; that Sir Henry</div>
               <div class="l">Who fought at Crecy in K. Edwards wars.</div>
               <div class="l">And then his little eyes would kindle so</div>
               <div class="l">To hear of their brave deeds! – I usd to think</div>
               <div class="l">The bravest of them all would not out do</div>
               <div class="l">My darling boy.</div>
               <div class="l">Gregory.</div>
               <div class="l">This comes of your great schools</div>
               <div class="l">And college breeding! plague upon his guardians</div>
               <div class="l">That would have made him wiser than his fathers.</div>
               <div class="l">James.</div>
               <div class="l">If his poor father Gregory! had but lived</div>
               <div class="l">Things would not have been so. he poor good man</div>
               <div class="l">Had little of book learning, but there lived not</div>
               <div class="l">A kinder, nobler hearted gentleman.</div>
               <div class="l">One better to his tenants. when he died</div>
               <div class="l">There was not a dry eye for miles around.</div>
               <div class="l">Gregory I thought that I could never know</div>
               <div class="l">A sadder day than that, – but what was that</div>
               <div class="l">Compared to this days sorrow?</div>
               <div class="l">Gregory.</div>
               <div class="l">I remember</div>
               <div class="l">Eight months ago when the young Squire began</div>
               <div class="l">To alter the old mansion, they destroyd</div>
               <div class="l">The martins nests that had stood undisturbd</div>
               <div class="l">Under that roof, – aye – long before my memory.</div>
               <div class="l">I shook my head at seeing it &amp; thought</div>
               <div class="l">No good could follow.</div>
               <div class="l">James.</div>
               <div class="l">Poor young man! I loved him</div>
               <div class="l">Like my own child, I loved the family;</div>
               <div class="l">Come Candlemas &amp; I have been their servant</div>
               <div class="l">For five &amp; forty years. I lived with them</div>
               <div class="l">When his good father brought my Lady home,</div>
               <div class="l">And when the young Squire was born, it did me good</div>
               <div class="l">To hear the bells so merrily announce</div>
               <div class="l">An heir. this is indeed a heavy blow – </div>
               <div class="l">I feel it Gregory, heavier than the weight</div>
               <div class="l">Of three-score years. he was a noble lad – </div>
               <div class="l">I loved him dearly!</div>
               <div class="l">Gregory.</div>
               <div class="l">Every body loved him – </div>
               <div class="l">Such a fine, generous, open-hearted youth!</div>
               <div class="l">When he came home from school at holydays</div>
               <div class="l">How I rejoiced to see him! he was sure</div>
               <div class="l">To come <span style="text-decoration: line-through">to me</span> &amp; to ask of me what birds there were</div>
               <div class="l">About my fields; &amp; when I found a covey</div>
               <div class="l">Theres not a testy Squire preserves his game</div>
               <div class="l">More charily, than I have kept them safe</div>
               <div class="l">For Master Edward. &amp; he lookd so well</div>
               <div class="l">Upon a fine sharp morning after them,</div>
               <div class="l">His brown hair frosted, &amp; his cheek so flushd,</div>
               <div class="l">With such a wholesome ruddiness! ah James</div>
               <div class="l">But he was sadly changed when he came down</div>
               <div class="l">To keep his birth day!</div>
               <div class="l">James.</div>
               <div class="l">Changd! – why Gregory</div>
               <div class="l">Twas like a palsy to me, when he steppd</div>
               <div class="l">Out of the carriage. he was grown so thin,</div>
               <div class="l">His cheek so delicate sallow, &amp; his eyes</div>
               <div class="l">Had such a dim &amp; rakish hollowness!</div>
               <div class="l">And when he came to shake me by the hand</div>
               <div class="l">And spoke as kindly to me as he used,</div>
               <div class="l">I hardly knew the voice!</div>
               <div class="l">Gregory.</div>
               <div class="l">It struck a damp</div>
               <div class="l">On all our merriment. twas a noble ox</div>
               <div class="l">That smoak’d before us, &amp; the old October</div>
               <div class="l">Went merrily in overflowing cans;</div>
               <div class="l">But twas a skin-deep merriment, my heart</div>
               <div class="l">Seemd as it took no share. – &amp; when we drank</div>
               <div class="l">His health, the thought came over me what cause</div>
               <div class="l">We had for wishing that, &amp; spoilt the draught.</div>
               <div class="l">Poor Gentleman – to think ten months ago</div>
               <div class="l">He came of age, &amp; now – </div>
               <div class="l">James.</div>
               <div class="l">I feard it then;</div>
               <div class="l">He lookd to me as one that was not long</div>
               <div class="l">For this worlds business.</div>
               <div class="l">Gregory.</div>
               <div class="l">When the Doctors sent him</div>
               <div class="l">Abroad to try the air it made me certain</div>
               <div class="l">That all was over. there’s but little hope,</div>
               <div class="l">Methinks, that foreign parts can help a man</div>
               <div class="l">When his own mother country will not do.</div>
               <div class="l">The last time he came down these bells rung so</div>
               <div class="l">I thought they would have rockd the old steeple down</div>
               <div class="l">And now that dismal toll! I would have staid</div>
               <div class="l">Beyond its reach, but this was a last duty.</div>
               <div class="l">I’m an old tenant of the family,</div>
               <div class="l">Born on the estate, &amp; now that I’ve outlived it,</div>
               <div class="l">Why tis but right to see it to the grave.</div>
               <div class="l">Have you heard ought of the new Squire?</div>
               <div class="l">James.</div>
               <div class="l">But little</div>
               <div class="l">And that not well; but be he what he may</div>
               <div class="l">Matters not much to me. the love I bore</div>
               <div class="l">To the good family will not easily fix</div>
               <div class="l">Upon a stranger; tis too old a plant</div>
               <div class="l">To bear transplanting &amp; its roots had struck</div>
               <div class="l">Too deeply. look – what’s on the opposite hill?</div>
               <div class="l">Is’t not the funeral?</div>
               <div class="l">Gregory.</div>
               <div class="l">Tis I think some horsemen</div>
               <div class="l">James.</div>
               <div class="l">And yonder is the herse – between the trees,</div>
               <div class="l">Tis hid behind them now.</div>
               <div class="l">Gregory – </div>
               <div class="l">Aye – there I see it</div>
               <div class="l">And there’s the coaches following, we shall meet &lt;it&gt;</div>
               <div class="l">About the bridge. would that this day were over</div>
               <div class="l">I wonder whose turn’s next?</div>
               <div class="l">James</div>
               <div class="l">God above knows.</div>
