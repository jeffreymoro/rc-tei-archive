               <p>I take it for granted that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">my precious brother</a> had procured his regular discharge – &amp; said nothing about his reestablishment in the
                  Suffisante because <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> tells me she is sent abroad. But a worse business has come out since. the young rascal
                  has drawn two bills upon me, one for three pounds to pay <span class="ital">a gunmaker</span> – the other for 5–13 – I know not for what, – &amp; moreover modestly sends me a taylors
                  bill for two complete suits &amp; a great coat of superfine cloth – to the tune of 11–16–3½
                  to convince me he says that he has not been extravagant. Of course I have protested
                  his drafts &amp; refused to pay his bills, &amp; he &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">his Aunt</a> &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Barham

               <p>All this I wrote to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MayJohn">May</a> by the last post. It is clear enough that he is completely adrift &amp; that if he do
                  not take to the sea he will go on as a sharper till he probably comes to the proper
                  &amp; customary termination of such a trade. I think he should be shipped off for some
                  foreign station, or if he be too bad for the navy, for some long voyage. that he can
                  turn out well is utterly impossible. I however must not omit doing all I can to put
                  him in a fair way – as for embarrassing myself for him that I will never do. I have
                  already incurred a debt to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MayJohn">May</a> by what I have done to help on <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> in the world – which will cost me the whole profits of Madoc

            <p class="indent1">These things however shall not give me any permanent vexation. they will needs irritate
               &amp; inflame at first, but I have a stock of practical stoicism which has often stood
               me in good stead. You assigned a cause for the tone of my former letter which probably
               does exist but assuredly did not exhilirate me. it is to me far more a cause of fear
               than of hope. I would rather forego delight than hazard tranquillity. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I mean to publish Madoc next winter &amp; to try to have the whole profits myself without
                  letting the booksellers go halves. if you can get me some subscribers I know you will.
                  a guinea for a quarto to be paid on delivery. But if this mode of publication sound
                  or feel unworthily to you – tell me so – &amp; my wares shall go to market. This will
                  clear me with the world. I should have had money to spare but for such perpetual drains.
