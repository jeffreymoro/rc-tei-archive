               <p>I suspect that my two letters directed to you on the Chester Circuit as you desired,
                  had not reached you when you last wrote or there would have been no charge of idleness
                  in yours. &amp; now having acquitted myself of that charge I proceed to the indictment
                  of my ears. If the charge had come from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Dapple</a> it would not have surprized me. one may fancy him possessed of more than ordinary
                  susceptibility of ear; but for the irritability of yours I cannot so satisfactorily
                  account. I could heap authority upon authority for using two very short syllables
                  in blank verse instead of one. they take up only the time of one. <span class="ital">Spirit</span> in particular is repeatedly placed as a monosyllable in Milton, − &amp; some of his ass
                  editors have attempted <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> to print it as one − not feeling that the rapid pronunciation of the two syllables
                  does not lengthen the verse more than the dilated sound of one. The other line you
                  quote is still less objectionable, because the old Ballad style requires ruggedness
                  − <span style="text-decoration: line-through">&amp; because</span> were this line rugged − &amp; secondly because the line itself rattles over the tongue
                  as smoothly as a curricle upon <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx</span> down turf. I have made candles of infants fat − &amp; this kind of cadence is repeatedly
                  used in the Old Woman &amp; in the Parody.
