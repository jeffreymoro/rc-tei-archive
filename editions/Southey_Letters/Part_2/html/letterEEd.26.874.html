                        at the end of this letter arrived on 24 December 1803. Southey’s confirmation of Edith’s

               begin to fear that they are seriously weakened – for after any reading or writing,
               objects at the other end of the room become quite indistinct. I must therefore send
               you such parts as will bear detaching. The following will require pruning &amp; retouching
               in its minor parts – but on the whole I think it will please you.</p>
