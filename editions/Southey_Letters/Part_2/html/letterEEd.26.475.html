               <p>One of the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WedgwoodThomas">Wedgewoods</a> tells me he has just obtained a passport from government to go to the South of France
                  on account of his health. You will not wonder that the intelligence gave me a wish
                  to <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx</span> do the same. There is an after difficulty supposing this surmounted &amp; that <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> is the French passport – but <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WedgwoodThomas">Wedgewood</a> is personally acquainted with some of the Chemists who are now transmuted into Senators,

                  can procure the passport from our own government. Whether there be any impropriety
                  in asking it, you will judge. Madeira would be a prison – &amp; the tedium of confinement
                  in it counteract the climate. I should think Tuscany safe – Sicily is a better climate
                  – but the people are turbulent &amp; I have no wish to witness <span style="text-decoration: line-through">the xxxxx</span> Italian revolutions. if France be inaccessible I must think of Lisbon, or more probably
                  of the West Indies. One of the healthy Islands – were it not for the voyage, would
                  offer a strong inducement, in the opportunity of seeing tropical scenery.</p>

               by day I have spirits – but at night ether only slightly relieves the symptoms instead
               of removing them. <span class="ital">the mental</span> stimulus of travelling will be useful to me.</p>

               <p>Maraccis Refutation of the Koran has much amused me. he collects all the Mohammedan
                  miracles. some, he says, are lies. some may be true, but then the Devil wrought them.
                  one which happened to please him, he strongly suspected to be true of some Xtian Saint
                  &amp; stolen by the Musselmen.

                  it – the tomb opened, &amp; his wife rose in her grave-clothes &amp; presented to him her
                  living child – telling him – that had he commended both to God, both would have been

               recommends, &amp; in case of peace, &amp; particularly Padua or Vicenza. At Trieste I could
               judge in safety of the practicability of getting into Italy. as for banditti, as I
               should steer clear of Calabria &amp; the Tyrol there is not much to apprehend – &amp; my way
