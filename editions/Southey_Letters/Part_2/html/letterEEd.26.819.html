               to late July 1803, the contents, in particular references to Tom Southey’s whereabouts,
               suggest that 7 August is a much more likely date.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">3.. </span><span class="noteBody">In legend, Nicostrata (or Carmenta) was the daughter of Ionius, King of Arcadia. She
               and her son settled on the site of the future city of Rome, where she invented the
               alphabet used in Latin and taught it to the local people. Rickman and Turner had drawn
               Southey’s attention to a Latin verse quoted in Pietro Crinito (1475-1507), <em>De Honesta Disciplina</em> (1504), Book 17, which told this story and claimed that an alphabet was taught to
               the Goths by Gulfilas (c. 311-382), Arian bishop of the Visigoths, before they settled
               in Spain. In fact, Gulfilas invented a specific Gothic alphabet when he translated
               the Bible into Gothic. The Visigoths did not reject Arianism for Catholicism until
               589 and their Kingdom in Spain lasted until the Arab invasion of 711-712.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               of them may have been of French origin, but Southey probably means Agnes of Aquitaine
               (d. c. 1078).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               of the Bible into Gothic which it contains is by Gulfilas (c. 311-382). Because Southey
               believed the <em>Codex</em> must have originated in Scandinavia he assigns it a much later date and so believes
               there must have been a second Gulfilas.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
