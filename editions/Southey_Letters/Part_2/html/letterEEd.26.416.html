            <p class="indent1">I have been daily in hope of knowing our destination after Midsummer certainly enough
               to communicate it. but this is still unsettled. the day after I last saw you a letter
               from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BiddlecombeCharles">Biddlecombe</a> reached me at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Brixton">Brixton</a>. it stated that there was a place at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Burton">Burton</a> which he thought would suit us – it had been divided into two tenements, both which
               with a little garden we might have for not more than eight pounds a year. I immediately
               wrote that this would do if there were the required number of bed-rooms – that is
               – rooms for myself – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</a> – a servant – &amp; one for a friend. to this I have daily &amp; vainly expected an answer.
               it will probably bring intelligence that the place is ours – but time presses &amp; I
               now wait with some impatience.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This house, or rather tenement to speak with <span class="ital">singular</span> propriety, is about two hundred yards from our former abode at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Burton">Burton</a>, &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BiddlecombeCharles">Biddlecombe</a> says, in every respect more convenient. I shall feel disappointed if we do not fix
                  there. in that case we shall be within reach of you, &amp; if as you expect M<sup>rs</sup> Tonkin &amp; her family

            <p class="indent1">In my journey home I collected one piece of information which you may use as a useful
               warning. when they have new horses to put in the Mail they always put them in first
               on a Sunday night, because they carry no letters &amp; there is of course time for an
               accident. so I was endangered quite enough to resolve upon no more Sunday night mail-coaching.</p>

                  she is rapidly growing well. I should think <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> consumptive were it not for her often recovering when apparently in so hopeless a
