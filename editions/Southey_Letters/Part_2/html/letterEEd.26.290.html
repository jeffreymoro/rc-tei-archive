               <div class="salute">My dear Tom</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I have this day received <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</a> letter respecting <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ProbyWilliam">Lord Proby</a>, &amp; will give you his own words. “My motive for writing is to desire you would consult
               with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Thomas</a> whether it would not be more advantageous for him to get on the Lisbon station, where
               perhaps I might be of use to him by means of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JervisAdmiral">Lord S<sup>t</sup> Vincent</a>. If he should wish it, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ProbyWilliam">Lord Proby</a> who expects to have a Frigate given him &amp; to return to that station has promised
               me to bring him out – that is to give him a birth, or an appointment on board his
               ship. You will write to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ProbyWilliam">Ld P.</a> to inform him that Thomas will accept of his offer, &amp; to give him Thomas’s direction
               that he might inform him whence &amp; when he sails. There need not be any explanation
               with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodAlexanderCaptain">Capt. Hood</a> till <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ProbyWilliam">Lord P.</a> writes to him, as you see, it depends on two contingencies. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ProbyWilliam">Lord P.</a> may not get a ship, &amp; if he does may not go to Lisbon. tho of this last he tells
               me he is certain”</p>
            <p class="indent1">Now Tom you must use your own judgement. if you see no impropriety in leaving <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodAlexanderCaptain">Capt. Hood</a> – &amp; as the change would be so much to your advantage I should think he cannot but
               wish you to accept it, I can see no other objection. let me know immediately, that
               I may inform <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ProbyWilliam">Ld. P.</a></p>
            <p class="indent1">You tell me you have left off sugar &amp; rum. I do not know my dear Tom that this, or
               any circumstance could now raise you in my opinion – but I know well what in your
               situation the sacrifice must be. Be not surprized if I say that I do not wish you
               to persevere in it. When I first did the same, it was at a time, when, from the general
               agitation of the subject, &amp; the number of abolitionists, there was a hope &amp; prospect
               of mortally wounding the traffic by the disuse of West Indian commodities. that prospect
               is gone. it is now evident that the very few who persevere can do nothing. &amp; my reason
               for still persisting as I ever shall, is from a respect to my own feelings, for the
               satisfaction I feel in being conscious that in no ways do I contribute to so accursed
               an evil as the Slave Trade, that if all else had acted as I act, that Trade must have
               been destroyed. for you Tom – your possible comforts God knows are few enough, nor
               do I think that you ought to abridge yourself of one, by indulging in which no actual
               evil is <span style="text-decoration: line-through">done</span> &lt;committed.&gt; <span class="ital">now</span> it is true that the efforts of an individual can do nothing.</p>

               <p>My last it seems (inclosing a 2 pound bill from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a>) had not reached you when you wrote. it was directed to Torbay. I shall not send

                  &amp; serious ones, of publishing another volume. to this my chief inducement is the hope
                  of getting a house to call my own; <span style="text-decoration: line-through">&amp;</span> I think, if my literary plans do not sadly fail, to accomplish this by the next Christmas
                  – &amp; then Tom you shall come &amp; chuse a cot &amp; fit up a room in your own taste.</p>

            <p class="indent1">We came here on Wednesday last, &amp; to night enter our lodgings, in the very house on

               will work it merrily. I expect to hear from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> daily respecting her house. if she gets rid of that, &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> reaches Lisbon well – why our family affairs will look better than they have long
               done. &amp; God knows it is time we had a little sun shine. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> is well – &amp; I hope air &amp; exercise will clothe her bones. for me I am the healthiest
               of all skeletons.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I mean to write a ballad soon. in the course of next week if nothing prevents me,
               &amp; you shall see it as soon as done. the Magazines shall come with the parcel – but
               tell me what was the last number you had.</p>

               <p>I hope you may go to Lisbon – far as the distance will be, &amp; long as it would seperate
