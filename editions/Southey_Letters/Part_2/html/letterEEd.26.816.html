               <p>I meant to have written sooner; but those little units of interruption and preventions,
                  which sum up to as ugly an aggregate as the items in a lawyer’s bill, have come in
                  the way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                  health, and that love of steady and productive employment which is now grown into
                  a necessary habit with me, if you were to execute and would execute it, it would be,
                  beyond all doubt, the most valuable work of any age or any country; but I cannot fill
                  up such an outline. No man can better feel where he fails than I do; and to rely upon
                  you for whole quartos! Dear Coleridge, the smile that comes with that thought is a
                  very melancholy one; and if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> saw me now, she would think my eyes were weak again, when, in truth, the humour that
                  covers them springs from another cause.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>For my own comfort, and credit, and peace of mind, I must have a plan which I know
                  myself strong enough to execute. I can take author by author as they come in their
                  series, and give his life and an account of his works quite as well as ever it has
                  yet been done. I can write connecting paragraphs and chapters shortly and pertinently,
                  in my way; and in this way the labour of all my associates can be more easily arranged.
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  And, after all, this is really nearer the actual design of what I purport by a bibliotheca
                  than yours would be, – a book of reference, a work in which it may be seen what has
                  been written upon every subject in the British language: this has elsewhere been done
                  in the dictionary form; whatever we get better than that form – <span class="ital">ponemus lucro</span>.
