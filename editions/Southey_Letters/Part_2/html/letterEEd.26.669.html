I know not when it will be possible to get the money which he had

               farewell of my books. my consolation is the joy that there will be in welcoming the
               new cargo. Still a removal disjoints my plans &amp; disorders the whole march of associated
               ideas. I am hard at work, surrounded by documents – folios &amp; quartos, one open upon
