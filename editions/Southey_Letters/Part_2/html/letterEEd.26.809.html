            <p class="indent1">The more I talk or think of the house at Richmond the more I am disposed to have the
               bargain concluded, that is, if the inside be tolerably convenient, which there should
               seem little reason to doubt. the taxes indeed are very high, but they must bear nearly
               the same proportion to rent every where in the neighbourhood of London. if you can
               get sight of the premises &amp; find them comfortably habitable, as doubtless they must
               be, I shall be very glad to take it for a term &amp; have every thing settled the sooner
               the better. then if any unforeseen circumstance prevents us from getting this we may
               lose no time in looking out for another.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I was heartily glad to reach home after the labour of perambulating London every day
                  for a fortnight. that fortnight seems longer than the twelve months which preceded
                  it, &amp; I relapse right gladly to my regular every day uniformity of scene, society
                  &amp; action. but this is lazy weather, too hot to go abroad &amp; almost to do any thing
                  at home. – I feel very much like a Portugueze &amp; could make a siesta of all day long.
                  it would be an improvement to live like the Owls by night at this season. All Bristol
                  is up in arms &amp; volunteering – cool sport for the dog days! the Duke of Cumberland

                  but that camp will spoil the loveliest walks in this neighbourhood or perhaps in this

                  unprofitable &amp; the least pleasurable, is by no means over yet. the plan becomes daily
                  more methodized in my head, &amp; I recollect &amp; discover more sources of information than
                  at first occurred. I perceive that the great art of my Generalship will be to do nothing
                  beneath my Commanderships dignity – to make others pioneer &amp; work in the trenches
                  &amp; to waste no toil upon what may be executed quite as well &amp; in all probability better
                  by my Sergeants &amp; Corporals. this is particularly the case with regard to examining
                  manuscripts – after I had mastered the difficulty of deciphering their characters
                  the expence of time &amp; eyesight would be more than I ought to afford. my business must
                  be to make others hew in the quarry &amp; erect the building myself. My old &amp; ugly stall-gleanings
                  are all now turning to account – I call them my Ducks – dirty – but good. in turning
                  over these venerables you would be surprized to see how much I find that bears upon
                  biography – or the general history of manners &amp; science. it delights me to think of
                  resetting the pearls that have lain so long in the dunghill – shall I not have a claim
