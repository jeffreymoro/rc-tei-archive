               <p>It might have been supposed that the interest which the fate of Chatterton excited
                  in the public mind, would, in some measure, have supplied his loss to his family,
                  by procuring for them active and benevolent friends. The publication of all his works
                  for their emolument, would at that time have secured to them the comforts of life.
                  Your readers, Sir, will probably learn with surprize, that the whole sum they have
                  ever received from the profits of his productions, amounts only to seventeen guineas
                  and six pence. In this I do not include the voluntary assistance of those individuals

                  given to the mother and sister. A great part of Mr. Barrett’s History of Bristol is
                  composed of Chatterton’s communications; the only return the family ever received
                  from him was his surgical assistance, gratuitously afforded to the sister, Mrs. Newton,
                  once in a complaint of the breast, once in curing a whitlow on her finger.</p>

               <p>When Chatterton was more particularly the object of public curiosity, a clergyman
                  called upon his sister, presented her half a guinea, and requested to see what ever
                  letters of her brother she had preserved. She produced them. He then begged permission
                  to take them away <span class="ital">for one hour</span>, assigning as a reason, that it would be too painful to his feelings to read them
                  in the presence of that sister, to whom they were addressed. On the same pretext he
                  procured the letters in Mrs. Chatterton’s

                  all suspicion; indeed, so consolatory and so full of religion was his language to
                  the mother, that she said she almost looked upon him as a guardian angel.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>A fortnight elapsed, the letters had not been returned, and they knew not the name
                  of the person to whom they had entrusted them. At the end of the fortnight Mrs. Chatterton
                  received a letter from that person, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CroftHerbert">Mr. H—— C——</a>.

                  </div> “Be not alarmed, Mrs. Chatterton,” he said, “all the little treasures shall be faithfully
                  returned to you again;” with the originals he promised to send transcripts of all
                  the letters, with which the curiosity of strangers might be gratified, while the hand
                  writing of Chatterton should be preserved. He again consoled Mrs. Chatterton for the
                  fate of her son. “Perhaps,” said he, “he now beholds with pleasure the deserved progress
                  his reputation is making every day, and the friends and the assistances which his
                  name brings to you and to his sister:” the date of the letter was Lincoln’s Inn, July
                  27th 1778.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In a second letter, August 24th 1778, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CroftHerbert">Mr. C——</a> requested the sister to write to him, whatever she and her mother could recollect,
                  concerning Chatterton. “Believe me you are writing to one who respects his memory,
                  and wishes you both well;” the promise of returning the letters and magazines containing
                  Chatterton’s pieces, which he had borrowed at the same time, were repeated; and in
                  the course of the Autumn they were accordingly returned. Nothing more was heard till,
                  in the following July, to the astonishment of the family, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CroftHerbert">Mr. C——</a> published the letters, and the information he had obtained from Mrs. Newton, in his

                  </div> The mother wrote to him, and upbraided him for duplicity; he replied, by sending ten
                  pounds, to be divided between her and her daughter; again professing friendship for
                  them, and saying, “Be assured the family of Thomas Chatterton shall never be forgotten

            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Four months afterwards he again wrote to justify himself, and used these expressions,
               “What has been done was with a view to pave the way for services to your family; and
               I hope, sooner than you think, to be of more service to you than any person who has
               hitherto enquired about your son, for I have a true regard for his memory.”</p>
            <p class="indent1">In November 1780, he wrote a fifth letter, desiring Mrs. Newton would send him a particular
               account of her circumstances, as he was about to promote a public subscription for
               her; and in April 1781, they received a note from him, requiring an acknowledgement
               of the ten pounds.</p>

               <p>Here <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CroftHerbert">Mr. C——</a> dropt his correspondence with the family; they heard no more of the <span class="ital">future services</span> and the <span class="ital">public subscription</span>. His Love and Madness had a great and rapid sale, undoubtedly in a considerable degree
                  owing to the letters of Chatterton; and his purpose was served. Luckily Mrs. Newton
                  preserved his letters. In 1796, she was advised, by a gentleman to whom she had shewn

            <p class="indent1">The name of Chatterton is, perhaps, yet familiar to your memory. She, to whom he was
               endeared by the tender ties of nature, and who, contemplating his many virtues, would
               remember his errors no more, begs leave to address you with reference to your professions
               of attachment to the remainder of his family. Several years have now elapsed since
               you obtained of me his unpublished papers, and communicated them to the world. The
               disquietude I might have felt at such a transaction, was removed by an apprehension,
               that while you interested yourself, you would render considerable assistance to me.
               The popularity of the concern was an adequate ground for my expectations, which were
               heightened by the respectability of your connections in life. Justice to my situation
               would long since have compelled me to address you, but have been, till a few days
               past, unacquainted with your residence. If any thing in my favour be practicable,
               to which I trust you will not be indisposed, your early attention will greatly oblige,</p>

               in that, induces me to trouble you with this, and I again solicit your attention to
               the remainder of the family of Chatterton. Justice to myself, as I before observed,
               was the reason of my forming the application, on which I had the satisfactory judgment
               of some very respectable friends. As the subject of obtaining my brother’s papers,
               has of late been particularly investigated here, I trust you will not suffer an occasion
