            <p>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . On Sunday, after delaying till the latest possible moment
               for the chance of passengers, we dropped down the river Dee. The wind almost immediately
               failed us; I never saw so dead a calm; there was not a heaving, a ripple, a wrinkle
               on the water; the ship, though she made some way with the tide, was as still as a
               house, to our feelings. Had the wind continued as when we embarked, eighteen hours
               would have blown us to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Dublin">Dublin</a>. I saw the sun set behind Anglesea; and the mountains of Carnarvonshire rose so beautifully
               before us that, though at sea, it was delightful. The sun-rise on Monday was magnificent.
               Holyhead was then in sight, and in sight on the wrong side it continued all day, while
               we tacked and retacked with a hard-hearted wind. We got into Beaumaris Bay, and waited
               there for the midnight tide: it was very quiet; even my stomach had not provocation
               enough, as yet, to be sick. In the night we proceeded: about two o’clock a very heavy
               gale arose; it blew great guns, as you would say; the vessel shipped water very fast,
               it came pouring down into the cabin, and both pumps were at work, – the dismallest
               thump, thump, I ever heard: this lasted about three hours. As soon as we were clear
               of the Race of Holyhead the sea grew smoother, though the gale continued. On Tuesday
               the morning was hazy, we could not see land, though it was not far distant; and when
               at last we saw it, the wind had drifted us so far south that no possibility existed
               of our reaching <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Dublin">Dublin</a> that night. The captain, a good man and a good sailor, who never leaves his deck
               during the night, and drinks nothing but butter-milk, therefore readily agreed to
               land us at Balbriggen; and there we got ashore at two o’clock. Balbriggen is a fishing
               and bathing town, fifteen miles from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Dublin">Dublin</a>, – but miles and money differ in Ireland from the English standard, eleven miles
               Irish being as long as fourteen English. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .</p>

               <p>To my great satisfaction, we had in our company one of the most celebrated characters
                  existing at this day; a man whose name is as widely known as that of any human being,
                  except, perhaps, Bonaparte!

                  an Exeter newspaper from his pocket: of bank paper, – his pocket-book was stuffed
                  with notes, Scotch, Irish, and English; and I really am obliged to him for some clues
                  to discover forged paper. Talk, talk, everlasting; – he could draw for money on any

                  instead of carts or waggons; women without hats, shoes, or stockings. One little town

                  with a round tower adjoining the steeple, making an odd group; it was notoriously
