                  must now stay at Amsterdam, &amp; cannot leave Amsterdam, whether they like Amsterdam,
                  or do not like Amsterdam, for now there is war with Amsterdam, all the English who
                  are at Amsterdam are made prisoners at Amsterdam. And therefore respecting Amsterdam,
                  much as I have wished myself at Amsterdam, that I might see Amsterdam, &amp; buy books
                  at Amsterdam, for which I must one day go to Amsterdam, as you have heard me say when
                  we talked of Amsterdam, for in truth I had a longing to go to Amsterdam, yet now that
                  Amsterdam is such an inhospitable Amsterdam, I must say truly of Amsterdam, that I
                  am glad I am not at Amsterdam, damn Amsterdam.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">And also Rotterdam – if I had gone to Rotterdam, as I wished to go to Rotterdam, I
               often said of Rotterdam &amp; sung of Rotterdam, &amp; sighed for Rotterdam, I should now
               [be] at Rotterdam, have been tired of Rotterdam, a prisoner at Rotterdam, tho on my
               parole at Rotterdam, yet confined to Rotterdam, obliged to eat in Rotterdam, drink
               in Rotterdam, sleep in Rotterdam, walk in Rotterdam &amp; never go out of Rotterdam, verily
               if I were at Rotterdam I should say of Rotterdam rot Rotterdam.</p>

                  and &amp; I can prove out of my Homer, &amp; my Bible &amp; my old ballads &amp; Romances, that the
                  finest passage in poetry are always &amp; uniformly so plain &amp; perspicuous, that you catch
                  their full force &amp; meaning immediately. the worst nuts have the hardest shells. a

                  is his talent. he makes me see – but he never makes me feel, &amp; he is always trying

                  for I think 30,000 English could defend that country against any force which the French
                  could bring against it. the Portuguese peasantry want neither patriotism nor courage
                  – but you know what the officers are! We shall see a great uproar in the world. I
                  learn that in case of the conquest of Portugal by France, Spanish America &amp; Brazil
                  will be revolutionized by England. so strangely have things turned about!</p>

               if they would but settle these things by a rubber at whist – or a game at chess –
               or the toss of a halfpenny – the decision would be quite as fair, &amp; a great deal cheaper
