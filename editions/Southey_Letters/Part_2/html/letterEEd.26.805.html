                  each volume 800 pages in quarto. each page 40 lines. terms 150£ per volume to me as
                  Editor &amp; Manager in chief &amp; absolute director. four guineas per sheet for what is
                  written. five where the subject-author has written in Saxon Welch or <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx</span> Latin. the work will be published in half-volumes like the Cyclopædia,
