               they are documents that I am better able to value than to use – howbeit I shall thank

You expect some pages from me to bind up with them. how can <span class="ital">you</span> have been so mistaken in calculation? I have no skill in that kind of alchemy – in
               extracting essence of numerals – surely you know this &amp; know also that in whatever
               requires continuous &amp; patient thought I am deficient. that I follow like the greyhound

                  I look for many &amp; permanent benefits to this country – that is to the civilized world
                  – from you – if apoplexy or fever do not prevent them. this deserves to be the first.
                  in whatever way you can make me useful you may command me – but do not expect too
                  much. We want communities for men also – convents without vows or religious ceremonies
                  – colleges without the previous apprenticeship to fellowships – where for a moderate
                  rent men of leisure might enjoy a common table &amp; a good library. We want something
                  very different from both these institutions – public stews. if I did not think you <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxx</span> agreed with me I would say why I think they would materially lessen an evil <span style="text-decoration: line-through">for</span> which cannot be destroyed – there would be a huge hue &amp; cry against them from your
                  rascally vital Xtian members. but reason &amp; humanity &amp; the public good would prevail.
                  were I in the house of commons I should think the subject worth all my efforts.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">You will not be pleased to hear that <span class="ital">upon calculation</span> instead of domesticating at Richmond I find it right to remove to the mountains of
               Cumberland. yet you must allow the resolution is a prudent one. Under the same roof
               with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> I can have as many rooms as I want, well furnished – for twenty guineas a year. the
               place &amp; the rooms we know, &amp; all the circumstances. now in or near London my rent
               &amp; taxes would be double that sum – &amp; it would be necessary to furnish the house –
               an expence &lt;for&gt; which all my ways &amp; means would be difficultly sufficient – even
               with a resource of which I should be unwilling to avail myself – the hasty publication
               of some hasty poem. for access to books – I have enough raw materials to occupy a
               three years labour. if the climate hurt me – patience! it is but removing to Lisbon
               two years sooner than business would call me there – &amp; Liverpool is a port at an easy
               distance. the difference of house expences also is nearly as 40 to 100. the Lakes
               &amp; the Mountains you will not admit as inducements – but have I not determined upon

                  verses – only enough to satisfy me that the power is not past away. perhaps you will
                  like this symptom. the fact is that in compiling history much of the work is mere
                  idleness for one who loves reading – a book &amp; a pencil to mark your way. the mass
                  of volumes which it is necessary to examine is enormous – but that is all easy sauntering
                  pastime. then again so many parts of the process are going on that variety of employment
                  serves instead of rest. there are always three narratives on the stocks at once. one
                  reign in its first rude stage – another in its chrysalis state – a third fairly <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> copied upon fair paper. if I am tired of the Kings I go to the Saints – if the Xtians
                  are dull there are the Moors to amuse me. for serious moods there are chapters that
                  require thought &amp; reasoning – &amp; in the quaintness of my heart I conceive notes.</p>
